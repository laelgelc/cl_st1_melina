@@33582232 <p> Do governments really care about advice and state enterprise efficiency ? <p> By the Economist <p> At the launch of two books by the Sri Lanka Economists Association ( SLEA ) last Tuesday , Dr. Sarath Amunugama , Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs , said that Sri Lankan economists had failed to be a potent force in guiding and directing economic policy . His critique was in fact broader and included all academics and intellectuals . This may be so . <p> It may be that many academics have thought it fit to peddle the policy of one party or another in the hope that they would be favoured for positions such as Chairmen of State Corporations , state agencies or even as Vice-Chancellors of universities.This has robbed the country of objective , independent and informed criticism and comprehensive proposals . <p> Against all odds , the Bank of Ceylon ( BOC ) , has attempted to maintain its efficiency in a very competitive financial market . <p> The Minister , once a finance minister of the country , did also say that many academics are peddling and supporting eccentric causes rather than the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue . The majority of academics are , as he pointed out , at best a silent community <p> These observations are no doubt most refreshing when they come from a minister of state . Nevertheless , there is another side to the story . Do Ministers and governments listen to the advice given by academics and reasonable men and women ? Time and again when good advice is offered , Ministers , Prime Ministers and Presidents say it 's very good advice and do nothing about it . The most common reason for this inaction is that there are political reasons requiring governments to pander to these rather than do what they themselves feel is good . <p> Recently when a glaring inappropriateness of an important appointee to a state enterprise was brought to the powers that be , the response was that nothing could be done because the appointee was a nominee of a political leader that mattered to the government . How can the efficiency of state enterprises be ensured in such a political context ? <p> The Minister of Public Administration himself quoted several obstacles he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Ceylon Electricity Board , the Petroleum Corporation and the Railways , among others . Their inefficiencies and their monopolistic powers resulted not only in the state subsidising their operations but also preventing the government from taking reform measures and policy directions that would improve and enhance the country 's economic efficiency and output . Progressive decision-making has been hampered by their trade union actions . The fact is that governments have often been responsible for creating inefficiencies in state bodies either willfully or by turning a blind eye to outrageous acts of governance by their political appointees . <p> A drama on this scenario is currently being enacted and illustrates the point made . We refer to the sudden change in recruitment policy , which among other actions may seriously undermine the efficiency of the country 's premier bank . Against all odds , the Bank of Ceylon ( BOC ) , has attempted to maintain its efficiency in a very competitive financial market . Needless to say the requirement to conform to state policies of employment , political interference and other aspects have not made the task one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the adoption of a recruitment policy , based on the prejudices of a single person that would undermine the efficiency of the bank . The Bank has through its post independent history maintained a knowledge of English as a perquisite for recruitment . The new policy for recruitment appears to have deleted this provision of a compulsory requirement of English , which is no longer a compulsory requirement for recruitment to the bank 's positions of staff trainee assistants . <p> This is indeed a strange course of action at a time when there is widespread recognition of the importance of English . Can the BOC maintain its efficiency in the financial market without its staff unequipped to handle business in English . Let us also remind policy makers that banking operations that are now computerised require a degree of functional proficiency in English . Dropping the requirement of English at this time is tantamount to sabotaging the Bank . <p> The other act of imprudence is the dropping of the qualification of Cost and Management Accounting ( CIMA ) from its list of acceptable qualifications . The reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it 's personal prejudice amounting to peddling a private ambition of a single person . <p> State owned Sri Lankan institutions have been seriously weakened over the years through irresponsible political interferences that appear to go hand in hand with public ownership . This then provides the rationale for privatisation of state enterprises . The relationship between the current erosion of capacity by its new recruitment policy and the role of the intellectual in our society is this . If governments are unable to act in simple cases of irresponsible acts by its political appointees to high office , then is there much point in intellectuals proffering their advice on more complex issues ? <p> Let us illustrate this with a more important issue . When the power crisis occurred researchers were blamed for not apprising the powers that be of the impending crisis . Researchers pointed out that not only had they done a number of studies on the issue , but that they had even presented these to the government . <p> They had hung around unread . Intellectuals , particularly economists , certainly require undertaking policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing awareness on economic issues and having advocacy efforts . <p> Yet the old adage that you can take a horse to water but can not make it drink applies rather cogently because political expediency , not rational economic decision-making , is the bane of our polity . Admittedly intellectuals should exert greater influence on such policy issues . However the pertinent issue is would they be heeded ? 
@@33582233 <p> Just a few days before this newspaper hit the streets last week , the saga of Dr Ziyard Mohamed , the harried director of the Tea Research Institute ( TRI ) , came to an end when President Mahinda Rajapaksa directed his reinstatement and instead ordered the sacking of the TRI board chairman . <p> The latter was the one who had instigated the flimsy charges of misappropriation of public funds , leading to the TRI official 's shocking arrest which a court overturned later and cleared him of all charges . <p> Dr Ziyard was treated like an ordinary criminal just after returning from Tokyo where he helped persuade Japan to lift a ban on Ceylon Tea imports . Last week 's editorial comment raised many issues about the accountability of the secretary and the minister in this whole episode but it took the President to step into the matter for justice to prevail . <p> This week we return to this saga not for anything else but to raise more pertinent questions as to whether the private sector , in this case the tea industry , failed the nation by not standing up for Dr Ziyard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spheres of the tea sector alerted the media to his arrest and urged newspapers to fight for his innocence , not a finger was lifted publicly in his defence . What we reliably understand is that Dr Ziyard had to fight his own case and get his job back . <p> Except for one association , much smaller than the big guns -- exporters , traders or brokers -- the others did n't publicly protest nor persuade the authorities to stop harassing the TRI director . At least publicly nothing was done or seen to be done . <p> The industry , even through that fast-becoming-defunct body , The Tea Association of Sri Lanka should have issued a strong statement condemning the treatment meted out to Dr Ziyard . If associations were reluctant to do it as an individual group , they could have done it as a joint group . Or was it just lethargy on their part -- as the private sector is prone to behave whenever there is a crisis or action called for ? <p> Should n't the industry have created a bigger rumpus over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ media and asking newspapers to fight the TRI official 's battle , which the media in fact did ? <p> Another top public sector official , highly respected and a hard worker , is also under pressure to work against regulations and moral obligations . He has so far tactfully managed his work without offending his masters but at the same time keeping his integrity intact . But how long would he last ? Will he meet with the same fate as Dr Ziyard and be called upon to fight his own battle ? <p> As our WOO columnist has repeatedly said on many occasions : wake up Mr Private Sector and make sure at least this time you have the guts to fight for what is right and make sure another honest official -- a rare breed nowadays -- does n't bite the dust because he did his job and what he felt was right . <p> The private sector has always been found wanting when it comes to social responsibility . When it should have stepped in during the height of Sri Lanka 's conflict , it chose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes ; it 's the government 's job to maintain law and order . We will not get involved . <p> This , at a time when civil society -- who also pay taxes -- was actively involved in trying to persuade the protagonists in the conflict to stop the war and start negotiations . Accused of being selfish , the response of business leaders was : " We have to satisfy our shareholders . We have to make money for them . We ca n't do social service . " <p> That changed in 2001when garment exports to the US were taking a beating . This was followed by the Katunayake airport attack and on top of that the bloody attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York . The local private sector was shattered ; its bottomline was gradually eroding and that led to the formation of Sri Lanka First , the business peace initiative that stills exists today though more low-key than before . <p> When the media was called for an informal press conference to announce the formation of this body , the first question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys when thousands of people were dying on the streets or getting displaced ? " Yet rather than flogging a dead horse , this paper commended that effort saying it was " better late than never for the private sector to get involved in the path towards peace . " <p> Another pathetic and appalling showing by the tea industry has been the way it has responded to the government downgrading the important Plantations Ministry portfolio to that of a non-cabinet ranked ministry . And this in a sector that in real terms , is the higher export earner for the country , for decades mind you . Now did the industry do something about it ? No they did nothing . <p> A few weeks back , a group of private sector industry officials grumbled about this to a reporter whose immediate question was : " So did n't you protest to the government for downgrading this ministry ? " The response ( your guess is as good as mine ) : Embarrassed smiles and scrambling for excuses . <p> Last week a newspaper reported that one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least : better late than never . <p> Finally , we repeat what we said before . The private sector is lethargic and selfish . The fate of the Tea Association of Sri Lanka is a good example of putting self before country . Yet , again we repeat : it 's never too late ; Make sure the other tea official referred to in this comment does n't meet the same fate as Dr Ziyard. 
@@33582234 <p> A senior citizen has suggested to the government that all subsidies that keep oil at an artificially lower price must be removed . <p> Nirmalan Dhas , Head of Mission of the Synthetist Mission , sent a letter to the Director General , Department of Fiscal Policy , Ministry of Finance and Planning -- with a copy to the President -- in response to a request for proposals to face Sri Lanka 's external challenge successfully . <p> The letter said : The problem of rising world oil prices is not a new and sudden phenomenon but one that has been evident for several decades and in response to which adequate plans and mechanisms of management should long since have been formulated and set in motion . This rise in prices is most certainly not an external challenge and that it is this fanciful notion of rising oil prices being an external challenge and not one to which we have actively contributed ourselves as individuals and as a nation , that has prevented us from realistically assessing the situation and preparing for the context that has now emerged . <p> Let me state once more quite categorically that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external challenges of any sort . <p> They are the direct result of the demand for oil having outstripped global production capacity and each one of us contributes directly both as individuals and as well as citizens of a nation state to this demand for oil . <p> Even though there are enough oil reserves to last a good few more years , there is still the need to look for alternatives . <p> Global oil reserves are in any case limited . They will sooner or later become exhausted . Prudence would demand their conservation and careful utilization towards the achievement of selected objectives . Instead our current civilization seems to be based on the single totally irrational objective of consuming our environment as fast a rate as possible so that the faster the rate at which we consume our environment the more developed we are deemed to be . <p> It is important that this simple reality , be understood by those who wish to formulate responses thereto lest we seek to protect ourselves from external threats that simply do not exist . We -- not ' they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this crisis and we have to now respond to the crisis we have caused . <p> Having identified the crisis clearly the response becomes obvious : * Adopt a more rational civilizational objective * Use less oil * Develop technologies that are less dependent on oil . <p> These three aspects are developed more fully below . * Adopt a more rational civilizational objective <p> To proceed along the currently dominant civilizational objective of consuming our environment at as fast a pace as is possible is meaningless and self destructive and will only serve to exacerbate the current global shortage of oil . People have to be proided with a more meaningful objective that will motivate them to conserve all available resources towards its achievement . <p> If not they will continue to consume their environment through the obsessive generation of desires and the compulsive search for their satisfaction that now constitutes the dominant behavior of the human species . <p> All subsidies that keep oil at an artificially lower price must be removed and a special tax added to oil products in order to finance the following changes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from these subsidies must be utilized to ensure that every house or dwelling place within the country is fitted with an electronic communication device supplied and maintained by the state -- in order to enable real time communication between the government and the citizenry in the seriously unstable situation that has begun to emerge due to -- a ) a shortage of resources , b ) global warming , c ) rising ocean levels , d ) pollution , not just in our country but all over the world and which will increase in the intensity of its impact over the coming years . Neighbouring Tamil Nadu seems to have opted for television , but we would do much better by using computers . <p> In the second instance the income from these subsidies must be used to project via all available media including the new media linkages described above , a new civilizational objective based on a wholistic understanding of ourselves as being the chaotic and relative behavior of an indivisible and universal whole that has neither beginning nor end and which proceeds along paths of its own perception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and towards its universal spread . <p> This universal objective of life 's evolution beyond human being and its universal spread must be accepted as that of our civilization as well and all available resources conserved and utilized strategically and sparingly towards this end alone . The adoption of this civilizational objective will permit the emergence of a new way of seeing the world , a new way of life , a new life for each of us and a new world for us all . <p> In the third instance movement must be discouraged as far as possible with instant communication being enabled by the government sponsored and maintained communication linkages installed in every home , and restricted to mass transit systems that run on energy generated by state owned but privately managed centralized energy generation systems so that pollution can be localized , contained and better managed . Where the physical presence of people is deemed essential for purposes of production such people must be housed within walking or cycling distance of such production units . <p> In the fourth instance , human powered vehicles must be encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to offer the speed , comfort and safety of the mass transit systems , private motor vehicles will not have to be banned as their use will be restricted to the few amongst the wealthy who really do not care for the human race and who therefore do not share in the new civilizational objectives and who are content therefore to continue consuming their environment at as fast a pace as possible . Their activities will be carefully monitored and regulated to ensure that they do not cause harm to others but will be freely permitted . <p> Use less oil This must be ensured by firstly ensuring that electricity becomes the primary mode of energy utilized by the citizenry for their day to day living and where necessary travelling . The generation of the required electrical energy must be centralized and generated by state owned but privately managed generation systems , and its pollution contained and managed . The use of this energy must then be made more efficient . <p> There are several ways by which this can be done but they lie beyond the scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Develop technologies that are less dependent on oil . The following are the basic requirements we have identified as being the bare essentials for the continuous support and sustenance of the level of human functional capacity that we have acquired . <p> As a first step , the energy required for all these supportive systems will be restricted as far as possible to the use of electricity which will be generated through centralized systems of energy generation which are owned by the state but privately managed . <p> Once this centralization of energy generation is accomplished the question of developing alternate sources of energy generation that are not dependent on fossil fuels can be addressed . Hydropower , Solar Power , Wind Power , Thermal Power , Nuclear Power , Biomass generated Power and any other sources as we may be able to discover will have to be rapidly developed . Finally the support systems themselves will have to be restructured in a way that ensures that they utilise a minimum of energy . <p> There are many ways in which the energy they utilize may be reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this paper but can be made available on request . <p> These changes are those that all those of us who claim to follow the ancient path to enlightenment followed by the Buddhas of old , should have thought of and begun implementing over twenty years ago . Instead we have not only fallen prey to the rampantly obsessive desires and compulsive search for their satisfaction that form the basis of the currently dominant civilization but have lost ourselves in classist and racist visions and their resulting conflicts as well . <p> Perhaps now at last in the face of this great crisis and the imminent disaster it threatens us with we will ready ourselves to abandon the dominant civilization with its irrational goals and consequent commitment to self destruction and adopt a synthetist perspective based on the emerging synthetist vision upon which the above submission is based and which seems to offer the only rational path to salvation from the disaster that lies directly ahead . <p> The collection of ideas as to how we can respond to the emerging situation is a commendable first step towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second step would be to engage those who advance such ideas within a process whereby such ideas may be further developed at a conceptual level and the strategic competencies required for their implementation be identified engaged and activated . It is my hope that the government will chose to act in this direction rather than stand by in apparent helplessness as the crisis worsens.

Available at Samayawardana , Sarasavi and Sammana Bookshops <p> This book of English poetry by P. Ariyasena de Silva , Emeritus Professor of the University of Moratuwa , was launched recently under the auspices of Tin Oo Lwin , the Ambassador of Myanmar and Madame Lwin , at the Institution of Engineers ' Wimalasurendra auditorium . The President of the Institution of Engineers , Jayantha Ranatuga delivering the welcome address congratulated Prof. P. A. as he is known to all , for producing a poetry book in English that covers our religion , history , and also our technology of the past ; the technology of the ancient Helas , the technology that was used to put up huge stupas and tanks , built by our ancient kings 2000 years ago . He elaborated on the poems that give pride of place to Prince Gemunu for learning the art of metal working , while he was hiding in the Kotmale hills . <p> A few lines from a poem should be interesting to children who want to learn our history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , Watched the smith as the sound did echo ; Pulled the bellows to make a good flame , From a smithy to a King I will rise all the same . " <p> The book refers to the discovery of silver in Ridigama during King Gemunu 's reign , when the King was thinking of building the Ruwanweli Maha Seya , Prof. P. A. has given the name silver town to Ridigama . An industrial complex of mining , melting of silver and minting of coins is set up . These verses are a joy to read for the young and old alike . We know that Gemunu could not complete the Maha Seya and how Tissa did a mock-up with cloth to show his very sick brother , the King . Two poems that rhyme with the well-known nursery rhyme " Twinkle twinkle little star ... " are ideal for tiny tots . <p> " Tissa had a simple plan , My brother shall see the Stupa as planned , White cloth he got from every weaver , Spun it round with hands so clever . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Waskaduwe Sakyamuni Viharaya , and Vice Principal , Moratuwa Maha Vidyalaya spoke at length in Sinhala and also in English . He congratulated the author and encouraged him to keep writing such books , so that foreigners would get the true picture about the country . In a poem that refers to the designing of the Ruwanweli Maha Seya , the author has rightly given the credit of the design to the Maha Sangha . The monks made sure that the King in his enthusiasm did not try to make it too large . He quoted the poem : <p> " The Buddhist monks who excelled in arts , Advised the King on many a craft , The girth and the height and other details Were chosen to look like heavenly sails . " <p> Ambassador Tin Oo Lwin said he was very happy to read in poetry , the simple and fundamental rules of Buddhism that the Professor has very successfully displayed . It was interesting to hear the Ambassador reciting the Pali " Sabba Papassa Akaranam " and comparing it with the poem -- <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Practice to perform tasks sublime , Cleanse your mind and be so pure This was the message that all Buddhas ' bore . " <p> The front cover is a full colour picture of Thuparama taken by Professor P. A. 's grand-daughter , Sachintha . Several interesting poems about King Devanampiyatissa 's meeting with Arahat Mahinda , and the construction of Thuparama Stupa are also included . <p> This little book of 237 verses ( 34 pages ) is a must for every Sinhala child in Sri Lanka and abroad . Parents will find it illumining too in this 2550th year of the Buddhist era . <p> Back to Top <p> Back to Plus <p> A fresh look at Sinhala lyric writers <p> More and more new Sinhala writers are trying their hand at more research-oriented works rather than writing a novel or a short story . Samudra Wettasinghe is one of them . In addition to pursuing a career in journalism ( he freelances for the Lankadipa contributing to its weekly literary page ) Samudra writes books . He is right now concentrating on a series of critical appreciations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third in the series , examining the work of Lucien Bulathsinhala , ( a Godage publication ) was released recently . Lucien is better known as a dramatist , and his name is synonymous with the successful dramas Taarawo Igileti and Ratu Hettakari . The songs in the former were instant hits , and to this day there is a heavy demand for " Sobava de mepura siri visituru balanu mituru " -- a vivid description of a street in Singapore , and " Yaluvo maluvo " -- a good laugh at the commercialised world . Equally popular is the " Deekiri deekiri " song in Ratu Hettakari . <p> Samudra has done an in-depth study of Lucien 's compositions , and critically evaluates them . The songs are reproduced in toto , and Samudra analyses each . He is impressed with Lucien 's ability to write songs on a wide range of subjects , as well as a broad canvas from stage dramas , teledramas and films to operas . Each of Lucien 's creative efforts is a conscious attempt to move away from the formula songs . Samudra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marana thunak eti minisa balasiti " , as one of the most intricate compositions in the Sinhala film . He discusses with Lucien how the song was born , portraying the need for a close rapport between the lyric writer , music director and the film director . Another example is a song from Mee Haraka . Samudra assesses Lucien 's contribution as a librettist in the two Sinhala operas Dora Madala and Sondura Warnadasi ( both created by Premasiri Khemadasa ) -- a rare opportunity for a lyricist in Sri Lanka . <p> The other lyric writers , whose work has been discussed by Samudra are Sunil R. Gamage and Vasantha Kumara Kobawaka . Incidentally , Samudra himself has tried his hand as a lyric writer , and as an undergraduate at the University of Sri Jayawardenapura has won top awards . He has also done a critical appreciation of the works of Tolstoy and his contemporaries . Having read Mass Communications for his degree , he has edited several books related to Sinhala literature and music . <p> Young writers like Samudra deserve every encouragement to do more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The annual US$100,000 or $8333.33 per month lease for all 100 tanks on 850 acres is not worth by any standards given the unprecedented value of the asset in question . Similarly , what is mentioned in the annexure of the Indo Lanka accord is no more than a consideration of development of the tanks jointly with India which is nowhere near a semblance of a legal agreement . <p> Developing 100 tanks and clearing the 850 acres of land and renovating the pipe line and the oil jetty should be done and owned by the Sri Lanka government so that the tanks are only hired out on a daily rate " per CBM per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hire them for crude oil , heavy fuel oil , intermediate fuel oil , refined products such as diesel , petrol , kerosene , aviation fuel etc using dedicated tanks and separate pipelines to the jetty . <p> SL should manage <p> It will cost an affordable amount to the Sri Lanka government needing no loan involvements to clear our own backyard of 850 acres .

These rulings constitute a clear and present warning to the Government which he heads . <p> The bitter comedy of cracking down on protests <p> That is not to say that suddenly voluble state ministers just waking up to the fact that the Government is straying from much vaunted paths of ' prosperity and splendour ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no criticisms , it would be good if the entire caboodle of Sri Lanka 's disreputable if not ruffianly Cabinet and State Ministers are sacked intoto . The ejection of Cabinet and state Ministers for Trade and Consumer Affairs who gobble lies at each turn before cameras as the citizenry go without cooking gas and basic essentials , must head that list . <p> Even so , I am on a different matter here . If the Head of State quotes decisions of the apex court of the land , his advisors can not indulge in cherry picking or in other words , select some decisions seen as favourable with the discarding of others . That is even more important when those less liked decisions concern protected speech . For , not even at the height of conflict in this country , North or South as the case may be , have Sri Lanka 's law enforcement officers acted with such enormous impunity in cracking down on protestors as they seem to be doing now . <p> Indeed , this suppression has become more a thing of bitterly raucous comedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the might of state power is translated into the everyday butt of mockery by all and sundry , that is not good ' marketing ' as the Government 's pundits ( or those who are left amidst the ruins of Viyathmaga ) might surely warn . Witness the recent questioning by the police of a social media activist on the ground that she had ' insulted ' the President by ' sharing ' posts relating to a ' hooting ' incident in a Colombo suburb by citizens queuing up for milk powder . <p> Right to criticise , even insult politicians <p> Taken by itself , this reported incident may have died a natural death if it had not been magnified further by the actions of the police . Apparently , the police spokesman had refuted his earlier reported injunction to the effect that the police will take legal action against those insulting or criticising the President . But the legal question remains as to how this questioning of activists sharing ' hooting ' stories or for that matter , ' hooting ' themselves , takes place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that this is for the ' purpose of investigations . ' <p> Investigations into what , we may well ask ? What was the crime committed ? From where did the police derive its legal authority to ' investigate ' ? These same questions arise in respect of the even more astounding reports in Sinhala media that the Ududumbara Police had proceeded to record statements from residents of Meemure regarding criticisms of the inaction of state officials over directives issued by the President following a visit to the area . These are violations of the very basic fundamental right to free speech secured in Article 14 ( 1 ) ( a ) of the Constitution . <p> And to be clear , this is not even to drag the abolition of criminal defamation ( 2002 ) into the picture . All that is quite irrelevant , constitutionally speaking that is . Even at the time that criminal defamation existed in our statute books , what constituted protected speech had been definitively laid out by the Supreme Court . One ruling in particular by the late Justice Fernando is pivotal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court had brought the right to make ' loud noises ' within constitutional protections in the ' Jana Ghosha ' case close to three decades ago . <p> It is not as if the police are unaware of these standards <p> In fact , this point was emphasised just last year in these newspaper columns ( ' On the honking of horns in protest and absurdities of a state gone berserk , ' the Sunday Times , May 2nd 2021 ) . This was in response to the equally idiotic arrest of a citizen ' honking ' his horn in protest at being held up when a cavalcade of a visiting dignitary swept by . The ' Jana Ghosha ' case ( Amaratunga v Sirimal and others , 1993 ) invoved the assault and tear gassing of then opposition parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa and his fellow activists who were protesting against the regime in power which was ruled to be unconstitutional . This is of course , one of those historically delicious ironies that can not be brushed aside . <p> But we are on the legal principles here which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to support or to criticise Governments and political parties , policies and programmes is fundamental to the democratic way of life . ' As such , this is a permissible exercise of the freedom of speech and expression under Article 14(1) ( a ) . Secondly , the warning issued by the judges is still eminently pertinent for the Government 's ears . ' Stifling the peaceful expression of legitimate dissent today can only result , inexorably , in the catastrophic explosion of violence some other day ' the Bench said . <p> These are not unfamiliar pronouncements but constitute the pith and substance of a long line of decisions handed down by the Supreme Court at a time when judges took their constitutional role seriously . Again , it is not as if our police do not know these standards , it is just that they choose to ignore them . And that very few call them to account . In fact , as we may recall , the protection of protest did not just stop at ' honking ' horns or ' hooting ' politicians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On more than one occasion , the Court had ruled that a call to ' topple ' the President or the Government and even exaggerated or plainly wrong criticism aimed against a regime in power was protected speech . In a well known precedent reflecting that caution ( Channa Peiris et al v the Attorney General et al , 1994 ) , it was observed that ' vehement , caustic and unpleasantly sharp attacks on the government , the President , Ministers , elected representatives or public officers are not per se unlawful ... ' The late ARB Amerasinghe J , writing for the Court , emphasized that these freedoms existed even under emergency law . <p> So is the state of democracy in Sri Lanka today in such a precarious state that the citizenry is now far worse off then when emergency regulations were in place in the context of ongoing conflict ? Should these familiar judicial cautions be repeatedly reminded , like a broken record as it were ? Cocooned by the false illusions of their own fairy tales , ruling politicians who instruct law enforcement to hound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forthwith . It is through these actions that a Government signs its own ( electoral ) death warrant .

@@33646236 <h> Sri Lanka : Patriotic Surgeon who treated me in Battle field <p> There is an unique difference in fighting out at sea . There are no covers . Whoever fire effectively first will win the sea battle . Sea battles are very short and decisive . <p> by Admiral Ravindra C Wijegunaratne <p> In 1991 , ( more than 30 years ago ) I was selected to one of the prestigious sea appointments in Sri Lanka Navy . After short familiarisation course , I was appointed to P 467 ( old pennant numbers ) , Fast Attack Craft ( FAC ) Super Dovra Mk ll , one of the fastest FAC of the Navy at that time . Built in Israel at cost of US $ 30 million , the vanguard of our Navy through out our conflict with LTTE Sea Tiger terrorists.Dovra ( or Dobra ) in Hebrew language means " lady Bee " . <p> P467 was commanded by LT Cdr Ariyadasa , an officer senior to me , who has captured highest number of smuggling boats in SLN in Western Naval Command . So , my sole intention was to work hard and capture more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days after taking over , my FAC was attached to Eastern Naval Command to patrol in Northern waters . Someone in Naval Headquarters do not want to see my face in Colombo ? <p> It was not smugglers , but LTTE terrorist Sea Tigers operating in Northern waters at that time . LTTE had some camps in Southern Indian Thamilnadu coast , which was their main logistics route to Northern peninsula . They had boats moving at excess of 30 knots ( 30 nautical miles per hour - approx 40mph ) and our FAC had slight speed advantage over terrorist speed boats . <p> The distance between India and Sri Lanka is approximately 24 nautical miles . Indo- Sri Lanka International Maritime Boundary Line ( IMBL ) marked at equidistance , approximately 12 nautical miles . So , terrorist boat moving at 30 knots can cross our waters in 24 minutes ! That 's the time given to us in the Navy to detect , chase and to destroy enemy boats . If you go too close to land , which was held my enemy at that time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ batteries . FAC will become a " sitting duck " if you have not moved away from land fast . Enemy always keep their tractors with the trailers in water ready for their boat arrivals . <p> As soon as their boat hit shore , they were loaded in to trailers and towed with help of a tractors to safe area , away from beach to unload the boats . <p> Similarly launching enemy . boats also done by bringing boats to shore from inland and launching done in few minutes . It was more difficult for us to detect these boat launching pads as they were done at night under the cover of darkness . However those days ( 1991 ) , when LTTE sea tigers saw an Israeli built Dovra , they used to run away at maximum speed . Most of our chases of sea tiger boats ends up in " Stern chase " and with slight speed advantage , we destroyed the enemy boat with 20mm Oerlicon cannon gun we had as main weapon . FAC had a crew of two officers and 12 sailors at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . My Second-In-Command was LT SHU Dushmantha , fearless and an excellent officer . He was an Outstanding Tennis player , old Anandian and from KDU Intake 4 . Sadly , he died in action out at sea on 30/10/1998 . He was a recipient of three gallantry medals for his bravery and valour out at sea namely , Weera Wickrama Vibushanaya ( WWV ) , Rana Wickrama Paddakkama ( RWP ) and Rana Soora Paddakkama ( RSP ) . I had Leading Seaman Newton as my coxswain ( later rose to Master Chief Petty Officer rank and excellent photographer ) and Leading Marine Engineering Mechanic Premaratne ( also rose to MCPO rank later and excellent cook ) looked after the engines . Our FAC in her first patrol to Northern Naval Area was able to destroy a enemy boat , which was a great achievement to me personally and to my crew . <p> CDR SHU Dushmantha <p> KIA / MIA 30.10.1998 <p> P498 at Sea off Mullaitivu <p> FAC was a time tested craft in SLN . Time to time , we upgraded our weapons and sensors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had only radar to detect enemy boats at night . Later we went in to MSIS ( Multi Sensor Integrated Systems ) and better forward main gun , such as US made 30mm Bush master chain gun , but the platform , the FAC hull remained same . <p> When we fought with sea tigers , there were no suicide boats . The enemy used ran away at their maximum speed when they saw a FAC , Then enemy developed their suicide carders and speed boats later loaded with explosives and they started to steer towards us at fast speed on suicidal missions . <p> We had to rewrite and develop our fighting tactics and manoeuvres against this new threat . We lost some of our best FAC Commanders and crews due to these deadly attacks . My salute to and to all who worked tirelessly during this time , special thanks to our gunners , electrical/ electronic engineers and marine engineers for keeping FAC operational and battle-prepared . <p> There is an unique difference in fighting out at sea . There are no covers . Whoever fire effectively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very short and decisive . <p> There is special bond between your shipmates ( FAC mates ) , whether you are an officer or sailor . You go to battle together in FAC and come home victorious or perish at sea together . OIC take decisions and he has to be brave and knowledgeable . <p> My FAC command period was eventful and enjoyable . I was married and my wife Yamuna was expecting our first ( and only ) child . We lived in married quarters at Naval Base Trincomalee . Those Royal Navy time officers quarters are specious and beautiful . <p> Our patrols to Northern waters were for seven days . If everything goes well , you get seven days break for maintenance , repairs and . to get ready for next patrol . Before my patrol to North , I will leave my wife with my brother officer 's family living in Naval Base Trincomalee , where she will stay until my arrival . She preferred to be with LCdr ( L ) Sarath Silva 's house . Sarath is from my junior batch and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own words " not allowing even me to prepare a cup of tea - all done by her " ) . They were very close friends also . That was the camaraderie among Naval families ! <p> P467 <p> When your FAC is non operational , you have to take some others Operational FAC on patrol . This is not an good arrangement as you are going out to sea with unknown crew . However in September 1991 , I had to take P468 ( my batchmate Shirantha 's FAC ) as my one was under repairs on slipway . Further , my 2IC , Dushmamtha was also on leave . I decided to go to sea on board P468 without a 2IC , on six-day patrol to Northern waters . <p> FAC have very powerful two inboard engines . They required large amount of low sulphur diesel ( LSD . One engine consume approximately 100 litres of LSD per hour . Two engines running , its 200 litres per hour . It takes four hours for us to go from Trincomalee to KKS. 800 litres consumed per one run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litre of LSD , FAC consumes approximately Rs 80,000/- worth LSD per one run . Then we do seven days patrolling and returning back to Trincomalee . Navy has 36 FACs . So you can imagine the fuel cost of running them . <p> That why Ship and craft called ' SHE ' . We always refer ship as a lady . Why ? Like a lady , it 's not the initial cost of purchase ( to marrying her ) , but the maintenance that kills you ! <p> Navies are very expensive ! <p> So , two days of my patrol onboard P468 was uneventful . On 13th June 1991 , around 10AM , were returning to KKS for rest and refuelling from Mulativu sea area . Sea was calm and I was keeping about two nautical miles from land and moving North at approximately 20 knots speed . I was on the flying bridge and enjoying bright sunlight and very clear weather . My lookout sentry on Port side ( land side ) reported two open jeeps moving on Manakkadiu road , one fitted with a gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action stations and told the crew that I will turn towards jeeps and increase speed . When I am turning again away from land to engage the targets with our 20mm cannon . The depth in this area is sufficient FAC to go up to 400m from land . Forward gunner was very good his third shot hit a jeep and it started burning . Other jeep took cover of a sand dune . We saw some movements on beach with enemy cadres getting into boats on land . When we were breaking away from targets and headed towards deep sea , our boat was hit by enemy fire from boats . Crack and thump of 50 caliber machine gun fire was very clearly heard . <p> Do you know how to identify some one is firing at you ? You hear two noises ( in military terminology know as Crack and Thump ) every shot fire at you- two noises for one shot . As bullet velocity is faster than sound speed , you first hear sound " tuck ' ( or crack ) when bullet goes through air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( or thump ) after some time . That is the sound made when bullet left gun barrel . Well trained Special Forces person will able to say approximate distance of firer by time between crack and thump . <p> Enemy gun fire rained the FAC , but we were almost over at enemy 's effective gun range . Suddenly one enemy gun shot hit the guard rail of the FAC . It 's splinters hit my left shoulder and upper arm . A sailor who was standing next to me at Open bridge also hit on his leg . Blood soaked my left arm and multiple injuries were visible . I knew I was hit badly . Sailors onboard were panicked . I steered the FAC to safe distance from land and informed my colleague Rohan who was on another FAC on patrol of the incident happened and steered towards KKS . <p> After bleeding was controlled by sailor trained on Combat medicine , I found no major damage to bones . I felt bit dizzy , but able walk into waiting ambulance at KKS harbour to transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On arrival Palal Army Hospital , I saw a tall figure in Surgical gown waiting for me .

They are still in side my left shoulders and upper arm . <p> I consider them as gifts from LTTE which deny me go through any Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) scan due to metal particles in upper body . <p> Dr Maiya <p> I invited Dr Maiya on board my FAC that evening and took him to sea and showed him Point Pedro and VVT ( home town of LTTE leader Prabhakaran ) from sea . <p> Dr Maiya was a patriot and his volunteer services as a Surgeon at battle front saved number of officers and men who got severely injured . <p> Dr Indrajith Maithri ( ' Maiya ' ) De Zoysa Gunasekara , FRCS , FICS , Consultant Surgeon was born on 22nd August 1951 and educated at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colours man on Basketball and Rugby Football and represent College in Athletics also .

The Sri Lanka rupee depreciated by 7.0 per cent against the US dollar in 2021 and has been broadly stable thus far in 2022 . At the same time , the Central Bank was able to fulfil the timely settlement of the International Sovereign Bond ( ISB ) of US dollars 500 million on 18 January 2022 .

@@33696230 <h> PROJECT TO INSTALL FLOATING SOLAR PANELS IN MAHAWELI RESERVOIRS <p> In the above captioned news item , appearing in your issue of 29th Jan. ' 21 , it is reported , the Minister for Irrigation , State Defence , and Home Affairs Chamal Rajapaksa has declared a gigantic project to install floating solar panels in the Mahaweli including reservoirs Victoria and Randenigala to generate power would be implemented soon . In view of global concern on climate change and our precarious situation of energy shortage , due to cancellation of Coal Power generation , and the pompous or imaginary idea of supplying electricity to India and far away Singapore , this proposal is acceptable . But have the authorities who advise the government or politicians themselves taking decisions on their own , without any knowledge of the subject considered the negative aspects of floating solar panels in reservoirs , in a small island as ours with a population of 21 million . Here I would wish to quote an authority on the subject , George L Clarke , Biological Laboratories , Howard University -- " Light is a limiting factor for aquatic plants and animals . Every school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green plants and that all animals , including ourselves , depend directly or indirectly upon the plants for their food supply . It is not so obvious however , that exactly that the same situation is encountered in the aquatic habitat . The ultimate source of energy for all multifarious life in the sea and in every body of fresh water is sunlight . Furthermore , most fish and many types of animals need enough illumination to see , at least part of the time -- to catch their food , to avoid being caught themselves . But light does not penetrate into the water indefinitely , it is absorbed by the water itself and further reduced by sediment and stains . The aquatic biologist is thus concerned to know how much light exists in various depths in rivers , ponds , lakes and in the ocean itself , and what are the maximum depths at which the fish can see and at which the all-important green plants make a living " <p> Apart from aquatic life , there are other aspects to be given serious thought , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ villager and a nourishment for healthy living , water sports to attract tourists and also landing of amphibian planes . The advantages cited by those advocating Solar energy are those concerned only on energy and saving of 20% of water through the prevention of evaporation , which will help farmers and hydropower generation . The negative factor which should be given due consideration is that vaporized water not rising from reservoirs , lakes , ponds and rivers , will the rainfall in catchment areas fail and will the weather pattern be subject to change ? . If so , what was gained in saving 20% of water in reservoirs will be lost if the rains fail in these areas , or reduced . <p> Speaking on Solar Energy in general is that when calculating the land area needed for a solar power panel installation on land , it is said that one megawatt plant requires approximately four acres when using crystalized technology . When using thin-film technology , one megawatt plant will require four to five acres of land . In other terms , each kilowatt of solar panel requires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this small island of ours with a land area of 65.610 km2 and the ever-increasing population , which now stands at 21 million , can we allocate such extent of land . In addition , the indigenous plant and animal will extinct as plants do not grow under solar structures , By all means encourage roof-top solar panels and offer incentives . One other factor is that Solar power generation is subjected to weather patterns due to cloudy and rainy days as rightly pointed out by the former General Manager , Shavi Fernando at a recent TV discussion . <p> It is certainly not my intention to discourage Solar Energy , but to accommodate solar panels in such a manner that the country does not suffer in other areas , such as effecting the natural habitat and displacing families . I should also state the information contained in this presentation is from news items , magazines and books written by those in the know . <p> With due respects and sincere apologies to Minister for Irrigation , State Defence , Disaster Management and Home Affairs Chamal Rajapaksa , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by the Minister for Energy Udaya Gammanpila or Minister for Power , Gamini Lokuge , under whom comes the State Ministry for Solar and Renewable Sources of Energy .

@@33696237 <h> Sri Lanka use of reserves for imports is a deadly false choice : Bellwether <p> Monday January 31 , 2022 8:02 am <p> Monday January 31 , 2022 8:02 am <p> ECONOMYNEXT -- Sri Lanka should not use foreign reserves for imports , because under a 6.5 percent policy rate an equal amount of money will be printed , which will prevent a contraction in credit and reserve money , encourage imports , perpetuate forex shortages and bring the country closer to default . <p> There has been flurry of calls to use reserves for imports rather than repaying debt . <p> No person who advocates Sri Lanka going to the International Monetary Fund can also advocate using reserves for imports with a straight face . <p> The first step the IMF takes is to hike rates ( if they are too low ) and force a float of the currency to stop ' reserves for imports ' and implied sterilization of such reserve sales with printed money . <p> Such a float -- at an appropriate interest rate that is sufficient to finance the residual deficit after a tax hike -- will stop the currency crisis in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make any disbursements unless ' reserves for imports ' are stopped . <p> The agency gives money to boost reserves , improve confidence and give a breathing space , not to bust them up on import consumption . <p> If reserves are given for imports , how will any debt , re-structured or otherwise be repaid ? As long as reserves for imports are given , Sri Lanka will then default on the re-structured debt . <p> Any imports have to be financed by inflows only . No only that , there has to be a little left over to re-build reserves . At the correct interest rate , that can be done . <p> So giving reserves for imports vs debt is a false choice and a deadly one , made apparently from the lack of knowledge of pegged exchange rates and currency crises . <p> That reserves can be used for imports as domestic credit picks up is a myth . It is a naked Mercantilist myth . Countries that do so , including those with budget surpluses have come to grief . <p> For 70 years Sri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are needed for debt because payments are lumpy . While it is beyond this column to explain the exact mechanism suffice to say , it can be done without altering reserves of multiple banks almost similar to an IMF transaction with the central bank . <p> However Sri Lanka now does not have a working currency regime . Sri Lanka neither has a credible pegged regime nor a floating exchange rate . <p> To balance imports with inflows , to repay debt , one or the other is needed . The surrender rules prevent any peg from operating , because they create new money . <p> Sri Lanka now does not have reserves . The central bank foreign liabilities exceed assets by a big margin . <p> To say reserves must be used for imports is a statement that has no basis with reality . <p> Sterilized Currency Defence <p> When a pegged exchange rate central bank sells dollars to an importer , it is not the same as an exporter selling a dollar or even the Treasury selling a dollar . <p> A central bank dollar sale reduces liquidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A 100 million dollar sale of reserves for fuel by the central bank leads to a 20 billion rupee liquidity shortage in the interbank market at the current rate . <p> This reduction in rupee reserves in the banking system ( as long is it is unsterilized ) also kills off credit that the 20 billion would have generated keeping the external sector and the exchange rate in balance . An unsterilized currency defence immediately deducts the outflow of real wealth from the banking system as a fall of rupee reserves of banks . <p> However if this rupee shortfall is pumped backed into banks to maintain the policy rate , re-expanding reserve money , banks can do not have to collect new deposits to replenish rupee reserves . It prevents the correction in the credit system that is required to stop the currency crisis . <p> It is not relevant whether money is printed to finance the deficit or sterilize reserves given for imports in an economic recovery . The effect is the same . <p> The injections will will completely mess up the prices in the economy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no overt excess liquidity seen in the banking system , like now . <p> In a clean , ' fixed ' exchange or credible peg rate there is no sterilization . An outflow of dollars leads to an equivalent fall in the local money , just as if the money supply was dollars . <p> In consistent peg , net foreign assets ( NFA ) will move parallel to the growth in reserve money . <p> In a float net credit to government ( NCG ) will go in parallel to reserve money . <p> In a ( soft ) pegged country , the intervention is sterilized with new money.In a soft-peg prone to crises , the two will go in opposite directions creating crises when NCG goes up ( sterilizing reserve sales ) , and re-building reserves when it goes down ( sterilizing purchases of dollars ) . <p> Gold standard central banks , free banks , and currency board operated on this principle . The Sterling Area operated on this principle for almost a century ( with no IMF ) . <p> In the currency and economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came from the artificial manipulation of the interest rate advocated by academic economists who had no banking experience or knowledge unlike classical economists . <p> The problem was well known to parliaments and bankers of Europe in earlier centuries . <p> The primary blame for the present day lack of knowledge probably goes Mercantilist theoreticians from Princeton , Cambridge and Oxford , though there are others . <p> Unlike in the 19th century when the UK parliament debated the question of resumption of gold payment ( Select Committee on High Price of Gold Bullion ) with logic and reason and a deep knowledge banking by the 20th century all knowledge of balance of payments problems seems to have disappeared . <p> Mercantilist ideas about the balance of payments ( economic snake-oil if you will ) which were discarded after a rigorous analysis in earlier ages became the subject of university education after the Great Depression . <p> In countries with high inflation and balance of payments trouble , classical economic ideas faded as the societies descended into chaos , though there were beacons of enlighten from time to time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one such issued to the government at the time , but not was issued to the parliament . <p> After repeated failed bailouts of Latin America a rare report was issued under the hand of Jim Saxton who was Chairman Joint Economic Committee of the United States Congress at the time . <p> The many countries had currency troubles and defaults even without budget problems ( East Asia crisis is the most prominent , though it also happens in Latin America ) is something that is generally ignored . <p> The Saxton report , backed by economist such as Kurt Schuler tried to ' dumb down ' the problem of currency crises in simple terms . <p> Saxton to US Congress <p> " The defining feature of a pegged rate is " monetary sterilization , " also known as " sterilized intervention , " explains the report ' Why Currency Crises Happen , which sought to educate US congressmen in the 20th century about currency crises . <p> " Sterilized intervention occurs when the monetary authority ( typically a central bank ) offsets its dealings in the foreign-exchange market with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> When the peg is defended and dollars are sold from reserves , the central bank will also sell rupees against securities through open market operations to try and fix the money base , unlike in a true fixed exchange rate . <p> Here is how it was explained to US congressmen , which present day parliamentarians would be well advised to read : <p> " Under a fixed exchange rate , when the foreign reserves of the monetary authority increase as a result of people buying or selling foreign currency to it , the monetary base increases in a fixed proportion , and when foreign reserves decrease , the monetary base decreases in a fixed proportion . The monetary base is on autopilot . <p> " Under a " clean " floating exchange rate , the central bank does not try to influence the exchange rate at all . It can stay out of the foreign-exchange market , which is on autopilot . Under a fixed exchange rate , when the foreign reserves of the monetary authority increase as a result of people buying or selling foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixed proportion , and when foreign reserves decrease , the monetary base decreases in a fixed proportion . The monetary base is on autopilot . <p> " Under a ( soft ) pegged exchange rate , in contrast , neither the foreign-exchange market nor the monetary base is on autopilot . <p> " The sterilized intervention characteristic of a pegged exchange rate allows the central bank to control the real supply of money for a time and to hinder the real supply from adjusting to changes in the real demand . <p> " The delay reduces the accuracy of prices as signals for guiding economic activity . Consider the case where the central bank prevents the doubloon monetary base from falling when real demand for it falls . The central bank maintains in circulation 10 billion more doubloons than people want . <p> " The cycle continues as long as the central bank refuses to reduce the monetary base . The central bank eventually loses so many foreign reserves it either must finally reduce the monetary base or it must abandon the pegged exchange rate and go to a floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curreency board on top of an existing monetary law failed 10-year later because BCRA started to sterilize interventions . The underlying law -- which was not changed -- allowed sterilization of 30 percent of the monetary base . <p> David Ricardo to Parliament <p> Here is how David Ricardo wrote in High Price of Bullion shortly before a Select Committee on High Price of Gold Bullion issued a report which was to be the basis of the restoration of the gold standard of the Bank of England . <p> He explained that people exported gold after exchanging for Bank of England notes ( like sending dollars abroad after exchanging rupees ) for useful purposes and they should be allowed to do it . <p> " Some people might be alarmed at the specie leaving the country , and might consider that as a disadvantageous trade which required us to part with it ; indeed the law so considers it by its enactments against the exportation of specie ; but a very little reflection will convince us that it is our choice , and not our necessity , that sends it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to exchange that commodity which is superfluous , for others which may be made productive . " <p> As long as the bank issued notes only against gold which was exchangeable on demand there would be no problems . <p> " The Bank might continue to issue their notes , and the specie be exported with advantage to the country , while their notes were payable in specie on demand , because they could never issue more notes than the value of the coin which would have circulated had there been no bank . " <p> If they printed money ( issued paper in excess of reserves of specie ) there will be reserve outflow from the bank ( and the country ) contracting the paper . <p> " If they attempted to exceed this amount , the excess would be immediately returned to them for specie ; because our currency , being thereby diminished in value , could be advantageously exported , and could not be retained in our circulation . These are the means , as I have already explained , by which our currency endeavours to equalize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crisis occurs if the central bank continues to print money to replace the money it took back in selling reserves , let us say for imports as is happening now to fix the monetary base or circulating medium . <p> " ... But if the Bank assuming , that because a given quantity of circulating medium had been necessary last year , therefore the same quantity must be necessary this , or for any other reason , continued to re-issue the returned notes , the stimulus which a redundant currency first gave to the exportation of the coin would be again renewed with similar effects ; gold would be again demanded , the exchange would become unfavourable , and gold bullion would rise ... " <p> " In this manner if the Bank persisted in returning their notes into circulation , every guinea might be drawn out of their coffers .

It is a road to nowhere . <p> Rate rises help by boosting savings and reducing consumption .

Monetary authorities that in effect target the real supply of money by maintaining pegged exchange rates encourage speculative pressure to build until it forces a devaluation . " <p> " Currency crises can be viewed as the foreign-exchange market 's way of forcing adjustment of the real supply of money to the real demand when the monetary authority is trying to prevent it . <p> " " The absence of sterilized intervention does not mean that adjustment will always be smooth ; it might be painful . However , the likelihood is that it will be even more painful with sterilized intervention because price signals are likely to become less accurate .

In Sri Lanka at the moment , liquidity is created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? j ? vu <p> Sri Lanka is heading for more pain . <p> In 2018 when the central bank embarked on a similar escapade this column warned that Sri Lanka was not Greece where inflation was stable , bank deposits and pensions and salaries retained value and there was no shortages of goods . <p> At the time the Fed had already tightened policy and oil prices were falling and there was also good rain , which reduces losses and credit pressure from energy utilities . Now a drought is on . Fed tightening is ahead . <p> But budget are already in dis-array due to the 2019 tax cuts though some new taxes are coming in . <p> If the 229 billion rupee ' relief package ' is printed , and more money is printed , things will get worse . At the moment with the rise in Treasuries rates , most of the deficit is financed . <p> However large volumes of money are printed at 6.5 percent to sterilize interventions . It can not continue .

However they can be frittered away in imports . The credit lines can be effectively used to finance the budget , as long as goods are market priced .

This is where the IMF will come in useful .

Politicians with economic knowledge are worse than others . <p> " It is not possible to import goods freely when a soft-peg collapses because there will be forex shortages due to sterilized intervention . Import controls may also come , " this column warned at the time . <p> " As the cost of fuel or electricity goes up if prices are not raised , more money will be printed to subsidize energy , pushing the currency down . <p> " In Latin America , energy price controls have led to money printing and rationing . There can be power cuts and fuel shortages . <p> " In Sri Lanka because of price controls of the National Medicines Regulatory Authority medicines , drugs can go off the shelves . <p> " In Latin American soft-pegs many price controls were imposed . Instantly goods go off the shelves and black markets appear . <p> " With import controls more businesses will fail . People will be laid off as revenues fall . Banks will make more losses .

Referring to the Government Medical Officers ' Association ( GMOA ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universities attracted Sri Lankan students at a tremendous expense to the national economy . At any given time , there were more than 70,000 Sri Lankan students studying overseas . <p> Jayasuriya said so delivering the Daya Wettasinha memorial oration organised by the Sri Lanka-Japan Friendship Society backed by the Sri Lanka-Japan Business Council , at the Sasakawa Hall . <p> Jayasuriya faulted successive governments for having given in to pressure from the GMOA . <p> Several universities had been interested in setting up universities here . The PC said : " There was a famous British university that has been allocated 20 acres of land in the Mirigama Zone . They refused to start off . There was Manipal University and Deakin University that were extremely enthusiastic in starting their universities in Sri Lanka . They were all traumatised with the actions of this Trade Union that is a law unto itself in opposing SAITM . At the moment Sri Lanka has no hope of such educational institutes starting in Sri Lanka . This would have averted the dollar drain but we could have also earned much needed foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly from India . It is vital as India has no international universities granting foreign degrees . If Sri Lanka can offer these foreign degrees , Indian parents would be so happy to send their children to Sri Lanka , rather than to European destinations particularly Australia where some of them are getting brutally assaulted and undergo cultural disparities . " <p> Referring to the then Sri Lankan Finance Minister JRJ 's famous San Francisco speech in 1951 in support of Japan , Jayasuriya emphasised Sri Lanka had received1.35 Trillion yen loan , approximately Rs. 270 Billion as grant aid , 108 Billion Technical Cooperation in addition to about 130 Japanese investments here . Daya Wettasinha , lawyer , businessman and more than anything else was a great human being . Wettasinghe was one of the select group of Sri Lankans to receive The Order of the Rising Sun . It is the third highest order bestowed by the Japanese government . <p> Commenting on current crises , Jayasuriya said that though Sri Lanka brought the war to a successful conclusion in May 2009 , the country was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some people , with numerous personal bodyguards round the clock , fancy vehicles acquired with public funds whisking through crowded streets ... probably now they fly about in helicopters or now in private Jets .... and all other unimaginable means of luxurious living .

People are also self-indulgent and revel in false valour at the expense of the innocent peasantry , who perpetually struggle to make ends meet . Some get a sadistic delight displaying their prowess and money power . Those with Aston Martins , Lamborghinis , and Porsches have no qualms about displaying their wealth , and of course we have those who purchase iconic fashion merchandise such as , Louis Vuitton , Gucci and Giorgio Armani , while bare footed children walk their way to school in the hot sun . There are those who are without furniture , toilets or even water in the school . They can barely afford their meals . Where is our development , where are we heading ? " <p> " Where have we failed ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an excellent civil administration , highly commendable Judiciary , Police and Public service and a top tier education system . These we inherited from our colonial forefathers . Of course we could be proud of what we inherited . But where are we today ? Is it that the systems have failed or the people have failed ? I would say that the systems have deteriorated and failed the people . Our values have failed . Our expectations have failed , our attitudes have failed . In short , we have failed . I do n't blame anyone but ourselves . We are all to blame for it . ' Mea culpa ! ' ' Mea maxima culpa ' Where is the problem ? How do we resolve it ? " <p> Jayasuriya also discussed how foreign capital could be attracted by offering resident visas to those interested in spending US$ 500,000 to make Sri Lanka a second home . Similar schemes were already practiced in Malaysia with US$ 80,000 whereas earlier it was only US$30,000 .

The Sri Lankan independence leaders ( Ponnambalam Arunachalam , W.A. de Silva , D.B. Jayatilaka and D.S. Senanayake ) are not as well known internationally as their counterparts in India ( Gandhi , Nehru and Jinnah ) . And yet , by co-operating with and encouraging British moves towards transfer of power from the 1920s onwards , Sri Lanka gained independence harmoniously without any protest marches , strikes or violence . Sri Lanka had universal adult franchise from 1931 which India never did before independence . The Indian Congress Party 's policy of non-cooperation resulted in chaos , carnage and partition of the country . <p> Sri Lankans should be proud of the moderation , good sense and statesmanship shown by our independence leaders and recognise that these qualities are as relevant today as in the past . <p> Dr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest payments <p> My compliments to Nihal Kodituwakku for his timely and courageous views in the ' Letters to the Editor ' column of the Sunday Times on January 30 , on re-introducing WHT on interest , as a once and for all tax payment . <p> I agree with his comments and so will thousands of others especially senior citizens who are facing issues of declaring and paying tax . <p> However , instead of requiring those with a total income below the taxable threshold to go through the process of applying for a direction , I would propose that if the authorities decide to introduce WHT , to give the option to deposit holders to authorize banks or finance companies , to recover the tax directly from the interest payments . <p> The learned Doctor has suggested that the only avenue left to prevent this kind of tragedy is to remove the cause of this action .

@@33772238 <h> Is the Ukraine ' Crisis ' Just Another US Charade ? <p> President Biden has made it clear that the United States will not intervene with its own troops if Russia invades Ukraine . So why move them into Eastern Europe ? Just to show hawks in Congress that he is standing firm ? For what ? <p> by Jack F. Matlock , Jr . <p> Today we face an avoidable crisis that was predictable , actually predicted , willfully precipitated , but easily resolved by the application of common sense . <p> We are being told each day that war may be imminent in Ukraine . Russian troops , we are told , are massing at Ukraine 's borders and could attack at any time . American citizens are being advised to leave Ukraine and dependents of the American Embassy staff are being evacuated . Meanwhile , the Ukrainian president has advised against panic and made clear that he does not consider a Russian invasion imminent . Vladimir Putin , the Russian president , has denied that he has any intention of invading Ukraine . His demand is that the process of adding new members to NATO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine and Georgia will never be members . President Biden has refused to give such assurance but made clear his willingness to continue discussing questions of strategic stability in Europe . Meanwhile , the Ukrainian government has made clear it has no intention of implementing the agreement reached in 2015 for reuniting the Donbas provinces into Ukraine with a large degree of local autonomy -- an agreement with Russia , France and Germany which the United States endorsed . <p> Maybe I am wrong -- tragically wrong -- but I can not dismiss the suspicion that we are witnessing an elaborate charade , grossly magnified by prominent elements of the American media , to serve a domestic political end . Facing rising inflation , the ravages of Omicron , blame ( for the most part unfair ) for the withdrawal from Afghanistan , plus the failure to get the full support of his own party for the Build Back Better legislation , the Biden administration is staggering under sagging approval ratings just as it gears up for this year 's congressional elections . Since clear " victories " on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by posing as if he prevented the invasion of Ukraine by " standing up to Vladimir Putin " ? Actually , it seems most likely that President Putin 's goals are what he says they are -- and as he has been saying since his speech in Munich in 2007 . To simplify and paraphrase , I would sum them up as : " Treat us with at least a modicum of respect . We do not threaten you or your allies , why do you refuse us the security you insist for yourself ? " <p> In 1991 , when the Soviet Union collapsed , many observers , ignoring the rapidly unfolding events that marked the end of the 1980s and the beginning of the 1990s , considered that the end of the Cold War . They were wrong . The Cold War had ended at least two years earlier . It ended by negotiation and was in the interest of all the parties . President George H.W. Bush hoped that Gorbachev would manage to keep most of the twelve non-Baltic republics in a voluntary federation . On August @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukrainian parliament ( the Verkhovna Rada ) in which he endorsed Gorbachev 's plans for a voluntary federation and warned against " suicidal nationalism . " The latter phrase was inspired by Georgian leader Zviad Gamsakurdia 's attacks on minorities in Soviet Georgia . For reasons I will explain elsewhere , they apply to Ukraine today . Bottom line : Despite the prevalent belief , both among the " blob " in the United States , and most of the Russian public , the United States did not support , much less cause the break-up of the Soviet Union . We supported throughout the independence of Estonia , Latvia and Lithuania , and one of the last acts of the Soviet parliament was to legalize their claim to independence . And -- by the way -- despite frequently voiced fears -- Vladimir Putin has never threatened to re-absorb the Baltic countries or to claim any of their territories , though he has criticized some that denied ethnic Russians the full rights of citizenship , a principle that the European Union is pledged to enforce . <p> But , let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtitle ... <p> Was the crisis avoidable ? <p> Well , since President Putin 's major demand is an assurance that NATO will take no further members , and specifically not Ukraine or Georgia , obviously there would have been no basis for the present crisis if there had been no expansion of the alliance following the end of the Cold War , or if the expansion had occurred in harmony with building a security structure in Europe that included Russia . <p> Maybe we should look at this question more broadly . How do other countries respond to alien military alliances near their borders ? Since we are talking about American policy , maybe we should pay some attention to the way the United States has reacted to attempts of outsiders to establish alliances with countries nearby . Anybody remember the Monroe Doctrine , a declaration of a sphere of influence that comprised an entire hemisphere ? And we meant it ! When we learned that Kaiser 's Germany was attempting to enlist Mexico as an ally during the first world war , that was a powerful incentive for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , in my lifetime , we had the Cuban Missile Crisis -- something I remember vividly since I was at the American Embassy in Moscow and translated some of Khrushchev 's messages to Kennedy . <p> Should we look at events like the Cuban Missile Crisis from the standpoint of some of the principles of international law , or from the standpoint of the likely behavior of a country 's leaders if they feel threatened ? What did international law at that time say about the employment of nuclear missiles in Cuba ? Cuba was a sovereign state and had the right to seek support for its independence from anywhere it chose . It had been threatened by the United States , even an attempt to invade , using anti-Castro Cubans . It asked the Soviet Union for support . Knowing that the United States had deployed nuclear weapons in Turkey , a U.S. ally actually bordering on the Soviet Union , Nikita Khrushchev , the Soviet leader , decided to station nuclear missiles in Cuba . How could the U.S. legitimately object if the Soviet Union was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously , it was a mistake . A big mistake ! ( One is reminded of Talleyrand 's remark .. " Worse than a crime ... " ) International relations , like it or not , are not determined by debating , interpreting and applying the finer points of " international law " -- which in any case is not the same as municipal law , the law within countries . Kennedy had to react to remove the threat . The Joint Chiefs recommended taking out the missiles by bombing . Fortunately , Kennedy stopped short of that , declared a blockade and demanded the removal of the missiles . <p> At the end of the week of messages back and forth -- I translated Khrushchev 's longest -- it was agreed that Khrushchev would remove the nuclear missiles from Cuba . What was not announced was that Kennedy also agreed that he would remove the U.S. missiles from Turkey but that this commitment must not be made public . <p> We American diplomats in Embassy Moscow were delighted at the outcome , of course . We were not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no idea that we had come close to a nuclear exchange . We knew the U.S. had military superiority in the Caribbean and we would have cheered if the U.S. Air Force had bombed the sites . We were wrong . In later meetings with Soviet diplomats and military officers , we learned that , if the sites had been bombed , the officers on the spot could have launched the missiles without orders from Moscow . We could have lost Miami , and then what ? We also did not know that a Soviet submarine came close to launching a nuclear-armed torpedo against the destroyer that was preventing its coming up for air . <p> It was a close call . It is quite dangerous to get involved in military confrontations with countries with nuclear weapons . You do n't need an advanced degree in international law to understand that . You need only common sense . <p> OK -- It was predictable . Was it predicted ? <p> " The most profound strategic blunder made since the end of the Cold War " <p> My words , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1997 , when the question of adding more members to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) , I was asked to testify before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . In my introductory remarks , I made the following statement : " I consider the Administration 's recommendation to take new members into NATO at this time misguided . If it should be approved by the United States Senate , it may well go down in history as the most profound strategic blunder made since the end of the Cold War . Far from improving the security of the United States , its Allies , and the nations that wish to enter the Alliance , it could well encourage a chain of events that could produce the most serious security threat to this nation since the Soviet Union collapsed . " <p> The reason I cited was the presence in the Russian Federation of a nuclear arsenal that , in overall effectiveness , matched if not exceeded that of the United States . Either of our arsenals , if actually used in a hot war , was capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing the extinction of the human race and much other life on the planet . Though the United States and the Soviet Union had , as a result of arms control agreements concluded by the Reagan and first Bush administrations , negotiations for further reductions stalled during the Clinton Administration . There was not even an effort to negotiate the removal of short-range nuclear weapons from Europe . <p> That was not the only reason I cited for including rather than excluding Russia from European security . I explained as follows : " The plan to increase the membership of NATO fails to take account of the real international situation following the end of the Cold War , and proceeds in accord with a logic that made sense only during the Cold War . The division of Europe ended before there was any thought of taking new members into NATO . No one is threatening to re-divide Europe . It is therefore absurd to claim , as some have , that it is necessary to take new members into NATO to avoid a future division of Europe ; if NATO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then logically the only way it can do so is by expanding to include all European countries . But that does not appear to be the aim of the Administration , and even if it is , the way to reach it is not by admitting new members piecemeal . " <p> Then I added , " All of the purported goals of NATO enlargement are laudable . Of course the countries of Central and Eastern Europe are culturally part of Europe and should be guaranteed a place in European institutions . Of course we have a stake in the development of democracy and stable economies there . But membership in NATO is not the only way to achieve these ends . It is not even the best way in the absence of a clear and identifiable security threat . " <p> In fact , the decision to expand NATO piecemeal was a reversal of American policies that produced the end of the Cold War and the liberation of Eastern Europe . President George H.W. Bush had proclaimed a goal of a " Europe whole and free . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , " had welcomed representatives of East European governments who threw off their Communist rulers and had ordered radical reductions in Soviet military forces by explaining that for one country to be secure , there must be security for all . The first President Bush also assured Gorbachev during their meeting on Malta in December , 1989 , that if the countries of Eastern Europe were allowed to choose their future orientation by democratic processes , the United States would not " take advantage " of that process . ( Obviously , bringing countries into NATO that were then in the Warsaw Pact would be " taking advantage . " ) The following year , Gorbachev was assured , though not in a formal treaty , that if a unified Germany was allowed to remain in NATO , there would be no movement of NATO jurisdiction to the east , " not one inch . " <p> These comments were made to President Gorbachev before the Soviet Union broke up . Once it did , the Russian Federation had less than half the population of the Soviet Union and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no reason to enlarge NATO after the Soviet Union recognized and respected the independence of the East European countries , there was even less reason to fear the Russian Federation as a threat . <p> Willfully precipitated ? <p> Adding countries in Eastern Europe to NATO continued during the George W. Bush administration ( 2001-2009 ) but that was not the only thing that stimulated Russian objection . At the same time , the United States began withdrawing from the arms control treaties that had tempered , for a time , an irrational and dangerous arms race and were the foundation agreements for ending the Cold War . The most significant was the decision to withdraw from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty ( ABM Treaty ) which had been the cornerstone treaty for the series of agreements that halted for a time the nuclear arms race . After the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in New York and the Pentagon in Northern Virginia , President Putin was the first foreign leader to call President Bush and offer support . He was as good as his word by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had harbored Osama bin Laden , the Al Qaeda leader who had inspired the attacks . It was clear at that time that Putin aspired to a security partnership with the United States . The jihadist terrorists who were targeting the United States were also targeting Russia . Nevertheless , the U.S. continued its course of ignoring Russian -- and also allied -- interests by invading Iraq , an act of aggression which was opposed not only by Russia , but also by France and Germany . <p> As President Putin pulled Russia out of the bankruptcy that took place in the late 1990s , stabilized the economy , paid off Russia 's foreign debts , reduced the activity of organized crime , and even began building a financial nest egg to weather future financial storms , he was subjected to what he perceived as one insult after another to his perception of Russia 's dignity and security . He enumerated them in a speech in Munich in 2007 . U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates responded that we did n't need a new Cold War . Quite true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ superiors , nor his successors seemed to take Putin 's warning seriously . Then Senator Joseph Biden , during his candidacy for the presidential election in 2008 , pledged to " stand up to Vladimir Putin ! " Huh ? What in the world had Putin done to him or to the United States ? <p> Although President Barack Obama initially promised policy changes , in fact his government continued to ignore the most serious Russian concerns and redoubled earlier American efforts to detach former Soviet republics from Russian influence and , indeed , to encourage " regime change " in Russia itself . American actions in Syria and Ukraine were seen by the Russian president , and most Russians , as indirect attacks on them . <p> President Assad of Syria was a brutal dictator but the only effective bulwark against the Islamic state , a movement that had blossomed in Iraq following the U.S. invasion and was spreading into Syria . Military aid to a supposed " democratic opposition " quickly fell into the hands of jihadists allied with the very Al Qaeda that had organized the 9/11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearby Russia was much greater since many of the jihadists hailed from areas of the former Soviet Union including Russia itself . Syria is also Russia 's close neighbor ; the U.S. was seen strengthening enemies of both the United States and Russia with its misguided attempt to decapitate the Syrian government . <p> So far as Ukraine is concerned , U.S. intrusion into its domestic politics was deep -- to the point of seeming to select a prime minister . It also , in effect , supported an illegal coup d'etat that changed the Ukrainian government in 2014 , a procedure not normally considered consistent with the rule of law or democratic governance . The violence that still simmers in Ukraine started in the " pro-Western " west , not in the Donbas where it was a reaction to what was viewed as the threat of violence against Ukrainians who are ethnic Russian . <p> During President Obama 's second term , his rhetoric became more personal , joining a rising chorus in the American and British media vilifying the Russian president . Obama spoke of economic sanctions against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in Ukraine , conveniently forgetting that Putin 's action had been popular in Russia and that Obama 's own predecessor could be credibly accused of being a war criminal . Obama then began to hurl insults at the Russian nation as a whole , with allegations like " Russia makes nothing anybody wants , " conveniently ignoring the fact that the only way we could get American astronauts to the international space station at that time was with Russian rockets and that his government was trying its best to prevent Iran and Turkey from buying Russian anti-aircraft missiles . <p> I am sure some will say , " What 's the big deal ? Reagan called the Soviet Union an evil empire , but then negotiated an end of the Cold War . " Right ! Reagan condemned the Soviet empire of old -- and subsequently gave Gorbachev credit for changing it -- but he never publicly castigated the Soviet leaders personally . He treated them with personal respect , and as equals , even treating Foreign Minister Gromyko to formal dinners usually reserved for chiefs of state or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something like , " We hold the peace of the world in our hands . We must act responsibly so the world can live in peace . " <p> Things got worse during the four years of Donald Trump 's tenure . Accused , without evidence , of being a Russian dupe , Trump made sure he embraced every anti-Russian measure that came along , while at the same time flattered Putin as a great leader . Reciprocal expulsions of diplomats , started by the United States in the final days of Obama 's tenure continued in a grim vicious circle that has resulted in a diplomatic presence so emaciated that for months the United States did not have enough staff in Moscow to issue visas for Russians to visit the United States . <p> As so many of the other recent developments , the mutual strangulation of diplomatic missions reverses one of the proudest achievements of American diplomacy in latter Cold War years when we worked diligently and successfully to open up the closed society of the Soviet Union , to bring down the iron curtain that separated " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the cooperation of a Soviet leader who understood that his country desperately needed to join the world . <p> All right , I rest my case that today 's crisis was " willfully precipitated . " But if that is so , how can I say that it can be ... <p> Easily resolved by the application of common sense ? <p> The short answer is because it can be . What President Putin is demanding , an end to NATO expansion and creation of a security structure in Europe that insures Russia 's security along with that of others is eminently reasonable . He is not demanding the exit of any NATO member and he is threatening none . By any pragmatic , common sense standard it is in the interest of the United States to promote peace , not conflict . To try to detach Ukraine from Russian influence -- the avowed aim of those who agitated for the " color revolutions " -- was a fool 's errand , and a dangerous one . Have we so soon forgotten the lesson of the Cuban Missile Crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demands is in the objective interest of the United States does not mean that it will be easy to do .

As the coalition 's inward-looking policies triggered an economic collapse and a shortage of foreign currency and local revenue , NM was dubbed " No Money Perara " . <p> On whom should this dubious ' No Money ' title be bestowed on , these days , when the country is facing a similar crisis ? ( Basil ) Rajapaksa , ( Ajit Nivard ) Cabraal or even ( Udaya ) Gammanpila who moans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> I was reflecting on these issues since the country is facing a huge revenue and foreign exchange crisis -- the worst foreign exchange crisis since the 1970s -- resulting in queues at fuel stations and for milk powder , for cooking gas ( according to some reports there is likely to be another shortage ) and for some other essentials . <p> As I prepared to write my column this week , the power was cut off in our area . At that moment , the telephone rang with Uncle Berty , known as ' Sporting Berty ' for his penchant for betting on horses , on the line . He sounded angry , as his betting shop was closed due to the power cuts . <p> " I say , a one-hour power cut is understandable but two hours is unbearable and three hours is insane , " he said adding , furiously ; " this government is grrr ... %%@##$&amp;&amp;6it ! ! " <p> The discussion across the neighbourhood this week was about the rolling power cuts -- first an hour , followed by two hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the topic of conversation under the margosa tree . <p> While the government is struggling to manage the situation and miserably failing in the process , its officials have cultivated the fine art of issuing contradictory statements . Consider the statements of the Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission Janaka Ratnayake . Last week he said there wo n't be any power cuts until March , only to break that promise a few hours later and announce a power cut . One-hour power cuts became two hours , then three hours and now four hours . What 's next in store , no one knows ! <p> It was in the midst of this unsettled governance that the President called a meeting of the country 's top business professionals a few days ago . But rather than discuss in detail the country 's crisis and seek opinions from the business community , it was more about how business can help develop the country ; not a priority at the moment . The business barons present should have been asked for their suggestions ( the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settling debt , meeting foreign exchange liabilities and paying our import bills . <p> Last week , the chamber , while frowning on the Surcharge Tax , provided many alternative recommendations considering either an income tax surcharge of 10 per cent from all taxpayers , an income tax surcharge at varying rates depending on the level of income , credit to be carried forward for paying the one-off tax or the imposition of the tax on a prospective basis . Any of these alternatives could have raised the targeted revenue , while minimising the burden on the private sector during this extremely challenging period in the country , the chamber said . <p> Since last year , with the country facing a serious economic crisis , the business community should have been roped in to a crisis council of sorts with the government to jointly steer the economic ship . But the government decided to rely on its own economic advisors and see where that has got us : Oil supplies coming into the port but no money to pay to clear these consignments ! ! <p> Why is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community into their confidence when reaching crucial decisions during crisis periods like the current one that impacts the nation and its people ? <p> The business community after all is a key stakeholder , providing the largest quantum of jobs in the country and the biggest taxpayers in the country through corporate taxes and taxes of employees . <p> For investors to invest in local industry -- there should be a conducive climate to encourage such investments . For example , ad hoc taxation is certainly not the right way ( the sudden , one-off taxes are a negative to investment ) , processes should be streamlined and costs should be predictable unlike in today 's context where it is unpredictable . <p> Predictable costs and labour laws need to be flexible , one of the reasons renewable energy companies and garment firms here are investing abroad . Not only the ease of doing business , but the cost of doing business need to be radically improved in Sri Lanka . However , the priority at the moment is ensuring the sustainability of business in this crisis of power cuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It is still not too late -- with the fuel crisis spreading into several other months -- for the joint chambers to be asked by the government for a short , medium and long term solution to the foreign exchange and energy crisis . The chambers would be willing to lend their expertise in this crisis . <p> Sipping my second mug of tea brought by Kussi Amma Sera , I was amused by a recent comment by an opposition legislator that very soon Sri Lankan motorists would be asked to pay in dollars at the fuel station -- much like the Central Bank saying whoever has foreign cash can import a vehicle ! <h> Share This Post <p> Hitad.lk has you covered with quality used or brand new cars for sale that are budget friendly yet reliable !

The country 's interest cost to government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanka 's history and the highest in the world . <p> These were some of the points that were debated last Tuesday when the Sunday Times Business Club ( STBC ) hosted a discussion on ' Going to the IMF ' at the Taj Samudra Hotel in Colombo . Economists -- LankaClear Chairman Dr. Kenneth De Zilwa and Verite Research Executive Director , Dr. Nishan De Mel shared their thoughts . Economics Prof. Sirimal Abeyratne was the moderator . It was the first physical meeting of the club in two years with this year 's host hotel being the Taj Samudra . <p> Dr. De Mel in his remarks stated , " Sri Lanka going to the IMF 16 times in the past , is why we have a problem of governance . The government does n't know to manage its economy well.We need a diagnosis of whether it is the IMF 's prescriptions or Sri Lanka 's bad governance that has led Sri Lanka into difficulty . The country has a problem of a lack of commitment on good behaviour . " <p> " IMF gives a programme and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must behave . It becomes an external commitment device because the internal commitment devices are not working . IMF locks up the government for better behaviour , " he added . <p> Sri Lanka had good growth for six years in the past out of which three years were when the country was under the IMF programme . The correlation and view people have that IMF leads to lower growth is unsubstantiated . Sri Lanka 's own history provides an example how the country was managed under the IMF programme and when it was n't , pointed out Dr. De Mel . <p> The only way forward for Sri Lanka is to restructure its debt . " We need to reach out to the creditors and take a loss on the debt . The longer we wait the more fuel shortages , medicine shortages , inflation , rupee depreciation pain will increase on a weekly basis . The delay is costing the country 's economy enormously . The IMF is extremely important for restructuring the debt . They can do a debt sustainability analysis , build credibility confidence leverage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop paying the creditors , " he noted . <p> Expressing a different view , Dr. De Zilwa stated , " Sri Lanka has to revisit the ' profit story ' only through making the country 's export , manufacturing and industrialisation sector competitive that this can be achieved , not services , as we have seen now . It 's not by going to the IMF . The IMF will tell you to depreciate the currency , increase the interest rates , hands off reserves , this sounds good , but is extremely dangerous . Globally too the IMF has done the same thing . All developing countries that have sought IMF assistance have not prospered . These are destructive policies the IMF brings into countries which erode competitiveness . " <p> Revisiting the IMF now is going to be at the cost of business . The country has seen this cycle repeat itself for the last so many years from 1965 , i.e. 16 times . " If we did all what the IMF said through multiple governments and programmes given to us , could n't we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shame on us to go for the 17th time , " he added . <p> He also noted , " Due to accessibility to funding because of the perennial problem to finance the trade deficit , the country had to go to capital markets , borrow and finance . Trade deficit continues to widen which to date is the crux of the problem that has led us into a huge cash flow issue . The country has a US$10 billion gap that needs to be financed . The current account does n't sufficiently meet the adequate financing and therefore we are forced from 2009 to go to capital markets . " <p> He said , out of Sri Lanka 's total debt today , $12.5 billion is the capital market debt . " The remaining is long term multilateral and bilateral debt which is not causing us anything and its average interest rates are manageable . It is the capital market debt that is causing the problem , because it 's short term . It is refinanced every two to three years depending on how we float bonds to finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chronic problem for us where our expenditures are relatively high and not managed well , " noted Mr. De Zilwa . <h> Share This Post <p> Hitad.lk has you covered with quality used or brand new cars for sale that are budget friendly yet reliable !

Yet , rather than discuss solutions to the crisis , both Government and Opposition MPs kept pointing fingers at each other over the unprecedented economic crisis . <p> On Thursday , SJB MPs wielding placards and battery powered torches staged a protest inside the Chamber demanding that the Government and President Gotabaya Rajapaksa resign over the daily power cuts . The uproar caused by the protest forced Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena to adjourn proceedings for 10 minutes . <p> When proceedings resumed , Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa noted that there were now long lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fuel shortage . Some filling stations have even begun rationing fuel . " Many factory owners called me and explained that their factories were not operating as they are unable to find fuel for vehicles that transport workers to and from the factories . They do n't even have fuel for their generators . " <p> The prevailing power cuts were also affecting students sitting for the ongoing GCE Advanced Level examination , small and medium industries and those in the tourism industry who are just getting back on their feet . " Save for competing media statements made by the Chairman of the Public Utilities Commission and Ministers of Power and Energy regarding the crisis , the Government has been unable to find a solution and has plunged much of the country in to daily power cuts lasting almost five hours . " <p> Energy Minister Udaya Gammanpila acknowledged that the country was facing a severe fuel crisis due to lack of foreign exchange . He claimed this was due to the country 's import expenditure vastly exceeding its export revenue since 1978 and from obtaining large foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1978 , including those that the Opposition Leader was part of must bear responsibility for the foreign exchange crisis we find ourselves in . " <p> Under the previous Yahapalana Government , the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation ( CPC ) owed USD 3.1 billion to the two state banks for Letters of Credit opened for fuel importation as at December 31 , 2019 . Despite the seriousness of the foreign exchange crisis over the past 18 months , Mr Gammanpila said he was still able to reduce the CPC 's debt to the two state banks by USD 355 million . The minister challenged the Opposition Leader to explain how he plans to solve the foreign exchange crisis instead of just hurling accusations . " This is not just a Government problem ; it 's a national problem . Cast your slogans aside and help us solve this problem for if we fall , the country will fall with us . " <p> The previous day ( 23 ) , the SJB had moved an adjournment debate on " the current socio-economic situation of the country . " The Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SJB MP Eran Wickramaratne said , moving the motion for the Opposition . " The Government puts a few dollars in and gets some fuel . When the Government buys fuel under the reload system , consumers have to refuel under the sachet packet system in some areas as fuel is rationed at filling stations , " he quipped . <p> According to the Minister of Energy himself , when an oil tanker arrives , it is the two managers of the Petroleum and the Bank together who decide on the payments to be made . Today the situation is so critical that the President and the Minister are being pushed to intervene . It shows that there is no management of institutions in the country and no management of the country , the MP claimed . " This is a catastrophic situation . " <p> The current crisis was not President Gotabaya Rajapaksa 's fault , nor has it come about due to the failure and inefficiency of his Government , Trade Minister Bandula Gunawardana argued . The Yahapalana Government saved USD 5 billion from 2015 to 2017 due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this money was squandered due to the instructions given by then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake to the Central Bank . That was only the start . You took out sovereign bonds that we will have to be paying till 2029 . Your Government destroyed this country . A single party can not find solutions to this crisis now . " he told the Opposition . <p> Justice Minister Ali Sabry meanwhile , dismissed the accusations levelled by the SJB against the Government over the Easter Sunday attack , pointing out that they occurred four-and-half years into the previous Government 's term . It is a fact that multiple intelligence warnings of an impending attack were ignored in the lead-up to the attacks , he pointed out . He also brushed aside accusations over the way the Attorney General had pressed charges over the attacks . " A civilised Government can not simply arrest people off the street and charge them . It is up to the police to investigate an incident and report facts to the AG , who must then decide if charges should be filed . The Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A Government that is unable to properly identify the crisis can not be expected to find a solution , National People 's Power ( NPP ) MP Dr Harini Amarasuriya opined . She noted that the vast majority of the country 's entrepreneurs are small and medium business owners and these businesses have been hit hardest by the crisis . The Government 's only response so far has been to blame the COVID pandemic for everything . " You ca n't provide an uninterrupted supply of electricity just because the President says so if you do n't have the necessary fuel and the money with which to purchase it . " <p> The claim that the power crisis stems from a failure by the Yahapalana Government to build new power plants is false because the problem is not with the power grid 's capacity but with the failure to supply fuel to existing power plants , said SJB MP Patali Champika Ranawaka . According to the Ceylon Electricity Board 's ( CEB ) own statistics , the country 's generation capacity is 4888 MegaWatts ( MW ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As such , he said the issue is clearly lack of fuel . Several key power plants , including the GT7 power plant at Kelanitissa and the West Coast power plant are currently out of action because their fuel stocks have run out . This means that though the power grid has a capacity of 2168MW of thermal power , only 1023MW is currently available . <p> The debate ended abruptly however , when most remaining SJB MPs walked out in the middle of the speech by Agriculture Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage ; the day 's final speaker . It was thereafter pointed out that there was no quorum in the House . Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna ( SLPP ) MP Dr Suren Raghavan , who was in the Chair , noted that it was the Opposition who moved the adjournment debate and their failure to stay until the end had disgraced both democracy and Parliament . With not enough MPs in the House even after the quorum bell sounded , the debate ended in embarrassing fashion . <p> Parliament will reconvene at 10 a.m. on March 8 . <h> Share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier with the help of Hitad.lk !

As Putin has put it , the " Soviet totalitarian regime " incorrectly divided the territory of the empire , limiting the rights of ethnic Russians , and now the time has come to redistribute the territory of the empire -- already a former empire -- anew . <p> An " escalation on the border , " a provocation organized by the Kremlin itself , is being used as a pretext for the invasion .

A dollar has to be sold by an exporter for a rupee ( wealth jumps from the US to Sri Lanka monetary base ) and the exporters pay the CPC in rupees . <p> CPC now has to jump back from the rupee monetary base into the US monetary base with US dollars . <p> Hence the exporter dollar conversion rule makes the problem worse because a given transfer of wealth has to jump from US monetary base to rupees and back again to dollars . <p> It can be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a floating exchange rate .

But when the currency depreciates the value of savings evaporates . <p> New savings also reduce as prices go up . <p> Economists talk about the Tanzi effect . The Tanzi effect refers to the fall in the real value of taxes in a hyperinflating economy from the time the taxes fall due and the time the payment is made . <p> However , savings and debt have a similar problem . A fall in currency inflates away real wealth . Economist Steve Hanke has already calculated a higher level of inflation implied by exchange rate movements . <p> When the currency falls , the ability to repay reduces . That is partly why countries that practice ' competitive exchange rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The revenue-based fiscal consolidation exercise by rejecting spending-based consolidation failed to arrest deficits .

Bi-lateral lenders continue to fund the country in a crisis and did not demand their money back in a crisis . <p> Latin American nations , which were basically first world nations before soft pegs were set up in the 20th century and faced severe uncertainty from the 1980s after the Fed floated , had always borrowed from commercial markets . <p> Sri Lanka also started to borrow in commercial markets with a similar soft-peg from around 2005 onwards . <p> Intermediate regime countries keep going back to IMF .

@@44001240 <h> Plight of African Nationals in China <p> In early April 2020 , Chinese authorities in the southern city of Guangzhou , Guangdong province , which has China 's largest African community , began a campaign to forcibly test Africans for the coronavirus , and ordered them to self-isolate or to quarantine in designated hotels . Landlords then evicted African residents , forcing many to sleep on the street , and hotels , shops , and restaurants refused African customers . Other foreign groups have generally not been subjected to similar treatment . Human Rights Watch criticized the Chinese government on this issue and pointed out that China should end the discriminatory treatment of Africans related to the Covid 19 pandemic . Authorities should also protect Africans and people of African descent throughout China from discrimination in employment , housing , and other realms . <p> Traditionally , Beijing has portrayed racism as a Western problem .

However , the national question , which has tormented the country for decades , continues to be one of her biggest problems , if not the greatest . <p> Sinhala Buddhist nationalism features prominently in any discourse on Sri Lanka 's national question . Its detractors often derogatorily call it by terms such as Sinhala Buddhist imperialism , Sinhala Buddhist chauvinism , and Sinhala Buddhist racism , whilst its protagonists call it Sinhala Buddhist patriotism or simply patriotism . Meanwhile , somewhat esoteric and ephemeral terms such as Sinhala Buddhist majoritarianism , kinguistic nationalism , and ethnocracy are used for it in learned discourse . Further , Sinhala Buddhist nationalism is very often discussed with reference to personages of Sri Lanka 's ancient history such as Dutugemunu and Elara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and early phases of development of Sinhala Buddhist nationalism during Sri Lanka 's ancient past , in order to enhance our understanding of the subject . <p> As in our own age , in the distant past too , various races migrated from one land to another for various reasons such as the search for greener pastures and the forced eviction by intruding tribes . From about the sixth century BC , Sri Lanka too , which until then was thinly populated by primitive hunter gatherers , experienced an influx of migrants from overseas . Some of them , who had a knack for agriculture , settled in the arid north central plains of the island , which were covered with wooded forests and shrub jungles , as those one could still see in places such as Wilpattu . As direct rain water was often inadequate and undependable for growing paddy , these pioneer settlers cultivated the art of conserving water by building small artificial reservoirs called tanks , and convert the hostile arid terrain into paddy fields with the water thus conserved . Thereby they were able to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tough , and enterprising pioneer settlers came to be known as ' Sihala ' or Sinhalese , whose founding fathers were , according to legends , Vijaya and his band of seven hundred followers , who came to Sri Lanka from northern India . Other migrant tribes , either perished in this hostile physical environment , like the traders devoured by Kuveni , or got suppressed and assimilated by the dominant Sinhalese . This was a social process , which had some affinity to the process of natural selection in the biological world -- a case of social Darwinism , so to speak . The Sinhalese went on to build progressively bigger tanks , weirs , canals , and complex irrigation systems connecting all such innovative creations with rivers which flowed from the distant wet mountains . As a result , the erstwhile wild and hostile terrain of Sri Lanka 's north central plains were converted into a vast blue and green tapestry of thousands of artificial lakes and lush paddy fields studded with dagobas of immaculate white . The formidable physical challenges posed by the nature were surmounted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which took place more than thousand years ago , inspired many people of modern times . A notable person amongst them was the British planter , archaeologist , and author John Still ( 1880 -- 1941 ) of Jungle Tide fame , who in turn drew the insightful attention of Arnold Toynbee , the eminent scholar of comparative history and civilizations ( Arnold J Toynbee ; A study of history ; abridgement by D C Somervell ) . The agrarian revolution powered by advanced irrigation systems was the bedrock , the backbone , and the material basis of the fully-fledged hydraulic civilization of ancient Sri Lanka . The elaborate social , political , cultural and religious institutions of that civilisation constituted , as Marx would say , its superstructure . <p> The birth of the ancient agrarian revolution based on irrigation engineering pre-dates the arrival of Buddhism in the island in the third century BC . The medium sized tank ' Abhaya Wewa ' , which is also known as Basawak Kulama , in Anuradhapura , built in the fourth century BC by king Pandukabhaya , proves the point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Anuradhapura during the reign of Devanampiyatissa ( 250 BC -- 210 BC ) . Irrigation engineering witnessed a quantum leap during the reign of the great Vasabha ( 67 AD -- 111 AD ) . During his reign , in addition to many large tanks , the Elahera canal was built . This canal diverted the waters of the Ambanganga , a tributary of the Mahaweli river originating from the Matale hills , to the tanks in the arid north central plains . The next great period of tank building was the reign of Mahasena ( 274 AD -- 301 AD ) , during which many tanks including the giant Minneriya Wewa was constructed . Mahasena 's achievements were equaled or surpassed during the reign of Dhatusena ( 455 AD -- 473 AD ) , during which huge tanks such as the Kalawewa and the Yoda Wewa were constructed , damming the Kala Oya and the Malwathu Oya respectively . However , the greatest irrigation engineering feat during the reign of Dhatusena was the construction of the Yoda Ela , also known as Jayaganga , a fifty four mile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tissawewa in Anuradhapura . Further significant additions to the irrigation infrastructure were made during the reigns of Moggallana II ( 531 AD -- 551 AD ) and Aggabodhi II ( AD 604 -- AD 614 ) . The former constructed the huge Nachchaduwa Wewa near Anuradhapura , augmented the Nuwara Wewa in Anuradhapura ( History of Ceylon , University of Ceylon : editor ; S. Paranavitana ) and built the Padaviya tank by damming the Ma Oya ( K M De Silva ; A History of Sri Lanka ) , whist the latter constructed the Kantale , Giritale , and Kaudulla tanks . Thereafter , the expansion of the irrigation systems seems to have subsided for several centuries till the time of Parakramabahu the Great ( 1153 -- 1186 ) . This king is considered to be the greatest tank builder of Sri Lanka ( ibid ) . The massive Parakrama Samudraya in Polonnaruwa , which was created by combining three tanks including the Topawewa , is undoubtedly his finest achievement in the field of tank building . It has to be been noted no other king after him built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrigation engineering had many important economic , social , political , religious , and cultural implications and outcome . On the economic sphere , it phenomenally increased the extent of arable land by making it possible to bring vast swathes of erstwhile arid forest land under the plough through irrigation . Further , it would have , most probably , facilitated a significant migration from small scale peasant subsistence farming to more productive large scale farming . Anyway , the obvious economic outcome of the ancient agrarian revolution was the generation of ever increasing agricultural surpluses over and about what was needed to feed the peasants and other agricultural labourers . These massive economic surpluses enabled the kings and their ruling elites to invest enormous resources in the expansion of the irrigation infrastructure , in maintaining the irrigation technocracy and the royal bureaucracy , in building impressive Buddhist monuments such as the great stupas , in patronizing outstanding Buddhist scholarship of international repute , and in constructing awe inspiring secular monuments such as Kasyapa 's Sigiriya rock fortress and royal palace . <p> On the social and political spheres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inexorably led to centralized control of agriculture through irrigation management . The technocrat who controlled the spills and the sluices of the tanks and weirs came to dominate the peasant who ploughed the fields , sowed the seeds , and harvested the crops . This entailed the ascendency of the state bureaucracy including the irrigation engineering technocracy , which in turn called for a unified and highly centralized state . <p> Pandukabhaya and birth of Sinhala state <p> It was mentioned earlier that the first significant tank was built by Pandukabhaya in the fourth century BC . It is interesting to note that he was also the first ruler of the Anuradhapura kingdom . Prior to him , the main Sinhala presence in Sri Lanka constituted a conglomerate of Sinhala settlements situated between the Kala Oya and the Malvattu Oya , loosely connected by tribal and family ties . It is evident that Pandukabhaya forcefully subjugated these semi-autonomous settlements and united them under his leadership . Thus the first Sinhala state was born . No doubt , this was in response to a historical necessity of the agrarian revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this nascent state had nothing to do with Sinhala Buddhist nationalism or patriotism . In the first place , Buddhism was yet to be introduced to Sri Lanka . Further , the Sinhala state was yet to perceive a real threat from non -- Sinhalese . It was young , vibrant and self- confident . It was , in modern parlance , an absolute monarchy . <p> Devamanpiyatissa and the birth of the Sinhala- Buddhist state <p> Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka by the great Mauryan emperor Asoka during the reign of Devamanpiyatissa ( 250 -- 210 ) at a time when the ancient agrarian revolution was in full swing . As already mentioned , it was during this period that the Tissa Wewa was built . The peaceful conversion of the country to Buddhism received unreserved royal patronage . The nascent Sinhala state became a Sinhala Buddhist state . Numerous lands and viharas were gifted to the Maha Sanga . These included the Thuparama dagoba , and the spacious Mahamegha park in Anuradhapura , in which the sacred Bodhi tree Sri Maha Bodhi was planted . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Theravada Buddhist Church in Sri Lanka . No doubt , the doctrine of the Buddha , which laid down a well -- structured spiritual path to freedom from existential suffering through the taming of the senses , struck a chord with the well-structured thinking of the Sinhalese irrigation engineers , which provided a path to freedom from material want by taming wild and hostile nature , with technological innovations . <p> Like Pandukabhaya 's Sinhala state , the nascent Sinhala Buddhist state during Devanampiyatissa 's had nothing to do with Sinhala Buddhist nationalism or patriotism . It did not perceive a real threat from non -- Sinhalese or non-Buddhists . Like Pandukabhaya 's state , it was young , vibrant and self- confident . <p> The Sinhala Buddhist state under siege <p> Devanampiyatissa 's Sinhala Buddhist kingdom was in state of blissful harmony , arguably unparalled in Sri Lanka 's long history . However , this state of affairs was to be dramatically disrupted after a short period of time due to game-changing external and internal interventions . The major external challenge came from Tamil adventurers from south India bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization . The main internal challenge came from the growing Mahayana tendencies amongst sections Sri Lanka 's Maha Sangha , which had traditionally been the custodian and standard bearer of Theravada Buddhism in Sri Lanka and abroad . Sinhala Buddhist Nationalism was born as a response to these challenges from within and without . <p> The first major challenge to the young Sinhala Buddhist state emerged thirty years after the death of Devanampiyatissa . Sena and Guttika , two Tamil brothers engaged in horse trading , captured the Anuradhapura kingdom and reigned for twenty two years . A few years after the Sinhalese regained the kingdom , the second successful invasion from South India was launched . This was led by the Chola prince Elara , who reigned in Anuradhapura for forty four years . The Sinhalese under Dutugemunu vanquished Elara and regained the kingdom . Dutugemunu 's reign ( 161 BC -- 137 BC ) was a watershed in the Sri Lanka 's history . The island , which hitherto consisted of several kingdoms , was unified under his leadership . The Sinhala Buddhist state became , in present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than four decades after Dutugemunu 's death , Anuradhapura was captured and occupied again by south Indian Tamils from 103 BC to 89 BC . They were expelled by Vattagamini ( Valagamba ) , who reigned from 89 BC to 77 BC . Thereafter , for more than five hundred years , Sri Lanka was free from foreign occupation . It was during this period that her ancient irrigation witnessed its first great flowering . However , it was during this period that the serious internal threats to the Sinhala Buddhist state emerged . They came in the form of Mahayana challenges to the uncontested supremacy of the Mahavihara led Theravada Buddhist Church , which was a main pillar of the Sinhala Buddhist state . The initial threat came in the first century BC with the establishment of the rival Abhayagiri monastery by Valagamba , which harboured dissenters . The immediate response of the Theravada Buddhist Church to this was the writing down of the Tripitaka at Aluvihara during that king 's reign . The next threat , which was of a much greater magnitude , was the intrusion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century AD , during the reign of Mahasena ( 274 AD -- 301 AD ) , with the fanatical support of that monarch . This was somewhat contemporaneous with the rise of Mahayana in south India under the guidance of great masters such as Nagarjuna . Anyway , the Theravada Buddhist Church eventually prevailed by winning back the king to its side with great difficulty . <p> The long peace of half a millennium , which commenced with the reign of Valagamba , ended with the invasion from south India in 429 AD . This resulted in the reign of six Tamils kings in Anuradhapura for twenty seven years , until Dhatusena liberated the country from the foreign yoke . Thereafter , the country did not experience invasions from abroad for about four centuries . Ancient Sri Lankan irrigation witnessed its second great flowering . However , during ninth and tenth centuries , Sri Lanka got caught up in the geo-political rivalries amongst south Indian Tamil kingdoms of Pallavas , Pandyas and Cholas . At that time the Hindu Tamil civilization of south India was in its ascendency , whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stagnation , if not decay . The end result was the conquest of Anuradhapura and the north central plains of Sri Lanka by the Cholas in the closing decade of the tenth century . This dealt a crippling blow to Sri Lanka 's ancient hydraulic civilization . The Sinhalese were , under Vijayabahu I , able to expel the Cholas from the Island in 1070 , and under Parakramabahu the Great , revive the ancient hydraulic civilization . Sri Lanka 's ancient irrigation witnessed its third and last flowering . However , the revival was short lived . The invasion by the marauding Kerala army of Magha of Kalinga in 1215 dealt the death blow to the ancient hydraulic civilization . The Sinhalese , who had populated the north central plains since sixth century BC , migrated en masse to the south west and the central hills . The irrigation works were abandoned and went into disrepair . The hostile arid jungles , which were banished by Sinhalese pioneers , returned to the north central plains with a vengeance . The ancient hydraulic civilization of the Sinhalese , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to an end . <p> The ancient hydraulic civilization and Sinhala Buddhist Nationalism <p> Sinhala Buddhist Nationalism , like many other -- isms , constitute an ideology ; an outlook . As already mentioned , it was born as a response to the external and internal challenges to the ancient Sinhala Buddhist state , which was an integrate part of the ancient hydraulic civilization . But , how do we conceptualise this ideology of Sri Lanka 's distant past ? Fortunately , the ancient chronicles -- Dipavamsa , Mahavamsa , and Chulavamsa , and the last two chapters of the Pujavaliya , come to our assistance . However , it should be cautioned that the ideologies contained in these ancient documents represent , more likely , the views held by their respective authors and their contemporary societies than by the personages of their narratives . <p> It seems that the internal threat to the Theravada Buddhism by Mahasena 's aggressive promotion of Vaitulyavada prompted the writing of the two oldest exiting chronicles of Sri Lanka -- the Dipavamsa , written in the fourth century AD , and the Mahavamsa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the narratives of both works end with the death of Mahasena points in that direction . Anyway , both emphasize that the island was freed from the Yakkas by the Buddha to make way for the Sinhalese settlers and the establishment of the Buddhist doctrine . This amounts to an imprimatur for Sinhala Buddhist exclusivity in Sri Lanka , which goes back , at least , as far as the fourth and sixth centuries . However , the treatment of the Sinhala king Dutugemunu and the Tamil king Elara by the two authors differ significantly . For instance , whilst the Dipavamsa devotes a mere twelve verses to Dutugemunu , the Mahavansa devotes eleven out of its thirty two chapters to him . Clearly , Dutugemunu is the favourite king of the author of the Mahavamsa . Further , whilst both chronicles admire Elara as an incomparably just king , the Dipavamsa , unlike the Mahavamsa , takes note of his outstanding spiritual qualities . More strikingly , the Mahavamsa , in chapter twenty five seeks to lend a Buddhist imprimatur to Dutugemunu 's war with Elara . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Metta Sutta , as much as the crusades of medieval Christendom authorized by the papacy was inconsistent with the letter and spirit of Jesus ' utterance " Put your sword in its place , for all who take the sword will perish by the sword " ( Matthew 26 ; 52 ) . In fact , the Mahavamsa 's stance on the Dutugemunu- Elara war is reminiscent of the ideas on ' just war ' advocated by St. Augustine and the Bhagavad Gita . Most probably , the south Indian invasions of the fifth century prompted the sixth century author of Mahavamsa to take a more militant Sinhala Buddhist stance than the fourth century author of the Dipavamsa . <p> The first part of the Chulavamsa , which was most probably composed in the early part of the thirteenth century , provides useful information about the period from the death of Mahasena to the end of the ancient hydraulic civilization . The last two chapters ( chapters 33 and 34 ) of the Pujavaliya briefly covers this period in addition to history up to the death of Mahasena . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the collapse of the hydraulic civilization . Whilst the three chronicles were composed in Pali , the Pujavaliya was written in Sinhala . <p> The Chulavamsa and the Pujavaliya , in comparison with the Dipavamsa and the Mahavamsa , take a more hostile approach towards non -- Sinhala Buddhist actors . For instance , unlike the Dipavamsa and the Mahavamsa , the Pujavaliya perceives Elara merely as a malevolent personage bent on destroying the Buddhist Church . The more virulent Tamil invasions from the ninth century onwards , would have contributed towards this more aggressive Sinhala Buddhist nationalism . <p> We have seen how the dynamics of the ancient hydraulic civilization gave birth Sinhala Buddhist Nationalism . The hydraulic civilization itself perished as a result of the devastating invasion of Magha of Kalinga . However , Sinhala Buddhist Nationalism did not perish with that civilization . On the contrary , it has continued to live as a potent ideology of Sri Lanka , right up to the present day . <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers the contents of this website without charge , but does not necessarily endorse the views and opinions expressed within .

@@89849231 <h> CONFESSIONS OF A GLOBAL GYPSY <p> On October 23 , 1983 , I arrived in London with my wife , to start a new chapter of dreams , ambitions and also some uncertainty . This was my fourth visit to the United Kingdom ( UK ) . Previously I spent a few months in UK , as a Management Trainee with the Trust House Forte ( THF ) hotels in London , as a Fellow of the International Labour Organization ( ILO ) with assignments in four British cities , and also as a tourist in England and Scotland . We were very familiar with London and the nearby areas . <p> I had finally been accepted to the first batch of the world 's first master 's degree ( M.Sc. ) in International Hotel Management , at the University of Surrey ( UoS ) . I was planning to be in UK as a full-time graduate student for a maximum of two years , but hopeful to complete my program within a year . To achieve that , I needed to manage my time well to pass all ten courses over a period of two semesters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Due to unavoidable challenges , I was late by a month to arrive in UK to join the M.Sc. program . I knew that I would have further challenges but I was determined to overcome obstacles and jump over the hurdles to the best of my ability . I was focused on catching up the studies of the missed month within a few days , but I was nervous . Early in the morning of my second day in UK , I arrived at the residence of UoS . <p> The University of Surrey <p> I was welcomed by Professor Richard Kotas , the Program Coordinator for the M.Sc . His encouragement during a week in early 1982 , that I spent at UoS as part of my ILO Fellowship , was the main reason I joined this program . He was very helpful in assisting me to catch up quickly the month that I had missed . He soon became my life-long mentor . <p> UoS is a public research university which had received its royal charter in 1966 , along with a number of other institutions previously known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ university 's research output and global partnerships have led to it being regarded as one of UK 's leading research universities . UoS 's bachelors ' degree in hotel management and master 's degree in tourism development were generally considered the best British university programs in the field . <p> Although now , masters ' degrees are common in hotel management , in 1983 , it was unique . Most hotel industry leaders in UK at that time , had commenced their careers at the lowest levels of the industry or with craft-level qualifications . They doubted if masters ' degrees were needed for a hands-on trade like hospitality . <p> The M.Sc. first batch had only nine students but all enhanced the ' international ' feel of the program . We came from nine different countries -- the Bahamas , Cyprus , Greece , Hong Kong , India , Kenya , Nigeria , Sri Lanka and the UK . At age 29 , I was the fifth oldest in the batch . We all lived in the main university residence in Guildford for two semesters . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supermarket , post office , bank and a large sports complex . I was totally content to remain on the campus on my days in Guildford . <p> Starving and Studying <p> I quickly settled into my studies and assignments , but I was very unsettled about our cash flow situation . Although , we assumed that my wife could find full-time work easily and quickly , it did not happen as envisaged . I was too busy catching up with my outstanding studies , and did not have free time to do part-time work yet . Our little extra cash kept for a rainy day was gradually evaporating . <p> I took my cutting down on expenses to a new level . Every week from Monday to Thursday when I stayed at the campus , each day I survived with the same diet -- a coffee in the morning , a small egg sandwich by noon and a glass of milk and a banana in the evening . " Chandi , how come that you became so thin ? " , my wife asked me one day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to London . I pretended that I am keeping fit and slim , intentionally . <p> Within a month , our financial situation improved . My wife found full-time work as a receptionist at a Dutch oil company office in Knightsbridge in London . After many attempts , I found a part-time work as a waiter in Kensington , London during the weekends . Having been a Hotel Manager and the Manager Operations in the John Keells head office , for seven hotels in Sri Lanka , my adjustment to work as a waiter again after 10 years , was not easy . <p> As I was able to work only for a couple of days , it was not possible to find employment in keeping with my experience and qualifications . We rented a small apartment in West Hampstead in North London . My wife stayed there and I joined her every week , from Thursday evening to Monday early morning . The other three nights , I spent in my tiny room in the campus , studying long hours till early hours in the morning . <p> A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommendation from Taj Samudra Hotel in Sri Lanka helped me to secure my first part-time job in London , with a sister hotel of the Taj Group . The General Manager of Baily 's Hotel , then owned and managed by the Taj Hotels of India , assigned me to work in room service at the hotel and their Indian Restaurant -- Bombay Brasserie . <p> Bailey 's Hotel was one of the earliest , privately built hotels in London . The opening of The Langham on Regent Street in 1865 , is generally considered the origin of the true luxury hotels in UK . Bailey 's Hotel was opened eleven years after that in 1876 and three years prior to the opening of the world-famous London hotel , The Savoy . Bailey 's bore the name of the developer , Sir James Bailey , a hotelier and politician . <p> Due to the location in West London ( opposite the Gloucester Road tube station , which had opened in 1872 ) and the reputation of the owner , Bailey 's Hotel had attracted London 's aristocracy and wealthier inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bailey 's Hotel had been one of the more successful hotels in London with over 300 rooms . It also was very popular with international guests . <p> In 1983 , although the Bailey 's Hotel appeared to be a little faded , the Taj Group had invested wisely to convert its street-front restaurant to become ranked as the best Indian restaurant in UK . It paved the way for Indian and Bombay cuisine in London . When opened in 1982 , the high standards of the Bombay Brasserie were compared with a reputed competitor -- then most prestigious and oldest existing Indian restaurant in London -- Veeraswamy ( opened in 1926 ) , located in the Regent Street . <p> I did split shifts on Saturdays and Sundays , serving lunch and dinner at the Bombay Brasserie . In between my split shifts I had four hours to spare . I asked permission from the management to remain in the Bailey 's Hotel staff canteen during that time , to do my university studies . Other employees often mocked me for bringing a bag full of text books to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they jokingly asked me . <p> I liked the gentle leadership style of the General Manager of the Bombay Brasserie -- Mr. Adi Modi . Every Sunday , after the lunch customers left , he invited all kitchen and restaurant staff to sit with him in the restaurant , to consume the sumptuous buffet lunch . He achieved two things from that uncommon action -- providing product knowledge to the internal customers and motivating his team . I was certainly motivated with that gesture , and a few years later , adopted similar initiatives as a Food &amp; Beverage Director and hotel General Manager . <p> A Part-time Banquet Waiter at the Dorchester <p> As I settled in well at UoS , in addition to the weekends , I was free to work on Thursday evenings and a full-day on Fridays . I could have easily done extra shifts at Bailey 's Hotel and Bombay Brasserie , but I wanted to explore other options . My desire was to gain more diverse experiences in well-known five-star hotels in London . <p> I used my previous connections in London as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that five-star experiences would open new doors for me to reach my ambitious , career goal . I wanted to eventually become the General Manager of an international , five-star hotel branded by a top , global hotel corporation . My mid-term career goal was to first become the Food &amp; Beverage Manager of a five-star international hotel . Investing time to gain valuable and high-quality experiences at any level , usually pays good dividends in the long run . <p> I met Mr. Wilfred Weragoda for the first time in 1974 , when I was a final year student of the Ceylon Hotel School ( CHS ) . He had returned from West Germany to Sri Lanka to manage Hotel Samudra . He was a member of the first batch of CHS , and had graduated in 1969 . In the early 1980s , Wilfred and his family were living in London . He worked at the Dorchester , as the Food &amp; Beverage Controller . A month after our arrival in UK , my wife and I were invited by the Weragoda family to lunch in their home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Chandana , I will help you to get into the Dorchester " Wilfred assured me . <p> The Dorchester is a five-star luxury hotel on Park Lane in London , to the east of Hyde Park . It was within walking distance of the Cumberland Hotel in Marble Arch , where I spent the summer of 1979 as a Management Trainee . The Dorchester had opened in 1931 , and 50 years later , became a listed building . By 1983 , it was generally considered the best five-star hotel in UK and one of the world 's most prestigious and expensive hotels . Throughout its history , the hotel has been closely associated with the rich and famous . <p> Walking into this iconic hotel in 1983 , I was surprised at how well it still retained its 1930s furnishings and ambiance , despite being modernised , on a few occasions . During the Second World War , the strength of its construction gave the hotel the reputation of being one of London 's safest buildings . Leading politicians and military top brass chose it as their London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie stars , rock stars and super models . Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton frequently stayed at the Dorchester throughout the 1960s and 1970s . It was also Michael Jackson 's favourite place to stay in London . <p> By the end of November , 1983 , I became a regular , part-time banquet waiter at the Dorchester . Every Thursday afternoon I left UoS after my last lecture for the week . I dressed in a well-ironed white shirt , black trousers and a pair of black dress shoes for my one-hour bus ride from Guildford to London . I then walked from the Hyde Park Corner straight to work . In the basement of the Dorchester , I put on a blue jacket and a dark blue , bow tie from the uniform room . I loved doing silver service at one of the greatest banquet rooms in UK , every Thursday and Friday . I was proud to be a gentleman , serving ladies and gentlemen who appreciated classy hospitality .

However , sometimes , it can malfunction , which leads to serious medical conditions . If you have some kind of heart , or blood vessel disease , or if you have poor blood flow to your brain , the doctor may recommend that you take a blood thinner . <p> Blood thinners reduce the risk of heart attack , and stroke , by reducing the formation of blood clots within the arteries and veins . The formation of blood clots is a very dangerous situation , because they hinder the flow of blood to critical body organs , like the heart , and the brain . Blood thinners help to retain the blood cells , known as platelets , from clotting . But using blood thinners can be risky in itself , as it can lead to excessive bleeding or blood loss , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than taking artificial blood thinners , it is recommended to induce a natural blood thinning process in the body . <p> According to Ex District Ayurvedic Officer ( DAO ) , Government Himachal Pradesh , Dr Hem Raj Gautam , Ayurveda suggests some blood thinning foods that can help thinning the blood naturally without any chemicals or taking medicines . <p> There are four types of natural blood thinning foods , that ( are ) : - <p> =high in vitamin E , <p> =contain salicylate , <p> =contain natural antibiotics , <p> =contain Omega 3 fatty acids <p> These are some natural alternatives that can substitute the artificial blood thinners : <p> Turmeric <p> Turmeric is an age-old remedy which is known for its several health benefits . It contains a yellow colour active substance known as curcumin , that has anti-inflammatory properties and it works as a natural blood thinner or anticoagulant . Studies in ayurveda suggest taking some quantity of turmeric daily can help maintain the anticoagulant status of the blood . <p> Ginger <p> Ginger is another anti-inflammatory and natural blood thinner . It lowers cholesterol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It works like Aspirin ( which is a synthetic derivative of salicylate ) . Not only in ayurveda , ginger is proven to be a natural blood thinner in modern science , as well . <p> Garlic <p> Garlic is well-known for its medicinal properties and health benefits . It contains a biologically active compound , Allicin . It is used to treat a variety of conditions , including heart disease , common cold infections and certain types of cancers . Several studies in the ayurveda suggest that intake of garlic can significantly lower blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels , and reduce the risk of plaque formations and heart disease . It also prevents the formation of blood clots . Garlic is a strong antioxidant that protects the blood vessels and heart from the harmful effects of free oxygen radicals . <p> Ghee <p> Cows ghee , which is rich in omega-3 fatty acids , is a natural anticoagulant or blood thinner . It is also anti-inflammatory , that is why it improves cardiovascular health . However , it is very important to consume cow ghee in limited quantities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salicylates , that help in natural blood thinning . It also works like aspirin . Consuming black pepper , in limited quantities , or using it as a spice in food , can help lower blood pressure and increase circulation . <p> Cinnamon <p> Cinnamon contains a compound known as coumarin . It is a powerful blood thinning agent . A modern science drug , Warfarin , is also derived from coumarin . Consuming large doses of cinnamon for a long-term , however , can damage the liver . It is thus advised to take only a small amount of cinnamon in your diet . <p> Adding these ingredients in your diet will help to make your blood thinner . However , it is important to perform physical activities . Go for long walks and perform yoga regularly to have better health . While pranayama and meditation are highly recommended for mental health . <h> First Sri Lankan female student to win Bronze medal at IMO <p> Nelushi Vithanachchi is currently a Grade-13 student in the Physical Science stream at Visakha Vidyalaya Colombo . She recently brought glory to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student , from Sri Lanka , to win a Bronze medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad in 2020 . <p> Nelushi 's interest in Mathematics started in Grade-7 when she was selected to the National Pool for the International Mathematics and Science Olympiad ( IMSO ) , organized by the Ministry of Education . Since then , her passion for mathematics has led her to be involved in the field for around five years now and she has taken part in many competitions , including the National Math Olympiad , Sri Lanka Mathematical Competition ( SLMC ) , International Mathematics Competition ( IMC ) and Asian Pacific Mathematics Olympiad ( APMO ) and has represented Sri Lanka at 12 international competitions , including three IMOs , one of at which she made her remarkable achievement of winning a Bronze medal , in 2020 . Speaking about her experience at the IMO , Nelushi says even though the questions presented are not easy , they are very original and can be solved using the most fundamental theorems of Mathematics . She goes on to say the satisfaction of managing to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good experience . Nelushi speaks about her journey at the IMO and says that , " In the normal curriculum , you are penalized for thinking outside the box , but in the Math Olympiad , it 's totally different : there is no specific way to solve the problems , you need to come up with solutions at that moment . " <p> When asked which area of Mathematics she enjoys the most , she says that although she is not very good at it , her favourite area is Combinatorics . She explains that although the concepts are simple and seem intuitive , the applications are very elegant . One such simple concept , she explains , is the Pigeonhole Principle which basically states that , " If n+1 pigeons occupy n pigeonholes then there is some pigeonhole with at least 2 pigeons " . Speaking about how her experience in Mathematics has shaped her , Nelushi states that " Although many students might think this is a waste of time and worry that they might miss other work at school , this is a very good investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . She goes on to explain that attempting such problems has developed her analytical and critical thinking abilities , which has placed her a step ahead in studying science subjects at the Advanced Level . <p> Quite a few individuals have been of great assistance to Nelushi in her mathematics endeavour , including her first teacher , Mr. Nishantha , the teachers who trained her and the team in the earlier days , from the Ministry of Education and later on , from the Sri Lanka Olympiad Mathematics Foundation ( SLOMF ) , Dr. Chanakya Wijeratne , Dr. Dayal Dharmasena , Dr. Kaushika De Silva and Rusiru Gambheera . All of them have been of guidance to her in her journey in Mathematics . Her family , too , has been a pillar of strength all these years , supporting her all throughout . <p> When asked about what advice she would give the youngsters aspiring to follow her footsteps , Nelushi says that the most important advice she would give is to not give up in Mathematics . She says that although one or many more of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should n't discourage you , and that the important thing is to continuously keep trying . Through her own experience , Nelushi goes on to say that there is a significant gender gap at the IMO where less than 10% of participants are female , and from Sri Lanka only three participants have been female students , out of around 90 participants . She encourages girls to take up this challenge , and in her own words , " Do n't leave it just for the boys " . She also states that although Sri Lanka is yet to win a Silver medal , she believes that we are capable of winning one in the near future . <h> Ditch the phone before bed ! 16 tips for a good night 's sleep <p> If your partner snores , and you ca n't cope , despite using ear plugs , find an alternative sleeping space .

Using mindfulness as a relaxation technique can also get us into the right mindset to sleep . <p> * Ensure a conducive sleeping environment with a comfortable bed , mattress and pillows . Your room should also be dark and quiet , with an ideal temperature of 18-22 ? C. <p> * Do n't clock-watch .

@@89945237 <p> It is said that the first lexicographer Samuel Johnson ushered a new orientation to language studies when he articulated his intention to document how English language is actually used in his Dictionary of the English language in 1755 . Previously , it was the grammarians who held sway on any matters of usage or teaching of a language . The grammarians were prescriptivist in orientation . They articulated the norms of the language for handbooks , textbooks , and curriculum , which spelled out what was correct , according to their technical expertise . Lexicographers , on the other hand , claim their expertise as descriptive -- i.e. , documenting how grammar is diverse and changing in society , even when it deviates from what grammarians might find objectionable . This way of classifying their differences would also make us treat grammarians as conservative and lexicographers as progressive . <p> However , things are not so neat . Soon , dictionaries also started to be treated as prescribing norms . When our friends object to our speech and say " But that 's not in the dictionary ! " they are treating the lexicographer as the final arbiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judgements of grammarians were misguided because they treated Latin grammatical properties as the norm for English and other languages , based on Latin 's status as an educated lingua franca at that time . To further complicate the descriptive/prescriptive divide , there are different kinds of dictionaries . While dictionaries that feature semantics , etymology , and phonology are the standard ones and are relatively more descriptive , there are other dictionaries of usage ( such as Merriam Webster 's Concise Dictionary of Usage or The Oxford Dictionary of American Usage and Style ) . These usage dictionaries distinguish between meanings to articulate how the usage might be changing , differ according to context ( i.e. , region or informality ) and relate to style ( written versus conversation ) . In these frankly subjective usage dictionaries , the authors have a strong presence and voice , articulating their own preferences . Their examples and descriptions can be conversational and anecdotal , deviating from the brevity and rigor of generic dictionaries . <p> There 's a new challenge for dictionary makers when English has now become a global lingua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of more than 200 years in many postcolonial communities , as in Sri Lanka . In these communities , English has developed local grammatical and lexical norms that are used by millions of speakers within the countries . Not surprisingly , there are now dictionaries of local English for Australia , Canada , Singapore , Nigeria , and the Bahamas . We are now beyond that point when we can debate whether anything other than British or American English should be accepted as legitimate . The famous Nigerian novelist Chinua Achebe once said that if English is a global language , it should be allowed to spread and diversify . If someone says a global language should be spoken like the British , they probably do n't appreciate the meaning of " global . " <p> That nativized Englishes are rule-governed , meaningful , and shared by millions of people leaves prescriptivists with a losing battle .

Note that at one point even American English was perceived as a deficient slang by British people . It took Daniel Webster 's dictionary-making efforts to fight back against this bias and demonstrate that Americans had their local norms that were systematic . <p> This brief history brings us to the challenges of dictionary makers and language teachers in Sri Lanka . There are a lot of studies on Sri Lankan English now by leading scholars to demonstrate that many local lexical , grammatical , and phonological features are rule-governed . There is even a Dictionary of Sri Lankan English ( published by Michael Meyler in 2007 ) . However , when does a mistake become a norm ? When does a deviation become regularized to be called Sri Lankan English ? That takes a complex social , historical , and political process : i.e. , social -- many people start using this " deviation " as a norm and it becomes widespread ; historical -- over a long period of time such usage becomes patterned , regularized , and systematized ; political -- there is a policy or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local norms . Once these processes occur , trying to stop such language change is like the story of King Canute trying to stop the waves with his mere presence ( as once argued by the renowned languist Bernard Spolsky ) . In fact , Samuel Johnson himself wrote in his introduction to the first dictionary : " They that have frequent intercourse with strangers , to whom they endeavour to accommodate themselves , must in time learn a mingled dialect , like the jargon which serves the traffickers on the Mediterranean and Indian coasts . This will not always be confined to the exchange , the warehouse , or the port , but will be communicated by degrees to other ranks of the people , and be at last incorporated with the current speech . " He conceded that norms would change through the diversity of social interactions . However , since not all changes gain acceptance and normativity , there is value in conversations about which of them are acceptable or worth preservation . Textbooks , handbooks , dictionaries , and language teachers play no small role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's dictionary has the subtitle : " Raising Alarm Bells on Sri Lankan English " in the cover page . As we can see , a strong motivation for him to publish his usage dictionary is what he perceives as deviations from the British English . Though the title does n't announce itself as a dictionary , the main section in his book ( Part 2 ) is titled " The Dictionary Section . " Part 1 introduces some grammatical terms which readers might find useful to understand the meanings elucidated in the dictionary section . The author 's preface is 14 pages long and gives useful information on his motivations for writing this book . He says that this book evolves from his experience teaching English to Tamil students in the Baldaeus Theological College . He has also focused on English corrections on his students ' writing while working as an Engineering lecturer at Peradeniya and the Jaffna University College . In this sense , this dictionary emerges from his practical experiences of observing the typical mistakes of Tamil students . He is also wise to target the dictionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the book to illustrate the points or identify interference from the first language in the use of English . The dictionary features alphabetically organized words to explain differences between similar sounding terms , mistaken usage , fresh local coinages , and specialized registers . The book also features exercises to help readers distinguish words or identify the mistakes in local usage . <p> It is clear from the preface that Hoole was schooled in British English , both in Christian schools in Sri Lanka and during his graduate studies in the UK . He has had opportunities to be exposed to the norms of British English through social networks , education , and publications . He also describes the books he read as a child and dictionaries that accompanied him into graduate education , such as H. W. Fowler 's A Dictionary of Modern English Usage ( Oxford , 1927 ) . These background details indicate the preferences of the author in the spirit of full disclosure . Referring to errors in the local news media , he states that " reading Sri Lankan English is dangerous to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in that process of reading bad English " ( p. xxiv ) . He also narrates anecdotes of students from an elite school in Colombo using that ubiquitous Sri Lankanism " bugger " to refer to one 's father as " Pater Bugger " , and criticizes such usage . <p> It is revealing that Hoole spent much of his life with usage dictionaries such as Fowler 's . His publication is also a usage and style based dictionary , and not descriptive in orientation . The entries are chosen from words featuring frequent errors or confusions to Sri Lankans . In many of the entries , the author offers helpful clarifications . In cases of certain variants , he is reasonable in allowing Sri Lankanisms in less formal contexts , although his preference is for the more formal variant . See , for example , the entries in page 122 : <p> All of us ate to our full except for my mother who felt a little tired . <p> Both expressions are said to be correct . But are they ? By the Loquacity Rule , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a pleonasm , and is therefore not the preferred form . <p> Eyes , I saw with my own eyes <p> It is needless to say " with my own eyes " in the expression <p> I saw with my own eyes . <p> We have a pleonasm in the words " with my own eyes , " because we always see with our own eyes and not other people 's eyes . This is clearly from the Tamil expression , Tamil example given here . <p> It is an expression that will , however , stay with us arguing that it is used for emphasis or to say that what the speaker saw refers to a first hand report . Be that as it may , " I saw " is usually good enough . <p> We can see the Engineering/Math professor in Hoole preferring more economical expressions . In the second example , however , he pragmatically recognizes that the use of " with my own eyes " has become part of local usage and concedes that it can be used for emphasis . It is laudable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionable words to allow for diversity . <p> But in some cases , he is a bit too strict . In page 142 , he has the following entry : <p> How about " I come there " ? <p> This phrase in the heading of this section , and illiterate phrases like it , take the place of the correct <p> How about my coming there ? <p> How about has to be followed by a noun : How about this ? Or How about that ? <p> It is possible that Prof. Hoole might be overlooking the simple distinction between conversational/informal and written/formal usage here . Conversational English grammar does n't follow written syntax in even native speaker communities . <p> Hoole also becomes a bit too prescriptive in page 237 where he chides the common practice of referring to the newspaper as " paper . " He mentions that " paper " refers to the material in which the news is printed , and therefore can not be used to stand for the newspaper . However , the electronic version of the New York Times announces on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for readers to click . Similarly , in his treatment of phrases like Thank you very much and Thank you so much , Hoole explains : <p> However , to me , " so much " implies a comparison like pointing to some rice on a plate and saying I eat only " so much : " Therefore , <p> " Thank you so much " seems to thank a person a certain amount without saying what that amount is . <p> I therefore strongly recommend " Thank you very much . " <p> However , even the usage dictionaries of the British and Americans are more tolerant on this one . They generally state that " Thank you very much " is slightly more formal than " thank you so much " . <p> Others feel that " very " is a superlative word used to add more emphasis to the appreciation . Therefore , it is not preferred by more reserved speakers who reduce the emphasis with the use of " so . " <p> These points are meant to demonstrate how complex usage is , especially at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to slight Hoole 's painstaking effort in publishing this book . <p> One has to appreciate his generosity in going outside his field , motivated by a sincere interest in helping local students master English . That the book derives from his teaching , and is still used by him in the theology school , demonstrates that it is not a mere academic exercise . Unlike many books that end unread in bookshelves , this book will be used by teachers and students in Sri Lanka . When there is a dearth of publications from international publishers , compounded now by the unfair currency exchange and inflation , and the lack of an English language publisher in Jaffna , this locally produced book is one that many learners will be able to own -- and even treat it as their daily toilet reading ( the way Hoole himself read dictionaries when he was growing up , as he describes in his preface ) . Students can treat the disparity between British English and Sri Lankan English as not mutually exclusive but choices for different contexts . While Sri Lankan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who interact with foreign tourists , business partners , or educational collaborators will appreciate a familiarity with British English . Globalization increasingly calls for " code switching " into different varieties , as speakers shuttle between different communities and contexts where diverse Englishes are used . Therefore , teachers who use this book can remind students of the contexts where the British and formal norms will be useful , and compare the pronouncements in the dictionary with variations in other communities and contexts . Thus Hoole 's dictionary can generate constructive discussions and lessons about language norms . <h> Is there a third way for social equity markets ? <p> From a philosophical point of view , Islamic financial markets are actually risk-sharing stock markets with moral issues defined by the shariah .

Government is the problem " . Together with former UK Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , he launched the global shift towards " Free Market Fundamentalism " . This was a right-wing reaction to the endless fiscal deficits and inflation generated by left-wing Keynesian economists ' preference for government intervention to solve market failures . <p> By the 1990s , former US President Bill Clinton and UK Premier Tony Blair pioneered the neoliberal middle way , adopting free market ideas of privatization , whilst preaching kinder , gentler social protection . Instead of solving government failure , they ended up with failure of both market and government with rising inequality , climate warming , populism and social polarisation . Neoliberal free market ideas in effect pushed bigger government captured by big business and huge vested interests . This sparked forces of polarization since the 1 percent benefited more than the 99 percent . <p> Guardian <p> columnist George Monbiot argued that the failure of neoliberalism ended with fascism that wants to go back to old times . US President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autocracy sounds suspiciously like Big Business Democrats trying to look green and inclusive , versus MAGA ( Make America Great Again ) Republicans who seem like macho white supremacists to many non-Americans . Economics or politics is supposed to be about why , what and for whom ? But behind that set of questions is Who acts to deliver What the people want ? <p> Thus , the Trumpian call is for the private sector or Big Business to make change , whereas the Bernie Sanders solution is for more government to do the job . Is finance serving the real sector , or is it eating up the real economy ? When government is too powerful and captured by the 1 percent , how different is that from an unelected bureaucracy ruling the 99 percent ? Central banks just print money to enable the politicians to buy the votes . Once elected , everything is forgotten on promises till the next election . <p> Top-down political structures can not work when the feedback from the bottom-up is missing . Worse , welfare programmes end up not reaching the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution showed in the Covid pandemic . So , what is the alternative to Big Business or Big Government ? Historically , we had the social institutions to deal with problems of excessive state or markets -- the importance of mutual , cooperative and community charitable work . <p> When the social contract is broken , in the sense that the state is no longer functioning to deliver essential public goods and services or failing to protect the masses from raw capitalist greed , then communities organise to help themselves . Social enterprises are non-government or not-for-profit organisations that try to provide public goods not provided by the state or Big Business . Some of the best public goods , such as changes in global public health , education and the Green Revolution , were financed by charity organisations , like the Rockefeller Foundation . <p> Today , the Gates Foundation is a big funder of social change . Driven by the young , social enterprises are beginning to make waves in the areas of climate action , gender , poverty and social injustices . But their impact has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard business strategist Michael Porter was one of the first to ask why corporate philanthropy has not worked to fund more social enterprise work . <p> The answer is that CEOs were not focused or incentivised to push corporate social responsibility . Today , as investors expect CEOs to deliver on ESG ( environmental , social and governance ) goals , CEOs still face the problem of how to allocate corporate philanthropy resources . The hard reality is that the best talents for organization , knowhow and access to funding are with the for-profit corporations . <p> Their employees may be best positioned in their spare time to help micro-small medium-enterprises ( MSMEs ) become more effective in delivering social projects that enable real change at the frontiers of climate action or social justice . Social finance is defined as the network of processes , decisions and institutions that finance production of public goods with participation of the private sector . But that network does not exist because MSMEs often are too small and weak to access the talent , funding and branding/trust that donors ( state , business or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for raising public funding already exists in the form of stock markets , which have the approval , listing , trading information , registration , clearing , settlement and payment mechanisms . They simply do not operate for non-profit social enterprises . Similarly , private equity/venture ( PE/VC ) capital firms already have the technology , knowhow and funding to " coach " good companies towards listing or raising capital for profit . <p> So why ca n't there be PE/VC firms that use their portfolio of MSMEs to decide which have for profit potential , and which can be groomed best in the not-for-profit social objectives ? In short , markets like Hong Kong , Singapore and Kuala Lumpur have the opportunity to create Social Equity Markets . <p> From a philosophical point of view , Islamic financial markets are actually risk-sharing stock markets with moral issues defined by the shariah . So far , few Muslim countries have used stock markets to make social change . A third way , therefore , is already technically feasible . All it takes is some courage to think and act out-of-the-box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a sky gazer for more than four decades , a habit which started in my school days . As an amateur astronomer , stargazing usually starts from the backyard , with or without any supporting instruments like binoculars or telescopes . Identifications of whatever celestial objects become the first task , with the help of elders who are relaxing in the backyard invariably after supper . <p> As one develops a keen interest in astronomy , reading and studying astronomy with advanced telescopes become a reality . I have passed many stages in life , and enjoy my retirement life devoting ample time to my hobbies of which astronomy becomes my favourite subject . <p> It is well known that the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST or WEBB ) is in operation with full potential , and incredible photos sent by JWST of distant galaxies could be seen on the NASA website as well as on public media.In order to explore the universe , various projects have been launched by many countries , of which NASA and the European space agency have contributed , by placing complex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known that the JWST is the most advanced telescope in operation since July 2022 . It is equipped with the most sophisticated instruments with state-of-the-art technologies , and surpasses the capabilities of the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST or HUBBLE ) , which was launched in 1990 . <p> JWST was launched in December 2021 on an Ariane 5 rocket and travelled 1.6 million kilometres in space , to reach its final orbit around the sun , which takes one year to complete one revolution . Whereas its predecessor , HST was launched using Space Shuttle Discovery and placed in a geocentric orbit around the Earth with , an altitude of 547 kilometres at an elevation angle of 28 degrees with the equator . HST takes about 95 minutes to go around the earth and completes 15 orbits per day . <p> HST is equipped with instruments to probe the composition of the atmosphere of our solar system and extrasolar planets , normally referred to as exoplanets . HUBBLE can capture ultraviolet , visible , and near-infrared wavelengths of light . Although near-infrared radiation is detectable by the human eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human eye . As the Hubble Space Telescope operates above 547 kilometres above Earth , Hubble can capture visible and infrared spectra with minimum interference . <p> In order to obtain a high degree of accuracy , space observations should be carried out outside the earth 's atmosphere , where obstruction to visible light and infrared light is minimal . Mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange has discovered five locations with respect to the sun and earth , where observatories could be parked for various astronomical activities . They are known as Lagrange points and are denoted as L1 , L2 , L3 , L4 and L5. in honour of him . <p> In these special locations , gravitational and rotational forces cancel each other out , creating ample parking space for telescopes and observatories . Any small mass object placed at the Lagrange point , moves in sync with the Earth , although they are in two different orbits around the sun . <p> The L2 point is advantageous in many ways for astronomy . The JWST can communicate continuously with Earth while providing a clear view into deep space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minimum , as Sun and Earth are behind the telescope . Sun , Earth and L2 points are on a straight line keeping L2 at 151.5 million kilometres away from the Sun and 1.5 million kilometres away from the Earth . To stay in this position minimum station-keeping manoeuvres have to be performed occasionally , which reduces the propellant requirement considerably . As a result , the lifetime of the JWST is increased proportionately . <p> It took about twenty years to develop the most powerful telescope , costing 10 billion US dollars , in collaboration with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , the European Space Agency ( ESA ) , and the Canadian Space Agency ( CSA ) . In addition to the main collaborators , there were about 15 other countries involved and contributed in many ways to making this mission a reality . This astronomical telescope was named as James Webb Space Telescope in honour of James Edwin Webb , who served NASA as an administrator during many critical space missions . <p> JWST design exceeds all the capabilities of its predecessor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by observing events that have taken place at a distance of 13.6 billion light-years away from Earth . In astronomy , distance is measured in light years . Light-year is the distance that light travels in a year at a speed of 300,000 kilometres per second , which is equivalent to 9.46 trillion kilometres . <p> Telescopes can go back in time . Looking out in space is looking back in time . Light takes time to travel vast distances in space to reach us . The light from the moon , which is about 390,000 kilometres away from us , takes 1.3 seconds to reach us meaning that we see the moon 1.3 seconds ago . Similarly , light takes about eight minutes to travel from the Sun , which is about 150 million kilometres away from the Earth . Inferring from that , what we see is the Sun about eight minutes ago . When the distances are in the order of billions , light takes years to reach the earth . <p> JWST is equipped with a ) Mid-Infrared Instrument ( MIRI ) , b ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( NIRSpec ) , d ) Fine Guidance Sensor ( FGS ) , e ) Near-Infrared Imager and Slitless Spectrograph(NIRISS) . These equipment facilitate measurements of Redshift and Spectroscopy of various objects in the universe such as stars , galaxies , etc . As these instruments monitor the infrared region of the electromagnetic spectrum , all equipment has to be cryogenically cooled to avoid interference within equipment and from outside . The operating temperature is set to minus 266 degrees celsius , which is closer to absolute zero . Absolute zero is minus 273.15 degrees celsius , and the lowest possible temperature to reach . Extremely low operating temperature indicates the unprecedented sensitivity of its infrared equipment . <p> NASA claims that the sensitivity of infrared equipment onboard the WEBB could detect the heat of a bumblebee at a distance from the moon . Further , details of a small coin of one-centimetre size could be seen at a distance of 40 kilometres away . <p> In astronomy , redshift has been classified into three categories namely ; a ) Gravitational , b ) Doppler , and c ) Cosmological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from an observer . In general , redshift is defined as an apparent increase in the wavelength ( or decrease in frequency ) of light waves , received from a moving source away from an observer . This is due to the stretching of the wavelength towards the red boundary of the spectrum . <p> Conversely , when the moving source of light is approaching the observer , a decrease in the wavelength ( or increase in frequency ) occurs . This is due to apparent compression of wavelength towards the blue boundary of the spectrum known as Blueshift . <p> Also , when a star rotates , one edge of the star is moving towards us relative to its centre , while the other edge is moving away . As a result , light from one edge of a star is slightly red-shifted , while light from the other edge is slightly blue-shifted . Astronomers can use these two shifts in order to calculate how fast a star is rotating . The same approach can be used to calculate how fast a galaxy is rotating . By evaluating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ object could be calculated . Conversely , Blueshift provides parameters of distance and velocity of an approaching object . <p> Astronomical spectroscopy is mainly concerned with the analysis of objects such as stars , planets , nebulas , and galaxies in space . It is done by splitting the received infrared spectrum into its various wavelength components . The spectrum patterns of a star can be compared with known spectrum patterns of hydrogen , oxygen , carbon and other elements to determine the physical and chemical composition of the star . <p> The media has shown magnificent and colourful photos of various stars , galaxies and nebulas released by NASA . Anybody would wonder about the process of producing such stunning photos from faraway galaxies many light years away from the Earth . These images are captured using infrared cameras and the spectrum is split into many different frequency bands using filters . Different colours are assigned to each frequency band during processing to obtain spectacular photos . A similar process is being used in digital colour cameras in processing visible light photos . <p> James Webb Space Telescope is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 year period .

This is to draw societal attention to the important issue . A few days back , the National Crime Records Bureau ( NCRB ) , released data for 2021 , and reported 1,64,033 suicides in India , with a rate of 12 per 1,00,000 population , an increase by about seven per cent , compared to 2020 . <p> By Saraswathi Tenagi and Vijaykumar Harbishettar <p> ' Creating Hope Through Action ' is the triennial theme for the years 2021- 23 for the World Suicide Prevention Day observed every year , on 10 September . This is to draw societal attention to the important issue . A few days back , the National Crime Records Bureau ( NCRB ) , released data for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rate of 12 per 1,00,000 population , an increase by about seven percent compared to 2020 . <p> These figures miss out those unnatural deaths which are still under investigation , or inconclusive . The NCRB report finds that five states put together -- namely Maharashtra , Tamil Nadu , Madhya Pradesh , West Bengal , and Karnataka -- accounted cent of the suicides in India . On the other hand , the most populous Uttar Pradesh reported a lower percentage . Furthermore , analysis by the NCRB mentions causes such as family problems/ personal issues , illness , love affairs , abuse , violence , isolation , and alcohol/drug use . <p> The age group 18- 45 is the most vulnerable as around 66 per cent of suicides are reported in this age range . Let us try and understand the impact of suicides on those kith and kin who are left behind . Any kind of death affects families resulting in a process called grief . It takes at least a year before it starts to subside . But in case of death by suicide , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and violent . Talking about suicide , especially the mode of death , can cause lot of distress in anyone , including the person reporting it . The immediate family members and close friends may develop guilt , start to question themselves with many ' what ifs ' and whether they could have saved the person . Close ones may also have to face police investigation and media scrutiny . There is a need to support suicide survivors ; especially some family members such as mother , father , sister and even spouse may get affected deeply and can show signs of mental breakdown . Trauma can haunt some mothers or spouses for many years . <p> The healthcare system and community need to support them as mass/family suicides are slowly on the rise . The theme ' Creating hope through action ' is a reminder that there is an alternative to ending life by suicide and the objective is to inspire and instil confidence . <p> Through their actions , no matter how big or small , everyone can create hope for those who are struggling . Some people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least asked them once . Warning bells should ring if you see a recent change in behaviour -- a gloomy appearance , mood swings , frequent expression of death or dying , talking about going far away , expressing hopelessness , unusual fear , not making eye contact , not being open , appearing depressed , not engaging , unable to resolve a problem and experiencing chronic stress . <p> Along with trying to engage the person , leaving work aside , it is recommended that one should ask directly if she or he is having suicidal thoughts or plans , or if the person is thinking about dying . Many people have the notion that by enquiring directly about suicide , they could increase the risk by instilling the idea into the person 's mind . But it is the other way around . Asking directly about suicide gives a good chance to save them . The person may actually feel better after this so-called emotional ventilation . <p> If still in crisis , it is best to take them to the nearest Emergency room or if during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary across individuals . Sometimes it can be impulsive . However , many actions are planned , with elaborate preparations made before the final act including the date and mode of death . Some may even say their goodbyes indirectly . <p> These should be seen as hints . Many would have visited their doctors , friends or even been hospitalised before the act . For every suicide reported , there are at least 25 suicide attempts . Attempts increase risk of suicide . Many suicide attempts may go unrecorded , and some may not get assessed , though many hospitals insist on the person seeing a psychiatrist . <p> The individual may not have disclosed previous attempts , leaving many around unaware . Individuals are different , so the same approach may not work for all . Persons with suicidal thoughts may feel trapped , and that they have no other option . <p> There is a quote by Magic Johnson , ' all the kids need is just a little help , a little hope and somebody ( who ) believes in them ' . Many may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be heard without being judged . Such small talk can create a sense of connectedness and thus some hope . It can actually save lives . While many can cope with the adversities in life , a few are vulnerable . <p> There are many factors like family problems , personality style , environmental factors , traumatic childhood events , and mental health conditions that contribute to the vulnerability . At the same time , protective factors like support from family and friends , problem-solving skills , decision-making skills , rational and critical thinking and resilience would help the person to overcome suicidal thoughts . Suicide is a complex interaction between these triggering factors , vulnerabilities and protective factors . Focus should be on enhancing the protective factors and minimising the vulnerability factors . Stigma or a belief that they can get discriminated against , and being labelled as a weak-minded person may act as a barrier to seeking help . <p> Listening to those sharing their experience of having overcome the problems , and how they changed their approach is one way to educate the public .

He has talked about the challenges he faced , while trying to focus on playing in India and the Ashes series . <p> Impact of his dad 's death by suicide and building his career in the cricket community , where many knew his dad , and eventually managing to carry on his dad 's legacy , have lessons to offer to the many families going through the loss of loved ones through suicide .

Make changes to the lifestyle . Nurture old hobbies or cultivate new ones that give pleasure . Try learning new skills . Spend time with friends and family . If work is causing stress , discuss this with colleagues , and ask for a break . Get involved in social and community activities , including volunteering . <p> Try spending time with nature , visit places and spend time in a calm environment .

On the other hand , in an opera called " The Magic Flute " , a suicidal character named Papageno is reminded by some boys of alternative ways to resolve the problem . Such is the influence of the media on people who are in crisis . <p> If a person searches for ' ways to commit suicide ' on search engines , the first few hits will now show ' crisis helpline ' or ' help is available ' .

The prize is awarded to an individual for outstanding contributions in affirming life 's spiritual dimension , whether through insight , discovery , or practical works , based on the decision of a panel of distinguished judges from various academic disciplines and religious traditions -- Hindus , Christians , Jews , Buddhists , Muslims and atheists . <p> In 1978 she was the recipient of the " Balzan Prize " for Humanity , Peace and Fraternity among People 's , awarded by the International Balzan Prize Foundation , and in 1979 received the " Patronal Medal " awarded jointly by The Catholic University of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conception for her distinguished service in the advancement of Marian devotion , theology , and general appreciation of the place of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary in the life of the Catholic Church . " <p> It was in 1979 that Mother Teresa became a household name throughout the world when she was awarded the " Nobel Peace Prize " for her respect for the individual human being , for his or her dignity and innate value . However , she sent word to the organizers that her acceptance of the prize was on the condition that every cent would be spent on the poorest of the poor . She refused the conventional ceremonial banquet given to laureates , and asked that the cost be diverted to the poor in Calcutta . <p> She raised eyebrows at the Awards Ceremony held on the December 10 , 1979 when she started her acceptance speech with the words -- let us pray the prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi . She had made sure that a copy of the prayer was placed on the seat of all those present . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On receiving the Nobel Peace Prize Mother Teresa was asked -- " what can we do to promote world peace ? " Her answer was simple -- " Go home and love your family " <p> The very next year , in 1980 , she was awarded the highest Indian Award -- ' The Bharat Ratna ' and in 1982 conferred with the " Companion of the Order of Australia " which is the highest general award of Australia . In 1983 Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II invested her with the highest British Award , the prestigious " Order of Merit " . <p> The Presidential Medal of Freedom awarded by the President of the United States of America for especially meritorious contribution to world peace was made to Mother Teresa in 1985 by President Ronald Reagan . The award is made to individuals selected by the President or recommended to him by the Distinguished Civilian Service Awards Board . <p> In 1995 she was invested by the Republic of Croatia with " The Grand Order of Queen Jelena " . The Order is named for Croatian Queen Jelena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Mother of the Croatian Kingdom , the Poor and Widowed Mothers . <p> She was once again honoured by the United States of America in 1997 when she was awarded with the " U.S. Congress Gold Medal " in recognition of her outstanding and enduring contributions through humanitarian and charitable activities , Recipient of the " John F. Kennedy Award " for her untiring and dedicated work towards humanity in 1971 , and the " 12th UNESCO Education for Peace Prize " in 1992 , and in 1993 received the First " Rajiv Gandhi National Sadbhavana Award " . <p> When I met this ' Mother of Mercy ' when she visited Sri Lanka -- the few words exchanged with that wrinkled faced individual known as the ' Angel of the Slums ' inspired and awed me . Her self determination , her trust in the unfailing providence of God for her work . Awards and publicity meant nothing to her as her parting words to me was -- " we do n't ' work for glory or for money , we work for GOD . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics or language . It was a complete surrender and dedication to the sole cause of caring for the unwanted , unloved and uncared for in society -- the poorest of the poor , as could be witnessed from some incidents in her life which have been overlooked.In 1982 , Mother Teresa persuaded Israelis and Palestinians , who were in the midst of a skirmish , to cease fire long enough to rescue 37 mentally handicapped patients from a besieged hospital in Beirut . <p> When the walls of Eastern Europe collapsed , she expanded her efforts to communist countries that had rejected her , embarking on dozens of projects . Mother Teresa also traveled to help the hungry in Ethiopia , radiation victims at Chernobyl , and earthquake victims in Armenia . In 1991 , Mother Teresa returned for the first time to her native region and opened a Missionaries of Charity Brothers home in Tirana , Albania . <p> During her lifetime and even after her death , Mother Teresa was consistently listed by Gallup 's List of Widely Admired People to be the single most widely admired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " most admired person of the 20th century . " Notably , Mother Teresa out-polled all other volunteered answers by a wide margin , and was in first place in all major demographic categories except the very young . <p> Former U.N . Secretary-General Javier P ? rez de Cu ? llar once said : " She is the United Nations . She is peace in the world . " Nawaz Sharif , former Prime Minister of Pakistan said that Mother Teresa was " A rare and unique individual who lived long for higher purposes . Her life-long devotion to the care of the poor , the sick , and the disadvantaged was one of the highest examples of service to humanity . " <p> The process of documenting the life and virtues of a holy man or woman can not begin until five years after death . This waiting period ensures that the person has an enduring reputation for sanctity among the faithful . However , Pope John Paul II put Mother Teresa on the fast track for Sainthood when he permitted the beatification examination process to begin just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beatified her after the Vatican recognized the healing miracle of an Indian woman 's prayers to Mother Teresa , which caused her brain tumors to disappear . <p> As we celebrate the life that touched so many hearts of the downtrodden , the sick , the suffering , the destitute , the heart broken -- the life of Mother Teresa who returned to her Creator on September 5 , 1997 -- let us say the prayer of peace that St. Fancis of Assis prayed , the opening prayer of Mother Teresa when she accepted the Nobel Peace Prize on December 10 , 1979 , in the Aula of the University of Oslo in Norway : <p> " Lord , make me a channel of your peace , that where there is hatred , I may bring love ; that where there is wrong , I may bring the spirit of forgiveness ; that where there is discord , I may bring harmony ; that where there is error , I may bring truth ; that where there is doubt , I may bring faith ; that where there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are shadows , I may bring light ; that where there is sadness , I may bring joy . <p> Lord , grant that I may seek rather to comfort than to be comforted ; to understand , than to be understood ; to love , than to be loved . For it is by forgetting self , that one finds . It is by forgiving that one is forgiven . It is by dying , that one awakens to eternal life . Amen . " <h> Italy : The Hard Right nears power <p> There 's an election in Italy next Sunday , almost exactly 100 years after Benito Mussolini 's ' blackshirts ' marched on Rome and brought the first fascist dictator to power.Giorgia Meloni , the hard-right populist politician who is likely to win that election , rejects any comparison with that ugly past . The party she leads , Brothers of Italy , has some ' nostalgic ' neo-fascists in its ranks , but she prefers to compare it to Britain 's post-Brexit Conservative Party or the US Republican Party as rebranded by Donald Trump . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain 's Conservatives , her hatred of immigrants , gays and Muslims with the US Republicans , and her truculent nationalism with both those parties . She is also militantly Christian , and she dabbles in ' Great Replacement ' paranoia . And just like them , she wages a non-stop culture war . <p> " There is no middle ground possible , " Meloni told a rally last June . " Today , the secular left and radical Islam are menacing our roots ... Either say yes , or say no . Yes to the natural family , no to the LGBT lobbies . Yes to the universality of the Cross , no to Islamist violence . Yes to secure borders , no to mass immigration . " <p> The brutal simplicity of these slogans works just as well with lower-income , poorly educated Italians as it does with the same sort of people in ' heartland ' America or ' red wall ' Britain . The goal is to distract them from the fact that their populist heroes really govern in favour of the rich ( which explains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giorgia Meloni lies , too , but when you compare her to populist peers like Viktor Orb ? n in Hungary , Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil , and Donald Trump in the United States , she actually does n't seem that bad . <p> Like them , she has no permanent political principles , just a bundle of cynical techniques for attracting distressed and desperate voters . But she needed to shift towards the centre ground to build her Brothers of Italy party up from 4% of the vote in the 2018 election to a predicted 25% this time -- so that 's what she did . <p> She now claims to support both the European Union and the NATO alliance . Even before the Russian invasion of Ukraine , she avoided the pro-Putin stance that was common on the radical right in both Europe and the United States . With the fragile Italian economy teetering on the brink of recession , she is promising good behaviour to Brussels . <p> So not a complete disaster , then . Continued access to the EU 's Covid recovery fund , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , should keep Meloni from straying too far from orthodox economics . If the EU withholds those funds , her prospects of remaining in power would be slim . <p> Brothers of Italy will probably be the largest Italian party after this election , but with only 25-30% of the vote she will not be able to govern alone . The problem is that the two parties she will need to make a coalition with , Silvio Berlusconi 's Forza Italia ! ( Go Italy ! ) and Matteo Salvini 's Lega ( The League ) , are direct rivals of her own party . <p> Berlusconi at 85 is still a big political player thanks to his huge media empire . Salvini is willing to bring any coalition down if it improves his chances of being prime minister in a different one . Both men will be trying to claw back the popular support that Meloni 's Brothers of Italy has stolen from them , so there will be tears before bedtime . <p> In normal times , their chosen tactic would be to undermine Meloni 's party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the EU . With the Russian energy blockade promising a hard time for Europe economically this winter , however , the obvious strategy for far-right parties is to advocate a softer line on Putin 's war in Ukraine . <p> Both men have been Putin fanboys in the past . Berlusconi sees the Russian dictator as a personal friend , and Salvini called him " the best statesman on Earth " three years ago . Now Salvini soft-pedals his admiration for Putin , but he demands an end to the sanctions against Russia because they are allegedly hurting Italy more than Russia . <p> Meloni ca n't afford to play that game , and the expected post-election coalition of far-right parties is unlikely to last very long . She has sufficiently detoxified herself that she could lead a coalition with other parties instead , and that may well happen.Post-fascist parties in power in Italy are still bad news , but the damage to the European Union and the NATO alliance can probably be contained . <h> Why do we go to the IMF ? <p> THE resumption of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external payments crisis , has reignited passions . As most countrymen wrestle with the question of whether or not the Fund is a tool of neocolonialism to keep countries like Pakistan sedated and subservient , what is lost in the debate is why we always wind up at its door . Let 's take a peek . <p> Energy is the relevant sector to get this conversation going as it constitutes the largest portion of our import bill . Economic growth and economic mobility depend on energy , whose demand rises as economies expand ( along with other factors like population growth ) . A large portion of Pakistan 's entire energy edifice is dependent on imported fuels , given our meagre internal energy sources . <p> Aside from raw material , the machines and equipment underpinning our power production are also imported -- from turbines at hydel power plants to equipment at LNG , coal and furnace oil plants . So , not only are we importing raw materials , we are also importing services to sustain them over the long term . All these have to be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-partisan economic plan <p> Here , let me address a misconception , that ' indigenous ' sources of power will take care of the matter . Think again . These ca n't be utilised without outside help . Decades after the construction of the Mangla and Tarbela dams , we still need foreign experts to solve critical issues related to them . Consider the Neelum-Jhelum run-of-the-river hydel power project , which has extracted gazillions from Pakistanis under the label of ' surcharge ' . Meant to utilise an ' indigenous ' source of energy , hardly a year later it is down due to a ' fault ' that required the services of foreign experts because our own ' experts ' could not identify it . ( It meant inflicting losses in the billions on consumers due to power production from expensive , imported fuel ) . <p> We are importing not only raw materials , but also the services to sustain them over the long term.The case of other indigenous sources is somewhat similar : we can not build nuclear power plants without foreign help ; we had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use Thar 's indigenous coal , etc . <p> This is not a revelation : there has been recognition for long that Pakistan creates problems for itself that , in turn , generate a demand for dollars , which we are usually short of . The Economic Survey of 1980-81 , for example , recognised that long-gestation projects under the public investment garb was the main reason for saddling Pakistan with an external debt of $9bn . Yet , PSDPs refuse to budge ! It 's still about grand projects like roads that incentivise an increase in vehicular traffic , in turn creating more demand for dollar imports , as the main components of the products of our highly protected car manufacturers are imported . <p> Let 's move to the role of public regulations . A few of endless examples will suffice . We have this infinite fascination with horizontal sprawls , complemented by ' housing societies ' in the public and private sector . Aside from cities becoming administratively difficult to govern , a result of these endless sprawls is the need for more vehicles , leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There has , arguably , never been an estimate of the increase in energy imports that accrued to the country due to this endless expansion . But if ever such an exercise is carried out , the results will make other import-related issues -- like IPPs -- look puny . <p> These endless sprawls have resulted in millions of acres of fertile agricultural land being gobbled up over time . Given that more than 100 agricultural ' research ' institutes are producing little or nothing in terms of higher land and crop productivity , complemented by a rapidly expanding population , there is little choice but to import food staples to meet our food requirements -- so much for being an ' agricultural country ' . <p> Another good example : the illogical fascination with uniform pricing . In terms of the ultimately imported energy products , it leads to waste . Pakistan 's fast-depleting natural gas reserves are an apt illustration of this phenomenon . First , it was Balochistan , and now it is Sindh whose natural gas reserves are dwindling fast . There has , historically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because they have been under-priced , primarily due to uniform prices that are way below the market prices . Had the pricing been market-based from the start , there might not have arisen the need for importing expensive LNG or coal , which severely taxes our dollar earnings . <p> Moving away from big-ticket items , even the micro level does not inspire much confidence . Consider the common office chair . Some time back , they were in short supply , carrying a premium . That 's because they are merely ' assembled ' here from imported parts . Most other products fare little better . <p> To summarise , Pakistan 's economic edifice is built in a manner that , unless we import , our economic activity will come to a standstill . And as GDP inches up , we end up importing more -- to the extent that our dollar earnings will never be enough to pay for our imports . So whether it 's the IMF or anyone else , Pakistan will sooner or later knock at their door for dollars . <p> How to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the Holy Grail , God save us from that predicament . Our earlier experiments only ended up producing rent-seeking seths and the likes of the car industry that sells low-quality tin for millions -- the promised ' localisation ' never happened . For a start , enough of brick-and-mortar ' plans ' that create more liabilities than assets , besides raising pampered generations of subsidy-sucking businessmen under the banner of ' infant industry ' and ' qaumi mufaad ' ( national interest ) . Neither do we need NOCs or hundreds of regulatory agencies to scare away foreign and domestic investors . <p> The way out of our dollar cash-flow troubles lies in greater global integration and trade , promoting competition and developing our human capital base . For a change , take the government out of business and let Schumpeterian creative destruction prevail on a level playing field . ( The Dawn/ANN ) <h> National Day of Saudi Arabia -- 23rd September 2022 <p> It is my pleasure to present Saudi Arabia 's Vision for the future . It is an ambitious yet achievable blueprint , which expresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengths and capabilities . All success stories start with a vision , and successful visions are based on strong pillars.The first pillar of our vision is our status as the heart of the Arab and Islamic worlds . We recognise that Allah the Almighty has bestowed on our lands a gift more precious than oil . Our Kingdom is the Land of the Two Holy Mosques , the most sacred sites on earth , and the direction of the Kaaba ( Qibla ) to which more than a billion Muslims turn at prayer . <p> The second pillar of our vision is our determination to become a global investment powerhouse . Our nation holds strong investment capabilities , which we will harness to stimulate our economy and diversify our revenues.The third pillar is transforming our unique strategic location into a global hub connecting three continents , Asia , Europe and Africa . Our geographic position between key global waterways , makes the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia an epicenter of trade and the gateway to the world . <p> Our country is rich in its natural resources . We are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , phosphate , uranium , and many other valuable minerals are found beneath our lands . But our real wealth lies in the ambition of our people and the potential of our younger generation . They are our nation 's pride and the architects of our future . We will never forget how , under tougher circumstances than today , our nation was forged by collective determination when the late King Abdulaziz Al-Saud -- may Allah bless his soul -- united the Kingdom . Our people will amaze the world again . <p> We are confident about the Kingdom 's future . With all the blessings Allah has bestowed on our nation , we can not help but be optimistic about the decades ahead . We ponder what lies over the horizon rather than worrying about what could be lost . <p> The future of the Kingdom , my dear brothers and sisters , is one of huge promise and great potential , God willing . Our precious country deserves the best . Therefore , we will expand and further develop our talents and capacity . We will do our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit the Holy Sites . <p> We are determined to reinforce and diversify the capabilities of our economy , turning our key strengths into enabling tools for a fully diversified future . As such , we will transform Aramco from an oil producing company into a global industrial conglomerate . We will transform the Public Investment Fund into the world 's largest sovereign wealth fund . We will encourage our major corporations to expand across borders and take their rightful place in global markets . As we continue to give our army the best possible machinery and equipment , we plan to manufacture half of our military needs within the Kingdom to create more job opportunities for citizens and keep more resources in our country . <p> We will expand the variety of digital services to reduce delays and cut tedious bureaucracy . We will immediately adopt wide-ranging transparency and accountability reforms and , through the body set up to measure the performance of government agencies , hold them accountable for any shortcomings . We will be transparent and open about our failures as well as our successes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this comes from the directive of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques , King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud , may Allah protect him , who ordered us to plan for a future that fulfills your ambitions and your aspirations.In line with his instructions , we will work tirelessly from today to build a better tomorrow for you , your children , and your children 's children . <p> Our ambition is for the long term . It goes beyond replenishing sources of income that have weakened or preserving what we have already achieved . We are determined to build a thriving country in which all citizens can fulfill their dreams , hopes and ambitions . Therefore , we will not rest until our nation is a leader in providing opportunities for all through education and training , and high quality services such as employment initiatives , health , housing , and entertainment . <p> We commit ourselves to providing world class government services which effectively and efficiently meet the needs of our citizens . Together we will continue building a better country , fulfilling our dream of prosperity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men and women . We will not allow our country ever to be at the mercy of a commodity price volatility or external markets . <p> We have all the means to achieve our dreams and ambitions . There are no excuses for us to stand still or move backwards.Our Vision is a strong , thriving , and stable Saudi Arabia that provides opportunity for all . Our Vision is a tolerant country with Islam as its constitution and moderation as its method . We will welcome qualified individuals from all over the world and will respect those who have come to join our journey and our success . <p> We intend to provide better opportunities for partnerships with the private sector through the three pillars : our position as the heart of the Arab and Islamic worlds , our leading investment capabilities , and our strategic geographical position . We will improve the business environment , so that our economy grows and flourishes , driving healthier employment opportunities for citizens and long-term prosperity for all . This promise is built on cooperation and on mutual responsibility . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We will begin immediately delivering the overarching plans and programmes we have set out . Together , with the help of Allah , we can strengthen the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia 's position as a great nation about which we should all feel an immense pride . <p> His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Crown Prince , Deputy Prime Minister , and Chairman of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs . <p> History &amp; Heritage <p> Saudi Arabia has long occupied an important role at the center of the Islamic and Arab worlds . Located at the heart of three continents , the Kingdom has served as an important ancient trade route and a vital link connecting East and West . <p> It also has a unique heritage landscape that has developed over the centuries , including 6 UNESCO World Heritage sites . <p> People &amp; Culture <p> Saudi Arabia has a rich culture shaped by the diversity of its people , which has formed the basis of its cultural identity .

Thus , strengthening the role of the private sector in the economy and creating the necessary environment for sustainable growth . 
@@90016240 <h> The 51 sessions of the Geneva-based United Nations Human Rights Council is underway . Sri Lanka is again in the focus with Western powers and their lackeys targeting the war-winning Sri Lanka military . <h> Successive Sri Lankan governments , including the incumbent administration , failed to address core issues . Their failure to counter accusations that over 40,000 Tamil civilians died in the hands of the military is inexcusable . The Foreign and Defence Ministries , without further delay , should review Sri Lanka 's strategy or fall victim to unceasing Western machinations against the country for militarily crushing the LTTE , against their advice . <p> By Shamindra Ferdinando <p> Lankadeepa journalist Ratnapala Gamage had been with the late General Rohan de S. Daluwatte , Chief of Defence Staff ( CDS ) , in Sept. 2001 at the latter 's Colombo office when the one-time Army Commander ( May 1996-Dec 1998 ) was informed of the killing of Vaithilingam Sornalingam alias ' Colonel ' Shankar . <p> At the time of his death the 51-year-old former Air Canada employee commanded the ' Air Wing ' and ' Marine Division ' of the LTTE . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CDS as Daluwatte had to rush for a meeting which was also to be attended by the then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga . <p> Ex-Lankadeepa journalist Gamage , now domiciled in Switzerland , dealt with the high profile ' hit ' carried out by the LRRP ( Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol ) aka DPU ( Deep Penetration Unit ) in the eastern part of the Vanni region . The raid carried out so deep , within the LTTE-held territory , sent shock waves through not only the enemy 's rank and file but the Colombo-based diplomatic community as well . Gamage in his maiden book ' Rana Bimaka Panhinda ' ( Notes from the battlefield ) discussed the war that was brought to a successful conclusion in May 2009 , with the focus on his experiences and visits to operational areas . The launch of ' Rana Bimaka Panhinda ' took place at the J.R . Jayewardene Centre on Sept 13 with the presence of Lankadeepa Editor Siri Ranasinghe . The gathering was told a Tamil translation of the book would be available later this year . Gamage had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participated in that particular operation on the **25;2126;TOOLONG road , east of Kandy-Jaffna A9 hi-way on the morning of Sept. 26 , 2001 . Gamage reveals his failed bid to convince one of those Long Rangers to give him one of the four pictures he had of the ' hit ' on Shankar , one of Prabhakaran 's closest associates . Gamage explained as to why the soldier declined to give him a photograph . At the time the LRRP unit triggered the claymore mine that blasted the heavily guarded vehicle , the attackers had believed Velupillai Prabhakaran was on the move in it . Operations behind enemy lines that developed over the years involved elite men , including Muslim military personnel and ex-LTTE cadres . During the Eelam War IV , the Air Force , on more than one occasion , evacuated several teams of Long Rangers who had got trapped in enemy territory . Did such highly successful operations carried out behind enemy lines prompt Prabhakaran to return to the negotiating table in Feb 2002 ? The Norwegians finalized the one-sided Ceasefire Agreement ( CFA ) that included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Due to an oversight on the part of Gamage , the unprecedented crisis caused by the raid on a safe house at Athurugiriya Millennium City housing scheme , operated by those conducting operations behind enemy lines , did n't receive the attention it deserved . The UNP government crippled the clandestine operation in spite of assurances given by no less a person than the then Army Commander Lt. Gen. Lionel Balagalle that LRRP/DPU did n't target UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe . <p> Interestingly , Gamage was n't at the launch of his book . The ex-Lankadeepa defence correspondent addressed the gathering from his home at Aarburg , Switzerland at the onset of the event attended by several retired military officers . Retired Maj. Gen. Sanath Karunaratne , who led the defence of the Elephant Pass base way back in July 1991 , in his then capacity as a Major , was among the guests at the launch . Gamage discussed the heroic defence of Elephant Pass base and the largest ever sea-borne operation ' Balavegaya ' launched to save those trapped therein . <p> The beleaguered men of the sixth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's command held the strategic base till seaborne ' Balavegaya ' troops fought their way in from the Mullaitivu coast to break the siege . ' Balavegaya ' involved 10,000 men and was considered the largest action undertaken before ' Operation Riviresa ' ( Oct-Dec 1995 ) that brought Jaffna and its suburbs under government control . <p> If not for the successful suicide attack on an advancing armour-plated LTTE bulldozer carried out by Lance Corporal Gamini Kularatne , the garrison could have probably fallen before the Army launched Operation ' Balavegaya . ' Kularatne received Sri Lanka 's highest gallantry award ' Parama Weera Vibhushana ' for the supreme sacrifice he made on the battlefield . Kularatne was the first recipient of the decoration . <p> Referring to the fall of Kokavil detachment south of Elephant Pass in June 1990 , Gamage quite rightly blamed the military top brass for the shortcomings . The second recipient of the highest decoration was Captain Saliya Upul Aladeniya also of the Sinha Regiment . Aladeniya commanded besieged Kokavil detachment established for the protection of the Rupavahini transmission tower there . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road north of Vavuniya up to Elephant Pass should be examined against the backdrop of the then President , late Ranasinghe Premadasa 's foolish attempts to reach a consensus with the LTTE by even transferring truckloads of arms to it . In June 1990 the government lost control of the A 9 road north of Vavuniya up to Elephant Pass . That stretch of the road overland route remained inaccessible to the government until the Army systematically liberated it in the final phases of the war in January 2009 . It would be pertinent to mention that though 6 SR valiantly held Elephant Pass base in 1991 with less than a battalion of troops , a Division plus troops could n't repulse multiple LTTE attacks on Yakachchi and Elephant Pass base in late April 2000 . The 54 Division abandoned the base and retreated in all directions . The LTTE killed well over 1000 officers and men . The then Army Commander Lt. Gen. Balagalle made a vain attempt to portray the humiliating Elephant Pass defeat as a strategic withdrawal . Many fighting personnel also perished as they ran out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source at Yakachchi <p> Keith Noyahr 's commendation among the well-wishers who could n't attend the book launch but chose to issue a recorded statement commending Gamage 's work was Keith Noyahr , the Deputy Editor of now defunct ' The Nation . Noyahr recalled his close association with Gamage during the conflict and when he earlier worked at the Daily Mirror , the sister paper of Lankadeepa . Noyahr fled the country following his abduction and subsequent release in May 2008 . The then Mahinda Rajapaksa administration was accused of targeting ' The Nation ' journalist over his column ' Military Matters ' that questioned the conduct of war-winning Army Commander the then Lt. Gen. Sarath Fonseka . Unidentified persons abducted Noyahr on the night of May 22 , 2008 in the wake of a provocative piece titled ' An Army is not its Commander 's private fiefdom ' on May 11 , 2008 . Noyahr wrote the column under the pseudonym ' Senapathi . ' Fearing Noyahr 's fate would also befall him , Gamage quietly left the country with his only son in Dec , 2008 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political changes never returned to the country . The then joint Opposition comprising UNP-JVP-TNA-SLMC-CWC backing Fonseka at the 2010 presidential election must have been quite a shock for those who criticised Fonseka ' s controversial strategies , that however brought about the unbelievable crushing of the LTTE in the battlefield , which many a pundit claimed was not within Sri Lanka 's military capability . <p> Gamage declared in his foreword , his close working relationship with the then Daily Mirror Editor Lalith Alahakoon ( having joined The Island in June , 1987 , the writer worked under Alahakoon who was the Night News Editor at that time ) and his Deputy at the Daily Mirror Noyahr . <p> Acknowledging his weekly contribution to the Sunday Lankadeepa greatly enhanced his capacity , Gamage appreciated the opportunity and support extended by both Alahakoon and Noyahr for him to do a weekly article that dealt with ' Military Matters . According to Gamage , it had been a joint effort by him and Noyahr . By the time , Noyahr was targeted ' Military Matters ' was penned by Noyahr for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late 1993 , Gamage moved overseas as Fonseka 's Army was making headway on the Vanni east front . Close on the heels of Gamage 's departure on Dec 18 , 2008 , the 59 Division brought Mullaitivu , once considered impregnable , under its control .

The Yahapalana government ( 2015-2019 ) , too , sold the adjoining land ) . <p> Brigadier Perera had been the head of one of the three teams that were assigned the task of eliminating Rohana Wijeweera . Then DIG Premadasa Udugampola ( He passed away in January 2019 ) , the late Maj. Gen. Lakshman Algama ( killed in LTTE suicide blast in Dec 2001 ) and the then Colonel Janaka Perera had been in charge of the teams that eventually hunted down the JVP leadership . Gamage recounted his stimulating conversation with Perera while sipping wine . Gamage was there on the invitation of the officer to share a meal with him .

What was the assurance the celebrated the army officer gave Wijeweera soon after he placed a pistol at the JVP leader 's head ? Where did Janaka Perera detain Wijeweera ? Who accompanied the then Army Chief Cecil Waidyaratne when he visited Wijeweera ? Gamage answered all these questions and also revealed why Janaka Perera accompanied the journalist to meet a soothsayer in Anuradhapura . This was years before Gnana Akka 's entry into the scene . Gamage 's reportage of LTTE leader Prabhakaran 's press conference in the Vanni on April 10 , 2002 captures the attention of the readers . How a police intelligence officer infiltrated the LTTE defences on the pretext of being a journalist from Colombo assigned to cover the much-touted media briefing and unprecedented security measures that were in place therein to prevent an attempt on Prabhakaran 's life was certainly exciting . Gamage discussed how the LTTE turned the media briefing to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victories . The stunning attack on **25;2153;TOOLONG base established in the early 90s to intercept boat movements across the Jaffna lagoon spurred the LTTE . Those directly responsible for the failure were n't punished though Army Chief Lt. Gen. Waidyaratne resigned after having accepted responsibility . The LTTE smashed the base in early Nov 1993 . <p> A visit to Vanni <p> Among other issues addressed by Gamage , perhaps one of the most important was the deficiency in the infantry . The ex-Lankadeepa journalist underscored the extreme difficulties experienced by the Army for want of sufficient men under arms . Gamage dealt with the issue against the backdrop of a visit organized by the Army for a group of Colombo-based journalists , including photographers to visit Army lines in the Vanni during Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga 's presidency . Ravi Ladduwahetti had been on The Island editorial at that time and was among those were taken there . Veteran journalist Ladduwahetti who had served many English newspapers passed away last week . He was 64 years old . The then Divaina Defence correspondent late Sirimevan Kasthuriarachchi and former UNL photographer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kasthuriarachchi , whose brother , an officer of the Vijayaba Infantry Regiment ( VIR ) died in the July 1996 Mullaitivu battle , had covered the conflict extensively and was one of those who always joined such arranged visits . <p> Like many other journalists Gamage , too , experienced flying with bodies of military personnel killed in action , when he was returning to Colombo from Palaly . The writer experienced the same on more than one occasion over the years . <p> Gamage shared his experience in flying to Palaly after the LTTE brought down two Avros with heat-seeking missiles on consecutive days in late April 1995 . Among those who perished in missile attacks were three Lake House journalists . Gamage was lucky to avoid a Sam 7 hit as in spite of speaking to the then Commander of the Air Force he could n't secure a seat on an ill-fated Avro that flew out from Ratmalana air base . Instead , the Commander had offered him the opportunity to board the flight at the Anuradhapura air base when the Avro touched down there . Perhaps the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force did n't take the risk of flying there the day after the mysterious destruction of an Avro while taking off from Palaly . <p> There had been several other books on the conflict since the eradication of the LTTE 's conventional military capability . The books authored by our Permanent Representative in Geneva C.A. Chadraprema ( Gota 's War ) and the late Subramaniam Sivakamy alias ' Col ' Thamilini ( ' Thiyunu Asipathaka Sevana Yata ' /In the Shadow of a Sharp Sword ) are must read . Sinhala translation of ' Oru Koorvaalin Nizhalil ' , life story of high ranking LTTE cadre , ' Col ' Thamilini , took place at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute ( SLFI ) on May 13 , 2016 . Oru Koorvaalin Nizhalil ' was launched on March 19 , 2016 , in Kilinochchi , the one-time LTTE bastion . <p> Gamage 's coverage of UNP presidential candidate Gamini Dissanayake 's assassination should be examined taking into consideration his assessment that the LTTE did so to facilitate Kumaratunga 's victory .

The UN-backed training programme meant to tackle a wide range of crimes taking place via sea routes got underway in early May 2016 . Among the participants were 07 male and 01 female officers of the Maldivian Coast Guard as well as 01 male and 01 female officers of the Maldivian Ministry of Fisheries ( pic courtesy SLN ) <p> Wartime Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa is one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Gajaba Regiment veteran did n't mince his words when he met Norwegian officials on April 06 , 2006 in the run-up to the closure of the Mavil-aru sluice gates in the third week of July 2006 . According to a NorwegianForeign Ministry document in the public domain : " On April 06 , 2006 , Hanssen-Bauer and Brattskar had a tense meeting with Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa . In response to a question about whether the ethnic and political problems in Sri Lanka could be solved by military means , Gotabaya answers , ' yes ' . The LTTE launched Eelam War IV in August 2006 . Within two years and 10 months the Sri Lankan military brought the war to a successful end . <p> By Shamindra Ferdinando <p> Colombo-based Norwegian diplomats burnt their fingers by seeking information from the Maldivian High Commission in Colombo as regards an Indian fishing craft ( Sri Krishna ) that had been commandeered by Sea Tigers and was intercepted and sunk by the Maldivian Coast Guard in May 2007 . <p> The Norwegian Embassy reached the Maldivian HC soon after the Maldivians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before while fishing in Indian waters . <p> The Island last week dealt with the Norwegian decision to close down its diplomatic mission in Colombo next year , two decades after Oslo arranged a highly controversial secret Ceasefire Agreement ( CFA ) ( Not even the then President Chandrika Kumaratunga was aware of it till it had been signed ) between the Government of Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) . The US , EU , Japan and Norway functioned as Co-Chairs to the peace process . <p> The Norwegian effort received the backing of New Delhi though the Indians were skeptical . Nevertheless , they fully cooperated . <p> The LTTE quit the negotiating table in April 2003 , one year and three months after the signing of the CFA . But , the Norwegians went out of their way to appease the LTTE regardless of the consequences . The diplomatic intervention made on behalf of the Tigers involved in the incident in the Maldivian waters is a case in point . In a way , the LTTE and its sidekick the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance the peace process , whether sincere or not . Instead , the LTTE exploited the Norwegian initiative so much that the negotiating process finally collapsed . Their strategy undermined the then Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe , who meekly towed the Norwegian line . On the other hand , their actions bolstered the nationalist groups and those opposed to the Norwegian questionable initiatives . <p> Dissolution of Parliament and calling for fresh parliamentary elections in April 2004 should be examined against the backdrop of utterly irresponsible LTTE strategy and its appeasers . However , the elections allowed the TNA , with the LTTE openly stuffing ballot boxes in areas it controlled , to secure the lion 's share of seats in the then amalgamated Northern and Eastern Provinces . Peace Co-Chair EU in its Election Observation report declared that the TNA colluded with the LTTE . Unfortunately , Co-Chairs , including the EU did n't take the report into consideration . <p> The incident in the Maldivian waters should be examined basically against the backdrop of the overall deterioration of the situation for want of clear guidelines to handle the peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being asked by the LTTE with a nod from a powerful Western interest . We must also note that Norwegian peacemaking efforts in Palestine with obvious American backing that brought about the Oslo Accord with much promise fared even worse with the Palestinians continuing to be humiliated and pasted by the Israelis almost on a daily basis . Where the hell is UNHRC ? No war crimes there on your watch Michelle Bachelet ? At least the UN should have given her a Nelsonian eye patch . <p> The Norwegian mission here definitely cleared its move with Oslo . However , by the time they got in touch with the Maldivian HC , Male had cleared Sri Lankan Navy intelligence to interrogate the apprehended LTTE cadres in the custody of the Maldivian . The Island reported the Norwegian intervention in its May 26 , 2007 edition . The LTTE had used the ill-fated vessel to transfer weapons from its floating armories to Wanni and was on such a mission when the Maldivians intervened . <p> At the time the Maldivians sank Sri Krishna , Tamil Nadu had accused the Sri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nadu as well as India never expected was another country intervening in the clandestine LTTE arms smuggling operation . <p> The Maldivian Coast Guard made the intervention on May 16 , 2007 . The Maldivian Coast Guard engaged a vessel carrying the Sri Lankan flag after the latter fired at a Maldivian fishing craft . <p> Interestingly , there had been some Indian naval personnel onboard the Maldivian craft engaged in the operation against the Tiger commandeered vessel . <p> The LTTE would have never expected its cadres who commandeered the vessel to surrender as they are noted for biting their cyanide vials to prevent capture . The Maldivians however rescued five Tigers who jumped overboard from the sinking vessel , subsequently identified as Sri Krishna . The rescued men told the Maldivians and their Indian instructors ( The Indians were helping the Maldivian Coast Guard personnel to familiarize with CG vessel Huravee , gifted by New Delhi to Male ) the circumstances under which they were found in Maldivian waters , while engaged in transferring armaments from a floating warehouse . <p> Sri Krishna 's skipper , Simon Soza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Sea Tigers admitted that the remaining Indians were being held in a camp in the Vanni ( Maldives sinks Indian craft hijacked by Sea Tigers -- The Island May 18 , 2007 ) . <p> The sinking of the Sri Krishna was the second high profile incident involving an Indian trained terrorist group in the Maldivian territory . The raid on Male during the first week of November , 1988 by sea borne PLOTE ( People 's Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ) terrorists at the behest of a Colombo-based Maldivian businessman , Abdulla Luthufee was the first . Interestingly , the Indian Navy sank MV Progress Light commandeered by Luthufee 's mercenaries while trying to reach Sri Lankan waters . <p> Former Foreign Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris , who led the then UNP government 's negotiating team for talks with the LTTE in 2002-2003 period , appreciated the role played by the Scandinavian country . <p> GL , Palihakkara , Salter , Jehan comment <p> Mark Salter <p> Prof. Peiris , now a leading member in one of the SLPP rebel groups said : " The Norwegian government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , long before its association with the peace process . In particular , there had been substantial Norwegian support for infrastructure development , especially rural roads in the South of Sri Lanka , in addition to assistance in the fisheries sector , human resources development and community work of various kinds . <p> In the aftermath of its facilitation role in the peace process in the late 1990s and early in the present century , the government of Norway commissioned an independent evaluation of their role here with a view to ascertaining its strengths and weaknesses . I believe this study led to more useful insights . <p> We regret the decision to close down the embassy in Colombo for the time being , but understand that it is part of a worldwide evaluation process . <p> The government of Norway has announced its commitment to and support for the people of Sri Lanka will continue . We appreciate this assurance . " <p> In response to The Island query regarding the Norwegian pull out , Executive Director of the National Peace Council ( NPC ) , Dr. Jehan Perera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Norwegian Embassy from Sri Lanka is a big loss to us . This is a time when we need all the assistance and friendship we can from the international community , especially those who have helped us in the past . The Ambassador has stated that Norway will continue to provide Sri Lanka with assistance and will engage in development activities . However , Sri Lanka will lose out because remote support is not the same as in-country support where Norwegian diplomats and embassy staff are in constant interaction with Sri Lankan people . We also need to acknowledge the huge investment Norway made to help us resolve our ethnic war through negotiations and a political solution . They supported organisations such as the National Peace Council to build bridges between the communities , which we continue to do . Norwegian support for peace-building work got reduced after the failure of the ceasefire agreement and peace process . NPC did not receive Norwegian financial support over the past decade . But the capacity for peace-building work that Norway supported us to achieve , and which continues to remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regret very much the closure of their embassy . " <p> The author of ' To End a Civil War : Norway 's Peace Engagement in Sri Lanka ' Mark Salter said : " The closure of the Norwegian Embassy in Colombo ends an important chapter in relations between the two countries . At the joint invitation of the government and the LTTE leadership , in 1999-2000 Oslo accepted the role of peace facilitator between the two parties . To their great credit , over the following decade the Norwegians stuck at their appointed ' peace diplomacy ' task through thick and thin -- possibly the most sustained instance of external engagement with a peace process to date . And this including when , in the aftermath of the return to war in autumn 2006 and the Ceasefire Agreement ( CFA ) the Norwegians brokered in 2002 looked increasingly dead in the water , they became the subject of increasing domestic attacks , notably by both the government itself and Sinhala nationalists who tarred them with the brush of ' White Tigers ' . <p> As we know , theirs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messenger , however , is only as good as the message they carry -- a fact that often seems completely lost on the legions of Lankan critics of the Norwegian 's ' messenger ' role . As Erik Solheim and others have long since acknowledged , Oslo undoubtedly made mistakes along the way -- notably the failure to foster an initial bipartisan Sinhala political consensus in support of the peace process . Ultimately , however , the failure of the peace process comes down to the failure in their different ways of both parties to continue to engage seriously with the process itself . " <p> For those who are genuinely interested in knowing the Norwegian-led process , perusal of Salter 's work is a must . Former BBC journalist and analyst , Mark Salter who launched ' To End a Civil War : Norway 's Peace Engagement in Sri Lanka ' in Colombo several years after Norway released ' Pawns of Peace : Evaluation of Norwegian peace efforts in Sri Lanka ( 1997-2009 ) ' meticulously addressed the issues . Salter 's work help the readers to understand what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve what was expected . Chr . Michelsen Institute and School of Oriental and African Studies , University of London , jointly put out that report . The team responsible for the official version comprised Gunnar S ? rb ? , Jonathan Goodhand , Bart Klem , Ada Elisabeth Nissen and Hilde Selbervik . The Wikileaks revelations should be of pivotal importance for those keen to know the developments here . <p> One-time Foreign Secretary H.M.G.S. Palihakkara who served as the Governor of the Northern Province during the Yahapalana administration , has sent us the following statement in response to a query posed to him : " It does not look like a singular decision by one country , at least optics-wise , since both countries announced the intended closures within a space of a few months this year , Sri Lanka being the first in April and Norway following in September . Embassy closing of course is news one can hardly celebrate esp . in bilateral diplomacy . The notion that reciprocity is the first lesson in diplomacy still has some currency . And that factor may have weighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speculating on that wo n't help either side . <p> What is of promise is that both countries have been quick to emphasize that the decisions are derived from ' structural ' , rather than bilateral considerations and will not impinge on relations . <p> Sri Lanka has further qualified closure as ' temporary ' while Norway has recommitted itself to ' further the constructive and friendly relations ' . It would be reasonable to say these relations have endured many decades and vicissitudes including a complicated and even controversial ' peace process ' with the LTTE through a vain facilitation effort by Norway . <p> The Norwegian envoy in Colombo , Ambassador Trine J ? ranli Eskedal in her media comments has quite professionally put these positives at a higher notch saying ' We will continue to maintain our warm bilateral relations with Sri Lanka and development assistance will also continue . ' So the ' distancing ' signified by these closures at first glance , may be more apparent than real . The fact remains that SL has benefitted from several billions of NKR bilateral ODA for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extensive rural development in the South . Since modern diplomacy is often about building on what you have rather than imagining the ideal , it is up to both sides to do just that-build on the positives . " <p> Whatever the views expressed by interested parties regarding the planned Norwegian closure of its embassy here the fact remains the move is detrimental to Sri Lanka , especially at a time the country is experiencing its worst post-independence economic crisis . Norway spent lavishly on its Sri Lanka project . Civil society groups benefited immensely . A simmering dispute between the Norwegians and the late Dr. Kumar Rupesinghe , one of the largest beneficiaries of the Norwegian funding highlighted the controversial relationship between the embassy and the civil society . The Norwegians ended up squandering their taxpayers ' money even on the LTTE and its front organizations . That is the undeniable truth . <p> But , perhaps their biggest mistake that had been influenced by interested parties here was the assertion as acknowledged in ' Pawns of Peace : Evaluation of Norwegian peace efforts in Sri Lanka ( 1997-2009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Norwegians as well as other Co- Chairs operated on the premise the Sri Lankan military could n't match the LTTE 's strategy or the fighting will . Those who benefited from the Norwegian largesse propagated that myth wherever possible like their Western pay masters . That assessment was proved wrong in May 2009 when a soldier shot Velupillai Prabhakaran on his head on the banks of the Nanthikadal lagoon. ? <h> Oslo pullout , new Geneva resolution and origins of terrorism ( part 1 ) <p> " Norway will never forget how LTTE influenced the worst ever act of terrorism on its soil . Far right Norwegian Andres Breivik , 32 , responsible for the July 22 , 2011 massacre of 77 persons , mostly teenagers in two successive attacks in Norway was inspired by the LTTE . A few hours before , Breivik went on the rampage , he made reference to the LTTE 's eviction of the Muslim community from the Northern Province in Oct/Nov 1990 , in his so-called manifesto released online . The following are the references ( 1 ) Pro-Sri Lanka ( supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Page 1235 ) and ( 2 ) Fourth Generation War is normally characterized by a ' stateless ' entity fighting a state or regime ( the EUSSR ) . Fighting can be physically such as the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) to use a modern example . ( Page 1479 ) . Perhaps , Sri Lanka should ask for an international inquiry . One of Sri Lanka 's foremost diplomats Jayantha Dhanapala appearing before the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission ( LLRC ) in 2010 stressed the accountability on the part of foreign governments . The then Mahinda Rajapaksa government probably blinded by unfathomable victory was not bothered . It only sought political advantage of the developments even at the expense of Sri Lanka . " <p> By Shamindra Ferdinando <p> Norway on Sept 09 announced that its diplomatic mission in Colombo will be closed at the end of July 2023 . The Norwegian Embassy in Colombo declared that this would be among five diplomatic missions to be closed as part of the planned structural reforms in its network of diplomatic missions . The Embassy did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established a diplomatic mission here in 1996 during Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga 's presidency . The setting up of that mission was primarily to facilitate negotiations between Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) . The establishment of the Colombo mission took place in the wake of the military consolidating its position in the Jaffna peninsula . Jaffna town was brought under government control in early Dec 1995 . <p> The signing of the one-sided Ceasefire Agreement ( CFA ) in Feb 2002 can be considered the highpoint of the Norwegian intervention here that allowed the LTTE to expand its sphere of influence . Who really drafted the CFA ? Did the then top Norwegian negotiator Erik Solheim draft it as he claimed in an interview with the late Kumar Rupesinghe ? Whatever the circumstances , the CFA certainly did n't take into consideration concerns of the military . <p> However , the Norwegian Embassy made available the Norwegian Foreign Ministry press release that dealt with the proposed closure of some diplomatic missions . Accordingly , the diplomatic missions in Slovakia , Kosovo and Sri Lanka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Houston , Texas , are to be closed . It would be pertinent to mention that Norway established a diplomatic mission in Slovakia in Sept. 2004 , just a year after Slovakia moved out of the Czechoslovakian Federation and in Kosovo four years later . NATO member Norway participated in large scale air offensive to drive out Serbian forces from Kosovo-Norway set up Embassy office in Madagascar in 2004 and the Houston ' mission ' back in 1977 . <p> The closure of the Norwegian Embassy in Colombo should be also examined against the backdrop of cash- strapped Sri Lanka closing down our missions in Norway and Iraq and the Consulate General in Sydney , Australia , early this year . <p> Norway has thrown its weight behind a new six-page draft resolution before the Geneva-based United Nations Human Rights Council , ( UNHRC ) handed in by the UK . The UK leads Sri Lanka Core Chairs and the resolution is widely regarded as the strongest since the successful conclusion of the war against the LTTE in May 2009 . <p> A vote on this new resolution is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commenced on Sept 12 . <p> The resolution is co-sponsored by the United States , Canada , Germany , Malawi , Montenegro , and North Macedonia . Sri Lanka 's rejection of the latest resolution is irrelevant . Therefore , another heavy defeat at the UNHRC is quite possible . But , Sri Lanka conveniently failed so far to set the record straight in Geneva and at the United Nations General Assembly in New York . Successive governments allowed Geneva to dictate terms by failing to present Sri Lanka 's case . The incumbent government is no exception . <p> Oslo has announced the termination of its mission here over a decade after the eradication of the LTTE 's conventional military capability . Had the Western sinister project succeeded , Sri Lanka would have been divided on ethnic lines . The CFA allowed the LTTE freedom to operate in the Northern and Eastern Province as it did away with restrictions placed on Tiger armed cadres entering government-held areas . The Norwegian led Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission ( SLMM ) that was empowered to oversee the Ceasefire Agreement , continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CFA violations by the Tigers . <p> In the wake of the then treacherous UNP government exposing the covert intelligence operation carried out by the Directorate of Military Intelligence ( DMI ) behind enemy lines , the LTTE went after its operatives with a vengeance . The Norwegians went to the extent of providing funding to the LTTE and its front organizations , much to the dismay of those who really believed in a genuine effort to bring peace . <p> The Norwegian funding continued even after the LTTE quit the negotiating table in late April 2003 . There had never been a proper examination of the Norwegian intervention here though Norway funded the costly joint study undertaken by Gunnar Sorbo of the Chr . Michelsens Institute ( CMI ) and Jonathan Goodhand of the School of Oriental and African Studies ( SOAS ) . Their report titled Pawns of Peace : Evaluation of Norwegian peace efforts in Sri Lanka 1997-2009 , released in September 2011 made specific reference to the SLMM , having accessibility to best possible intelligence . <p> High profile Oslo project <p> According to the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treaty Organization ( NATO ) and India 's premier intelligence agency , the Research and Analysis Wing ( RAW ) . <p> Thanks to NATO and India , those running the peace process could n't have been unaware of the LTTE 's rapid preparations for war . Norway received NATO support as a member of the military alliance ( Pawns of Peace : Evaluation of Norwegian peace efforts in Sri Lanka 1997-2009 , page 100 ) . <p> The Norwegian study quoted the then SLMM head as having said that RAW only reached them through informal channels , therefore they could n't be fully trusted . " They were n't giving it to us to be nice . We would always ask ourselves why they want us to know this . Intelligence provided by NATO only confirmed what they already knew " , the SLMM chief was quoted as having said . <p> The RAW destabilized Sri Lanka to such an extent , beginning with the election of J.R . Jayewardene , because of his overt tilt to the West , Sri Lanka was compelled to transform its ceremonial army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been pursuing hostile agenda against us in Geneva quite conveniently forget how major powers ruined Sri Lanka by sponsoring , particularly the LTTE terrorism , and also giving them a free hand . Can the so-called leader of the Core Group , the UK , absolve itself of the responsibility for promoting terrorism here ? The UK allowed LTTE 's International Secretariat to propagate the war against a Commonwealth country from London , granted citizenship to the late Anton Balasingham who advised Prabhakaran on terror project and even allowed secret talks therein between the LTTE theoretician and top Norwegian diplomats in the wake of the then Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar 's assassination by the Tigers . The UK has also given refuge to his wife Adele despite her having nourished Tamil young girls to take up violence . She was photographed donning cyanide capsules around the necks of such girls as they passed out after training . <p> The LTTE assassinated Kadirgamar on Aug 12 , 2005 , while the CFA , supervised by Scandinavian countries , was in operation . On April 25 , 2006 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Army headquarters . On Oct 01 , 2006 , the LTTE made an abortive bid to assassinate Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa near Piththala junction , Kollupitiya . The Norwegians and Peace Co-Chairs comprising the US , Japan and the EU remained inactive . The LTTE continued to advance its project . The CFA did n't prevent the LTTE from unloading ship loads of armaments or carrying out high profile assassinations . <p> The Norwegian role should be examined taking into consideration the Japanese involvement in the peace initiative . <p> Dr. John Gooneratne , who had been with the government Peace Secretariat from its inception in January 2002 to May 2006 , explained serious shortcomings in the CFA over a year after the conclusion of the conflict in May 2009 . Appearing before the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission ( LLRC ) on September 15 , 2010 , Dr. Gooneratne revealed that four key matters proposed by the government were n't included in the CFA . ( A ) There had been no reference to the requirement to use the CFA to pave the way for talks to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prohibition of unlawful importation of arms , ammunition and equipment was not included . ( C ) Although the LTTE was allowed to engage in ' political work ' in government controlled areas , other political parties were n't given access to areas under the LTTE control ( D ) Forcible conscription of personnel to the LTTE 's fighting cadre , too , was not added to the list of prohibited activities . <p> Dr. Gooneratne , a veteran career diplomat , faulted the then UNP government as well as the Norwegians for being hasty in their approach . Dr. Gooneratne said : " What lessons can we learn from this experience ? Firstly , negotiating on such security and military matters should have been a more inclusive format than by just the party in power . Secondly , in negotiating documents , such as the CFA , thoroughness should be the standard , and not just the speed . " <p> The CFA created an environment that allowed the LTTE to exploit the situation . Defence Secretary General Kamal Gunaratne in his book ' Road to Nanthikadal ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LTTE abused and misused it . Sri Lanka 's Permanent Representative in Geneva , former The Island columnist and prolific writer C.A. Chandraprema , in his book ' Gota 's War ' , too , dealt with the Norwegian role here . But , those who really desired to know about the Norwegian project should definitely peruse ' Peaceful Intervention in Intra-State Conflicts : Norwegian Involvement in the Sri Lankan Peace Process . ' <p> The Norwegians had been careless , extremely reckless . There can not be a better example than importing radio equipment in agreement with the then government that bent backwards to appease the LTTE . The then Norwegian Ambassador Jon Westborg earned the wrath of some Opposition political parties as well as Sinhala nationalist groups for directly playing a role . The political leadership tried to underscore the importation of state-of-the-art radio equipment by the Norwegian Embassy in agreement with the Peace Secretariat though all knew it was a political decision . CFA time Defence Secretary and one of those who negotiated with the LTTE Austin Fernando 's ' My Belly is White ' launched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a must read . <p> UNHRC , GTF silent on India 's accountability <p> The Islandin its Sept 19 , 2022 edition ( both print and online ) carried a statement issued by the UK-based Global Tamil Forum ( GTF ) . The TNA 's partner called for a strong new resolution on Sri Lanka that reflected the recommendations of the High Commissioner 's Report . Having demanded punitive action against Sri Lanka , the GTF thanked India for backing their cause at the UNHRC . The GTF and the UNHRC owed an explanation whether they wanted to leave India out of the proposed investigations . <p> Can accountability pertaining to the Sri Lanka conflict be examined by turning a blind eye to Indian intervention here , ranging from sponsoring of terrorist groups , atrocities perpetrated by the Indian Army that prompted the LTTE to assassinate former Indian PM Rajiv Gandhi and the sea borne raid on the Maldives carried out by Indian trained PLOTE terrorists and the killing of TULF 's Jaffna MPs by TELO at the behest of RAW ? <p> The UN Human Rights High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comprehensive , victim-centred strategy on Transitional Justice and accountability , to establish credible truth seeking mechanism and ad hoc special court ' . Obviously , UNHRC and GTF are in a dilemma . India lost well over 1,000 officers and men here while approximately 3,000 others received injuries , some maimed for life . <p> Instead of opposing Geneva led investigations , Sri Lanka should request for a wider probe to establish how foreign support allowed the LTTE to wage war for nearly three decades and to ascertain the origins of terrorism . <p> The incumbent government should publicly ask those demanding accountability on Sri Lanka 's part to explain why the predominantly Tamil speaking northern and eastern electorates overwhelmingly voted for General Sarath Fonseka at the 2010 presidential poll after repeatedly accusing he and his Army of committing war crimes and how the TNA should be dealt with for recognizing the LTTE in late 2001 as the sole representatives of the Tamil speaking people .

Perhaps , the TNA and the very vociferous Tamil Diaspora should be asked to prove that they at least requested the LTTE not to take cover behind civilians and hold them as a human shield after the combined armed forces pushed the LTTE fighting forces across the A9 to the Mullaitivu coast by April- May 2009 . <p> The role of the Sri Lankan Church , too , should be probed .

Would it be possible to identify those PLOTE cadres killed by the Indian Navy on the high seas as they fled the Maldives in early Nov 1989 following the abortive bid to assassinate the then President of that island nation ? <p> However , the writer has no dispute with the GTF 's call for thorough investigation into corruption accusations and action against all those responsible regardless of their standing in society . <p> Foreign passport holders <p> For want of Western governments ' support , thousands of people , categorized as dead/missing , live abroad under assumed identities . Sri Lanka never succeeded in securing their cooperation as they hid the real identities of thousands of Sri Lankans issued with new passports .

India ended itse military mission in March 1990 with then President Ranasinghe Premadasa showing them the door . The LTTE assassinated Gandhi just over a year later . Another high profile case is the ex-LTTE terrorist Antonythasan Jesuthasan receiving an opportunity to play the lead role in notable French Director Jacques Audiard 's award-winning Dheepan ( 2015 ) . Jesuthasan , too , may be on some missing persons list . <p> The much-touted Geneva investigation should ascertain the actual number of Sri Lankans living abroad under assumed names .

@@90101233 <h> ' Memoirs of a Water Engineer ' - Palitha Manchanayake <p> I read ' Memoirs of a Water Engineer , ' a collection of 19 essaysby Eng . Palitha Manchanayake , with great pleasure and satisfaction . The essays are on ancient irrigation engineering , water resources , hydrology and flood forecasting covering his personal experiences both here and abroad . He first worked here for the Department of Irrigation and Mahaweli Authority and later , after migrating to Australia , as a Hydrologist serving the Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology in Sydney . <p> Firstly , I found that the writer to be a versatile personality compared to many engineering professionals . Manchanayake has authored other works on scientific irrigation , Sinhala poetry , Buddhism , and philosophy as well . To find writers of that versatility and depth is difficult and hence commenting on work by such an author becomes a satisfying pleasure . <p> As is to be expected , the book devotes itself to technical aspects of irrigation , hydrology , political engagements , and construction issues related to such work . But these are provided simply without technical jargon . I address these aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On Biso Kotuwas he covers several areas of technicalities , quoting from earlier historical and technical publications by writers like RL Brohier and Henry Parker . He has also referred to the work of my friend , Prof. WI Siriweera , to state historical findings on Biso Kotuwa . In a comparative study of large reservoirs , he highlights the importance of Biso Kotuwa , supporting the construction of large water bodies coping with high pressures at high heads of water . Hence , his explanation ( pages 15 to 17 ) in plain language and equally simple technical terms of the purpose of a Biso Kotuwa is educative to technical and other personnel . <p> The author discusses another Sri Lankan hydrological invention , i.e. Keta Sorowwa , the conduit through which outgoing water from small low-head reservoirs were issued in ancient times . He explains here , also in plain language , the make-up of Keta Sorowwa and explains the Ketaya ( clay pipe ) required during high water levels , permitting enhanced tank capacity . Keta Sorowwa has been helpful to ensure water requirements when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regrets the destroying of Keta Sorrowas by some British rulers , especially during the 1818 Rebellion . <p> Chapter Three lists how irrigation infrastructure has evolved over the years . Chapter Four also sets out the historical evolution of ancient irrigation , water resources management and the Yodha Ela concept that evolved during the eras of the Sinhala Kings dealing with the Yodha Elas of Kalawewa , Elehara-Minneriya , Minneriya-Kantale , Angamedilla , and Minipe Yodha Elas , and describes some Yodha Elas . <p> The chapter discussing the devastation caused by the British in the irrigation field narrates the historical aspects , which run through from pages 49-54 , that include the Wellassa Rebellion and the destruction of ' one tank-one village ' ecology . Manchanayake incorporates an emotional description of the beheading of Keppitipola Disawa to highlight the consequences of the criminal devastation by the British in 1818 . <p> The book narrates the personal experiences of the author relating to irrigation feasibility studies , planning , and operating schemes . In Rambakan Oya and Muthukandiya schemes he developed close relationships with political heads , an experience by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to differing personal views on projects . <p> In the chapter on the Parakrama Samudra floods in 1978 , he offers a detailed description of the disaster . I too had personal experience there as the then Government Agent of Polonnaruwa . Manchanayake and a group of engineers took part in another study and submitted a report to the government when a walking path was to be constructed on the Parakrama Samudra bund . <p> The flood control system in Ratnapura discussed in the relevant chapter could not be achieved through scientific norms and a project had to be abandoned . However , the need and importance of flash flood prediction and management are set out and these could improve flood control systems in any part of the country . <p> The chapter on Elephant Corridor is interesting as it shows environmental consequences of scientific decisions which are sometimes forgotten by technical officials . How rain gauging was disturbed thrice by elephants and how the concerned officials eventually succeeded teaches a lesson not only for irrigation but also for any other development project involving the environment . Manchanayake 's love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter in his book titled Wahalakada Jungles to this subject . There 's much to learn there of the irrigation and hydrology of Wahalkada as well as wildlife there . <p> In the subsequent chapter he deals with technical assessments , discussing the water resources of Sri Lanka . The last few chapters running from pages 103 to 142 are the author 's experience in hydrology , floods , etc which would best serve interested engineers . For managers , the experiences could be guidelines for the future development of water management . Of course , some of the stances taken by developed nations may not be feasible here for want of resources . However , exposure to these would be useful to our engineers observes the writer . <p> This book printed by ' The Quality Printers ' of Nugegoda will be of interest to laymen , generalists like me as well as to those who serve in the field of irrigation in areas where managing water shortages is an important part of their jobs . The book is written in simple language without technical jargon and with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in water resources and management . Mostly , let me repeat my appreciation of the interest the author has taken to cover such a wide field . <h> The Petroleum Bill -- its quiet passage and disquieting politics <p> The Petroleum Products ( Special Provisions ) ( Amendment ) Bill had a quiet passage in parliament with a majority of 60 votes , 77 for and 17 against . What is disquieting is that only 94 of the 224 MPs ( excluding the Speaker ) were in parliament for the vote on a Bill on petroleum products , the mismanagement of which turned the country upside down in a matter of months this year . The Bill itself is not some masterpiece of legislation to foster proper management of the petroleum sector , but a simple seeming amendment to the Petroleum Products ( Special Provisions ) Act No. 33 of 2002 . It underscores the point that in the absence of real infrastructure and supporting policy regime , there is no legislative , regulatory or constitutional way out of the crisis in the petroleum sector or any other economic sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2002 and the new amendment is to enable the granting of licenses to entities outside the Petroleum Corporation " to import , export , sell , supply or distribute petroleum . " While the 2002 law vested the licensing power in the " Energy Supply Committee " established under the Energy Supplies Act ( No. 2 , 2002 ) , the new Amendment transfers that responsibility to a ( new ) committee appointed by the Cabinet of Ministers . The Amendment also redefines the subject Minister by the words " the Minister " instead of " the Minister in charge of the subject of Power and Energy , " as it was in the original Act . <p> The Bill was challenged before the Supreme Court over the constitutionality of some of its provisions and the whole Bill itself . The Court held that the Bill itself in one respect and some of the provisions were indeed inconsistent with the constitution but suggested changes to the Bill to remove the inconsistency and the necessity for a two-thirds majority in parliament and even a referendum . Parliament has now passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Supreme Court . <p> Media reports have been calling the amendment as a law to " liberalize the petroleum sector , " obviously taking the cue from the Minister of Power and Energy , Kanchana Wijesekera , who said in parliament that the new Amendment " will allow global suppliers to enter as retail operators , eliminate the monopoly of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation ( CPC ) on Jet Fuel and liberalize energy sector . " There is nothing in the eight clauses and four pages of the new Amendment that is not already in the main Act that is going to cause global suppliers to drop everything and rush with petroleum products to cashless Sri Lanka . If at all the new Amendment might be used to create the path of least obstacles to local petroleum wheeler dealers by replacing one obscure committee with another . This aspect of the Bill came up in the hearing before the Supreme Court . <p> Petroleum Saga <p> In an earlier article ( July 24 ) I alluded to the saga of the petroleum industry -- from pre-nationalization to nationalization in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CPC monopoly to CPC-LIOC duopoly -- being a crucial case-study backdrop to the current fuel crisis . Any such case-study should be an exercise in political economy and not constitutional interpretations . Tragically , however , for all the political tumults about the supply and delivery crisis of petroleum products there has not been any corresponding ' agitation ' in parliament either at the level of soliciting and securing up-to-date information on the supply and status of petroleum products , or at the level having some serious discussion about the petroleum crisis , its causes and potential solutions . <p> While no one in parliament is showing any serious interest in these matters , it is left to the Supreme Court to step in to fill the void . But filling the void is not solving the crisis and it is not in the business of the solve anything . Nonetheless , the Court 's ruling on the amending bill provides a good summary account of the " existing legal framework " for the regulation ( I would add ' and deregulation ' ) of the petroleum sector , beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1961 . <p> The current Minister who is now claiming that his new law will eliminate the monopoly of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation , should know from the Supreme Court ruling ( if he is not directly familiar with the CPC Act ) that the 1961 law that nationalized the petroleum industry has always included provisions permitting the supply or distribution of petrol , kerosene , diesel oil or furnace oil by non-CPC entities with the approval of the Minister or CPC Board of Directors . <p> These provisions were not utilized by governments not because , as was suggested during the Court hearing , the CPC Act did not ' contemplate ' regulatory measures for their application but because no government until after 1977 contemplated using them for the import , supply or distribution by non-CPC entities . This included both the governments of the Left and the Right . In fact , it was the UNP government of Dudley Senanayake that entrenched the monopoly of the CPC by building a new refinery in Sapugaskanda with the capacity to meet virtually the entire domestic demand for petroleum products by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labyrinth <p> Contemplation , if any , to use non-CPC sources for the supply and distribution of petroleum products began after 1977 with the changes in economic direction and philosophy , under a different UNP government led by PM turned President , JR Jayewardene . His government enacted the Petroleum Products ( Regulation and Control of Supplies ) Act No. 34 of 1979 to provide for the regulation and control of the distribution and use of petroleum products . Nothing much came out of it , and the JRJ government , as I wrote earlier , baulked from making a serious and considered decision about the petroleum sector ( or the electricity sector ) -- whether to continue the CPC monopoly , ' liberalize ' the whole sector , or selectively ' unbundle ' it to create a healthy blend of both public and private sector involvement . <p> The next set of laws came after more than 20 years , in 2002 , when Ranil Wickremesinghe was Prime Minister , co-habiting with President Chandrika Kumaratunga . There were three pieces of Legislation -- the Energy Supply Act , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanka Act , all enacted in 2002 . The Energy Supply Act was enacted to purportedly deal with the emerging energy crisis in the country , and the Act enabled the creation of a new Committee , the Energy Supply Committee , but it also provided for the of regulation of " activities of persons engaged in the importation , exportation , storage , distribution and supply of petroleum and petroleum products . " <p> However , the Energy Supply Act was in operation only for a period of two years from March 2002 to March 2004 , and would seem to have died with the sacking ( through dissolution of parliament ) of the peace-process government of Ranil Wickremesinghe by President Kumaratunga . At the same time , the Petroleum Products Act that was also enacted in 2002 by the Wickremesinghe government has survived his alternations in and out of power and , according to the Supreme Court , has provided " a more empowered regulatory regime over the petroleum industry . " <p> The Court ruling suggests that the Petroleum Products Act ( PPA ) " sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the CPC and providing for the issue of licences subject to prescribed conditions . " With respect and in policy parlance , the PPA legislation actually sought to achieve the opposite : to deregulate the petroleum sector ! Pertinent to the new amendment to the PPA legislation , the latter provided for the licences for the import , export , sale , supply or distribution of petroleum products to be issued by the Minister on the recommendations of the Energy Supply Committee . The latter committee would somehow seem to have survived the demise of its enabling legislation . As I have indicated at the outset , the new Amendment is replacing the Energy Supply Committee by a new Committee . <p> A word on the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka ( PUCSL ) Act to round off this legal labyrinth , and the underlying overlapping of vested interests . The intended purpose of the Commission ( and the Act ) is to provide " a framework for the regulation of public utilities industries , which originally included ( in the Act 's schedules ) only the Electricity Industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added to the PUCSL list four years later , in 2006 , just after Mahinda Rajapaksa became the new President . <p> As the Court duly noted in its ruling , it was unclear " during the hearing whether there was agreement amongst parties on whether the PUCSL did exercise any regulatory power in terms of the PUCSL Act over the petroleum industry . " And the Court concluded that " the PUCSL does not have any power of regulation over the petroleum industry merely upon it being included in the Schedule to the PUCSL Act . " <p> What next ? <p> The question now is what difference is the new amendment going to make to the operation of the petroleum sector ? The Minister might think that he now has a freer hand to break the monopoly of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and get non-CPC entities to import and supply petroleum products for local distribution . If the Minister , or the government , wants to really end the monopoly of the CPC , even though there is no monopoly now anyway , it must bite the bullet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take over the CPC can use its infrastructure the same way the CPC used the infrastructure of the multinational oil companies after nationalization . In trying to create a parallel system besides the CPC , the government is only leading the country into the worst of both ( public and private ) worlds . The same way the JRJ government destroyed the bus industry and the school system . Very soon there might be an international university on climate change headed by a new Jennings from Norway ! <p> As for falling into the worst of both worlds , the Supreme Court ruling has laid down the markers to indicate where things easily go wrong . The Court held that in three areas the new Bill was inconsistent with the Constitution and suggested changes . First , the Court directed the new Committee to be restructured to include two additional Ministry Secretaries similar to the Energy Supply Committee . Second , it struck Clause 7 , a deeming provision that made any previous act by the Energy Supply Committee legal and unchallengeable in courts . Third , the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Committee was kept outside the purview of Bribery Act . The Court directed the Bill to be changed to include the Committee as a Scheduled Institution under the meaning of the Bribery Act . <p> Why was it excluded from the purview of the Bribery Act in the first place ? The answer is because the real intent behind half-baked attempts at licensing is to create the path of least obstacles to local importers and their foreign suppliers . Even with privatization , it is the responsibility of the government to ensure that proper processes are in place for setting criteria and standards , for competitive bidding , and for the granting of licenses and contracts . That has not been the case at all in Sri Lanka , starting from 1977 and made worse after 2010 . <p> Specific to the petroleum sector , the legislative changes in 2002 under Ranil Wickremesinghe and in 2006 under Mahinda Rajapaksa leaves one to opine if , after all , Mahinda Rajapaksa was continuing from where Ranil Wickremesinghe left . Is it now the other way around ? And is national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via Ekwa Negitimu ?

The foundation of the Hungarian state was established in the late 9th century . By the 12th century , Hungary became a regional power , reaching its cultural and political height in the 15th century . After that it was partially occupied by the Ottoman Empire for over 150 years . Hungary came under Habsburg rule at the turn of the 18th century , later joining with the Austrian Empire to form Austria-Hungary , a major power into the early 20th century . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II , Hungary became a satellite state of the Soviet Union .

That was a part of a broad wave of revolutions in various communist countries of Central and Eastern Europe . <p> Gyor <p> En-route to Budapest , the capital city of Hungary , we visited a small city with a population of 70,000 , Gyor .

The history of Budapest began when an early Celtic settlement transformed into the Roman town of Aquincum . The Hungarians arrived in the territory in the late 9th century , but the area was pillaged by the Mongols in the mid-13th century . Re-established Buda became one of the centres of Renaissance humanist culture by the 15th century . <p> After the reconquest of Buda in late 17th century , after a 150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age of prosperity , in 1873 , with the unification of Buda , ? buda and Pest the name ' Budapest ' given to the new capital of Hungary . Budapest also became the co-capital of the Austro-Hungarian Empire . <p> Bisected by the Danube River , Budapest 's cityscape is studded with architectural landmarks Buda 's medieval Castle Hill and grand neoclassical buildings along Pest 's Andr ? ssy Avenue to the 19th-century Chain Bridge are impressive . Turkish and Roman influence on Hungarian culture explains the popularity of mineral spas , including at thermal Lake H ? v ? z . <p> We visited most of the key tourist attractions in Budapest and nearby areas , including Matthias Church , Buda Castle built in the 13th century , Fisherman 's Bastion , which is an architectural icon of the city , and one of Europe 's oldest and most beloved coffee-houses , Caf ? Gerbeaud . Our lunch at a small restaurant included goulash soup which was much hotter than the versions I had tasted before , and used to prepare when I was an executive chef . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international hotel in the city , Budapest InterContinential . On our way back to Vienna , we stopped again in Gyor for refreshments . <p> CZECOSLOVAKIA <p> Towards the end of our stay in Austria , I planned a quick trip to Czechoslovakia . My wife wanted to skip that trip to spend the day with her mother and our Austrian friends , doing fun things in Vienna . I went alone to Czechoslovakia early in the morning with a group of tourists travelling in a coach . Learning from a bad experience at the Bulgaria-Romania border , 10 days prior , I took the advice from the Austrian travel agency , and armed myself with an additional visa for Czechoslovakia . <p> Czechoslovakia was an interesting country with a population of 10 million divided among two main ethnic groups -- the Czech people and the Slovak people . Ethnic Czechs were called Bohemians in English until the early 20th century , referring to the former name of their country , Bohemia . Czechoslovakia was a sovereign state created after the World War I , when it declared its independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II , a major territory of the country became part of Germany , while the country lost further territories to Hungary and Poland . <p> After World War II , the country of Czechoslovakia was re-established , with the exception of Carpathian Ruthenia , which became part of the Ukrainian SSR ( a republic of the Soviet Union ) . From 1948 , Czechoslovakia was part of the Eastern Bloc . A period of political liberalization in 1968 , known as the Prague Spring , was violently ended when the Soviet Union , assisted by some other Warsaw Pact countries , invaded Czechoslovakia . <p> Four years after my visit , in 1989 , as Marxist -- Leninist governments ( and communism ) were ending all over Central and Eastern Europe , Czechoslovaks peacefully deposed their socialist government in the Velvet Revolution . Later , in 1993 , Czechoslovakia peacefully split into the two sovereign states of the Czech Republic and Slovakia as the result of nationalist tensions among the Slovaks . <p> Bratislava <p> The tour coach reached Bratislava , by mid-morning . Bratislava in 1985 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slovakia , is set along the Danube River by the border with Austria and Hungary . It 's surrounded by vineyards and the Little Carpathian Mountains , criss-crossed with forested hiking and cycling trails . The pedestrian-only , 18th-century old town is known for its lively bars and caf ? s . When we reached the city , the coach left us and the driver asked us to meet him in the same spot in eight hours . <p> That was a challenging excursion as no one at information and tour desks spoke any English . My German was not good enough to find my way . Bratislava and suburbs had several universities , and as a result there were many student excursionist . I eventually became friendly with a couple of students from West Germany , who liked to practice speaking English , and a Czechoslovakian student . We created our own city itinerary for the day , with the help of her Slovak-English dictionary . <p> Bratislava Castle <p> We visited the picturesque Bratislava whose Old Town banks the Danube River . It is relatively a smaller city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best preserved medieval old towns in Europe . Besides the colourful medieval houses , impressive churches , bell towers and beautiful baroque palaces , the most enchanting building is definitely the Bratislava Castle . Perched atop a hill , the reconstructed Bratislava Castle overlooks old town and the Danube . <p> My new friends and I spent hours at the castle in the midst of heavy snowing . When snow fall eased , we walked a lot around the city . We had lunch in a Slovak cellar type restaurant . After lunch we continued our discovery tour by foot . It was wet and cold , but fun . <p> An Assignment in Switzerland <p> When I returned to Vienna , I received a call from Sri Lanka . It was my father-in-law who ran our family business -- Streamline Services , a travel agency and hospitality consulting company . We also represented a few well-known hotel schools in Europe for whom our company recruited students from Sri Lanka . <p> My father-in-law , Captain Wick chatted over the telephone for a long time . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secured for us three years ago has progressed well . When you are in Switzerland , HotelConsult has invited you to check their facilities , meet our students , have a luncheon meeting with the President of the school , and also deliver a guest lecture . Their main campus is in Brig , which is only a three-hour train ride from Z ? rich which you have planned to visit . Can you go there and spend a couple of days ? " <p> I said , " Yes , Captain ! " and changed my travel plans immediately . My wife and mother-in-law suggested that I go to Switzerland alone on the business trip while they went on to Munich to stay with our good Bavarian friends in West Germany . We agreed to part for three days . <p> After leaving Vienna , the train passed some beautiful Austrian villages as well as cities such as Linz , Salzburg , Innsbruck and Bludenz . Mr and Mrs. Sch ? dler , an elderly couple returning to their country Liechtenstein , after a week in Vienna , became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for global travels . " On your way to Z ? rich , why do n't you visit our country ? " Mrs. Sch ? dler asked me . When I told them that I do n't have a visa , Mr. Sch ? dler was quick to encourage me saying " there are no border controls between Liechtenstein and Switzerland and , the Swiss visa is valid in Liechtenstein . " I was tempted . <p> The train reached the Swiss border city Buchs around 3:00 pm . When I realized that Liechtenstein was only five miles away , I changed my mind , and travel plans and got off the train . After leaving my bag in a station locker , I took a bus to Liechtenstein . <p> LIECHTENSTEIN <p> Liechtenstein is a German-speaking , 61-square mile wide principality between Austria and Switzerland . It 's known for its medieval castles , alpine landscapes and villages linked by a network of trails . In 1985 , with a population of only 26,000 ( today , 39,000 inhabitants ) Liechtenstein is one of the smallest countries in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Columbia , in the USA . Liechtenstein is the world 's wealthiest country . According to the World Bank , its annual per-capita income is $175,813 , ranking Liechtenstein ahead of Monaco , Luxembourg , Switzerland and Bermuda in 2022 . <p> Vaduz <p> Vaduz , the capital of Liechtenstein , sits on the Rhine River near the Swiss border . It is a cultural and financial centre , home to Kunstmuseum Liechtenstein , with galleries of modern and contemporary art . The Postmuseum displays Liechtenstein 's famous postage stamps . Although ideal for tourism , the largest hotel in the city had only 41 rooms ! The main attraction is the Vaduz Castle . <p> Vaduz Castle <p> On a hillside overlooking the town , Vaduz Castle dates back to the 12th century and is a royal family residence . The nearby national museum houses archaeological and cultural artifacts in a medieval building . After a brief visit to Vaduz , I took a bus to return to Buchs in Switzerland . But I realized that it was now getting too late to travel to Brig according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit another country . <p> SWITZERLAND <p> Having travelled in Switzerland for studies and leisure three years ago , I was familiar with half a dozen key cities in this beautiful country . Switzerland 's political structure is fairly unique in the world . In total , there are 26 cantons ( states of the Swiss Confederation ) with an average population of 250,000 per canton . The primary language in 19 cantons is German , six cantons are French and one canton is Italian . In 1985 the population of Switzerland was only 6.5 million ( today , nearly 10 million ) . <p> Before catching the last train from Buchs , I called HotelConsult to inform them about my slight change of travel plans . Then I called my Ceylon Hotel School batch mate and hostel mate for three years , Patrick Taylor ( Patta ) who was living in Zug with his Swiss wife , Judy . They met , fell in love and got married when Patta was the first Executive Chef of Triton Hotel and Judy was a Tour Leader for a Swiss tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , which was 30 minutes south of Z ? rich by train . They came to the Zug railway station to pick me up . <p> Zug <p> As I arrived in Zug , when it was very dark and cold , and did not see much . Zug is the main town and capital of the Swiss canton of Zug . The city is small and had a population of just over 20,000 . Its name originates from the fishing vocabulary ; in the Middle Ages it referred to the right to pull up fishing nets and hence to the right to fish . This town is well-known for its low taxes and affluence with beautiful nature . The historic town of Zug a favourite destination for those who are fond of discovering noteworthy landmarks . <p> I stayed in Patta and Judy 's house that night . Judy quickly prepared a traditional Swiss meal including Z ? rcher geschnetzeltes ( meat cut Z ? rich-style ) , a simple but very tasty dish consisting of veal cooked with mushrooms , cream , onions and wine . Patta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raw grated potatoes and butter ) . <p> Z ? rcher geschnetzeltes mit r ? sti <p> As Judy was starting a new job next day , she went to sleep early leaving Patta and I to catch up about our memorable college years . After dinner I had a long chat with Patta till early hours in the morning . We talked about how our lives have changed since we first met 14 years ago in Colombo . Judy had motivated Patta to set up a small business in Zug called , Taylor Catering Services . " Machang , I also make some income from a new hobby of mine , Patta told me . <p> Their apartment was beautiful and had a collection of large abstract paintings . Patta surprised me when he told me that he is the artist . Painting had been something he tried after settling in Switzerland . I never knew about my friend 's artistic talent when we were college students . Those beautiful paintings inspired me to try abstract painting myself . I did this for many years after that , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Asia , South America , the Caribbean and North America . Thanks for the motivation , Patta ! <p> Patrick Taylor and I during a CHS trip in early 1970s <p> Patta was fascinated with my travel record and future travel ambitions . " Machang , where else are you travelling during this trip before returning to your base in London ? " he asked . I said , " just a few brief stops in Z ? rich , Bern , Brig , Lax , Fiesch , Lausanne , Luzern , Munich , Paris , Amiens , Boulogne-Sur-Mer and Dover . " Patta laughed loud and said , " The travel bug has certainly bitten you , Chandana ! " <h> How Bob Dylan used ancient practice of ' imitatio ' to craft some of the most original songs of his time <p> By Raphael FalcoProfessor of English , University of Maryland , Baltimore County <p> Over the course of six decades , Bob Dylan steadily brought together popular music and poetic excellence . Yet the guardians of literary culture have only rarely accepted Dylan 's legitimacy.His 2016 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholars , fans and critics to think of Dylan as an integral part of international literary heritage . My new book , " No One to Meet : Imitation and Originality in the Songs of Bob Dylan , " takes this challenge seriously and places Dylan within a literary tradition that extends all the way back to the ancients . <p> I am a professor of early modern literature , with a special interest in the Renaissance . But I am also a longtime Dylan enthusiast and the co-editor of the open-access Dylan Review , the only scholarly journal on Bob Dylan . <p> After teaching and writing about early modern poetry for 30 years , I could n't help but recognize a similarity between the way Dylan composes his songs and the ancient practice known as " imitatio . " <p> Poetic honey-making <p> Although the Latin word imitatio would translate to " imitation " in English , it does n't mean simply producing a mirror image of something . The term instead describes a practice or a methodology of composing poetry.The classical author Seneca used bees as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bee samples and digests the nectar from a whole field of flowers to produce a new kind of honey -- which is part flower and part bee -- a poet produces a poem by sampling and digesting the best authors of the past . <p> Dylan 's imitations follow this pattern : His best work is always part flower , part Dylan.Consider a song like " A Hard Rain 's A-Gonna Fall . " To write it , Dylan repurposed the familiar Old English ballad " Lord Randal , " retaining the call-and-response framework . In the original , a worried mother asks , " O where ha ' you been , Lord Randal , my son ? / And where ha ' you been , my handsome young man ? " and her son tells of being poisoned by his true love . <p> In Dylan 's version , the nominal son responds to the same questions with a brilliant mixture of public and private experiences , conjuring violent images such as a newborn baby surrounded by wolves , black branches dripping blood , the broken tongues of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , a young girl hands the speaker -- a son in name only -- a rainbow , and he promises to know his song well before he 'll stand on the mountain to sing it . <p> " A Hard Rain 's A-Gonna Fall " resounds with the original Old English ballad , which would have been very familiar to Dylan 's original audiences of Greenwich Village folk singers . He first sang the song in 1962 at the Gaslight Cafe on MacDougal Street , a hangout of folk revival stalwarts . To their ears , Dylan 's indictment of American culture -- its racism , militarism and reckless destruction of the environment -- would have echoed that poisoning in the earlier poem and added force to the repurposed lyrics . <p> Drawing from the source <p> Because Dylan " samples and digests " songs from the past , he has been accused of plagiarism . <p> This charge underestimates Dylan 's complex creative process , which closely resembles that of early modern poets who had a different concept of originality -- a concept Dylan intuitively understands . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of nothing , but going back to what had come before . They literally returned to the " origin . " Writers first searched outside themselves to find models to imitate , and then they transformed what they imitated -- that is , what they found , sampled and digested -- into something new . Achieving originality depended on the successful imitation and repurposing of an admired author from a much earlier era . They did not imitate each other , or contemporary authors from a different national tradition . Instead , they found their models among authors and works from earlier centuries.In his book " The Light in Troy , " literary scholar Thomas Greene points to a 1513 letter written by poet Pietro Bembo to Giovanfrancesco Pico della Mirandola . <p> " Imitation , " Bembo writes , " since it is wholly concerned with a model , must be drawn from the model ... the activity of imitating is nothing other than translating the likeness of some other 's style into one 's own writings . " The act of translation was largely stylistic and involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new definition of originality <p> However , the Romantics of the late 18th century wished to change , and supersede , that understanding of poetic originality . For them , and the writers who came after them , creative originality meant going inside oneself to find a connection to nature . As scholar of Romantic literature M.H. Abrams explains in his renowned study " Natural Supernaturalism , " " the poet will proclaim how exquisitely an individual mind ... is fitted to the external world , and the external world to the mind , and how the two in union are able to beget a new world . " <p> Instead of the world wrought by imitating the ancients , the new Romantic theories envisioned the union of nature and the mind as the ideal creative process . Abrams quotes the 18th-century German Romantic Novalis : " The higher philosophy is concerned with the marriage of Nature and Mind . " <p> The Romantics believed that through this connection of nature and mind , poets would discover something new and produce an original creation . To borrow from past " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work or " new world , " could seem like theft , despite the fact , obvious to anyone paging through an anthology , that poets have always responded to one another and to earlier works.Unfortunately -- as Dylan 's critics too often demonstrate -- this bias favoring supposedly " natural " originality over imitation continues to color views of the creative process today . <p> For six decades now , Dylan has turned that Romantic idea of originality on its head . With his own idiosyncratic method of composing songs and his creative reinvention of the Renaissance practice of imitatio , he has written and performed -- yes , imitation functions in performance too -- over 600 songs , many of which are the most significant and most significantly original songs of his time . To me , there is a firm historical and theoretical rationale for what these audiences have long known -- and the Nobel Prize committee made official in 2016 -- that Bob Dylan is both a modern voice entirely unique and , at the same time , the product of ancient , time-honored ways of @ @

@@90332230 <h> Youth Observer <h> Understanding scientific basis and history of Homeopathy <p> The following is an interview with Sri Lankan Homeopath Dr. Imthiaz Latiff , son of the pioneering legend of homeopathy in Sri Lanka , Dr. Majeed Abdul Latiff . <p> Published as part of an educative series on wellbeing and to mark the anniversary of the founder of Homeopathy , the renowned German medical Professor and intellectual , Friedrich Hahnemann born on April 10,1755 , this interview will be continued to provide more insights on how diverse medical traditions could co-exist to serve humanity . <p> Here are excerpts of the first segment of the interview <p> Q : Your father , Dr. Majeed Abdul Latiff was considered the father of Homeopathy in Sri Lanka . Could you speak about him and how he came to become a homeopathic doctor ? <p> A : My father initially wanted to become an Allopathic Western Medicine doctor . <p> The forefathers of our family were famous traditional physicians who had even treated King Sri Wickrema Rajasinghe and the King 's family during the kingdom of Kandy . My father Dr. Majeed Abdul Latiff , being an offspring of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ( Allopathic ) medicine and enrolled himself in the West Bengal Medical College in Calcutta in 1953 . <p> During his first year in medical college there was a severe outbreak of cholera and my father was also infected . He had taken treatment from the college medical officer with no relief for two days and accidently met a homoeopathic practitioner who had given him some small pills . After taking two doses within a gap of four hours as instructed , my father felt he was almost 50 percent relieved . At the fourth the dose , he was back to normal . He was amazed what these magic pills were that cured him in hours ! The answer was homoeopathy ! <p> When he met the doctor again , my father told him that he was a first-year medical student of an Allopathic Medical college and the homeopathic doctor had asked ; " Why are you learning a medical system that could not cure you ? <p> The result was that my father left the Western Medical College and enrolled himself with the Calcutta Homoeopathic Medical College @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . He followed a five-year study in the college and served the College Hospital for six months as a Junior House Physician and six months as a Senior House Physician . He returned home in 1958 as the first institutionally qualified Sri Lankan homeopath . <p> He was instrumental in getting the Homoeopathic Act of 1970 passed in Parliament and was one of the seven members to be appointed to the first Homoeopathic Medical Council in 1973 . He served as President and member in almost every Homoeopathic Medical Council since its inception . <p> He dedicated his life towards the development of homoeopathy in Sri Lanka . His name was frequently mentioned in the Hansard of Parliament whenever any matter concerned with homoeopathy was taken up for discussion . <p> During his practice , he had treated many prominent personalities including Former President J.R . Jayewardene and Helena Jayewardene , and Hema Premadasa , Mrs. Lalith Athulathmudali and many former ministers and members of Parliament such as Lakshman Jayakody , Indradasa Hettiarachchi and many prominent figures and celebrities . He was popular among the top brass of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' miracles ' by curing what was termed incurable by conventional treatment . <p> Even allopathic doctors and their families came to him for homoeopathic treatment . He was known for conducting free clinics in Colombo . During his tenure in the Homoeopathic Council he was instrumental in obtaining a five-acre plot of land at Welisara for establishing a Homoeopathic College and Teaching Hospital , and today , we have the 20-bed Homoeopathic Hospital at Welisara with two separate wards for males and females as well as a separate OPD Unit and Laboratory . My father was honoured with the title ' Vidyanidhi ' by President R. Premadasa for his dedication to homoeopathy . <p> Q : Could you speak of your background and work as a homeopathic doctor in Sri Lanka ? <p> A : Having qualified from the Pakistan Homoeopathic Medical College and Hospital in Lahore , I am a registered homoeopathic practitioner in Sri Lanka and Pakistan . I function from Colombo , but I send Homeopathy medications throughout Sri Lanka and abroad . <p> I have collaborated with the Colombo Municipal Council to treat thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lankan expatriates obtained preventive homeopathy treatment from me , and I sent medications the world over . <p> Globally , Homeopathy is highly acclaimed to treat viruses and Covid-19 and Covid vaccine related complications is a current example . The best international example is Prince Charles who benefited from homeopathic treatment when he was ill with Covid-19 . <p> I am the homeopathy doctor in the Indian High Commission medical panel in Sri Lanka . I treat the Indian mission staff and in 2005 , I assisted the special Indian Consultant in Homeopathy deputed to Sri Lanka by the Indian Government to help formulate a short- and long-term development plan for homoeopathy in Sri Lanka . This culminated in the drafting of the New Homoeopathic Act of Sri Lanka which was passed in 2016 . <p> I have accompanied the former Secretary to the Sri Lankan Ministry of Indigenous Medicine for a discussion with the Secretary of Health of the Government of India and was instrumental in initiating scholarships for Sri Lankan students to study homoeopathy in India . Since then , every year 10 scholarships are awarded to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homeopathy in Calcutta . <p> Q : April 10 marked the birth anniversary of Friedrich Hahnemann , the German Professor of Western medicine who discovered homeopathy . Could you explain the discovery and basis of homeopathy ? <p> A : The basis of Homoeopathy is in Western science . It is not to be misunderstood as indigenous although we in Sri Lanka have placed it within the indigenous medicine ministry . Some time back it was in the mainstream health ministry category . <p> Dr. Christian Friedrich Samuel Hahnemann of Germany who discovered homeopathy in the 1790s was a Western medical scientist and chemist . He was a senior medical professor who knew more than 30 languages . This enabled him to read widely on diverse cures practised the world over . <p> He was regarded as one of the highest qualified allopathic doctors in the 18th century and was a rarity of rarities because he was a doctor who made his medicines . He was a man with principles . Although he was holding a top official position as a highly qualified allopathic practitioner and enjoying a good lifestyle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Western medical science at the time . <p> Being a man of high intellect and knowledge he researched , contemplated , read and decided that the allopathic methods may do more harm than good . Therefore , he resigned from his position , gave up his practice and continued his work as a chemist while continuing to read and research on a possible alternative through the root of Western science . <p> Using his knowledge of many languages he took up literary work and translations of various medical books . During his translation , he came across a medical book by the great Scottish physician William Cullen 's Materia Medica . This book contained details about the effects of the Peruvian Bark which was also called Quinine and given as a treatment for malarial fever ( botanical name is Cinchona officinalis ) . In the footnote in the page about the Peruvian Bark , it was stated that the reason this medicinal plant was used to treat malarial fever was because it has the property to produce malaria-like symptoms . <p> This information led Dr. Hahnemann to a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking the extract of the Peruvian bark . He noticed that he experienced the characteristic symptoms of malaria ; intermittent fever with chill and perspiration . For the next few years , he decided to experiment all other drugs in the material medica in different dosages on himself and on different people , both male and female under various conditions . All homeopathic experiments are on human beings and never on animals . <p> Experimenting first with the treatment of malaria , Dr. Hahnemann tried giving patients much smaller or diluted dosage instead of the usual . This he found was what worked in facilitating permanent cures . His results justified what was stated in Cullen 's material medica that properties of Peruvian bark had the ability to treat malaria , because it has the similar effect and ability to produce identical symptoms of malaria . What was happening earlier was that due to large/crude doses as given in Allopathy significant side effects are caused resulting in relapses after treatment . This renowned Western medical professor , thereafter , embarked on a long research of drug proving for other ailments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses a range of compounds for treatments . <p> The term homoeopathy is derived from Greek ( where ' homoeo ' means similar and the word ' pathy ' means treatment ) . Thereby the new scientific law called Similia Similibus Curantur was introduced which means let ' like be treated with like ' . This is the scientific premise as well as philosophy of homeopathy . <p> Any drug given to a healthy person during drug proving in large doses can produce symptoms ( artificially induced through the drug ) similar to the natural disease . The same compound given in minute highly diluted doses in a process called potentisation can fully cure the person having the actual disease . <p> Q : Could you explain the technical difference between Allopathy and Homeopathy ? <p> Allopathic treatment is based on the physiological and pathological changes that have been observed during proving of drugs on animals . The concept of diseases in allopathy is that it is caused by external forces such as bacteria , virus and parasites and also changes in cell pathology . <p> Medicines of Allopathy are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Anti Inflammatory , Anti Bacterial , Anti Histamine , Anti Acid , Anti Coagulants and Anti depressive to bring on an opposite effect to the exhibiting condition . <p> Homoeopathy is based on the causative factor . According to the concept of homoeopathy there are ' no ' diseases , but only diseased ( dis-ease ) in persons . The word dis-ease itself is self-explanatory . Homeopathy holds that the so-called diseases which have been given various names are merely external manifestations of the internal disorder ( dis-order ) exhibited by way of signs and symptoms , which may be physical , pathological , functional or psychological . <p> When a person dies what actually happens ? All organs cease to function . What was lost ? His energy which enabled the body to function . In homeopathy we term this energy as the ' vital force ' responsible for all the functions of the body including physiological function , cell development and every activity of a person . <p> The term dis-ease is when this vital force is altered or functions disturbed and needs to be reinstated back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make known its altered state is by producing signs and symptoms which are exhibited and felt by the person/s with dis-ease . This is termed as the external manifestation of the internal disorder and medical professionals select a group of signs and symptoms including the pathological changes and give them various terminologiesThe latest terminology Covid-19 or Corona is a good example of such a naming . <p> To reinstate the vital force to its original healthy state , Homeopathy follows the Law of Similar restores the vital force . This is done by administering extremely minute doses in restoring the balance and harmony of the body . <p> Q : Could you explain this more ? <p> A : Yes . Let me give an example . Take a cup of water and put a tablespoon of salt . You will feel the taste of the salt . Now take a large cauldron and do the same ; you will not taste the salt but the ' physics ' of the salt is there . Similarly , homeopathic medicines are made highly diluted and in atomic form for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are zero side effects . You can take it along with any other form of medicine such as Allopathy or Ayurveda.

From April onwards till June or July we can expect more rains and consequently an increase in the mosquito population . It is the female mosquito that bites and it needs about 4-5 feeds every day . <p> While not every mosquito carries the dengue virus , if an infected mosquito bites a person it could infect many others in the nearby vicinity at the same time . Young children are most at risk as their blood is fresh .

Therefore , they created dance based poses in their creations , especially in the Hindu icons , decorative pillar sculptures and carved sculptures of the walls . <p> Rhythmic vibrancy of dance poses of females along with the male dancers and male accompaniments are also well depicted on these wall friezes of the Polonnaruwa period . Similarly different poses of Ganas reveal and reflect close links and close association with the classical dance poses especially with different dance poses and with different dance nuances .

Regardless of the individual political ideologies , everyone in the country , except perhaps politicians , will hail this new philosophy as one of the best victories achieved by the people . <p> However , as the Finance Minister says , can a responsible citizen let the ship sink because he or she does not accept the captain 's behaviour ? The most certain answer is that no one can let that happen without going down with the ship themselves . Hence , it is time for the general public to get together in some form of mutual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Regretfully , the Parliament that represents the entire country does not show any sign of consensus .

Although these Parliamentary sittings burn millions of rupees of public funds , even at this most gruesome time , very few Parliamentarians show genuine interest in addressing the burning public issues . <p> Therefore , everyone must work in unison to force the Parliamentarians from both sides and those who are independent to ward off petty party politics and find a solution to establish political stability . Foreign lenders , donours , and well-wishers will almost certainly not look favorably on Sri Lanka if the political crisis remains unresolved . <p> The State can not function without a Cabinet of Ministers , as it is an important originator of legislation .

Sand grains are also necessary for the formation of the moon 's labyrinth terrains near the poles . <p> Researchers think these distinct crags could be like karsts in limestone on Earth -- but on Titan , they would be collapsed features made of dissolved organic sandstones . <p> River flow and rainstorms occur much more frequently near the poles , making sediments more likely to be transported by rivers than winds . <p> A similar process of sintering and abrasion during river transport could provide a local supply of coarse sand grains - the source for the sandstones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're showing that on Titan -- just like on Earth and what used to be the case on Mars -- we have an active sedimentary cycle that can explain the latitudinal distribution of landscapes through episodic abrasion and sintering driven by Titan 's seasons , ' Lap ? tre said . <p> ' It 's pretty fascinating to think about how there 's this alternative world so far out there , where things are so different , yet so similar .

Here the left side of the mole is dark and slightly raised , whereas the right side is lighter in colour and flat . <p> Melanoma Day was observed recently . The Sunday Observer spoke to Consultant Dermatologist and a senior member of the Sri Lanka College of Dermatologists , Dr. Januka Galahitiyawa to get more answers to this emerging disease which is still unfamiliar to most people in Sri Lanka . <p> Following are excerpts . <p> Q. Melanoma Day was observed recently . What is Melanoma and why is it important to set aside a special day to discuss it ? As this is a subject most readers are unfamiliar with , can you explain what it is in simple layman language for their benefit ? <p> A. Melanoma ( also called malignant melanoma ) is the most serious type of skin cancer , that starts in the pigment-producing skin cells ( melanocytes ) and the number of melanoma cases diagnosed annually is increasing faster than that for any other cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which you can do something about , others which are beyond your control . <p> Too much sun , particularly getting sunburnt , falls into the former category ' intermittent ' sun exposure is a major risk factor such as getting a lot of sun just a few times a year ; on holiday , for example , but then staying indoors , working in an office perhaps , for the rest of the year . People who are outside most of the time , like gardeners , are not at an increased risk of melanoma . About 6 out of 10 cases of melanoma are thought to be caused by sun exposure . <p> Q. Are fairer people more in danger of getting Melanoma than dark skinned people ? Why ? <p> A. Melanoma is uncommon in dark-skinned people , as they have more protective melanin in their skin , while those most at risk of sunlight skin damage are people with fair skin - in particular , those with skin which always burns and never tans , those with red or blond hair and green or blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> A. Sri Lankans have brown skin , ranging from light brown to dark brown skin . So we have eumelanin which protects us from sun damage . That said , even though the prevalence is low in Sri Lanka , still we have the risk of getting melanomas . <p> Q. So what are the factors that we can control ? <p> A. Using sunbeds or similar tanning machines which emit UV light . Damage caused by sunbeds seems to be worse in people with red hair and freckles and also in young people under the age of 20 years . Having a weakened immune system ( for example , due to HIV infection , or if you are taking immunosuppressive medicines , perhaps after an organ transplant ) also increases the chance of getting a melanoma . <p> Q. Factors beyond our control ? <p> A. Some people get melanoma without having had much sun exposure in their lives . For these people , melanoma has developed because of a genetic mutation : this is beyond their control and there is nothing that can be done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A. Though melanoma is mostly an adult disease , children 's skin is most vulnerable to damage . Sun exposure in childhood is the most damaging . People who had a lot of freckling in childhood , or had frequent or severe sunburn in childhood , are most at risk of developing melanoma as adults . The damage to the skin can occur many years before cancer actually develops . <p> Q. Can it be inherited ? If you have a family history of skin cancer will it make you too more vulnerable to Melanoma ? <p> A. According to a study approximately 5 -- 12 percent of melanomas are hereditary , and hereditary melanomas tend to have different mutation profiles to non-hereditary melanomas . A family history . If a close blood relative develops melanoma then your risk is approximately doubled . This increased risk may be due to a shared family lifestyle of frequent sun exposure and/or having fair skin . It may also be due to inherited faulty genes . <p> Around one in ten people with melanoma will have a relative who has also had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these and other genes which may be involved . Gene testing for melanoma is not yet possible . As a rule , if you have a family history of melanoma you should take extra care to protect your skin from sun damage . Also , check your skin regularly for early signs of melanoma <p> A. Melanomas generally grow from fresh skin . They are a new mole that grows over a few months . Generally speaking if you 've had a mole for years it is very unlikely to change into a melanoma . If a long-standing mole does change though , it 's always best to get it checked by a doctor.Melanomas can grow on skin that is very hard to see yourself : on the back of your shoulder blade , the sole of your foot , or in between your buttocks ( what doctors call the ' natal cleft ' ) . <p> Q. What are the first signs of Melonoma to watch out for ? <p> A. The features of asymmetry , poorly defined edges , variations in colour and larger size that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the benign moles which are smaller with well-defined edges and consistent colour . <p> Some melanomas are not dark , some are nice and smooth to the naked eye , and a melanoma has to start somewhere , so at some point it will have been small . The size of a mole does n't really correlate at all to whether it is cancerous . <p> Q. How is it diagnosed ? <p> A. Diagnosing melanoma with the naked eye is very hard and there are no particularly accurate ways to do it . Two scoring systems have been developed which can help guide patients and doctors as to whether a mole needs to be seen by a specialist : <p> The ABCDE rule : <p> Asymmetry of a mole ( not being a circle , or an oval ) . <p> Border irregularity ( instead of having a smooth outline ) . <p> Colour being uneven ( instead of one colour all over ) . <p> Diameter more than 6 mm . <p> E stands for evolving ( a mole that is changing or getting bigger ) or expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The 7-point checklist : <p> The three major features of change in size ; an irregular border ; or an irregular colour . <p> And the four minor features of a size more than 7 mm ; inflammation of a mole ( where it gets red ) ; oozing or crusting ; and a change in sensation or itch . <p> However , some melanomas score very low on these checklists and so you might be falsely reassured ; on the other hand some completely harmless moles or bumps score very highly and do n't need cutting out . <p> Most skin specialists , and some family doctors , use a handheld microscope called a dermatoscope to help diagnose melanoma . By looking closely at a mole through the dermatoscope a doctor can quite confidently ' rule out ' melanoma and tell you the mole is harmless <p> Q. Initial treatment for suspected Melanoma ? <p> A. If the dermatoscope shows a suspicious mole then most specialists will advise to have it cut out ( excised . If a melanoma is suspected the Dermatologist would do an excisional biopsy ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . ) . <p> If the doctor is sure that all the melanoma cells have been removed and the melanoma cells are confined to the top layer of skin , no further treatment may be needed .

The film 's subject matter was so sexually and politically shocking that Dal ? became infamous , causing quite a stir with the Parisian Surrealists . <p> The Surrealists considered recruiting Dal ? into their circle and , in 1929 , sent Paul Eluard and his wife Gala , along with Ren ?

Yet in the early 1930s , Dal ? took this concept a step further by creating his own Paranoic Critical Method , in which an artist could tap into their subconscious through systematic irrational thought and a self-induced paranoid state . <p> After emerging from a paranoid state , Dal ? would create " hand-painted dream photographs " from what he had witnessed , oftentimes culminating in works of vastly unrelated yet realistically painted objects ( which were sometimes intensified by techniques of optical illusion ) . <p> He believed that viewers would find intuitive connection with his work because the subconscious language was universal , and that , " it speaks with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , feeling of death , physical notion of the enigma of space - these vital constants are universally echoed in every human .

' s paintings were notably illustrative of his theories about the psychological state of paranoia and its importance as subject matter . <p> He painted bodies , bones , and symbolic objects that reflected sexualised fears of father figures and impotence , as well as symbols that referred to the anxiousness over the passing of time . Many of Dal ? ' s most famous paintings are from this highly creative period . <p> While his career was on the rise , Dal ? ' s personal life was undergoing change . Although he was both inspired and besotted by Gala , his father was less than enthused at this relationship with a woman ten years his son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic development was waning as Dal ? moved more toward the avant-garde . <p> The final straw came when Dal ? was quoted by a Barcelona newspaper as saying , " sometimes , I spit for fun on my mother 's portrait . " The elder Dal ? expelled his son from the family home at the end of 1929 . <p> The politics of war were at the forefront of Surrealist debates and in 1934 Breton removed Dal ? from the Surrealist group due to their differing views on communism , fascism , and General Franco . Responding to this expulsion Dal ? famously retorted , " I myself am Surrealism . " <p> For many years Breton , and some members of the Surrealists , would have a tumultuous relationship with Dal ? , sometimes honouring the artist , and other times disassociating themselves from him . And yet other artists connected to Surrealism befriended Dal ? and continued to be close with him throughout the years . <p> In the following years , Dal ? travelled widely , and practised more traditional painting styles that drew on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vermeer , though his emotionally charged themes and subject matter remained as strange as ever . <p> His fame had grown so widely that he was in demand by the rich , well known , and fashionable . In 1938 , Coco Chanel invited Dal ? to her home , " La Pausa , " on the French Riviera where he painted extensively , creating work later exhibited at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York . <p> But undoubtedly , Dal ? ' s true magic moment came that year when he met his hero , Sigmund Freud . After painting his portrait , Dal ? was thrilled to learn that Freud had said , " So far , I was led to consider completely insane the Surrealists , who I think I had been adopted as the patron saint . This young Spaniard with his candid , fanatical eyes and his undeniable technical mastery has made me change my mind . " <p> Around this time Dal ? also met a major patron , the wealthy British poet Sir Edward James . James not only purchased Dal ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years and collaborated on some of Dal ? ' s most famous pieces including The Lobster Phone ( 1936 ) and Mae West Lips Sofa ( 1937 ) - both of which decorated James ' house in Sussex , England . <p> The legacy of Salvador Dal ? <p> Dal ? epitomised the idea that life is the greatest form of art and he mined his with such relentless passion , purity of mission and diehard commitment to exploring and honing his various interests and crafts that it is impossible to ignore his groundbreaking impact on the art world . <p> His desire to continually and unapologetically turn the internal to the outside resulted in a body of work that not only evolved the concepts of Surrealism and psychoanalysis on a worldwide visual platform but also modeled permission for people to embrace their selves in all our human glory , warts and all . <p> By showing us visual representations of his dreams and inner world laid bare , through exquisite draftsmanship and master painting techniques , Dal ? opened a realm of possibilities for artists looking to inject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . <p> In post-war New York , these concepts were incorporated and transformed by Abstract Expressionists who used Surrealist techniques of automatism to express the subconscious through art , only now through gesture and colour . <p> Dal ? ' s use of wildly juxtaposing found objects to create sculpture helped shake the medium from its more traditional bones , opening the door for great Assemblage artists such as Joseph Cornell . Today , we can still see Dal ? ' s influence on artists painting in Surrealist styles , others in the contemporary visionary arts spheres and all over the digital art and illustration spectrums . <p> Dal ? ' s physical character in the world , eccentric and enigmatic , paved the way for artists to think of themselves as brands . He showed that there was no separation between Dal ? the man and Dal ? the work . <p> His use of avant-garde filmmaking , provocative public performance and random , strategic interaction brought his work alive in ways that differed from the painting - instead of the viewer merely looking at a beautiful work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in real life by a manifestation of Dal ? ' s imagination designed to unsettle and conjure reaction . <p> This could later be seen in artists like Yoko Ono . Andy Warhol would go on to concoct his own persona , environment and entourage in much the same way as would countless other 20th-century artists . In today 's social-media landscape , artists are almost expected to be visibly and socially just as interesting as their art work . <p> Dal ? also spearheaded the idea that art , artist and artistic ability could cross many mediums and become a viable commodity . <p> His exhaustive endeavours into fields ranging from fine art to fashion to jewelry to retail and theatre design positioned him as a prolific businessman as well as creator . Unlike mass merchandising , which is often disdained in the art world , Dal ? ' s hand touched such a variety of products and places , that literally anyone in the world could own a piece of him . <p> Today this practice is so common that we find great architects like Frank Gehry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Baldessari lending his images to skateboard decks .

Ashamed Buddhist faithful may also say ' yes ' . But many citizens of all religions and no religions , recalling our bloody history of majoritarian ethnic arrogance and repeated repressive violence against both rebelling ethnic minorities and insurgent rural youth , will acknowledge the violence , including anti-religious violence , on all sides . <p> If post-colonial Lankan ( ' Sri ' is not worth using at present ) history is to be understood well , then it must be acknowledged that the cumulative socio-historical <p> experience has been one of **25;1179;TOOLONG oppression and marginalisation of not just ethnic , religious , minorities but also of various genders , castes ( in electoral gerrymandering ) , and even the differently abled . This oppression of the numerical minorities leaves the religio-ethnic and masculine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Note that the political-economic structure of the modern Lankan State is also industriously mauling our island 's serendipitous ecology . <p> The usually fragrant Araliya flowers that adorn ' Temple Trees ' must surely be withering in the atmosphere of hate speech , anger and political hysteria in recent days . Known throughout British colonial South Asia as ' Temple ' flowers because of their constant use in Hindu , Buddhist , and Jaina ritual in temples and as sacred garlands , the flower is even depicted in the Sigirya frescoes . <p> ' Araliya Gaha Mandiraya ' was named ' Temple Trees ' by its British owner of the time , a mid-19th century colonial businessman . It was later sold to the colonial government and became the official residence of the Colonial Secretary . After 1948 , the venerable building became the permanent official residence of Prime Ministers and even two Presidents of the country . Given the sacred value of the flower , in addition to its official political significance , the ' Mandiraya ' and its official occupants are seen as blessed by the ambience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is its symbolic and political significance , ' Temple Trees ' soon became a focal point of State power and also a target of those wanting to overthrow the State or to seize power . The 1962 coup d ' ? tat plotters made the Prime Minister 's Official Residence their main target and managed to get the armoured vehicles guarding the mansion withdrawn . But the coup plotters were rounded up before they could strike . Similarly , the original JVP movement , in its 1971 insurgency , planned to attack then Premier Sirimavo Bandaranaike at her private residence in Rosmead Place . As the insurgency broke on 5 April , the Premier , as well as several top Ministers , were all re-located in the better defended ' Temple Trees ' . In fact , the mansion reportedly became the core command centre for operations to crush the insurgency . <p> The very person who resigned on the grounds of popular demand , but also openly facilitated mass violence from his official residence itself , is currently enjoying the luxury of State ' security ' in the comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who suffered from the violence are injured or displaced from their peaceful protest sites and thousands of other protestors round the country now risk lethal firing by troops <p> During the Tamil Eelam separatist war , intelligence that the Liberation Tigers were to use their makeshift combat planes to strike at the Mandiraya had prompted the placement of anti-aircraft guns adjoining the compound of the mansion which President Chandrika Kumaratunge used as her official residence . <p> Ironically , the Governor 's Mansion in the Colombo Fort , which later became the Janadhipathi Mandiraya ( President 's Palace ) , was never seen as such a centre of power although it has always remained heavily guarded . <p> 9 May 2022 , brought a shameful and system-threatening reversal of the use of this symbolically and politically significant mansion . This ' palace of the sacred flowers ' ( Araliya Gaha Mandiraya ) , this epicentre of Republican power , instead became the epicentre of a violent attack on the people , seemingly engineered by the official chief occupant himself along with several Ministerial colleagues and other officers . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol of the nation , to all Sri Lankans , ' Temple Trees ' is synonymous with Democracy , whether Westminster-style or ' Gaulist ' . Even the most vociferously hardline Buddhist activist groups , even those led by Theras ( let alone the Venerable Sangha Nayakas ) , have not dared make divisive or exclusivist exhortations ( leave aside actual organising activity or plotting ) from within the Sri Dalada Maligava 's sacred precincts , nor within similar sacred sites such as in Anuradhapura or Mihintale . Physical violence has never emanated from within any sacred religious site -- Buddhist , Hindu , Muslim , Christian -- on this island that people are proud to call the " Dharma Dveepa " . <p> But on 9 May , not only did the , then , Prime Minister and , some of his ministerial and party associates , clearly organise and host a large gathering of party loyalists , but they also clearly incited the crowd in various ways , some more so and others less explicitly , and mobilised their audience into an angry mob -- all inside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prime Minister of the Republic . <p> Worse , once the mob was aroused , this angered crowd then appeared to have been equipped with metal rods and poles , and they came directly out of the PM 's official residence to begin their violent actions against a notably peaceful civilian protest site immediately outside . Far worse , having beaten up the peaceful protestors and destroyed their Mynah Go Gama campsite , this same mob marched a whole kilometre and similarly attacked the , now historic , Gota Go Gama site right in front of the Office of the President of the Republic ! <p> Not only did this violent , explicitly anti-democratic , rampage begin from within the Official Residence of the Prime Minister , but the violence was perpetrated right in front of both the PM 's Official Residence as well as right in front of the Office of the President . These two official facilities being key installations of the State , the violence was directly threatening national security . Furthermore , the organised violence was perpetrated during a State of Emergency , when the activated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order and the security of the citizenry . <p> Most significantly , the endangering of two key installations of the State brings these acts of organised , pre-meditated violence directly within the ambit of the Prevention of Terrorism Act ( PTA ) . The video evidence of the hosting of the gathering of ( pro-government ) party supporters inside ' Temple Trees ' , the arousing of their anger and hostility towards the peaceful ( anti-government ) protest movement , and , finally , of the movement of this angry mob directly out of ' Temple Trees ' , is available . <p> There has been no official denial either by the President 's Office or by the Prime Minister 's Office or Official Residence , that this organised violence that starkly threatened national security originated in ' Temple Trees ' . Nor has there been any denial that the Prime Minister himself had been present and addressed that gathering that eventually stormed forth to wreak violence . That some low-ranking institutional security officials and other functionaries of ' Temple Trees ' and top police officers , are being questioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state institution at the heart of the Republic . <p> What is most evident is that some 48 hours following this flagrantly subversive activity emanating from within the heart of the State and with ample indications of the active involvement of the chief occupant at Temple Trees and others inside the building , there is no move to arrest and question the former Prime Minister or any of the others . <p> It is possible to relate this terrible behaviour by top State officers inside and outside key State installations to at least three or four types of criminal offences . At the lowest level there is the offence of incitement to disturb the peace . Next there is the violation of the State of Emergency . Next there is the threatening of national security , which is addressed by the Prevention of Terrorism Act . Additionally , these activities inside ' Temple Trees ' could easily be interpreted as a violation of the Establishment Code and a flagrant misuse of public property . <p> Instead , the former chief occupant of ' Temple Trees ' has been allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , family and all , to what appears to be military protection in our principal naval base of Trincomalee . <p> Such is the paradox of a former " liberal democratic republic " now turned playground and site of plunder and political rage by a nepotistic regime . <p> The very person who resigned on the grounds of popular demand , but also openly facilitated mass violence from his official residence itself , is currently enjoying the luxury of State ' security ' in the comfort of our premier naval base . Meanwhile , the citizenry who suffered from the violence are injured or displaced from their peaceful protest sites and thousands of other protestors round the country now risk lethal firing by troops . <p> And the causes of all this unrest -- namely the massive plunder , politico-economic mismanagement and socio-economic deprivation -- all remain unresolved . The principal subject of public calls for removal , the President himself , is also refusing to move aside for other alternative political arrangements to be tried out . The sudden appointment of Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister is another bizarre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' by his own voter constituency has appointed as PM the person who has been labelled ' Loser ' by his own party membership and voter constituency ! <p> Is this ' democracy ' of any sort ? The official residence of the PM has become a house of thuggery . Why is there no move to detain the organisers of the ' Temple Trees ' thuggery ? Will the Rajapaksas join the many other dictator families living in luxurious exile ? An example <p> Is Sri Lanka now the living lie to the exceptionalism of Liberal Democracy ? Purists and idealists will note the schizoid nature of a political culture that enables thuggery under official auspices , brazenly launched from official venues . <p> In European medieval times , feudal loyalist troops did sally forth from the castles of the barons to crush peasant resistance . But we have no record of such troops sallying forth directly from our historic palaces and citadels . Certainly , in modern times , there does not seem to be a record of any thugs or troops sallying forth from official residences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is this a unique contribution of Mahinda Rajapaksa to the record of political leadership ? The Ranasinghe Premadasa regime 's ( with Ranil Wickremesinghe as PM ) ' dirty war ' against the JVP 's second insurgency , probably resulted in the same number of death squad victims as did civilian victims in the armed forces operations against the separatist insurgency -- up to 100,000 according to some estimates . But even if plotting of this morally despicable activity probably occurred inside official residences and offices , there was not even a hint that actual thug bands or death squads were deployed directly from inside such respectable official facilities . <p> So even if previous regimes ' barbarities also point to such political-cultural schizophrenia ( ' dharma chakraya ' was the slang term for a particular torture method here ) , what happened on 9 May takes things to a schizoid peak . <p> How do we re-legitimise such a battered republic ?

Different industries , and celebrities , companies and more , joined in . The Rambukkana shooting incident was responded to by the larger community with great poise and restraint , all expressing remorse and disgust at the tactics . <p> Countries around the world expressed solidarity and admiration and insisted people be allowed to protest peacefully and democratically . And amidst whatever private gnashing of teeth and blood pressure spikes , everyone abided .

Anger begat anger and we forget the wisdom of Gandhi or Martin Luther King .

That the most recent televised misadventures came as something of an anticlimax is cause for much relief . The unkindest thing that could be said about the president 's thought process is that he is now a past-master at stirring up apathy if and when ' his excellency ' deigns to address the nation . <p> At least it was aired on a private TV channel ; was mercifully brief , which was the best thing that could be said about it ; and spared the polity any serious pretension of being a ' national address ' . <p> All the president 's men <p> The chief executive was painfully laboured in his delivery but lamentably predictable in his deliberations .

Perhaps he is no longer persuaded by the dispassionate rationales spewed out by his now-discredited bureaucrats and others on whom the regime was banking ? Either way , there was no mention of root causes of the present dire straits in which we find ourselves . Only the laboured point that he is at great pains to facilitate the solutions through political dialogue . Tell that to the marines , sir -- ahem , the military traversing the mean streets . <p> Meanwhile , the commander-in-chief took great delight in the imposition of Emergency regulations that are evidently his shield and buckler in this frightening milieu . And his majority-ordained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shoot on sight obviously reassures the president more than it reassures the people from all walks of life who have been raising a clenched fist at an entrenched autocracy and speaking truth to power out of control for months .

Sorry . <p> The all-powerful head of government -- post cabinet resignation en masse necessitated by the ignominious prime ministerial exit -- was keen to major on military-led stability . While he assumes that the parliamentary establishment will play ball with his efforts to introduce the stability of the political culture , it was nowhere near being a nod to previously admitted ' mistakes made ' and the admission that the ' anger of the people is justified ' . And the individual who he thinks is the head of a future cabinet that commands the confidence of parliament only indicates he is not likely to confess any more misdemeanours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or his high horse . <p> The usual suspects whose names were being bandied about curfew-time cocktail circuit and emergency hamstrung social media only underlines how out-of-touch the political establishment is with the pulse of the people , and how tone-deaf our governors can choose to continue to be . <p> Is it because they 're still ensconced in the corridors of power despite the baying at the barricades ? Snug behind the state-erected military facades and armed battalions no longer confined to garrisons ?

And just like that , is arguably the most dictatorial national leader since possibly JR -- that Old Fox who lumped us with the ' cheat sheet ' against democracy -- going to jettison 20A and that infamous 2/3rds ?

The hunter in chasing the fox may be the unspeakable in pursuit of the unspeakable -- but the fox , old or not , hunting itself is a fairy-tale pastime no one is going to buy .

The snubbed joint opposition will find itself rather hamstrung between the autocracy of Gota and the clinical technocracy cum realpolitik of RW . <p> Still , the penny has n't dropped with either of these two mandarins : that whether or not ' GotaGoHome ' goes from ' going ' to ' gone ' , the old political culture is well and truly on its way out as far as the peace-loving , justice-oriented , average-voter-joe , decent-jane , **27;1233;TOOLONG goes ... even if the military says no more saying so on the streets , or the SJB and JVP suddenly lose their vim , vigour and vitality . <p> So , can we assume that a tone-deaf president is being deaf to the cries that once emanated from all over Sri Lanka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green ?

Subversively dismissed by a fifth column leading a rearguard action to simultaneously discredit the corruption-exposing JVP and undermine the dangerously apolitical gravitas of the original GGG ? <p> Too little , too late <p> A ' Government of Reversals ' is one thing -- it simply shores up the perception of an incompetent administration that once had two heads ; who , between them , could not make up their mind to implement a single idea in a united fashion in the national interest without a plethora of gazettes to revoke them . Now , it has two who are clearly of one mind when it comes to a return to the system of checks and balances that one of the clearly repudiated ; and which the people rejected in his name ... <p> A ' reversal of government ' is quite another matter .

It is a concern for the cohorts of rascals who would cling perilously to the skirts of residual power in the executive now that the shrine of the egregious soothsayers are but dust beneath the chariots of rage and a right-royal wrath that razed it to the ground . <p> For one , the democratic impulse is a notoriously mercurial inclination . Will Gotabaya rally around RW 's " House " for a returning of the sceptre that many have craved and none wielded with honour ?

On the one hand , will the programme to clean up government take on fresh steam under the aegis of premier who can no longer seek refuge behind the screen of a putative Mr. Clean ? On the other , will the country be taken to the cleaners again -- and impunity for a larger and more inclusive set of rogues and strippers of national assets be the ongoing order of the day ? <p> For yet another , even a government of convenience headed by a prime minister who is ostensibly adroit -- and therefore best , his defenders would plead -- at negotiating with the IMF can be sacked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is already naked ) .

The Mahaweli also contributed significantly to our energy security , and if not for Mahaweli hydropower , we would be experiencing much more severe power cuts today . <p> Unfortunately , since then , no government has taken up the issue of energy security seriously . Many of our governments have added to the problem by investing in more fossil fuel consuming energy plants . In addition to requiring vast sums of dollars every year , these products are also highly susceptible to global market conditions as we are experiencing now . We have only played lip service to developing renewable energy projects . <p> To achieve energy security , we need commitment at the highest level to generate a major portion of our energy from renewable sources . Just as JR did in the ' 80s , the President needs to be involved in directing the program , creating new laws , deregulating the existing industry and creating the environment for the massive investment required . In the case of the Mahaweli , President JR 's involvement in accelerating the 30-year project was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to six , obtained World Bank support , spoke directly to leaders of friendly nations seeking their assistance , directed the drafting of new laws and handpicked the most capable man in his team for the job , Gamini Dissanayake as the Minister of the new Mahaweli Development Ministry . <p> He overlooked the project at every stage and was there to overcome many of the obstacles that came up during the contracting and implementation stages . Many , including the World Bank and his own Finance Minister , Ronnie De Mel , thought the project was too large for Sri Lanka to bear . His conviction and commitment succeeded ; a 30-year project was completed in six years , giving us food security that we enjoy even today . <p> Our current energy crisis has led to an economic crisis , which has created doubt in governance itself . The campaign to remove the President and all 225 members of Parliament is reasonable . Their lack of action has created a crisis that affects every family in Sri Lanka . However , a push for a 21st Amendment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a surreptitious attempt to ride on the campaign of the protestors . Dismantling the executive presidency will make solving our energy crisis even more difficult . Imagine implementing large scale wind and solar projects around the island when de facto federalism takes hold of our provinces with the removal of the President 's authority . <p> Just as in the implementation of the Mahaweli project , it is the strength of the executive presidency and the stability it gives that will allow the Government to take the difficult decisions to give us energy security . New laws , deregulation of the energy sector , allowing market forces to work , removal of subsidies , retrenchment of excess staff , deconstructing existing cartels and bringing in massive investment are some of what need to be done . <p> As JRJ said when first proposing the executive presidential system , " Not subject to the whims and fancies of an elected legislature ; not afraid to take the correct but unpopular decisions because of fear of censure from his parliamentary party " is what we require . No prime minister who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achieve this . <p> The powerful energy cartels , will never allow a prime minister who is dependent on his parliamentary majority to deregulate and liberalise their industry . We need the strength and the independence of the executive presidency to overcome this crisis . Our situation is not a failure of the presidency ; it is the fault of successive presidents not using the power of the presidency to fix the most challenging problem we face today -- energy security . <p> ( The writer is a pioneer solar energy entrepreneur who initiated the successful rooftop solar program .

@@90774240 <h> Classified <h> Other <h> Unfolding the enigma of Sara Jasmine <p> What happened to the girl who dreamt of becoming a medical doctor but turned into a suicide bomber for IS which led to the attacks on Easter in 2019 ? <p> Who is Sara ? Was she really a suicide bomber brainwashed through Islamic extremism or a mole planted by a spy agency to track the motives of Islamic extremists who led the Easter attacks which killed nearly 300 innocent people and wounded many more ? Why is this mysterious lady continuing to dominate headlines while giving conspiracy theoreticians importance ? Let us take a close look at the events surrounding her life during the Easter carnage in 2019 . <p> Two days before the suicide attacks , Zahran Hashim 's wife Hadiya alias Siththiya , Muhammadu Hasthun 's wife Sara alias Pulastini Mahendran , and Mohammed Azad 's wife Abdul Raheem Feroza along with a few others left for Kanthankudy to find their safe place to buy time for possible subsequent attacks . They had brought a vehicle from Kattankudy to pick them up . The van was driven by Riyaz , a close associate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kattankudy , they did not forget to buy white colour clothes from Jayasundara Textiles , a shop located in Giriulla . Feroza carrying Hadiya 's daughter entered the clothing store followed by Hadiya and Sara . It has been confirmed that Hadiya had bought two outfits , Sara four and Feroza three . Authentic sources reaffirmed that they have bought white clothes to use during Iddah after the deaths of their husbands . According to Islam , Iddah or " Iddat is an Arabic term which means the period of waiting and is observed by Muslim women . It is a period of chastity which a Muslim woman is bound to observe after the dissolution of her marriage due to the death of her husband or by divorce before she can lawfully marry again . " <p> As per the Quran described , the observing period for a widow is four months and ten days . But some sources suspected that they have bought the white clothes for detonating bombs at targeted locations though there is no evidence to support it . However , investigators have found substantive evidence to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks . <p> It was in the afternoon of 18 April in Colombo for the first time that Zahran told Hadiya that he and his group were planning to leave for Hijra known as greater emigration , and requested her and the kids to live with his parents if he did not return . " In the Islamic tradition , Hijrah refers to Prophet Muhammad 's migration from Makkah to Medina in 622 CE . However , the Islamic State ( IS ) has manipulated this term to attract Muslim followers to its territories . " Zahran vowed that all responsibilities would be taken care of by his brother Rilwan alias Abu Kital . Then Zahran asked Rilwan to take his wife and two children along with others in the group to Kattankudy immediately . <p> As scheduled , the group left Colombo for Eastern Province via Panadura on the morning of 19 April and reached a safe house in Nintavur , Kathankudy at around 2:30 a.m. on 20 April . The group included Hadiya , her two children , Sara , Rilwan , Feroza , and Riyaz , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months that the extended family members , including Zahran 's parents , had met . From 20 to 26 April 2019 , the group used various tactics to hide from the security forces . Investigations have revealed that they used several houses in the area as safe houses during this short period . Eventually , their last hideout was a single-storey house in the Bolivarian village in the Saindamaradu area . <p> It was the late afternoon of 26 April 2019 , and the area , like many other places in the country was drowning in fear due to the most horrendous coordinated terrorist attacks in history . Several people in the mosque turned their attention to two men who went to pray at the Jumma Mosque that afternoon because of their suspicious behaviour . It did not take long to spread the news ; many people were sceptical about the newcomers to their village . <p> The group chose to hide in a house in Bolivarian village in Saindamaradu area and determined that no one would pay attention to them . But their assumption was wrong . Bolivarian village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land selected for this project was previously used for paddy cultivation but due to its environmental difficulties , it was decided to use for the project . As a result of this project , the area was renamed the Bolivarian Village . <p> The group chose to hide in asbestos sheeted single floor house which has only one gate to enter or exit . It is a two-door black colour gate about seven feet high . Surrounded by four walls , the house consisted of a fairly large living area followed by a small veranda , two bedrooms , a kitchen and a toilet with a small shower area . The toilet was located near the kitchen , bordering a blind high wall about three feet from the kitchen wall . The house has a back door that allows access to the yard from the kitchen and enters the toilet . Even though that door , there is only one main gate for anyone to leave the house . <p> As of 26 April 2019 , 19 people , including Zahran 's family members , were staying in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including explosives , and currency notes . According to sources , Zahran 's father Hayatu Mohammed , mother Synthi , wife Hadiya and her son Waseeth and daughter Rudaiyna , Rilwan , his wife Fatima Nafna , their children Mhra and Saheed , Sheini , his wife Fatima Afrin , their children Hamama and Umar , Zahran 's sister Hidayah , her husband Rishad , and their daughter Rubeiyda , Zahran 's second sister 's husband Niaz , Sara and Feroza lived there . <p> The security forces received a message that a suspicious group was staying in the house around 4 p.m. on 26 April , according to information provided by the people living in the village and the trustee of the Jumma Mosque . The security forces in charge of the area decided to search the house accordingly . Before the search of the house , the Army immediately deployed security forces to cover the entrance or exit area of the house . That was the time that Rilwan issued the video message saying that the house was surrounded by troops in his term " dogs " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of Allah . <p> " By the grace of Allah , by the grace of Allah , we will get ready for what we have planned to do . We will rid this country of dogs and non-Muslims for they have no place . We will continue our effort until they are punished , may Allah be with us . Even if we died , we will die as martyrs . What we plan to do will take place at every venue . Stay with us , stay strong , believe in our word . Allah never fails to answer the prayers of the faithful . These people who do us wrong will face three times the revenge of God . This is our Jihad . We ask for this on the day of Yamul Qiyamaha where every prayer is answered and every plea is heard by Allah . Allah never fails to answer those prayers , " a joint video issued on social media by Rilwan , his father , and Shaini who was holding his son Umar on his lap were pledged . <p> However , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shaini and Niaz made a desperate attempt to prevent the army from entering the house and fired at the army . Niaz went out of the gate and tried to shoot at the army , but he was killed by the army in retaliation . His body was found about 10 metres from the entrance gate of the house . Shaini 's body was also found lying in the yard of the house . Only Zahran 's wife Hadiya and her daughter survived with bad injures . Everyone else in the house was killed in the blasts . The other members of the household at the time were believed to be Hayatu Mohammed , Synthi , Rilwan , Fatima Nafna , Mihra , Saheed , Fatima Afrin , Hamama , Umar , Hidayah , Rishad , Rebeida , Sara , Feroza , and Zahran 's son Waseeth all of whom were believed to have died in the series of blasts . <p> Here , the first focus of the investigation on how Hadiya and her daughter survived was a matter of fate . Accordingly , a lot of important data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force members have surrounded the house , they all began to wash and clean their hands and feet as quickly as possible . Meanwhile , Rilwan was preparing to blow up the gas cylinder in the house and the fuel tank of the motorcycle which was kept inside the living area . <p> Rilwan then assisted the others to tie up the suicide kits at home after tying up his suicide kit . Since then , Sara and Feroza have been wearing suicide kits . Hadiya has stated that she had witnessed the two of them wearing suicide kits and , Sara invites Hadiya to join them immediately to go to heaven . At that moment , Hadiya had gone with her daughter from the living room to the toilet first and then to the next bedroom . At that moment bombs exploded . Consequently , Hadiya fainted and fell . Hours later , security forces rushed her and her daughter to the hospital , and dead bodies were taken to post-mortems . Only a few bodies were found that could be easily identified . The bodies of all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On 28 and 29 April 2019 , the forensic pathologist in charge of the area sent the bodies and body parts for post-mortem examination and obtained biopsy samples for DNA testing . After obtaining the approval of the court , the samples were referred to the Government Analyst . Unfortunately , three of those biological tissue samples had expired , the Analyst told the court on 15 May 2019 . The police then referred the case to the CID for further investigation . <p> Permission was sought from the court on 7 June 2019 , to obtain biopsy samples for DNA testing again from the relevant body parts , stating that three of the biopsy samples obtained were tainted . The bodies of 10 adults and one child were recovered and samples were taken for DNA testing . The Judicial Medical Officer and the CID were present but for whatever reason , the Analyst 's Department officials did not attend . However , the DNA samples taken a second time were immediately sent for tests . <p> The results of those investigations were reported to the court three months later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test report , the DNA tests could not confirm everyone in the house . Many questions than answers arose . Is it because they are not able to focus on certain parts when taking DNA samples ? If not , was the number of persons in the house by the time of the explosions mentioned by Zahran 's wife wrong ? Did anyone in the house escape before the explosion or at the time of the military operation ? These questions made the incident even more controversial . Most people 's attention is drawn to Sara Jasmine , who returned from Colombo on 19 April with Hadiya and others . Because DNA tests could not confirm her body but all others . <p> What happened to Sara Jasmine , the wife of Abu Muhammad alias Mohammed Hashtun , the man who bombed St. Sebastian 's Church in Katuwapitiya , Negombo ? Some speculators and conspiracy theorists came up with many stories . One such story is that she has fled to India via Mannar with the support of a police officer as she was a mole of a spy agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of stories were based on speculation and unsubstantiated rumours circulating throughout society . Therefore , it is important to look carefully at the actions taken by the officials of the law enforcement agencies in this country . <p> However , what we can reaffirm now is that the officials responsible for the first DNA tests on the victims of the explosions at the Bolivarian village house in Saindamaruthu did not pay keen attention to taking biopsy samples . Then , samples were taken from only a selected few bodies during the second round of DNA tests . <p> Evidence , meanwhile , showed that there was a difference between the number of people staying in the house and the number of bodies confirmed by DNA tests after the explosions . This discrepancy led to a wide social controversy and the truth was questioned . The basis for that controversy was that there was a political conspiracy behind this attack , and those who were behind the attacks helped Sara to escape . But when all the incidents in this chain of events are intertwined , it is very clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is a political conspiracy behind this or anyone who helped Sara to escape . <p> However , Hadiya has reconfirmed on several occasions that Sara Jasmine was present at the time of the explosions in the house . She also confirmed that she was wearing a suicide kit given by Rilwan . Shaini and Riyaz came out of the house and opened fire on the security forces , while three powerful explosions were reported inside the house . There is no credible evidence that anyone left the house after the explosions . As mentioned above , there is only one gate to enter and exit the house , which is surrounded by over seven feet high walls . It is also reported that a large number of people were watching the operation . Is it possible that anyone could have left the house at or after the explosions under such circumstances ? Maj. Gen. Mahinda Mudalige , who commanded the Army in the operation , made it very clear that no one was able to escape after the Army surrounded the house since 6 p.m. on 26 April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains as there is no scientific evidence to prove that she was dead . Meanwhile , a senior police officer attached to the Colombo Crimes Division has been assigned to the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to investigate the Easter terrorist attacks . It was 27 November 2019 . He reported that Sarah Jasmine had escaped while presenting before the Commission a testimony given by one of his informants as an eyewitness to the incident . Reports indicated that he used a single statement of the relevant informant without any substantive details to prove the allegation . It is also clear that no detailed background study or mobile phone analysis has been conducted on the informant before presenting the evidence . So this so-called informant had changed his statements from time to time on several occasions . <p> According to the evidence presented in the Kalmunai Magistrate 's Court , the informant of the police officer who worked in the Presidential Commission had obtained information from his driver , Sivalingam Ravindran . Based on his statement , one Selvaraja Devakumar and a Chief Inspector Abubakar , both residents of Kalawanchikudi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged with aiding and abetting Sara Jasmine 's escape . However , the person who allegedly provided information to the police officer 's informant has made contradictory statements on several occasions and later admitted before the Kalmunai Magistrate 's court that he had given false information . He also said that the police officer 's informant had asked him to tell him that he had seen the woman fleeing in the hope of getting a cash reward . <p> Based on the findings of the investigations carried out so far , two basic facts can be inferred . The first is that his informant had misled the police officer who was in charge of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to settle certain personal grievances . Second , Sara Jasmine 's escape to India for some reason may have been a deliberate fabrication by all involved including the police officer to get possible benefits . <p> However , there is still no credible evidence to prove that Sara Jasmine died in the bombings at home . Also , there is no credible evidence to prove that she fled the house at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defects in two rounds of DNA testing and the nature of collecting biopsy samples . In this context , there are only several ideas that are said to have been given by people who claim to be informants and some of the assumptions that have been made are based on those ideas . <p> Contd. on Page 11 <p> ( The views expressed in this article are the writer 's own and do not reflect the official policy or position of any other organisation or employer he is affiliated to . ) <p> But here are a few basic facts to keep in mind . First , the allegations made by the informants that Sara Jasmine fled with the assistance of a police officer have been admitted by the court to be false themselves . Second , Zahran 's wife , Hadiya , has repeatedly stated that she witnessed Sara Jasmine wearing a suicide kit at the time of the blasts . It has also been confirmed that Shyam , a resident of Kalmunai , who was arrested on intelligence , has witnessed that Sara Jasmine was staying in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final video message that he had three wives of three people who had gone to heaven a few days earlier with him and that they too would go to heaven soon . Based on these facts , it is not wrong to believe that Sarah Jasmine was present at the time of the house explosion . <p> Mahendran Pulasthini alias Sara Jasmine was born on 7 March 1996 at the Kalawanchikudi Hospital . Hospital records reconfirmed that the mother had given birth to a baby girl at the hospital at 8:30 a.m. on the same day . Born into a Hindu family , later converted to Islam due to a love affair , Sara 's life with many controversial events is very important to understand the different dimensions of the Easter attacks and the nature of the threats that may come in the future . Most importantly what happened to this girl who dreamt of becoming a medical doctor but turned into a suicide bomber for IS which led to the attacks on Easter in 2019 ? So it is very important to find out if she is alive or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . <p> Against this backdrop , a third official request was made to the Security Council to obtain biopsies of the bodies of those killed in the explosions and to conduct DNA testing . That was two years ago , on the second day of February 2020 . The request was made by Maj. Gen. Suresh Sallay , director of the State Intelligence Service . He made that request , focusing on several very important issues . <p> The head of state intelligence , over two years ago , observed that it was important to confirm the status of Sara Jasmine and the failure to do so could lead to serious security , legal , and social implications in the future . However , for a variety of reasons including the pandemic , the third round of DNA tests took a longer time than expected . <p> Finally , several senior police officers went with the Government Analyst on 7 May 2021 , for a site inspection of the crime scene to resolve the controversy that was emerging throughout the society . They did not forget to take Zahran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Following the site inspection , on 16 August 2021 , the Government Analyst submitted a report to the CID making recommendations and observations on the matter . Saman Weerasinghe , a Chief Investigating Officer of the Police , was instructed to retrieve the biopsy samples for further DNA testing to implement those recommendations immediately . Unfortunately , Weerasinghe died of illnesses , and the process had taken more time to obtain the necessary court order to collect the relevant biopsies . <p> When the case was taken to court on 21 March 2022 , the police were able to obtain the relevant court order and the court was given time from 8 to 12 April to obtain the relevant biopsy samples . However , the forensic pathologist in charge of the area was informed that he could not attend due to the urgent duties previously assigned to him . Therefore , 27 April was the date on which all responsible parties could participate . Accordingly , the body parts were exhumed and the required samples were taken for DNA testing . This time , the Judicial Medical Officer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from all the relevant body parts . Therefore , this time the test will be crucial . It is to be hoped that there will be a clear scientific answer to the widespread rumours about Sara Jasmine . <p> However , no one has the right to say for sure whether Sara Jasmine died in the incident until confirmed by thorough investigation . The unknown factors of her life as well as her current status have had a more controversial impact . This incident teaches us that it is very difficult and tedious to get the true picture of the incident which is surrounded by misinformation spread in the society through various elements and prejudices . <p> According to the evidence of those she last met , 23-year-old Sara Jasmine was born into a Hindu family and later converted to Islam and accepted violent extremism as the sole way to forever lasting liberation . Suicide bombers created by the LTTE and suicide bombers manufactured by Islamic extremism have opened up a new social dimension that we were reluctant to see . This abysmal transformation that takes place in someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for an in-depth study of the society in which we live . Preventing the recurrence of such violent tendencies can not be achieved by clinging to various conspiracies . <p> Social crises always make man think . How many people adapt to those temptations and focus on studying them ? But unfortunately , many people tend to use any social event very easily to achieve narrow political objectives rather than seizing the opportunity to make a greater social contribution . If we close the path to the search for truth ourselves , we will become accustomed to gathering around the delusion . When delusion becomes the primary driving force in our lives , we inherit slavery over individual liberty . This is why the enigma of Sara Jasmine must be scientifically revealed . It is a form of collective social responsibility .

@@91154234 <h> Time to bring Hasaranga back for Tests ? <p> Wanindu Hasaranga has been Sri Lanka 's biggest match-winner in the limited-overs formats for a few years now . A product of Richmond College , the leg-spinner ended up being the highest wicket-taker in the T20 World Cup last year as well as the Abu Dhabi T10 while capturing 26 wickets in arguably the biggest cricket festival in the world -- the Indian Premier League ( IPL ) . <p> Despite the limited-overs success , Hasaranga has not been able to carry his form into Test cricket taking only four wickets in four matches at an average of over 100 , in complete contrast to his T20I average of 13.75 . <p> The 24-year-old has not been considered for Test cricket since April 2021 as the selectors gave opportunities for the spin trio of Ramesh Mendis , Lasith Embuldeniya and Praveen Jayawickrama . <p> While their performances at home have been impressive , they were disastrous in the last couple of away series . In India although they were able to pick up wickets on rank turners , they leaked far too many runs against ofcourse quality batting line-ups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Bangladesh . <p> Surprisingly , Bangladesh had not prepared wickets that were turning from the day one , but somehow Bangladesh spinners , led by Shakib al Hasan ( 9 ) , Nayeem Hasan ( 6 ) , Taijul Islam ( 4 ) were among the wickets . In comparison Embuldeniya ( 1 ) , Mendis ( 1 ) and Jayawickrama ( 0 ) were quite awful . <p> On the other hand , none of these bowlers have contributed with the bat either . While Jayawickrama and Embuldeniya are purely bowlers , Mendis has disappointed with the bat despite the very decent first-class batting record -- the off-spinner still looks million miles away from being an all-rounder . <p> Captain Dimuth Karunaratne is a very calm and cool character , but even the senior man could not resist taking a dig at the spinners following the 1-0 series win in Bangladesh , claiming that he was ' disappointed ' with the performances of the spinners . <p> It is fair to say that the national selectors have n't always given him the best options in terms of team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's premier fast bowler Dushmantha Chameera for the Indian Test series a couple of months ago , but then midway through the tour they informed Karunaratne that he can not be picked for the playing XI because they are saving him for the T20 World Cup later in the year . <p> Karunaratne would certainly need a much stronger bowling attack against Australia as it is an extremely important series in the ICC Test Championship . <p> When Sri Lanka hammered Australia 3-0 in 2016 , Rangana Herath was the hero for the home team , and then captain of Australia Steven Smith said after the series , " Herath gives you no freebies " , which was one of the reasons why he was so successful taking as much as 28 wickets in three Tests . But the current spin trio of Sri Lanka gives away far too many freebies . <p> Malinda Pushpakumara or Prabath Jayasuriya could certainly be better options in home conditions , but the selectors would not go back to the two veteran spinners as they have always opted for youngsters , but out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably be the best pick . <p> The Australian batting line-up consists of at least four left-handers , with the likes of David Warner , Usman Khawaja , Travis Head and Alex Carry expected to feature , which is certainly not a good sign for the prospects of bringing in Hasaranga as he has continued to struggle against the left handers . But on turning wickets Hasaranga can be very difficult to play . In addition , Hasaranga is more than handy with the bat down the order because this is expected to be a low-scoring series and hence contribution from the lower order is vital . <h> Comments - 0 <h> Add comment <p> Comments will be edited ( grammar , spelling and slang ) and authorized at the discretion of Daily Mirror online .

They did not care that their names and those of their organizations were used for political mileage .

Sri Lanka was down-graded to the point of default by Rating Agencies like Moodys , and Fitch . Sri Lanka should not have been down-graded in this manner .

The shortage is so acute that only Essential Services vehicles are being provided with fuel at least until July 10 . Suddenly , we have realized that we need to move away from vehicles that burn so-called fossil fuels such as petrol and diesel which we do not manufacture and have to import at a great cost to the economy - literally . It is thus never too late to turn to alternative modes of transport that do not require petroleum at all . <p> From another perspective , the world is being literally choked by traffic and the associated smog and pollution . The rise of the private car has contributed heavily to global warming , which would have disastrous consequences by the turn of the century for the entire world if it goes unchecked . <p> Viable solutions <p> But all hope is not lost as there are many viable solutions in sight .

The trick here is to get more car owners to switch to public transport by offering a faster , more comfortable ride to the city or another destination of their choice . Renewable energy is one other alternative . Just imagine the fossil fuel savings if all the thermal power plants can be replaced with wind and solar . <p> But there are two modes of transport that do not require any external energy at all -- walking and cycling . Both are good for the body as well as the mind , being vigorous forms of exercise . But one can not walk for more than a few kilometres , especially , in a big city , which leaves cycling as an option or alternative to the car over medium distances . <p> The world recently focused on this somewhat old form of transport on World Bicycle Day which fell on June 3 .

Many cities also have cycle stands where one can rent bicycles and e-bicycles ( cycles with a small electric motor attached , for easier hill climbing ) for a small fee using a smartphone app . Once the trip is over , the user goes to a similar bicycle stand and locks it . <p> Common sight <p> Our love affair with the private car has nearly obliterated the bicycle from our streets , with only the poorest segments of society and professional racing cyclists using bicycles , though this is changing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports of professionals , diplomats and academics using bicycles to get to work , though it is too much to expect our Members of Parliament and Ministers to give up their gas-guzzlingV8 SUVs and ride the humble bicycle instead .

Several Ministers including Transport Minister Dr. Bandula Gunawardena have urged all citizens to use the bicycle often for short journeys . <p> Bicycle use is much higher in rural areas of Sri Lanka than in urban areas ( schoolchildren in uniform can be seen riding to and from school in these areas ) , but regardless of area , cycling remains a highly dangerous form of transport here as other road users have little or no regard for cyclists ( and also pedestrians ) .

In Asia , bicycles still rule the roost in many rural areas . Countries such as China have a cycling culture , though most people there have moved on to cars after the economy opened up . <p> While our law enforcement authorities are very strict on the helmet policy for motorcyclists , there is no such law for cyclists , which means they have a far greater chance of getting injured or killed in a road accident . The use of helmets must be made mandatory in Sri Lanka for cyclists regardless of age . They must be made affordable and Sri Lankan companies could manufacture them to save @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bicycle is certainly back with a bang and increasingly looks like the smart mobility choice for the future .

Still , our roads are highly dangerous for cyclists and pedestrians , but a change of attitudes , a shift towards more public transport and new traffic management solutions could make the bicycle a more viable option for one-way journeys of less than 50 Km at least . Ancient but paradoxically modern at the same time , the bicycle could yet be the answer to our transport and fuel woes .

The composition of colour , form and posture of the subjects of this portrait , make the painting speak of a deft blend of the urbane with a subtle unspoken bohemian vein within the subjects , holding a posture that speaks of a modern couple ensconced in the disposition of contemplative sunny islanders . <p> The chief organiser behind this exhibition as I got to know when I went to see the exhibition was entrepreneur and art enthusiast Lahiru Pathmalal who provided me the list of all the owners of the Beven pieces that made up the exhibition 's collection . <p> The ladies and gentlemen mentioned above deserve applause for having put together an exhibition of ' Bevens ' which offered a visually captivating body of work . <p> Photographs <p> Lahiru helpfully arranged for the photographs of the opening to be sent to me , for the benefit of the readers of Sunday Observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hereby credited to Malaka Pathmalal . <p> In my conversation with Lahiru , he said the group of art collectors who offered their pieces by Beven to be part of the exhibition intends to publish an exhibition catalogue in the future . <p> It is indeed hoped that such a publication project will come to fruition in the near future , in order to have a captivating full pictorial record of the latest exhibition that honoured one of Sri Lanka 's greatest living artists .

The Minister in an interview with the Sunday Observer said the common phenomenon in our political system is the Opposition that always opposes whatever good or bad move of the Government . <p> That is why some politicians and various people are asking to form an All Party Government so that everybody can move forward with unity . When the proposal to form an All Party Government came up both the SJB and JVP turned down the request and put forward various conditions based on their political agendas . <p> Excerpts of the interview <p> Q : Some Government and Opposition MPs are of the view that if an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current crisis can be found locally and internationally . Your views ? <p> A : Various sections in the country maintain divergent views . One group is of the view that if an All Party Government is formed , it will be able to provide solutions to the current issues . When a public protest was made against the Rajapaksas , President Gotabaya Rajapaksa discussed with the then Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and at that time all the Rajapaksas quit from their ministerial portfolios . <p> If they did not do so , the problem would n't be solved . Then the President constitutionally invited all parties to join hands and form an All Party Government . At that time , the Samagi Jana Balawegaya and the JVP put forward various conditions based on their political agendas . We both in and outside Parliament made an open invitation to the SJB and the JVP to accept ministerial portfolios but they rejected . <p> At that time , UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe agreed to accept the Prime Minister portfolio . Actually , we had to go for that option hoping that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their support . If that requirement was fulfilled at that time , nobody would have leveled any allegations today . <p> At present , Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has requested to hand over the country to them for five years so that they will sort out this problem within this period . It was in the social media that the JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake has said that solutions to these issues can be provided within six months if they are given the premiership and opportunity to appoint the Cabinet of Ministers . <p> We have to think about what led the country to turn into this crisis situation . Is it mainly due to the administration established after 2019 or the shortcomings of all former Governments which ruled the country ? We should look into whether this situation has occurred due to the lapses on the part of the Government officials and some wrong policy decisions taken . <p> We should understand there was a 30 year battle against terrorism in the country and as a result , the economy had collapsed . We also had to suffer due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result , over 60,000 people were killed . We also had to face natural disasters and the 2019 Easter Sunday terror attacks . All those incidents had a serious impact on our economy . <p> Q : Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has said that both the President and Prime Minister have failed to solve the day today , increasing issues of 22 million people in the country . Would you like to comment ? <p> A : At present , we have faced several economic issues . We had an issue regarding drugs . Now we have received money rather than what we require per year to import drugs . Similarly , we have addressed five major issues . At present , the 13- hour power cuts have been reduced to three hours . If we receive fuel in the near future , we would be able to reduce this further . <p> Since this crisis emerged , we are addressing the issues one by one . We had to pay money for treasury bonds . If we had not obtained loans for the past three years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for loans by dollars . That is why this dollar crisis was created and there is a shortage of fuel and essential commodities . We did n't have a production economy . <p> That is why the President since he assumed office , attempted to create a production based economy . The dollar crisis has seriously affected us as we did n't have a production economy . Sometimes there may be shortcomings in our policy decisions . <p> The shortage of fuel and the escalation of the prices of essential commodities is the major crisis faced by us now . I hope the gas issue will be sorted out after July 3 . In order to move towards a production based economy , we have commenced a cultivation drive . However , this can not be done within a couple of days . Issues have also been created due to the Government 's decision to switch into organic fertiliser . As a result , some farmers had given up their cultivation . Solutions to these issues can only be found if we all join hands and work together and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Q : The recent fuel price hike has made a serious impact on transport , health , trade and education sectors while a decision has been taken to release fuel from the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation ( CPC ) only to essential services until July 10 . How do you view this situation ? <p> A : Similar to our economic crisis , the world is also facing an economic crisis due to the Russian-Ukraine war . It is not only in Sri Lanka but also Australia and America have also faced the consequences of the world economic crisis . Australia had recently announced to restrict vehicular movements except for essential journeys . According to Sri Lankan rupees , a litre of petrol exceeds Rs.850 in those countries . Therefore , the world economic recession has had an adverse impact on all countries . If we had discussed purchasing fuel at lower rates earlier and opened Letter of Credits ( LCs ) with required money , those fuel stocks would not be sent to us as scheduled . <p> That is why we had to face this situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to provide fuel from the CPC only to essential services such as health , electricity and export oriented products . In addition , it was decided to summon only essential workers to public and private sector institutions and grant permission to others to work from home . <p> Q : Even some Government Parliamentarians have raised concern as to why the fuel can not be imported from Russia at much cheaper rates . Would you like to respond ? <p> A : The President discussed this matter with the Russian Ambassador . They have said that the Russian Government does n't supply fuel and that it is handled by private companies . The Russian Ambassador had given the list of seven such companies . At present , the Petroleum Minister is discussing with them . Perhaps , they may be reluctant to provide us fuel due to the prevailing economic situation in our country . However , the discussions are going on even at this moment . <p> Q : The Frontline Socialist Party ( FSP ) has alleged that the fuel prices have been increased by the CPC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this allegation ? <p> A : As I am aware , the CPC is not earning profits . During the past period , fuel has been imported for certain credit periods . That is how fuel had been imported by all former Governments . Whatever the former Government imported fuel , the Government in power has to pay for it . They are being paid by now . Fuel is not a loss making business . However , we incurred nearly 60 to 70 percent or 30 to 40 percent loss from fuel that we imported . Therefore , we have to cover that loss . That is why the IMF has also requested to increase our fuel prices compared to the prices in the World market . Otherwise , if we subsidise fuel prices , we will also have to recover that loss from the poor people . <p> Therefore , the Government has decided to introduce a price formula in comparison to the fuel prices in the World Market . It is also being discussed to issue a coupon to provide a certain amount of kerosene to low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Q : Some Opposition political parties such as the JVP and FSP have raised concern as to why education was not declared as an essential service when several other services have been declared as essential services . Your views ? <p> A : When the JVP and FSP launched strikes to close down schools and demanded holidays for students , even at that point , education was not declared as an essential service . They should know that education is the most essential component for children . When the country has faced an economic crisis , they want to bring children to schools and create a situation to embarrass them . <p> I think no Government will provide room to create any hindrance or disturbance to the children 's education . Nearly nine people including a Parliamentarian were killed due to the riot incidents which took place on May 09 and the violence created afterwards . <p> Massive damage was also done to the properties and vehicles . Similar to 1988-89 riots , the May 9 operation was carried out by some underworld figures , drug addicts and ransom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political and student organisations . It is obvious , if they capture power , they will not allow even those who maintain opposition political views to survive . They attempt to create jealousy and hatred and distort the mindset of the people . <p> Q : Opposition Leader Sajith Premadasa has urged the Government to resign instead of posting an apology on Twitter . Would you like to air your views ? <p> A : The Opposition leader is just boasting . If he has held several ministerial portfolios , he has not done anything on behalf of the people . He has faced a situation of not even safeguarding his own party members . That is why he is now asking to hand over the Government to him . When he was asked to join the Government , he refused . At present , a crisis has emerged in the SJB . The majority of the SJB front liners requested Premadasa to take over the Government . However , he was scared to accept that challenge . Leaders are n't afraid of accepting challenges . His own party members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Q : The JVP led Jathika Jana Balawegaya say they are prepared to take over the Government in a bid to find a solution to the current situation if given the opportunity to appoint a Cabinet of their choice , in the current Parliament . How do you respond to this ? <p> A : Then they can bring a proposal regarding that . It is nothing new for them to work with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe . During the tenure of the former Yahapalana Government , they worked together with confidence . They also worked as active members of the Anti-Corruption Committee of the Yahapalana Government . Even now they can nominate their Cabinet and submit their proposal to the Prime Minister , and then I am ready to give up my portfolio and hand it over to them . <p> As Parliamentarians we are ready to fulfill our duty on behalf of the country . The Opposition leader says to give him five years to rebuild the country while the JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake says to give him six months . It has not completed even one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore , we have given him an opportunity . <p> Q : The people ask , what is the purpose of convening Parliament , when it has failed to provide any solution to their burning issues . Does n't the Parliament have a solution to the ongoing crisis ? <p> A : Parliament can only discuss and formulate policies . It is the responsibility of the public officials and State mechanism to implement them . It is not the relevant Minister and Parliament MPs who order and purchase fuel . There are separate officials at the CPC to fulfill that job . <p> The Ministry Secretary is the chief accounting officer . Therefore , the officials along with him should formulate the mechanism to import fuel . These issues can only be discussed in Parliament . Otherwise , the Parliament is not in a position to fulfill the functions of the ministry . <p> The fuel and other issues are discussed at Parliament Consultative Committees while separate party leaders meetings are held to discuss and provide solutions . <p> Then those recommendations are forwarded to the relevant authorities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a group of MPs in Parliament who are elected by the people based on various sectors . <p> The one side of the people 's representatives is composed of people while the officials are on the other side . The board of instructors is also there . Finally , what the Minister can do is to sit with all these parties and take the final decision . The Minister will have to listen to the voice of the people , professionals and also discuss with those who are in the relevant field . This is how it happens . However , the Opposition leader does n't understand this ground reality . That is why they boycotted Parliament recently <p> Q : However , at present the people reject all 225 Parliamentarians . What has led the people to lose their confidence in Parliamentarians ? <p> A : The JVP and anti-Government groups have created this sentiment by asking to reject all 225 Parliamentarians . In the May 9 riots only the houses and properties of SLPP politicians were destroyed and their supporters were killed . If the people reject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set on fire . However , that did n't happen . When looking at those who have been arrested , it is very obvious who were behind those attacks . If certain sections reject all 225 Parliamentarians , they have been elected by the people 's vote . <p> It is only the National List MPs who have not been elected by the people . However , a wrong impression was created among the society to reject all 225 Parliamentarians . <p> If the JVP says to conduct an election , it means to elect another 225 MPs to Parliament . Then what is the purpose of rejecting all 225 MPs . There is no logic behind their argument . They can never win an election . The JVP obtained portfolios and worked in Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga 's Government and they also worked with then Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and then President Mahinda Rajapaksa . <p> The entire country should realise they are unsuccessful and that is why their vote base was reduced to a mere three percent . That is why they attempt to launch even a struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@92876233 <h> Structural Adjustment and Stability after IMF Is it Adequate ? <p> Sri Lanka 's economic turmoil is today visible to the world as a full-blown , full-fledged political crisis and humanitarian emergency . After years of economic mismanagement which enriched a small number of elites , the citizens of the country are now left to reel with acute shortages of fuel , food and medicine . <p> As Sri Lanka awaits with heavy hopes on the bailout offered by the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) , the latest update of the process comes from President Ranil Wickremesinghe who last week announced that an agreement with the agency had been pushed back to September due to the unrest over the past weeks . At the ' Reform Now ' conference organized by the Advocata Institute under the theme " Let 's Reset Sri Lanka " , held at BMICH , President Wickremesinghe emphatically mentioned that Sri Lanka has no way out of the present crisis other than the bailout offered by IMF . <p> Sri Lanka has been a repetitive client of the IMF and by now has sought the assistance of the agency , a total of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be concluded by September <p> Taking an improvised stance , Australian National University 's Emeritus and renowned economist Professor Prema-chandra Athukorala insisted at the conference that true recovery for Sri Lanka is possible only after the inclusion of strong domestic elements in reforming policies . Taking Thailand as an example , Athukorala explained that even though the IMF played a major role in structural adjustment in the 1997-98 Asian Financial Crisis , recovery was possible only through significant domestic components included in the reform process . Some of the domestic factors adopted by Thailand included <p> Rewriting laws to give independence to the Central Bank <p> Reforming Foreign Direct Investment ratings <p> Appointing new ministers , predominantly from the business community to run <p> the country . <p> 75% of the reforms to tackle the crisis in Thailand are documented to be taken from tradable sectors primarily from the export sector . Thailand , South Korea , Malaysia , Indonesia and the Philippines were the 5 most affected East Asian countries from the 1997-98 Asian Financial Crisis . None of the above countries have sought the IMF since 1998 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a repetitive client of the IMF and by now has sought the assistance of the agency , a total of 16 times . The 17th approach is much anticipated to be concluded by September . <p> On his presentation on Debt Crisis , Structural Adjustment and Trade Policy , Athukorala opined that Sri Lanka , during the era of Independence had maintained an export-oriented economy with a strong welfare component . Sri Lanka was already a welfare state when it became independent , providing food subsidies , free rice , free education , and free healthcare to all . The UN Development Programme ( UNDP ) report on Human Development published in 2000 , denoted that the Human Development Index ( HDI ) of Sri Lanka was 0.733 , higher than other countries in the region . The report credits the social welfare programmes launched by pre- and post-independence governments to help achieve some remarkable successes in human development . <p> With income disparities in rural and urban sectors becoming low and falling , Athukorala explains that economic policies of Sri Lanka gradually became more focused on keeping up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still well utilized by members of the Parliament and political candidates to win elections . <p> A report by the Social Watch reads that Sri Lanka did try in 1977 to reverse the development pattern and become more export oriented . According to the report the United National Party Government , which came to office in 1977 , introduced policies to stimulate the stagnant economy and remedy high unemployment rates . Called the " Open Economy " , the report reads that these measures had both positive and negative impacts on social development . Structural adjustment policies were also introduced in the early 1980s to decrease public expenditure and increase repayment of external loans . But Athukorala explained Sri Lanka could not fully benefit from these reforms due to much of them being made without the consultation of the World Bank and due to the 30-year long civil war . A publication by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka titled ' Recent Trends in the Emerging Economy ' mentions that Sri Lanka had a reasonably high level of economic growth since 2005 with growth rates of 6.2 , 7.7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four-year period up to 2008 . <p> The IMF advises member countries on economic and financial policies to promote stability , reduce vulnerability to crises , and encourage sustained growth and high living standards <p> Athukorala in his presentation compared the above period to a Japanese Sumo wrestler , who lives on a special high protein diet ( stronger visually ) but has a 20 years shorter life span than the average Japanese man . Dr. Asanka Wijesinghe , a Research Economist of the Institute of Policy Studies in a webinar hosted by the institute in 2021 mentioned that Sri Lanka 's openness towards rates of globalization has continuously declined especially after 2005 due to GDP growth in non-tradable sectors . At the time , the World Trade Organization had predicted a pickup in global trade volumes for 2022 while an IMF database that uses signals emitted by sea vessels also showed an uptick in world trade from the beginning of 2021 . <p> Wijesinghe also insisted that Sri Lanka should ready itself to take advantage of trade diversion and investment opportunities . Athukorala demonstrated that this massive non-tradable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially after 2005 had devastatingly underpinned the growth spurt of the economy . The outcome , he simply explained through an equation is The outcome = Vulnerability to Covid-19 + A debt overhang + debt service burden + drying up of foreign exchange reserves . <p> Export earnings of Sri Lanka for the past two decades have been dominated by merchandise and service exports adversely resulting in high debt dependence . Even though reports denote that the debt burden of Sri Lanka was much higher in the early 90 's compared to the present , the current situation is way more destructive as the external debt relative to the Gross Domestic Production ( GDP ) of the country is weighed out by non-tradable goods , which Athukorala points out " does not help us pay any debts " . <p> In economics , the Dutch disease is the apparent causal relationship between the increase in the economic development of a specific sector ( e.g. natural resources ) and a decline in other sectors ( e.g. manufacturing sector or agriculture ) . The term was coined in 1977 by The Economist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Netherlands after the discovery of the large Groningen natural gas field in 1959 . The theory tries to explain how excess focus on non-tradeable sectors naturally decreases tradable production . In his address at the Advocata conference , Athukorala listed out 3 factors that helped exaggerate the non-tradable bias in policy regimes of Sri Lanka while assuring that focusing on these factors will help take the country into a solid recovery route <p> 1 . Exchange Policy -- As people focus on the inflation , the nominal exchange rate has been used as an ' inflation anchor ' . A key cause for the non-tradable bias has been the preventing of the appreciation of the real exchange rates . This strategy had been used to maintain competitiveness to globalized markets and to tame inflation . " Pumping money into non-tradable sectors while simultaneously trying to maintain a constant nominal exchange rates is a serious mistake " Athukorala said . <p> 2 . The Tariffs Regime -- In Economics , the Lerner Symmetry Theorem establishes that import tariffs and export taxes are equally protectionists in international trade . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes anti-exports . Sri Lanka is capable of moving into a more uniform tariff structure . <p> 3 . Policy backsliding in the area of promoting direct foreign Investment - Recalling his experience as a research fellow for the World Bank , Athukorala narrated that once when he had examined investment records of the Board of Investment ( BOI ) , it was revealed that more than 200 export-oriented businesses had closed down during the period between 2005-2013 due to distorted approval processes and delays . <p> The International Monetary Fund advises member countries on economic and financial policies to promote stability , reduce vulnerability to crises , and encourage sustained growth and high living standards . But as Sri Lanka is a ' twin deficit country ' with our trade deficit being mirrored in our budget deficit , Athukorala predicts the IMF supported stabilization and structural adjustment reforms would specifically focus on fiscal consolidation through ' expenditure reduction ' . In simple words , Athukorala explains IMF= It 's Mostly Fiscal ( for the Sri Lankan context ) <p> " Therefore , in an economy where anti-tradable bias has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt overhang , it is ( critically ) necessary to combine ' expenditure-reducing ' policies with policies aimed at ' expenditure switching ' from non-tradable production in the economy .

When the Sinhala youth of this country , specially those belonging to the rural sector , raised up in arms against the ruling classes , once in 1971 and again in 1988 , the people were not able to free themselves from that age-old bondage , to give the much-needed support to their sons and daughters to go the extra mile to claim sovereignty , which has been placed on the elite .

The Constitution had become just a misnomer to frustrate any move from below to regain sovereignty . That barrier , was smashed by the youth who gathered at Gotagogama and Galle Face Green .

In fact , we have questioned the viability of calling a highly political move by the masses , apolitical . Yet , despite all that , we have never questioned the genuine intentions of the masses led by their sons and daughters to seek much-needed change in the manner their country was governed . Neither is there any question about their bravery and boldness in the face of the government security apparatus . The protesters who occupied Galle Face Green have left and Gotabaya Rajapaksa has been removed from power . Yet the struggle is far from over .

@@93468233 <p> The recent revision of electricity tariffs was a step towards reducing the fiscal burden caused by the supply of electricity below its cost of production . While the new tariff structure is an improvement on the previous one , anomalies remain . <p> In determining tariffs , there are three characteristics of electricity that must be noted : <p> I. Electricity is a commodity that is interchangeable both in its generation and use . One megawatt hour ( MWh ) of electricity produced from coal or hydropower contains the same amount of energy . Different categories of users consume the same product . <p> II . It must be produced and used simultaneously . Electricity storage is still prohibitively expensive . Supply must meet demand exactly in the power grid . <p> III . The cost of supplying electricity fluctuates throughout the day depending on the power generation mix , the cost of fuels used , transmission costs and energy losses . <p> As electricity is a commodity there should be no difference in the prices charged to different users . The tariff should also reflect the varying cost of supply , depending on time of day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its use . For sustainability the tariff needs to be on a cost-recovery basis . <p> The new tariff addresses some of the shortcomings of the existing structure but there is still considerable room for improvement . <p> 1 . The proposed structure reduces the discrimination between different types of bulk supply customers . <p> For users below 42 kVA the different rates that were charged to hotels , government and general purpose bulk supply have been amalgamated into a single general purpose tariff but a lower rate remains applicable to " industrial " customers . However it is positive that the differential between the general purpose bulk supply and customers categorised as " industrial " has decreased . <p> For larger bulk customers it is welcome that the distinction between categories has been done away with and a single tariff , close to cost recovery and reflecting time of use has been applied . <p> The PUCSL consultation document states that the average cost of generation is Rs. 32.87 but the tariff charged to low use industrial users ( Rs. 20 ) and low use general purpose customers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both below cost . <p> The only justification for a discriminatory tariff is for a lifeline tariff for the poor . While domestic users below 90 kWh do receive a subsidised tariff , domestic consumers who exceed this pay the highest tariff ( Rs. 50 for usage between 90-180 kWh , Rs. 75 above 180 kWh ) which is almost double that of all bulk users . Thus high-use domestic consumers are subsidising industrial and commercial users . Moreover , instead of increasing the rate for each block of use , the moment domestic customers exceed 60 units the tariff increases from an average of Rs. 9 to Rs. 16 . A customer who consumes 59 units will pay Rs. 9 but one who consumes 61 units will pay Rs. 16 per unit . This is unfair and can promote corruption in meter reading . In general , such cross subsidies are undesirable as they can lead to inefficient resource allocation or have unintended consequences . <p> For example , the higher domestic tariff may serve as a disincentive for remote work . Remote or flexible work arrangements can reduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some , enable a better work/life balance . The Government should be facilitating flexible work but the higher rates applicable to some domestic consumers may be a disincentive . <p> The PUCSL has an unusual definition of industry ; it includes , ' Agriculture ' , ' Forestry and Fishing ' , ' Mining and Quarrying ' , ' Manufacturing ' , ' Electricity , Gas , Steam and Air Conditioning Supply ' , ' Water Supply , Sewerage and Waste Management ' . As a matter of principle the producer should not make judgment on how a product is used or attempt to encourage or discourage particular activities through prices . If the Government does wish to encourage particular industries it is more efficient to do this through a transparent system of grants rather than distorting prices . <p> Economic activity is increasingly complex and a value chain can involve many different sectors . For example , the tea industry involves agriculture , processing in factories , transport , warehousing , blending , financing , marketing and exports . Moreover , products are now more knowledge intensive so a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ components of the value chain . With differential tariffs , parts of the same value chain may pay different prices for use of the same commodity . <p> Religious and charitable bodies continue to enjoy preferential treatment under the domestic tariff category but there is a small decrease in the discount offered to these bodies . High use customers in this category should also be subject to a TOU based tariff . Advocata reiterates that there should be no price discrimination between users ; at most there should be two categories households and businesses . <p> 2 . It is welcome to note that the new tariff structure extends the time of use ( TOU ) tariff to the agriculture subsector but this should be extended to smaller bulk users and made compulsory for the high use domestic category . For customers using solar power on a net metering basis , the export and import tariffs should be based on TOU . A TOU based tariff reflects the changing cost of generation across the day . Generation during peak hours relies more heavily on thermal power which is more costly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers are incentivised to shift demand to off peak hours . <p> 3 . The new tariff maintains a lower rate for low-use domestic customers and it is welcome that the new structure applies marginal tariffs based on different slabs of usage . The previous system was inherently unfair to the consumer , the new tariff removes this anomaly . <p> 4 . The decision to charge for street lighting , which should be paid for by the local authorities is welcome . Previously as the CEB did not charge for street lighting the local authorities which have control over when the lights are switched on and off had no particular incentive to switch off street lights during day time . A lower rate for street lighting is justified because the major part of the use falls into off peak hours . <p> 5 .

However , this would only divert resources from other alternative users and may not be the most efficient way of allocating the scarce foreign exchange in the country .

Therefore it is imperative that this must be accompanied by increased transparency and efficiency within the utility . <p> Consumers may expect to pay for higher world prices but can not be expected to pay higher costs due to inefficiency , waste or corruption . State enterprises need to be open and transparent in their affairs , particularly in procurement , and where possible should operate in competitive markets . <p> As a first step the CEB should provide a detailed breakdown on the components of its tariff : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid to the private generation companies ) .

Sri Lanka has protested against the use of this term at the ongoing 51st regular session of the United Nations Human Rights Council ( UNHRC ) . <p> Addressing the council on September 13 -- the same day the Acting UN Human Rights High Commissioner Nada Al-Nashif presented the High Commissioner 's report on Sri Lanka , Foreign Affairs Minister Ali Sabry said that the reference made to " economic crimes " in the report is vague and exceeds the mandate of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights ( OHCHR ) . <p> It is vital to recognize and assist Sri Lanka to address the underlying factors , which have contributed to this crisis , including embedded impunity for past and present human rights abuses , economic crimes and corruption <p> The reference has been made in so many places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its summary , the report says " The High Commissioner encourages the international community to support Sri Lanka in its recovery , but also in addressing the underlying causes of the crisis , including impunity for human rights violations and economic crimes . " While explaining impunity prevailing in Sri Lanka , the report again refers to the term claiming " a number of corruption and other related economic crimes cases between 2020 and 2022 were discontinued , following withdrawal of charges or indictments on various technical grounds . " <p> Under the subheading Further " Options for Advancing Accountability , " the High Commissioner hopes " that the new administration will respond to the popular demand for accountability for economic crimes , including corruption , and abuse of power with a renewed commitment to end impunity . " When bringing the report to a conclusion , the High Commissioner reiterates it is vital to recognize and assist Sri Lanka to address the underlying factors , which have contributed to this crisis , including embedded impunity for past and present human rights abuses , economic crimes and corruption . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies have pointed out that malnutrition is widespread among children . A recent study by the World Food Program ( WFP ) had found that 73 percent of participating households had reduced their diet and food intake <p> Foreign Minister Sabry 's contention about vagueness of the term had some validity as the report in some places refers to " economic crimes including corruption " while citing in another place " economic crimes and corruption . " A clear definition to the term had not been given in the report . However , the High Commissioner had somewhat negated his second argument about exceeding the mandate of the OHCHR , through her recommendations to the UNHRC . The report recommends to " support Sri Lanka in the investigation of economic crimes that impact on human rights and the tracing and recovery of stolen assets . " If something impacts on human rights it comes under her purview . <p> Sri Lanka is in a dire situation . Various UN agencies have pointed out that malnutrition is widespread among children . A recent study by the World Food Program ( WFP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced their diet and food intake . UNICEF last month said " severe malnutrition in crisis-wracked Sri Lanka was already among the highest in the region . " Although , the government rejected this claim arguing that the UN Children 's Fund had come to this conclusion based on 2016 statistics , the very argument on the other hand indicates a bleaker picture . <p> The COVID 19 pandemic and the bankruptcy of the country have impacted heavily on the people by way of increased poverty . Officials of the education sector point out that poverty impacted heavily on the school children . Many schools have organised their own arrangements to feed the children who attend to schools without food . In some schools the attendance of the children has halved due to lack of food . Hence , it is obvious that the current situation is far worse than what prevailed in 2016 . <p> The health sector is collapsing for want of funds , especially foreign exchange .

Foreign training for medical professionals has been suspended . Thus , all sectors have been hit by the economic crisis , infringing the rights of the people to education , healthcare , employment and most importantly the right to life . <p> And since the current economic crisis is clearly the outcome of the corrupt practices and mismanagement of politicians and officialdom , the term economic crimes indisputably gains validity . The International Monetary Fund Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva had told NDTV in May that the economic crisis in Sri Lanka is a result of mismanagement . In a recent interview former President Mahinda Rajapaksa also had acknowledged that all past governments and leaders including him have to be held responsible for the current economic downturn . <p> The main Opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya ( SJB ) on Tuesday had requested Speaker Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena to appoint a Parliamentary Select Committee ( PSC ) to investigate into the " economic crimes " committed since 2019 which have brought in the current socioeconomic mess . They in a letter urges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a three months term . The SJB seems to have borrowed the term economic crimes from the Human Rights High Commissioner 's report as the party had used it immediately after the report was presented in the UNHRC . And the UN human rights body in turn might have picked up the idea from the recent people 's uprising or the Aragalaya where penalizing those who destroyed the economy and tracing the stolen money had been major demands . <p> The SJB seem to have decided the period to be probed with a view to take political mileage against the ruling Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna ( SLPP ) . However , the country has been plundered by the politicians and the high ranking officials for the past several decades , not only after 2019 . The Mahinda Rajapaksa government 's mega projects which later turned out to be white elephants and the Central Bank bond scam during the last government led by the United National Party ( UNP ) also contributed to the current economic downturn . The leaders of the SJB know where they were during the Yahapalanaya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that decisively ruined the economy with its irrational decisions such as huge unsolicited tax cuts , banning chemical fertilizer imports and fixing the dollar exchange rate which clearly amount to economic crimes .

However , it was the Rajapaksa family that has been mainly held responsible in the Senate resolution introduced this month by U.S. Senator Bob Menendez ( D-N.J . ) , Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and two others calling for a comprehensive international approach to address Sri Lanka 's current political and economic crisis and in the plaint filed by the Hamilton Reserve Bank in a New York court against the Sri Lankan government over the country 's decision to default on its $1 billion sovereign bond . <p> However , the recommendation by the Human Rights High Commissioner made to Sri Lanka for an " investigation of economic crimes that impact on human rights and the tracing and recovery of stolen assets " seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by the UNHRC for the past thirteen years , since the end of the war .

And punish those who were responsible for approving such payments ? Why has n't the Attorney General 's Department done that , and done it very , very quickly ?

What is the responsibility ? Ultimately , the people who have been played out are Sri Lankan citizens and taxpayers . Where is the justice ? " <p> That is why -- with Eran Wickramaratne MP -- we say that the time has now come , not only to have a Stolen Assets Recovery Law , but also an Independent Public Prosecutor in this country . So that we can get off that list of countries , which have committed economic crimes !

Apparently the most difficult phase of the balance of payments crisis is moving towards a point where it could be resolved for the common good of the country ; but the most difficult era of this crisis will not end with that phase . Even if Sri Lanka succeeds in receiving the IMF relief package , the explosive economic and other reforms that the IMF wants introduced to be qualified for that could be implemented effectively only if it succeeds in reaching a general national consensus for it . <p> However , the severity of the failure and the state of bankruptcy that Sri Lanka has encountered at the moment has not led to create a favourable atmosphere where the overwhelming cupidity of political leaders for power is mitigated and everyone is united to extend their unstinted support towards rescuing Sri Lanka out of the abyss it has fallen into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overcome the crisis can be considered as a distant dream that is not easy to achieve . <p> Greed for power and power struggle <p> The present crisis led to the ascension of Ranil Wickremesinghe , who had only one seat in Parliament , to the post of Prime Minister and then to the position of President . It can be considered a miracle in the political sense . Yet , he who had been elected president in that way did not have a parliamentary group . Despite the fact that he may have had various limitations , he can be considered as the most qualified person to be chosen from among the current politicians to solve the difficult crisis that Sri Lanka is facing at the moment , which is unique and complex . He is endowed with necessary knowledge , experience , and ability to make decisions and to get international support . Taking all these aspects and the seriousness of the crisis into account , the Opposition should have followed a policy of supporting the program implemented by the president , at least for a limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Initially , there was a great deal of agreement for that among the members of the party led by the leader of the Opposition . <p> But , the leader of the Opposition seems to have perceived it as something that would destroy his party along with him . Therefore , he has adopted a policy that prevented the emergence of such an alliance . In the end , to achieve that goal , he joined hands with the Peratugami Party ( The Frontline Socialist Party ) and launched street agitations and demonstrations thereby making his party an important partner of the program to send Ranil home . <p> With that , the prospect of the opposition entering into a united course of action to overcome the crisis was thwarted . It seems that the political strategy of the leader of the opposition is to politically destroy President Ranil Wickremesinghe , his main political rival by making him a political prisoner dependent on the Pohottuwa party . The outcome of such a strategy in the current political context could have a devastating impact not only on Ranil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party , and above all , on the country as well . <p> The policy of the leader of opposition reminded me of the policy followed by Sirima Bandaranaike in the early stage of the second insurrection of the JVP and the price the country had to pay for it . <p> The second insurrection of the JVP <p> The JVP interpreted the Indo-Lanka agreement as an Indian invasion , and it launched a terrible and violent struggle in the guise of a patriotic war against it and to capture the political power of the country . In that struggle , JVP described J.R . Jayewardene as a traitor who had betrayed the country to India . The slogan - " Kill JR " was a harsh phrase used by the JVP for their wall posters . The protest of the JVP displayed against J.R . and the Indo-Lanka Agreement fitted well with the political thoughts and aspirations of Sirima Bandaranaike as well . <p> Consequently , she followed a policy of assisting the JVP informally at the first phase of the insurrection . On the eve of the 1988 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in close cooperation with the JVP to nominate a common candidate for the presidential election . However , when she realised that the strategic aim of that program of the JVP was to keep her out from contesting the presidential election with surreptitious intention of advancing the insurrection , she decided to contest the presidential election defying the threats from the JVP . But , the SLFP was in a very weak condition at the time of the presidential election since a large group of party members had joined the insurrection following her example when she was in alliance with the JVP . Because of that , she was defeated in the presidential election which she could have won . Consequently , the UNP rule which could have been ended in 1988 restricting it for two terms got extended to a third consecutive term . The rebels had a hatred for J.R . but they did not have such a feeling for Premadasa ; they rather loved him . The JVP 's assessment was that if Sirimavo could be prevented from coming to power , it would be easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Proving their belief wrong , President Premadasa defeated the JVP insurrection . <p> What could be the end ? <p> If the Opposition adopts a policy of not supporting or rather blocking , directly or indirectly , the implementation of reforms necessary for resolving the balance of payments crisis , it is inevitable that Sri Lanka will fall into an abyss even worse than the one it had fallen into before . Most probably , such a situation could turn out to be a detrimental factor that will cause great destruction not only to President Ranil and his government , but also to the leader of the Opposition and his party as well , and above all , the country in general . The survival and security of the country is more important than anything else . <p> On this special occasion , it is important that the leaders who organise demonstrations and agitations aimed at ousting the Government should have a relook at them . The Constitution of Sri Lanka is designed in such a manner that the government in power can not be overthrown by such actions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolving the balance of payments crisis when efforts are being made to resolve it , is huge . <p> How to formulate a framework to solve the balance of payments crisis and socio-political crisis that all political parties and young activists of the Aragalaya could accept and work together can be considered as the biggest political problem that Sri Lanka needs to solve at the moment . In this process , a general consensus can be reached through negotiation to allow an early election and implementation of a two-phase reform program as was done in South Africa . <p> In the first phase , a general consensus can be reached for a reform program that will lead to a positive and profound change in the system , including the formulation of a participatory constitution and appointing an all-party governing body to implement the program . By adopting an interim constitution , the entire work plan of the reform program can be turned into a process that flows to a logical conclusion with a statutory foundation . <p> The United Nations may be assigned the responsibility to act as an observer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the Opposition contemplate on such a program ? Should n't the international community , including India and Japan , force the political leaders of Sri Lanka to embark on such a program ?

Restraint largely owing to a decade of hard work by United States to build partnership with local media than lack of importance . Nor that we hear substantial political voice raising concern . There are no Think Tanks like Advocata or Verite to argue a case for MIR system analogous to IMF . The decision has a direct bearing on our national interest and security as the nation in concern has been an unequivocal ally and security guarantor of Sri Lanka in the international stage . <p> Payment systems are the veins and arteries of financial system as the cross boarder trading grew west developed a secure massaging system to communicate between financial institutions that came to be known as SWIFT replacing manual Telex massaging .

Through time like the Dollar it morphed into a potent weapon at the hands of Washington . <p> China &amp; Russia has been challenging this financial edifice by developing a parallel structure . Union Pay built by China is now largest payment system yet lacks outreach to match juggernauts Visa and MasterCard . Interbank payment systems CIPS ( China ) and MIR/SPFS compete with SWIFT and US Dollar clearing CHIPS . MIR and CIPS offer complete suite of clearing and settlement service not only massaging . It cuts middlemen and directly converts Rouble or Yuan to local currency enabling trade and commerce between the nations . System hence foster bilateral relationship . SWIFT on the other hand headquartered in ' neutral ' Switzerland . It complements well with other products and services that western world dominates such as currency , markets , payment cards and Investment Banks . Severing MIR system therefore has flow on effect on decoupling Lanka 's economic reliance on Russia while enhancing dependency on western bloc . <p> Nature of the imperialism that we see today is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leverage than direct control , based on a development of purported common value system that is often defined by hegemon . To this end Washington and its alliance has built a loyal fraternity comprise of Think Tanks , professional bodies like Ceylon Chamber of Commerce , Chartered Institute , funded legal fraternity , most importantly been giving advice to Central Bank through multilateral organisations in the likes of IMF . Many top management administrators in Central Bank poses US Doctoral degrees with scholarships awarded . Playbook of Lanka 's economic pathway bear stamp of Washington Consensus . An ' independent ' CB may steer to become ' dependant ' CB on Washington Consensus . Pertinent point west transforms institutions not individuals and then relies on institutions to self-sustain the ideology . <p> Lately through USAID and IREX has been encroaching media space .

Ethno-nationalism long played a role in resenting western influence over non-allied policy which it sees as an impediment . As a counterweight Lanka 's ethnic issue found refuge in western polity ( analogous to Uygur Muslim for China or Rohingya in Burma ) .

If Tamils are marginalized or discriminated it is by the Vellala Tamils and not the Sinhalese .

@@94397236 <h> Rishi Sunak will become the U.K. 's next prime minister <p> Rishi Sunak prevailed in a chaotic three-day race for leader of Britain 's Conservative Party on Monday , a remarkable political comeback that doubled as a historical milestone , making him the first person of color to become prime minister in British history . <p> The 42-year-old son of Indian immigrants , whose political career has already had its ups and downs , Mr. Sunak won the contest to replace the short-lived prime minister , Liz Truss , when his only remaining opponent , Penny Mordaunt , withdrew after failing to reach the threshold of 100 nominating votes from Conservative lawmakers . <p> Mr. Sunak , a former chancellor of the Exchequer , is expected to pull Britain back to more mainstream policies after Ms. Truss 's failed experiment in trickle-down economics , which rattled financial markets and badly damaged Britain 's fiscal reputation . He is also likely to offer a stark contrast to the flamboyant style and erratic behavior of Boris Johnson , his former boss and Ms. Truss 's discredited predecessor . <p> But Mr. Sunak will confront the gravest economic crisis in Britain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the helm of a badly fractured Conservative Party . Healing the rifts in the party , and leading the country through the economic crosswinds of the months to come , will require political skills at least as adroit as those that enabled Mr. Sunak to navigate the leadership contest . <p> Mr. Johnson 's decision to pull out of the race on Sunday night cleared a path for Mr. Sunak , who had challenged Ms. Truss last summer but lost to her in a vote of the party 's rank-and-file members . With Mr. Sunak the only surviving candidate this time , he was not subject to another vote of the members . <p> It was a head-spinning reversal of fortune for Mr. Sunak , whose abrupt resignation from Mr. Johnson 's cabinet last July set in motion Mr. Johnson 's downfall and pitched Britain into upheaval , culminating in Ms. Truss 's brief , calamitous stint . After he lost the leadership contest to her , it seemed as if Mr. Sunak 's meteoric ascent had cratered as well . <p> Now , he will become Britain 's third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries and the first person of the Hindu faith to achieve its highest elected office . <p> A former investment banker whose wife is the daughter of an Indian technology billionaire , Mr. Sunak will also be one of the wealthiest people ever to occupy 10 Downing Street -- something that could prove a vulnerability at a time when Britons are struggling to pay soaring gas bills . The Times of London this year estimated the couple 's worth at more than $800 million , placing them among the 250 wealthiest British people or families . <p> But if his victory swept away another barrier in British politics -- putting Mr. Sunak in the same pathbreaking category as Margaret Thatcher , Britain 's first female prime minister , and Benjamin Disraeli , its only prime minister of Jewish heritage -- it also thrust him into power at a singularly difficult moment . <p> " There is no doubt we face profound economic challenges , " Mr. Sunak said in brief , somewhat stiff , remarks after his victory . " We now need stability and unity , and I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country together . " <p> Britain is suffering the twin scourges of surging energy prices and a recession , as well as the self-inflicted damage of Ms. Truss 's free-market agenda : sweeping unfunded tax cuts that frightened markets , sent the pound into a tailspin and kicked off a rebellion of her own lawmakers . <p> The dramatic circumstances of Mr. Sunak 's rise reinforced the problems he will face in uniting a divided party . Had Ms. Mordaunt cobbled together the necessary 100 votes from lawmakers , polls suggested she would have stood a decent chance of beating him with the members , as Ms. Truss did . <p> Her failed challenge and Mr. Johnson 's aborted bid laid bare a party still torn by factions . Some members continue to view Mr. Sunak as Mr. Johnson 's political assassin , and the serial scandals of Mr. Johnson 's tenure , followed by the economic misfire of Ms. Truss 's , have left the popularity of the Tories in tatters . <p> The party now lags the opposition Labour Party by more than 30 percentage points in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has demanded a general election , and those calls could grow louder as the new prime minister imposes a belt-tightening economic program in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis . <p> Still , political analysts said the party 's swift conclusion to the leadership contest , which avoided a vote by the members , suggested that for now , the feuding Tory factions were committed to rallying around Mr. Sunak . In her withdrawal statement , Ms. Mordaunt called for people to back her rival . <p> " After the trauma of the last four or five months , even factions that do not support Sunak are going to give him a fair wind , " said Tony Travers , a professor of politics at the London School of Economics . " They have to decide whether they want to win another election or spend a period out of government fighting with each other . " <p> British assets and the pound jumped after news of Mr. Sunak 's victory , raising hopes that his fiscal prudence and more technocratic style of governing would settle investors after the turbulence set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Sunak warned that her plan to reduce taxes at a time of double-digit inflation would be destabilizing . He called for keeping in place an increase in corporate taxes and holding off on a cut in income tax , both of which Mr. Sunak had proposed while chancellor . " Borrowing your way out of inflation is n't a plan , " he said at a debate in July , " it 's a fairy-tale . " <p> Mr. Sunak said almost nothing about his plans during this more compressed race . But he is expected to hew to the agenda he laid out during the campaign last summer , which emphasized the need to curb inflation before reducing taxes . With Britain 's borrowing having risen as a result of Ms. Truss 's policies , he may be forced into deeper spending cuts than he once expected . <p> Some analysts expect him to retain Jeremy Hunt , the chancellor whom Ms. Truss recruited after she was forced to eject her first , Kwasi Kwarteng , the architect of the market-destabilizing tax cuts . Mr. Hunt reversed virtually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to Mr. Sunak's. ( nytimes ) <p> " The pressure on him is to run the most stable , responsible , efficient government as is humanly possible , " Professor Travers said . " How the financial markets are going to respond is going to be major check on this government . " <p> The man chosen to face all these challenges was born in Southampton , on England 's south coast , to Indian immigrants who had moved to Britain from East Africa . His father was a family doctor ; his mother ran a pharmacy . They saved to send him to Winchester College , one of Britain 's most academically rigorous high schools , and then to Oxford University , where he studied philosophy , politics and economics . <p> From there , Mr. Sunak worked at Goldman Sachs and at a hedge fund , and later earned an M.B.A . at Stanford University , where he met his wife , Akshata Murty . Her father is Narayana Murthy , the founder of Infosys , whose wealth Forbes magazine estimates at $4.5 billion . <p> Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chancellor in 2020 , where he won instant popularity by handing out billions of pounds to protect those who lost jobs in the coronavirus pandemic . <p> But his career was nearly derailed by reports that Ms. Murty held a privileged tax status that allowed her to avoid paying millions of dollars in British taxes on some of her income . It also emerged that he had retained a U.S. green card , which would allow him to settle permanently in the United States . <p> Mr. Sunak gave up his green card and Ms. Murty changed her tax status , but the damage was done . Though he survived the episode , it left him with lingering vulnerability at a time of economic hardship for million of Britons . <p> Critics often tar him as a jet-setter , out of touch with the lives of ordinary people . It does n't help that he and Ms. Murty own expensive houses in London , in his parliamentary district in Yorkshire and in Santa Monica , Calif . Or that he works out on a Peloton exercise machine and has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " smart " mug that keeps coffee at a precise temperature . <p> " It will hinge on what people see him doing , " said Anand Menon , a professor of European politics at Kings College London . " He will be vulnerable if he is seen as defending the privileged and the rich . " <p> Professor Menon said Mr. Sunak 's race was less of a factor in Britain than it would be for a comparable political figure in the United States . For one , he was elected by Conservative lawmakers rather than in a popular vote . While critics speculated that his Indian heritage might have hurt him with some party members last summer , his wealth was viewed as the bigger issue . <p> " It 's not like we 're living in some kind of post-racial nirvana here , " Professor Menon said . " We just do it somewhat differently than in the United States . " <p> On the streets of London , people reacted cautiously , perhaps reflecting weariness after months of turmoil in British politics . <p> " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's really like out here , rather than looking down from the 26th floor , " said Hazel Wallace , 26 , who works in an ice-cream parlor and views the cost of living as the biggest issue . " It 's survival of the fittest right now , what with everything going up . " <p> But David Smith , 69 , a retired painter and decorator sipping a pint in the Bishop Blaize pub in Leyburn , said he was relieved that Mr. Sunak had replaced Ms. Truss . " He did warn the party that things would n't be right with her , and nobody listened to him , " Mr. Smith said , adding that he expected Mr. Sunak to do " a fantastic job .

" This leads to a new way of self-learning . Formal education gives us a job to survive . But things that we learn by ourselves through self-learning can bring us more . <p> Why is this self-learning essential for us ? The world of self-learning can be a little hard . But , if we want to achieve our ambitions and stay relevant in an ever-changing world , self-learning is important . <p> The education of schoolchildren suffered a collapse due to the political and economic crises faced by the country in the recent past , but teachers constantly kept children engaged in learning through online technology . Self-learning is a valuable concept that should be encouraged as the main way to acquire new knowledge and skills .

The rise of the Internet has proven that self-learning is easier and faster .

Through that , we can develop strong problem-solving skills . It enables you to identify problems and find effective solutions quickly . This can be from colleagues , the Internet , or research .

The ability to learn quickly can easily adapt to changes in the environment . <p> Self-directed learning focuses more on the process than the outcome of learning . Besides , in self-learning , no one sits behind us and pressures us to know what we have to learn and how much time we have to complete it . <p> There is no pressure to learn the content within a timeframe , and get high marks . We choose what we want to learn , when we want to learn , and how we want to learn . <p> The overall result is an internalisation of content , which is why self-learners tend to internalise what they learn more than those who participate in directed learning . So , self-learning is a stress-free learning process . <p> While studying , we can also learn other important skills such as time management , self-assessment , and setting our goals . <p> These are important skills that we can apply anywhere in any condition .

When they have a question about something , they use a variety of methods to find out what it is and how it happens . <p> Self-learners can engage in these activities using social media and the Internet . They are curious and always strive to learn something new . A main part of learning is satisfying some level of curiosity , and learning happens naturally when there is curiosity . This means that we are motivated to learn and that we can gain a great deal of knowledge when directed from within rather than from external sources . It 's an adventure , and every time we learn something new . <p> Self-driven learning comes from a personal desire to acquire new knowledge . It is driven by the need to find more information about a topic and use that information for some purpose . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the information gained is often relevant and makes sense .

With all these learning methods within our reach , we can choose the one that suits us best and the one that we find most attractive . And here we do n't need to stick to one mode of learning since we can try many methods of our choice . <p> One of the main problems we face is how we engage in self-learning . Of course , whether we learn from a school , university , course , or private educational institution , we must engage in the process of self-learning even during the learning procedure . because we can not find all the things we need in one place .

We have to be in the right frame of mind , understand what we want to learn and why this subject is important to us . We need a lot of internal motivation and studying preparation will keep us going even when our motivation levels are low . <p> Just as a teacher sets up a teaching plan that aims to help learners acquire various skills and knowledge at the end of a lesson , our personal learning should have an end goal .

Therefore , what should be done is to understand one 's needs and goals and try various activities by oneself to check the knowledge and understanding one has gained at the end of self-learning . <p> Education is something that we can never finish .

' As the curtain rose , the rich chant of the Potegura filled the auditorium in what seemed to me a theatrical miracle . Here was something new and exciting , different from anything seen in Sinhala theatre before . Sarachchandra had created from a traditional source a sophisticated modern drama , breaking way from the western influenced fourth wall proscenium drama .

He said as Potegura I opened the performance on 3 Nov 1956 . Until then I had no clue about my role but the power of the script , the music , and the audience stimulated me . Sarachchandra later said that no narrator who came after Shyamon could excel him . <p> Before the performance Sarachchandra had told the cast that the press will attack the play and to be prepared and not to get discouraged . But the newspapers gave it rave reviews . The first performance of ' Maname ' in Colombo was on a Saturday and the first review was by Regie Siriwardene in Daily News on Monday . <p> Regi praised it extravagantly , writing in English . His review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said he had gone to most Sinhala plays hoping that someday something would turn up which could give him hope for Sinhala theatre and this was it .

There is song and stylized movement . the intelligent Sinhala playgoer who had been dissatisfied with nrutya hotch potch will find in Maname that Sinhala drama did have an indigenous dramatic form which as immensely superior to the hybrid which has be foisted on us as national art . There was considerable dramatic variety , the formalized chant of potegura , the love duet , the veddah king . <p> The performance called for a most exacting combination of talent , singing , time movement and character acting . it was astonishing that a student cast should reach such a consistently high standard in all these aspects of dramaconcluded Regi . Regi observed that Charles Gurunanse had joined in the singing at the end of the play . <p> Later , Regie Siriwardena recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what struck him most forcefully was the breakthrough in theatrical form . This was the reaction of several other early critics of the play as well . <p> Regi 's review was followed by an equally laudatory Sinhala review by Charles Abeysekera , in Dinamina . Never before had a Sinhala play been received so jubilantly by critics . These rhapsodic reviews gave the play an excellent boost , encouraging the upper class audience who read Regi , to go and see it , said HL <p> Gunasena Galappaththy got pupils from nearby schools to come and fill up the hall for the performances that followed at the Lionel Wendt theatre . J.B. Disanayake recalled that his teachers at Ananda took them to see the play . Maname had a second run at the Wendt about three months later , tickets fared better word having got round that the Nadagama was worth seeing . <p> It was only after ' Maname ' was shown at YMBA hall at Borella several months later , that the other Sinhala newspapers responded .

He said the interpretation of characters in the play had given the Maname story a new robustness . One is encouraged to explore the events in a critical way rather than at face value . Other critics took notice said Sarachchandra . <p> When Maname played at YMBA , the men stayed where ever they could , but mostly at YMBA . For this they were helped by YMBA residents , HM Gunasekera and Madawela Ratnayake who were friends of Sarachchandra and Siri Gunasinghe . They slept on the floor . They were treated to sumptuous dinners by friends of Sarachchandra who supported his work . But there were times when they had to get by with much less . HL recalls sharing a thosay dinner with two orchestra members at the exorbitant cost of ten cents each , which was all they could afford . <p> ' Maname ' expanded the audience for Sinhala theatre , in all directions . Firstly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught up in the resurgence of cultural nationalism . Even Colombo 7 types who used to wait patiently for the annual Dramsoc offering now went to the Borella YMBA , said Amunugama .. Others pointed out that Sarachchandra found his initial and most ardent support , in the western educated elite and it was this which enabled the play to make its first forceful impression in the public . But this support was confined to those who were bi-lingual and bi-cultural . However , Sarachchandra said that it was only when ' Maname ' was shown at YMBA hall at Borella that ' we got the audience that could actually appreciate the play ' . <p> Another commentator said ' from my impression of the audience at Borella , YMBA and Lumbini , I would say the new audience of 1956 and thereafter , was predominantly Sinhala speaking urban lower middle class . Sinhala theatre was not able in those years to reach out to any group beyond the middle class .

' Maname ' was taken to towns which had never seen ' serious ' theatre before , with the local cinema hall or school hall used for the show . To accommodate the growing demand for the play from towns that could barely provide a school hall , the cyclorama was abandoned . Siri Gunasinghe 's set which depicted a ' nadagam maduwa ' was also abandoned as it was difficult to transport . Getting the cast , who were by now employed , together in some outlandish town was also difficult . <p> ' Maname ' was taken over by Jana Ranga Sabha in 1957 , they took it round the Island .

Ralph Pieris arranged for a performance at the Bogala Mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' played at YMBA , Lumbini and Lionel Wendt . <p> Sarachchandra had expected ' Maname ' to be followed by several plays in the same style . ' Before long we would possess body of plays that would reflect our national genius like the Kabuki and Noh of Japan . ' A.J. Gunawardene ( Jayadeva ) said that though ' Maname ' did not succeed in generating a new dramatic tradition as the dramatist had hoped , it had released trapped energies . <p> it was triumphantly asserted years later that modern urban Sinhala theatre owed its very existence to Tamil culture , since the nadagama style on which it was based came from the Terukuttu performed in Jaffna by the Roman Catholics . This was brushed aside . The Sinhala play was no longer trying to modernize by imitation . It had passed that stage . ' Maname ' was to be an experiment in form using the nadagama style .

@@95147236 <h> KAMALIKA PIERIS <p> This essay is a revised version of the earlier essay titled EDIRIWEERA SARACHCHANDRA 'S ' MANAME ' ( 2015 ) <p> ' Maname ' was a landmark event in Sinhala theatre . But the events leading up to it have received little attention . The emergence of ' Maname ' at Peradeniya was no accident . The Arts faculty of the University of Ceylon was exposed to a new atmosphere when they moved to Peradeniya in 1953 . Peradeniya was secluded , residential and ' outstation. ' it was safely away from Colombo and Colombo 's preference for imitative , half-baked western culture . <p> There was a change also in the undergraduate population . For the first time students drawn from rural schools were arriving in the university. 1 Many were bilingual . They were very enthusiastic about Sinhala theatre and were determined to make a contribution to it , while in university . <p> In Colombo , the university had formed a Ranga Sabhava which had produced plays for Colombo . In Peradeniya this Association got a new lease of life . It abandoned its Indian sounding name and became Sinhala Natya Mandalaya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mandalaya became a robust organization with P.E.E . Fernando , senior lecturer in Sinhala as patron and W. Arthur Silva , an undergraduate as president , said H.L. Seneviratne . <p> When Sarachchandra returned in 1956 after a year abroad , studying theatre , the Natya Mandalaya embarked on a series of ' play reading ' sessions but what they really wanted was a new play from Sarachchandra . Sarachchandra had meanwhile realized that naturalistic Sinhala theatre had not gone down well with audiences . Something else was needed . <p> H.L. Seneviratne says that at this time , Sarachchandra was influenced by the Noh plays he saw in Japan . Sarachchandra would surely have known about Noh theatre before he arrived in Japan . My guess is that in Japan he found that that the traditional Noh , resuscitated and probably heavily doctored to suit modern taste , was going down well with modern audiences . This would have encouraged him to look afresh at traditional theatre in Sri Lanka . <p> Sarachchandra inspected the local folk plays and decided ' the most suitable for modern theater was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said in an interview . The advantage of Nadagama , though Sarachchandra did not say so , was that it could be manipulated for artistic entertainment without creating a mighty rumpus . It was alien anyway , and had no ritual implications . <p> It was the insistent persuasion of a small group of enthusiastic Natya Mandalaya members , led by its president W. Arthur Silva which led to Maname said H.L. Persuading Sarachchandra was no easy task , he said . Sarachchandra was not keen on doing a new play since his previous plays had not met with public approval . The university authorities did not respond to his requests for assistance either . He had known the bitter experience of repeatedly asking the university authorities for help with no response , said HL . So he hesitated , but the students kept on pressing him and one day he said ' api ehenam nadagamak natamu ' . <p> In a ' Nadagama ' the story is told through song . There was also an element of dance , because each character had set movements which were performed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement. 2There was a narrator . The play was acted on a raised semi-circular platform adjacent to a shed , and the sloping roof of the shed became its roof as well . <p> ' I did not try to reproduce the old Nadagama style intact , but used its essence and certain aspects only ' , said Sarachchandra . He selected Chulla Dhanuddara Jatakaya for the story . This jataka had been performed as Maname ' in kolam and kavi nadagam , 3but not as a sindu nadagama . Sindu nadagama went on all night for about 7 days and the ' Maname ' story had been too short for this . ' But I realized that I could create a good dramatic presentation of ' Maname ' , said Sarachchandra . ' He knew that he had got the right idea ' , said HL Seneviratne <p> When creating ' Maname ' , Sarachchandra first wrote the songs . For this Sarachchandra obtained the services of Charles Silva Gunasinghe . Charles knew nadagama songs including kavi nadagama and he could sing them without a break . He sang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composed the lyrics . ' I used the most musical nadagama tunes that Charles knew ' . Sarachchandra had included nadagama songs earlier in ' Pabavati ' too . <p> ' Maname ' adopted the nadagama style for movement as well . In a nadagama , characters come in dancing , as they are introduced . Each character had a different beat and different movement . They went round and round in a circle . ' Maname ' performers did the same . Charles Silva Gunasinghe created the movements , using the dance steps of nadagama , selecting those which suited each ' Maname ' character . Vasanta Kumar created two highly original Veddah dances also the combat dance between Veddah king and ' Maname ' . 4 The orchestra consisted of harmonium , flute , esraj and violin with only one nadagama instrument , the Tamil maddala drum . <p> The greatest contribution in Maname was from Charles Silva Gunasinghe , who knew the nadagama tradition well . He knew Kolam and Tovil too . Charles was an outstanding performer , talented and versatile , he could sing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music for the two nadagama songs in ' Pabavati'and had acted as Poteguru in it . Sarachchandra admired his singing which he considered far superior to any Sinhala singer he had ever heard . <p> ' Charles was with me at every stage of the writing of ' Maname ' , ' said Sarachchandra . He provided the music , he advised on dance and song movements and participated in discussions about the content of the play . Sarachchandra recalled , ' when I started rehearsing the play Charles demonstrated the traditional nadagama style but was agreeable to changes . ' Charles also trained the performers . He was a good teacher , said Sarachchandra . <p> Sarachchandra was not sure whether the talent he needed for ' Maname ' was available and whether the students had the necessary staying power . The public auditions were unsuccessful and the students had to find promising actors through personal contact and networks . This placed a heavy burden on Arthur Silva and the other student enthusiasts of the Natya Sangamaya . <p> The actual process of recruiting candidates was laborious and time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarachchandra 's house , where they sang and were usually rejected . Many years later , Natya Mandalay members nostalgically recalled how they had dragged their reluctant friends to audition . <p> The students persevered and eventually came up with a stellar cast . For Prince Maname they found Ben Sirimanne , a school teacher who had come to do a two year diploma in Sinhala at the university . He had a rich and full throated voice , and a keen musical sense . <p> To play the princess they found two excellent candidates , Hemamali Goonasekera and Tricilia Abeykoon , where even one was rare . Tricilia had sung on radio in Lama Peetaya and had seen folk plays . She would have been an obvious choice . Trilicia continued to perform in Maname over the years and the role of Maname princess came to be associated with her . <p> Hemamali did not continue in Maname , because her parents did not want her to perform outstation . Hemamali is forgotten now , but she should not be , said HL , for it was with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play opened to an enraptured audience on the night of Nov 3. 1956 . She was only 18 then but was able rival her two world class male co-players . <p> The Veddha king was a problem . Every candidate brought for role of Veddha was rejected by Sarachchandra . Edmund Wijesinghewas discovered by the students during an undergraduate ' sarong strike ' where he was heard singing songs during the demonstration . Wijesinghe was a mature student who had been a school teacher before he entered university . He vanished from the university soon after the ' Dhoby strike ' and could not be found . He was not living in a hall of residence . <p> Sometime later , Arthur Silva and his friends had gone to a carnival at Bogambara , and had found Wijinghe there , intoxicated . They captured him , and brought him to Peradeniya . Arthur kept him in his room at Arunachalam Hall and delivered him to Sarachchandra the next day . The delighted Sarachchandra , ' accommodated the precious find ' in his own home , where Charles Gurunanse was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an orchestra was formed . The entire orchestra consisted of students from rural schools . The harmonium performer , Kitsiri Amaratunga and flautist Somaratne Edirisinghe were found without difficulty , both were talented . A maddala drummer was needed . Arthur Silva brought in his batch mate and fellow A " Hall resident , G.D . Hemapala Wijayawardhana who had studied the tabla and found the Maddala easy . L.R . Mudalihamy played the violin . He was a school teacher attending the Sinhala diploma course . The esraj was played by Ramya Tumpala . A horanava player could not be found . <p> We rehearsed in the old military building wih a corrugated metal roof that housed the Economics Department . We moved the furniture and sat in a circle and practiced singing . When it came to rehearsals proper we moved to the Junior Common Room where the play gradually took form , said HL . <p> Charles Silva Gunasinghe trained the performers . He taught them to sing nadagama style . The early rehearsals were in fact singing classes . He then trained them in nadagama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle , using specific steps . Tissa Kariyawasam observed that Tricilia did not exactly follow the style given to her by Charles . She made the steps gentler . Most of the performers , had not seen a nadagama and knew nothing about them , but were very cooperative . Hemamali said it was a privilege to have been trained by Charles . <p> The stage set designed by Siri Gunasinghe was a significant piece of work in itself and one that could have contributed to the diversity of an emerging theatre . This was a stage set that represented in abstract the arena of the nadagama , which was its stage . The design primarily consisted of a triangular board representing the thatched roof that sheltered the ' stage ' of the nadagama . It was an imaginative and colorful piece of d ? cor but it was unwieldy and difficult to transport and setting it up demanded much skill and labor . It had to be set up the day before in outstation. it had to be securely done to prevent it from falling on the heads of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to transport and set up . <p> The production side of ' Maname ' was a ' very primitive affair amateur affair ' which depended a great deal on personal and small group contactsaid HL When the play was to be shown at YMBA , stage lights were needed and the only spotlights in the entire country were at the Lionel Wendt . Prof MB Ariyapala knew Mahinda Dias , and Arthur Silva took him along to meet Mahinda at the Colombo Commercial Company office where Mahinda was employed as an electrical engineer . Dias agreed to loan the equipment not only for YMBA performances but for outstation as well . He also sent along an assistant who became a permanent member of the troupe . <p> Siri Gunasinghe made a substantial contribution to ' Maname ' . Siri was the art director for ' Maname ' . He designed the stage set , giving it a triangular board representing the thatched roof that sheltered the stage of a real nadagama . He designed the costumes as well . Their striking use of green and orange showed his exquisite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the total color scheme of the stage . This was an unprecedented visual integration of different components of the performance. 6 <p> Siri was a great support to Sarachchandra , said Amunugama . He was ' constantly behind ' Sarachchandra , who consulted him on many matters . Siri saw to the repairs to Sarachchandra 's Volkswagen car as well . <p> H.L.Seneviratne observed that Aileen Sarachchandra would also have made a contribution behind the scenes , to the success of ' Maname and her contribution should be recognized . She was a talented actress and very musical . Aileen had made the costumes assisted by her niece , Indrani . The two had also done the striking make up . <p> Other dons in the Sinhala Department , such as Ananda Kulasuriya , and D.E . Hettiarachchi also showed interest . M.B. Ariyapala had helped to solve the spotlight problem . He had later sponsored ' Maname ' performances in the south and ' hosted us warmly and lavishly accommodating us in an estate mansion owned by his family ' , recalled HL . <p> I am told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . ' Professor Pieris was also there at the rehearsals , encouraging us ' , I was told . He had made his car available . Ralph 's interest in the play , would have come from his friendship with Sarachchandra . He admired the costumes designed by Siri Gunasinghe ( personal communication ) . I am sure that other members of University would also have helped though their names are not on record . <p> An American student at Peradeniya , Peter La Sha was staying at Ramanathan from where a substantial contingent of the cast came . He had shown great interest in Sinhala culture . Peter learnt Sinhala , and could sing the Maname songs with musical perfection , said HL . <p> Peter knew stage lighting and was easily persuaded to help . It was Peter who managed the stage lighting in Colombo , said HL . Mahinda Dias whose name is given in the programme was an absentee lighting expert . La Sha is also mentioned By Shyamon Jayasinghe , as one of the persons helping in the Colombo performance. 7 Peter La Sha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is definite that the success of ' Maname ' was due to the support given by the rural students . This group understood what Sarachchandra was trying to achieve . Many of the performers , the orchestra , the helpers and organizers of ' Maname ' as well as the office bearers of the Drama circle , who were responsible for the hard background and organization work that went into making ' Maname ' into a landmark play , were drawn from this new rural group . Dedicated and hard working they assisted in creating the ' new ' Sinhala theatre . I think that they would have enjoyed the experience as well . <p> These supporters took on multiple taslks . HL was prepared to play the esraj if needed and provided the calligraphy for the programme in addition to performing in the original cast . Hemapala Ratnasuriya was interested in painting and helped Siri with the art work . Hedesigned the program for the play 's first run at the Lionel Wendt . He was also stage manager . <p> HL stated that without the backing and enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silva , Sarachchandra would not have launched ' Maname ' at the time he did . If ' Maname ' had appeared later , the impact may not have been the same . <p> HL makes special mention of W. Arthur Silva . ' Maname ' owes much to W. Arthur Silva said HL . ' Maname ' would not have become a reality if not for Silva 's relentless effort in dealing with the people involved , including Sarachchandra , who demanded very high standards from not only the actors but all associated with the play , including punctuality . Shyamon Jayasinghe corroborates this . The stalwarts of the Sinhala Drama Society deserve special mention said Shyamon Jayasinghe . They were Arthur Silva , KDP Perera and Wimal Nawagamuwa . <p> As the rehearsals progressed , the indications were that the play was going to be a success . The poetic excellence of the play , the allure of the songs , the music , the visual impact , the excellence of the acting , the perfection of its artistic unity , could be seen at the later rehearsals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipated the impact it would have on the first night audience as indeed it did on all later audiences , said HL.

This means every citizen is entitled to elect their own representative . It personifies that all people are equal . <p> Casting the vote at an election is how the citizens participate in government . The MPs who get elected by the majority vote represent the citizens ' ideas and concerns in the parliament . <p> The National List MPs are unelected . The voter has absolutely nothing to do with them . Basically , they do not know them . <p> Prior to an election , the proposed National List Mps do not engage in any discourse with voters . <p> Universally , the most important criterion to become an MP is that they are elected at an election by the popular vote . The National List MPs are unelected . Thus , they have no legitimacy to sit in the parliament claiming that they represent people . <p> The National List system is contrary to every democratic principle and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more undemocratic than the National List MP system . <p> Based on the number of votes obtained by a political party , they are allocated National List MP slots . This is contrary to the One -- person , One -- vote principle . This is why it is argued that the scheme is undemocratic . <p> Currently out of the 225 MPs in the parliament , 29 are National List MPs -- about 13% of the total parliamentarians . <p> The political party that has secured a National List MP slot can appoint any ' Tom , Dick and Harry ' as the National List MP . This is how the system has operated thus far . Since recently even defeated candidates ( candidates that were rejected by the people at an election ) have been brought in to the parliament thanks to the National List system . They are ' back door entrants ' . The sad irony is that it is the JVP , who portray themselves as ' saviours of democracy ' that introduced this in 2015 . <p> Appointing defeated candidates as National List MPs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the party hierarchy has the absolute liberty and freedom to appoint anyone they wish as a National List MP . Mostly , they appoint persons whom they know that would fit-in well with the corrupt parliamentary culture and process . <p> Because they are unelected , these National List MPs are not accountable to the people . They only show allegiance to their party leadership who handed them the position . It is rumored that a certain National List MP who was in the parliament only for few days collected a duty free car permit before leaving it . A car permit is worth millions of rupees . This loss must be borne by the taxpayer . <p> One noteworthy feature is that these National List MPs are often given plum cabinet positions . They have held such high cabinet positions as Finance , Education , Foreign Affairs , Public Administration and Justice . <p> Sometimes National List positions are given to people who had spent lots of money for the party , personal friends of the party leader and media owners who freely promote the party . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National List nominees are people friendly or that they understand the pulse of the people . <p> The National List MP scheme was introduced by JR Jayawardane on 24 May 1988 when he was the President . He introduced the 14th Amendment to the Constitution in this regard . <p> On that occasion he elaborated that intellectuals , professionals , academics etc should be allowed to be brought into the parliament to run the government . He made a fine case to stress his point . <p> But , he failed to admit that what he was introducing was a totally undemocratic system . <p> By looking at those who have served as National List MPs since 1988 to date one can not say that they have contributed to the betterment of the country . Some may have been well educated , but their contributions to the country 's development and prosperity have been dismal . <p> Some have been well known crooks . Even thugs , vagabonds and former terrorist leaders have sat in the parliament as National List MPs . <p> Like the elected 196 MPs , these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanka to its present position -- we are a bankrupt country . <p> It is well known that an enormous amount of taxpayer funds are spent to maintain and upkeep the 225 parliamentarians .

Australia has only 151 elected MPs ( true , they have a 71 member Senate , who are also elected ) . <p> India , South Africa , Australia , New Zealand , UK , Canada are all Commonwealth countries ; like Sri Lanka none of them have unelected representatives of the people in their parliaments . The situation in the USA is also the same . <p> Again , the National List is a useless concept . It has not served the country of any purpose .

Those who have the money and power always win ahead of the less wealthy and powerful . Thus , it is possible to argue that Manapaya is an undemocratic process . <p> The Proportional Representation System . <p> We must bring back the Westminster style election system where people elect an MP for their constituency . This is the pre -1978 system . The UK , Australia , Canada , India and New Zealand still have it . <p> We have 160 parliamentary constituencies ( electorates ) in Sri Lanka . People should vote for their own MP . Then , the MP is also responsible and accountable to its electorate . <p> By this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strictly adhered to . <p> It is thanks to this system that Mr AsenKhudoos won the Puttalam seat by a mere 103 votes in 1970 . <p> It is due to this that independents like Mudiyanse Thennakoon ( Nikaweratiya ) , RG Senanayake ( Dambadeniya ) and Wijayananda Dahanayake ( Galle ) were able to enter the parliament . <p> Today , it is impossible for an independent to contest an election alone and enter the parliament . This is contrary to the basic democratic principles . <p> In the UK , Australia and Canada swaths of people win elections and enter the parliament as Independents . This is real democracy . <p> In those countries sometimes it is the Independents who determine who will form a government . <p> MPs should not be allowed to switch political parties . <p> People call our MPs ' frogs ' as often they jump from one party to another .

Several heroic sons were born on this island to eradicate this menace from the ' suppressed communities ' of terrorism . When the time where the country was passing ' years of blue ' , the region of Pooneryn was not prosperous with the fear of terrorism , which was instilled in every corner of the Northern area . <p> It was 14 November 1993 and the battle of Pooneryn took its fearsome form with its enemy . LTTE code-named ' Operation Frog Leap ' ; was the battle between the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam and the Sri Lankan Military against this Pooneryn attack . The LTTE undertook a ' surprise attack ' in the Pooneryn , invading the garrison and capturing military establishments . In the first phase of the operation , the Army and the Navy troops broadened their presence in the Pooneryn area establishing a permanent base in 1991 to counter LTTE movements across the Kilali lagoon from the Jaffna peninsula , which was under its control .

Several weeks later , the LTTE launched Operation Frog Leap to destroy the isolated military base in Pooneryn . This was the time when the LTTE had begun to launch its brutal illicit activities , day by day . On 11 November 1993 , the LTTE launched a massive ' land attack ' by destroying the Nagathevanthurai naval detachment and the army defence lines in Pooneryn . The LTTE were able to capture the Pooneryn Camp letting the Army soldiers face an unexpected assault from the lagoon and all the defence lines thereby came under the control of the LTTE . <p> Not only this affected the Army troops but also the naval detachment and its installations , including a radar station , which were destroyed within hours by the brutal terrorists . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' dispatched by the Sri Lanka Air Force .

The Navy executed an amphibious landing on 14 November 1993 enclosing fire from fast gunboats with the support of the newly formed Special Boat Squadron . <p> Heroes never ' wait as a mule ' before the threat . They are ready to exhibit heroism at any cost , no matter what . The LTTE withdrew by the evening of 14 November 1993 and the army re-established its base in Pooneryn once again .

@@95191231 <p> Outlining the main policy thrust underlying Budget 2023 that was unveiled last week , Finance Ministry Secretary Mahinda Siriwardana said it was designed with the intention of contributing to the economic stabilisation path , which the country had already embarked on , while laying the platform for rebooting growth . <p> Speaking at a post-budget forum organised by the Central Bank , Siriwardana said the budget is confronted with three equally tough tasks of funding the government machinery without letting it become dysfunctional , settling the long and large overdue payments to the government suppliers and contributing actively to strengthen the economic stabilisation programme . <p> He showed how hard the daily cash flow management has become , as revenues have n't been nearly enough to meet even the essentials such as payment of salaries and subsidies , making him to soon realise how deep the crisis has run into , since he took over the top job at the ministry in April this year when the economy collapsed . On the outstanding payments to the government suppliers , he disclosed that the government at present has about Rs.200 billion worth of unpaid bills to various parties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And as a result , I know the pain these specific sectors are going through . But unfortunately , the government is not in a position to pay them , " Siriwardana said . <p> The third mission of Budget 2023 , according to him , was to ensure that the budget does not create any more inflation . <p> " This is where I see you have to reduce the Central Bank financing . You know that the Central Bank financing or money printing causes inflation . We have been relying on money printing for long and the challenge is how to come out of this situation and stabilise the fiscal situation , " he said . <p> He characterised the plight of the current situation in the economy to a " deep crisis " , from his first-hand experience of dealing with an avalanche of daily requests he receives from a multitude of parties from around the country , from big corporates to small businesses to people who have fallen victim to the economic crisis . <p> " We are in a crisis , a deep crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is directly facing that , being the Secretary to the Finance Ministry . You would not imagine the requests that I get from various corners : may they be blue-chip companies , SMEs and those who are below that , including the people living in remote areas , " Siriwardana said . <p> The root cause of the current crisis is the unsustainable budget deficits the country has run for decades under successive governments , which Siriwardana summed by saying , " We have lived beyond our means . " <p> While Sri Lanka has embarked on a path to consolidate the budget through both revenue enhancing measures such as tax hikes and expenditure rationalisation , Siriwardana said budgets are not just about consolidating but should also create opportunities for the private sector and specially the aspirational youth in the country . However , how far specific proposals in Budget 2023 addressed their aspirations remains open for debate . <p> Hey Siri , are you high or on drugs to make this kind of DUMB statements , ! !

@@95191236 <h> Sri Lankan rugby still has a lot to offer to Asia and world -- AR President <h> Asian Sevens Series 2022 -- Al Ain Edition <p> Qais Al-Dhalai , the President of Asia Rugby in an exclusive interview with the ' Daily Mirror ' elaborated on the vision , path , process and role administered by the regional body in ensuring the development and spread of the game . The excerpts of the interview are as follows : - <p> Question : What motivated you to get involved in Regional Rugby administration ? <p> Answer : I am an athlete since 7 years old , I played football at club and the UAE national teams until the U19 age group . I represented my country , the UAE , at the Under 17 Asia Cup in the year 2000 . In 2009 , I was appointed as a Board Member of the UAE Rugby Federation due to my sport career as an athlete and since then I have been a Council Member of Asia Rugby and went through the ranks in Asia Rugby from being elected as an Executive Member for the period 2013-2015 to being elected as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in November 2019 , I was elected as President of the biggest continent . Historically , it is the first time in Asian rugby history to elect a President outside East and South East sub regions , however it also reflected the massive trust I gained from all countries in Asia through trust , respect and passion . <p> Question : Would Sri Lanka be considered a venue for 2023 Asian Sevens Series ? <p> Answer : Asia Rugby follows a strict competitions policy , and floats a public bid to all countries on an annual basis for every tournament whether 7s or 15s . In simple language , the best bid will be awarded the hosting rights for our various competitions . Asia Rugby will only guarantee the hosting rights for the best bid . <p> Question : How do you see the scope of Asian Rugby as a force in globalizing the sport ? <p> Answer : Asia Rugby is considered one of the biggest contributors to our sport globally if not the biggest . Speaking only about the major events and not the age groups competitions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ UAE , Asia hosted the Rugby World Cup 2019 in Japan , Asia is hosting three legs of the HSBC World Sevens Series in Dubai , Hong Kong and Singapore ; Asia hosted the RWC 2021 Final Qualifiers in the UAE earlier this year and again is currently hosting the RWC 2023 Final Qualifiers in the UAE - Dubai . <p> Asia is the biggest market for the sport of Rugby ; Asia has 130,750 registered players , 452,150 regular participants , 954,598 social media followers , around 150,000 female players and participants and as legacy from the Rugby World Cup 2019 in Japan , Asia from 2016 until 2019 had 1.8 million participants classified as 1 million in Japan and 800,000 across Asia . Asia has the biggest potential to popularize our sport , to call it a truly international sport for all and for us to miss the opportunity to work collaboratively will indeed be a travesty to our sport . <p> Asia Rugby still has the economic engines of major markets like China , Korea , India , etc .

The country has a massive potential given that rugby is the sport ranked second after Cricket . Sri Lanka has previously played at the HSBC Sevens World Series , played at the Commonwealth Games , played at the ( formerly ) Asian 5 Nations and now called Asia Rugby Championship , and the country still has a lot of talents to offer to Asia and the world . <h> Comments - 0 <h> Add comment <p> Comments will be edited ( grammar , spelling and slang ) and authorized at the discretion of Daily Mirror online .

Dr. Gamini has authored two books , " In the Line of Duty " and " The Extra Mile " . <p> Dr Gamini Goonetilleke <p> Dr. Gamini Goonetilleke brought out anecdotes from his book " The Extra Mile : A Surgeon 's experiences " , which were courage-filled and adrenaline-driven . The audience was at the edge of their seats , entranced by Dr. Goonetilleke 's robust personality and absorbed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his MBBS ( Ceylon ) from the University of Colombo and proceeded to the UK for further training and qualifying as a Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons in England ( FRCS ) , returned to serve his country in 1982 . His first appointment as a Consultant Surgeon in Sri Lanka was to the Base Hospital Polonnaruwa , where he served as the only surgeon for a total period of six and a half years , catering to a population of 260,000 people , the majority being farmers . <p> Dr. Goonetilleke harnessed the bare minimal facilities available at the Base Hospital with unmatched enthusiasm and a strong commitment to the care of his patients . While we were sipping tea after the meeting , his wife Shalendra , with a bright smile , said , " he valued his patients more than anything and everything . It was extremely difficult for me to adapt to a rural environment like Polonnaruwa after being in Colombo for some time . But I had to take that decision to support Gamini . Later on , we all developed an emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he valued his patients ' care more than anything , and that was during Black July in 1983 . My first son was schooling at that time ; as I remember , he was somewhere between five to seven years of age . People in the whole town were running astray with the message that Tigers were entering the village . I called Gamini but could not get through to him quickly as mobile phones were unavailable then . I had to go through numerous landline codes to get to him . Finally , I got to him , and I told him to pick up the son from school , and his response was , " I have patients to attend to " . I exactly can not remember what my response was , but I had to run to the school to rescue my son . I could n't drive during that time either " , she recalled with a bittersweet emotion on her face . <p> Dr. Gamini began his guest lecture by recollecting that the Civil war compounded the surgical admissions to the Polonnaruwa hospital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast injuries brought from the conflict zone in the East and the villages bordering the conflict zone . " The Base Hospital Polonnaruwa was virtually primitive in 1982 ; the operating theatre was dilapidated with basic equipment available ; I was only 32 years old , having returned from the UK . I had never worked out of Colombo but decided to take the plunge , not knowing what my future would be . In the absence of junior doctors at the hospital , the WHO had to get down doctors from Burma along with a Burmese anaesthetist . I also established a special ward for military casualties and also an Intensive Care Unit . None of the doctors was willing to come to this area due to human-elephant conflicts and malaria " , he said . <p> He elaborated that he was not trained to treat war victims as he had studied during relatively peaceful times . Therefore , the initial exposure to war victims was dreadful and horrendous . " In July 1985 , a landmine buried on the main road between the Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa was exploded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought six victims . Three with mutilated bodies were dead on admission , and I tried my very best to save their lives first and then their limbs . <p> Once , a man of 30 years was shot on the left side of his belly , and his small and large intestines had come out instantaneously but his friends have n't had a vehicle to send him to the hospital immediately . Anyhow , the victim had said that he was hungry , and the friends who lacked first aid knowledge had given him King coconut , dhal , and meat curry with roti . He was admitted with a ballooned stomach , and his bowels were hanging out . This was a serious condition that I had never seen before or read about in any textbook or medical journal . There was no anaesthetist , and I had to also play the role of an anaesthetist . Once I had connected him to the anaesthetic machine , I requested the house officer to observe his vitals , as there were no monitors to do so . The stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowel was damaged , so it was safest to keep that " part out " the audience was sucked into his horrendous experiences as they pondered the travails of a time with such little smart technology . <p> He also recalled a galling incident concerning a politician and his secretary who had been subjected to a hand grenade explosion . " Even though the victim was a politician , I had to apply the theory of " Triage , " which means sorting out the patient with severe injuries and treating them according to the seriousness of the injuries . Upali , the secretary of the politician , had his left leg mangled by the grenade blast as it had exploded near his feet . The main blood vessel in his left arm was damaged and impaired circulation to his arm . And also , a metal fragment had penetrated his left eye , and the eye was beyond repair . The politician did not require urgent surgery as he had no internal damage . But his political stalwarts were ravaging the hospital , and I got numerous calls to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , it would be " curtains " for Upali . I told the radiologist to spend excessive time taking x-rays of the politician till I had attended Upali . I had to amputate Upali 's leg to save him , and he also lost one eye . By the time I had finished treating Upali , I was soaked in blood . So before attending to the politician , I went to change my kit , and to my surprise , while I was in my underwear , the politician 's wife was just there kneeling and requesting , " Ane Budu Mahattayo , mage manussaya berala denna " . I was in shock , and meanwhile , there was immense pressure from the President 's house to airlift him to Colombo , but I was determined to keep him one night at Polonnaruwa , and I did so . Anyhow later , he was dispatched to Colombo on a request by the higher powers . Upali remained at the Polonnaruwa Hospital ; he had no regrets ; he had lost his leg , job , eye , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he was sure that I would not desert him , I gave birth to him again and rehabilitated him . My advice is , do not get too close to politicians " the audience was smiling , divided between tears and happiness . <p> Furthermore , he said that he did not want the experience he gathered to go to waste . Therefore he volunteered to treat at the High-security zone in Palaly , Jaffna , where casualties from the Northern war-front were being treated . " I knew flying to the Northern Warfront was a high-risk adventure , but I took the plunge for the service of the nation . I flew to the warfront not only with my healing knife but also with my pocket-size camera Olympus Trip 35mm , which captured the scenes that are of historical importance today . The armed forces lost large swathes of land in the Jaffna peninsula and were confined to only a few areas . The aerial route became the most important route for the transfer of men and material between Colombo and Jaffna . I flew to Palali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passengers . So the seats were removed , and many men and materials were taken . We had to sit on the floor , which was extremely difficult during take-off and landing . One time , I travelled sitting on metal barrels in the cargo compartment , later realising that those were lethal bomb barrels " , he smiled nonchalantly while the audience was enamoured . <p> Dr. Goonetilleke stated that the predominant weapons in the initial phase of the Eelam war were landmines and bombs . " The heightened conflict in the North-East of Sri Lanka resulted in many antipersonnel mines being buried in the region by both parties . Soldiers who stepped on antipersonnel mines had their feet blown or lacerated . Some had their foot hanging by pieces of skin or bone . Their cries haunt me even today . Many were unemployed village boys who had joined the army and they believed losing their legs would end their lives as they were the sole breadwinners of their families . But " Save life before limb " . The LTTE had their own antipersonnel mines in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mine " ; the production cost of one was Rs. 250 then " , he sighed . <p> " After the LTTE 's capture of the Jaffna Fort in September 1990 , the entire Jaffna Peninsula was under the control of the LTTE , except for the High-Security Zone in Palali , Jaffna , and Elephant Pass at the neck of the peninsula . LTTE imposed tough regulations for travel in and out of the peninsula , and people from the south were barred from entering and leaving . I received a phone call in early September 1994 from the only consultant surgeon Dr. M Ganesharatnam inviting me as an external examiner at the final MBBS examination for the Medical student at Jaffna university . He knew that I was keen to visit Jaffna , but I was concerned about my security going to a rebel-controlled land . Then he said that he would get the approval of Prabhakaran , and thus my safety was assured . My appointment as an external examiner was confirmed via the International Committee of the Red Cross(ICRC) " , Dr. Gamini said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered while sipping tea with Dr. Gamini 's wife Shalendra . " I dropped him at the ICRC . He did not look at me as he knew it was an unbearable situation . After he left for Jaffna , there were days when he sometimes went on for more than 15 days without any contact . I had to rely on whatever information ICRC gave me . Most days , I was anxious and tense , not knowing whom to believe and whom to contact . Those were heavy days " , she exhaled . <p> Back to Dr. Gamini 's side of the story . " I was the first Sinhala doctor to enter the Jaffna peninsula after the onset of the civil war in 1983 . Those in control had no objections to my visiting Jaffna , others were taken to a separate counter for immigration and customs clearance . No one checked me or my luggage for any prohibited items . I did not have newspapers or liquor with me but I had my precious camera . I was cleared in quick time in a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tourist Hotel that gave me accommodation . I was the only guest in a 30-room guest hotel . The next day the owner of the hotel brought <p> " Ealanatham " the official newspaper of the LTTE , which indicated the arrival of Professor Gamini Goonetilleke in Jaffna . The people living in Jaffna were kept informed about an outsider in the city of Jaffna who was a Sinhalese doctor " , Dr Gamini gave a bright smile . <p> Dr Gamini was met with another surprise when he found Somaratne while he was examining patients . Somaratne was a fisherman who had drifted to the North-Eastern waters off the coast of Mullaitivu which was in control of the LTTE . He and his friend were arrested . Ranjan had been assaulted , and his face was swollen . Somaratne had developed severe pain in the abdomen and Dr Gamini revealed that he was suffering from kidney stones . " I gathered their details and they were elated to have found someone from the south who could communicate in Sinhala . I promised them that I would do my best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although they were receiving treatment at the hospital , they were to be released from the ward and sent back to the LTTE prison . <p> I wondered what their fate would be .

I sent a message to the head of LTTE via the ICRC . The LTTE hierarchy acceded to my request to release the fishermen from their custody . However , they could not release the fishermen directly to me ; only through the ICRC , they could release them . So the ICRC handed the prisoners to me at the Point Pedro Jetty " , he said with a sparkling smile . <p> Dr Gamini 's " The Extra Mile " is an immense inspiration that teach us all the value of commitment and perseverance .

@@95432230 <h> Youth Observer <h> Monk Discourse Bill to be made law <p> The Parliament recently approved the proposal to amend the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance and the drafting of the Theravada Bhikkhu Discourse Bill . It is now set to be made into law following the considerations of the Attorney General 's Department and on the agreement of all parties . The proposal was put forward by the Minister of Buddhasasana , religious and cultural affairs Vidura Wickremanayake . While the Buddhist Temporalities Act was enacted 91 years ago , the first attempt to amend it failed . <p> Sri Lanka is home to many ancient temples and shrines . During the rule of the Kings , acres of land were bestowed to these places of worship for their maintenance . There have also been incidents where certain bhikkhus have attempted to obtain ownership of these lands in greed . <p> Some were even successful in doing so . Certain outsiders also enjoyed the benefits of these lands resulting in the Maha Sangha facing many difficulties in managing these lands and properties . <p> It was to resolve these issues that the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance in its current form was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The act states " Around the year 1905 , since the Buddhist temples and shrines have not received sufficient protection from the provisions of the Buddhist Temporalities Act , after deciding that it is advisable to arrange a management organisation system for such Buddhist temples and shrines to receive sufficient protection , with the advice and approval of the Legislative Council , the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance No. 19 of 1931 was brought forward by the Governor of Ceylon on June 26 , 1931 . " <p> According to the Commissioner General of Buddhist Affairs , Sunanda Kariyapperuma two main tasks are scheduled to take place in relation to the amendments . " One is the Buddhist Temporalities Act , Ordinance No.19 of 1931 . This was enacted prior to Sri Lanka obtaining its independence . It has been 91 years since and has not been amended to suit modern times . For example , only simple things such as the title of Commissioner being renamed as Commissioner General or seeking the opinion of the Basnayake Nilame in a vote has changed . <p> First time <p> This will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law . One major change will be that a law will be introduced to stop the loss of temple land due to illegal possession and so on . It will allow the Commissioner General to take over any temple land that is being utilised by another . The person using the land can challenge this in court and if he can prove it belongs to him he can claim ownership . If not it will be taken over or he can continue to use it subject to a tax , " he said . <p> Kariyapperuma said certain fines under the act have also not been revised . " For example , a bhikku was only allowed to retain Rs. 500 as savings in the bank . This will be amended to suit today 's day and age . The fine of appearing as a bhikkhu or samanera without having his name in the ordination list was Rs. 50 . This will be increased to Rs. 10 , 000 " he said . <p> He said that while S. 23 allows bhikkhus to acquire and maintain private property or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are yet under discussion and will soon come into law . <p> " The Theravada Bhiikhu Discourse Bill will register the discourse under the Buddha Sasana Ministry giving legal powers to act according to the discourses of each Buddhist sect in the country . <p> Then , in the event that any problem arises , by pointing out in the court that the discourse was acted upon , the discourse itself will be accepted . Even though the law says so , the accused party has the possibility to seek the help of the court in the event that it is stated that the decision was not given impartially considering both parties equally . <p> However , if the discourse has adhered to the same decision will be given . This will allow action to be taken against those carrying out various wrongful acts while in the guise of being a bhikkhu . Legal power will be granted to take action against such persons according to the discourse of the sect helping to maintain the discipline of the Maha Sangha , " he said . <p> Currently , Sri Lanka @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 40 , 000 have been registered as bhikkhus . <p> Commenting on the proposed reforms , Ven . Narampanawe Ananda Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter said the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance must be amended to suit today 's day and age . <p> " However , today it is not only the Buddha Sasana that is in a crisis . The country 's culture , economy and politics are also in a crisis . There is a sense of chaos that we have not witnessed before . Therefore , given the situation , we are not able to believe the crisis within the Sasana can be rectified . If we consider the past , when a country sees a political decline , its economy , society , culture and religion follow suit . <p> Therefore , we do not approve the sudden decision to bring laws for bhikkhus without an understanding of these happenings . We can not agree to this . There are many issues within the existing bhikkhu discourses . Each sect and chapter has passed discourses of its own . <p> Politics <p> When these are legalised , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inter-discourse issues ? For example , one sect might say a bhikkhu can engage in politics while another might hold a different view . One sect might approve of providing driving licences to bhikkhus while another might disagree . Therefore , legalising these discourses will create issues that could have been avoided , " he said . <p> Meanwhile , the secretary of the Sri Kalyani Samagri Dharma Maha Sangha Sabha , Amandoluwe Dhammaratana Thera said , that the forms should have taken place in a timely manner . <p> " This is not something that took place on a whim . The Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance was read end to end for many days . A Sangha Sabha bench consisting of the Maha Sangha of the three sects created these amendments after much discussion . <p> All were party to these discussions and the amendments were agreed upon collectively . The issue with earlier attempts was that a vastly different bill to that which was discussed with us was presented to parliament . <p> Therefore , even bhikkhus who discussed these previously disagreed with it . We hope that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of others . There were weaknesses in taking action against bhikkhus who entered monkhood and then carried out wrongful activities . <p> Sangha Sabha <p> Some used these weaknesses to carry out corrupt and fraudulent acts . Some don the robes and commit wrongs . Others pretend to be both a lay person and a bhikkhu to carry out wrong acts . <p> The Sangha Sabha nor the Police take any action regarding these in fear of human rights . If a person is representing a particular institution then they must adhere to its discipline . <p> It needs a strong background . That is how this bill was created . But there is no use if it is passed but not put into action . For example despite having laws to support if property of drug smugglers are not confiscated in Sri Lanka . We will not get the result we seek if it is kept aside after it is passed , " the Thera said .

@@95432239 <h> One World Foundation : A Social Sculpture <p> In the town of Ahungalla , a two-hour rail journey to the South of Colombo , in a beautiful plot of land facing the Southern golden beach , there is One World Foundation ( OWF ) , a school dedicated to free education supported by Bogenvillya , a guesthouse and a centre for modern art and literature . <p> The brainchild of this amazing concept of One World Foundation is Kathrin Messner 's and her husband Joseph Ortner 's who died quite unexpectedly in 2009 . In the winter of 1983 , Kathrin , Joseph and their daughter Xiane came to Sri Lanka for the first time , searching for a second home which could offer them new experiences to add to their lives in Vienna and their work in the field of international contemporary art . <p> Although they had originally wanted to head for California and had arrived here in Sri Lanka more or less by chance , they felt a spontaneous sense of connection with the island and its people . " Although it was the first time we travelled in Sri Lanka , we immediately fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a greenery heaven at the very first sight , " speaking to the Sunday Observer Kathrin recalled her very first experience with Sri Lanka . They decided to invest a moderate sum in a small piece of land and made a building that they conceived as a place for meeting artists from among their circle of friends . <p> Free Education Unit <p> Kathrin Messner <p> As they then travelled around and met young people who could hardly speak English , they developed the idea of establishing a school which could offer some of this generation an opportunity of learning the language of the former colonial power as a means of enabling them to make a free and liberated contribution to the cultural and economic development of their country . <p> Kathrin bought a detached house on the site next to today 's Bogenvillya and converted the living space into two classrooms . On August 27 , 1995 , they opened a school with two teachers and around 100 pupils . From the beginning , the campus has been open to everyone who had the enthusiasm to learn English and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the immediate neighbourhood although some are prepared to travel long distances to be able to learn at the OWF . <p> " After gaining independence from the British rule , Sri Lanka 's post-colonial generations tried to suppress as much as possible all memories of foreign rule with the effect that even the English language , once spoken by a significant proportion of the population was removed from the curriculum . As a result , the island largely lost its capability to communicate abroad and become increasingly isolated . That was one of the key reasons as the founders of OWF we were keen to teach English as a foreign language at an early age , " Kathrin said . <p> From the start , One World Foundation was guided more by Katherin 's and Joseph 's intuition than by any strategic concept . As Europeans they wanted to express their notion that they all live in the same world and they decided to establish a simple closed loop which would establish a clear relationship between their two spheres : the rental income from a guesthouse should finance the running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel broadens the mind in two ways " they sought out people in their circle who enjoyed travel and wanted to relax and they were lucky to have a positive response . Despite the various challenges posed by the cultural , climatic and political environment in Sri Lanka , they constantly improved their offering and used the growing income to expand the school . <p> Even if the commitment to contemporary art represented by their Vienna-based arts association ' museum in progress ' remains quite separate from the Sri Lankan social project in terms of both content and organisation , both initiatives were , and remain , inspired by the same position : Their desire to make things happen and their trust in the partners with whom they work . This prerequisite for all their activity informs both their cooperation with local forces and their relationship with those friends and organisations that inspire this project with their ideas and enhance it with their hard work . <p> In the 25 years since it was started , the free education unit of OWF has experienced continuous annual growth of around 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents an increase from an initial 100 to almost 1,500 in the number of young people . The free education unit is consisted with education and training up to level 4 of the National Vocational Qualification ( NVQ ) . OWF 's next aim is to obtain certification for Level 5 -- Diploma level for future supervisors . <p> Unique architecture <p> The unique architecture in One World Foundation provides the framework for its activities and encounters . The first building was designed by late Joseph Ortner , the co-founder of One World Foundation , who set out to originally combine a modern European aesthetic with the surrounding nature and the possibilities offered by local craftspeople . <p> In this regard , he found a partner in the architect Carl Pruscha who designed the lagoon bungalows , the palm grove bungalows and the school campus in Ahungalla -- who was as congenial as he was combative . Work on the most recent building , the Araliya bungalow , was completed in the same spirit in partnership with a representative of the contemporary Sri Lankan architecture scene , Varuna de Silva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sri Lanka is expressed in two initiatives which add something very special to One World Foundation . Ever since they established an artists ' in-residence program together with the gallery owner Ursula Krinzinger and a writers ' in-residence program in cooperation with author Robert Menasse , artists and writers have been coming regularly to Bogenvillya to work . This artistic-intellectual exchange builds on their original intentions in the best possible way and is of incalculable value for all those involved . <p> The true value of the network that OWF and its guests had developed over the years became overwhelmingly clear in the wake of the tsunami of December 26 , 2004 , which destroyed virtually everything that they had created with a single wave . <p> " In the very midst of the chaos , we sensed a positive energy that gave us the courage to tackle the rebuilding . First of all , we decided to find an appropriate piece of land at a safe distance to the coast . The choice fell upon a wasteland just outside Ahungalla and opposite the railway station of the Colombo-Galle line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as by public transport from further away . <p> One World Foundation free education unit <p> Support from the municipality of Vienna enabled us to acquire this safe site and create a new school building designed by Carl Pruscha , a renowned architect from Vienna and very good friend of us , " Kathrin said . <p> In addition , countless donations from organisations and persons and the proceeds from an auction organised by artist Eva Schlegel supported the rebuilding of both the school in the form that it is today and of the guesthouse as a means of generating the income to continue financing the school . <p> " Even if much has changed in Sri Lanka during the course of the past 25 years and a middle class is gradually emerging to occupy the gap between the very rich and very poor segments of the population , most rural people continue to be highly influenced by religion and very close to nature . " <p> " Everyone here loves to see things grow and hence we experience the growing skills of our employees and their tireless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sparkling eagerness to learn and the contagious joie de vivre ( cheerful enjoyment of life ) of our pupils . " Kathrin added . <p> Art and writer residencies <p> The One World Foundation promotes cultural exchange and mutual understanding across borders . As a meeting place and space for creative exchange , artists and writers are offered an inspiring place to stay and a suitable studio for their work . Here , in the Art and Residencies program , surrounded by palm forests , these creative people are given the opportunity to be inspired by encounters with both guests and locals . <p> Since 2009 , Galerie Krinzinger has been running an Artist in Residence Program in cooperation with the One World Foundation . A studio was built in 2009 on the former school ground , where the school facilities of the One World Foundation had existed until the tsunami in 2004 . The program was initiated in January 2010 and is now available as a workplace for the artists invited by the gallery . <p> Writer in Residence Program at OWF is sponsored by the Austrian Federal Ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert Menasse . Authors who work on transnational and trans-cultural projects , or who are interested in telling about the one world we all share -- but do not necessarily know -- are invited to three-month stays to write and develop projects . <p> Shining OWF <p> Today , OWF employs around 40 teachers who educate over a thousand children and adults on its campus in Ahungalla . The guesthouse Bogenvillya accommodates 14 rooms spread among the six different buildings set in an extensive garden setting which is looked after by a staff of 30 and which also includes an Ayurveda unit which employs five trained healers . <p> One world Foundation is a framework that have created in which some things become possible and much more can happen . Many of written testimonies express their gratitude for all the efforts Kathrin Messner and following the death of Joseph Ortner are prepared to make for the children in Sri Lanka . <p> One World Foundation is a social sculpture which filled with life and substance by the contributions , the ideas , commitment and material support of all participants . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors which can neither foresee nor influence .

@@95432240 <h> Youth Observer <h> All have a role to play <p> Just a couple of weeks ago , a 14-year-old girl and her father were killed instantly when they were mowed down by a drunk driver in a pickup , within sight of their home . This is just one fatal road accident among the many that occur in Sri Lanka with alarming frequency . <p> Sri Lanka 's roads are among the deadliest in the world -- with around 3,000 deaths every year or roughly six every day . Around 8,000 are injured per year , some of them seriously . Around 38,000 vehicle crashes occur in Sri Lanka every year , not counting those not reported to Police after drivers mutually exchange insurance details . The estimated annual road crash deaths per capita in Sri Lanka is the highest among its immediate neighbour in South Asia and five times that of the best performing countries . Over two-thirds of road crash victims are productive , working age adults between 15-64 years . <p> Huge burden <p> One glaring fact that is often ignored in these accident statistics is the massive health cost of accidents , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injured in accidents . This can be a huge burden to developing countries with free healthcare systems , such as Sri Lanka . In fact , the World Bank has estimated that accidents and related costs ( such as health costs , loss of youth etc ) could cost as much as 5 percent of the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) annually for countries such as Sri Lanka in the long term . The World Bank has estimated that Sri Lanka might need an investment of over US$ 2 billion over the next few years to combat the road safety crisis . <p> In fact , a bigger investment has to be made for the first responders -- the Ambulance service , fire brigade and the accident services of both State and private hospitals . In an accident with survivors , the first hour is often called the Golden Hour , because there is still a chance of saving their lives with proper and swift medical care within this period . The 1990 Suwa Seriya service must be upgraded with more fully-equipped ambulances and better trained crew members . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport seriously injured persons to the nearest big hospitals where life saving blood transfusions and surgery can be performed . <p> Earlier , there was a proposal to establish an Air Ambulance Service in Sri Lanka at the rate of one helicopter per province . This may seem to be absurdly expensive for a country facing an economic crisis , but it is a worthwhile investment that will help save many lives in the long term . Hospitals such as Colombo , Peradeniya and Karapitiya can handle serious injury cases that many rural hospitals can not . If an Air Ambulance Service is available , such patients can be safely transport to one of these hospitals in under 30 minutes from almost anywhere in the island . <p> Lack of information <p> Another factor that hinders rapid treatment is the lack of information on accident victims , including blood types . While the new Driver 's Licence is supposed to contain such information , it is doubtful whether the Police , First Responders or the Accident Service personnel have the facilities to " read " them . Delays are caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and garner some other useful information . These shortcomings should be rectified without delay . <p> Both these aspects ( air ambulance and information on victims ) also apply to the critical sphere of organ donation . Gruesome it may be , but young victims of accidents are the perfect organ donors as their organs are often in prime condition . Almost all of their organs from the eyes to the heart can be transplanted to those on the waiting list for organs if they can be transported swiftly . This is another crucial role played by Air Ambulance Services in other countries . It is also vital to educate the Sri Lankan public on the concept of " presumed consent " whereby the first responders take the vital organs of victims of fatal accidents on the assumption that relatives will give their consent anyway . <p> Moreover , hospitals must clearly outline their policy with regard to " brain dead " accident victims who have a very , very slim chance of revival . In such cases , the relatives face the dilemma of choosing between switching off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of the former , six or seven people waiting on the transplant list will benefit . Of course , these are issues with moral and ethical dimensions that should ideally be discussed in a future article . <p> No ' P Plate ' in Sri Lanka <p> But before we get ahead of ourselves , the factors that lead to accidents , fatal or otherwise , have to be analysed . Sri Lanka is one of the few countries where a youngster can get the driver 's licence today and drive a high-powered Porsche tomorrow , no questions asked . Most other countries have a P Plate ( for " Probationary " ) which young drivers have to display for a couple of years , until they are fully conversant with road rules and manners . In some countries , they are also supposed to drive only with a licensed driver in the passenger seat . <p> Young drivers in many countries have to get a separate licence to drive on expressways . This was discussed here sometime back , but nothing happened . This system should be introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from next year . Under the latter system , drivers will get demerit points in addition to the existing fines . Theoretically , one could lose so many points and lose the licence as well . <p> The fines for certain serious offences are still inadequate and should be increased . The private bus lobby was successful in watering down many of the fines , which is understandable given that private buses ( and three wheelers ) are involved in most crashes . But these should be increased if some sanity is to be restored to our roads . <p> Prevention <p> Driver training is the key to the prevention of most accidents -- and most accidents can be prevented , apart from those caused by bad road or weather conditions . It is rather well-known that most driver training schools have " arrangements " in place to ensure that their students pass the practical test . Driving schools must be strictly regulated to ensure that they give a thorough training to their students . The first thing that learner drivers should learn is that " speeding kills " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But training to drive per se is not enough . Discipline is the other factor that most drivers solely lack . Almost 90 per cent of accidents can be avoided if all drivers ( and indeed , all other road users including pedestrians ) are disciplined . Many drivers will sound their horn if the car in front halts even at a pedestrian crossing . Such impatience serves no purpose at all on the road . <p> On the road , it is quite all right to be late ( rather than be sorry ) . Both private bus and three wheelers drivers badly need a dose of discipline -- that alone will see a reduction in the number of fatal accidents . And if Sri Lanka is serious about reducing the number of accidents , there is no doubt whatsoever that three wheelers have to be phased out , at least by 2035 . They weave in and out of traffic , make sudden stops and U-turns , discharge passengers onto oncoming traffic and generally disregard all road rules . If they are gone , most accidents will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Driving Under the Influence ( DUI ) of Liquor is also a key cause of accidents , despite the existence of harsh punishments including the cancellation of drivers ' licenses . The Police need more modern equipment to detect drunken drivers . But DUI is not the only problem . The private bus union bosses have admitted that as many as 70 per cent of their drivers are using banned narcotics substances , which can imperil their judgement at a crucial moment . In this context , the Government has finally decided to get down equipment that can detect drug usage among drivers . New laws will have to be brought to impose penalties on such drivers , as the existing laws do not cover this particular aspect . <p> We already discussed young drivers , but old drivers can be a problem too . Reflexes and impulses get weaker as one ages , so old drivers may react a little bit too late in a crunch situation . Even a half second 's delay is enough to decide someone 's fate . This is especially so for older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an upper age limit for drivers of any vehicle category , it is up to the older drivers and their families to decide whether to call it a day . <p> Another problem that is common to all age groups of drivers is falling asleep at the wheel . We have all heard the joke about " my grandfather died peacefully in his sleep , not screaming like the others in the car he was driving " , but falling asleep at the wheel is no joke . Even a second 's sleep ( called Microsleep ) can be fatal to the driver , passengers and other road users . The golden rule is , if you are feeling sleepy , pull aside , rest , refresh and go again ( unless there is another driver who can take over ) . It is also not advisable to drive after certain medications which may induce drowsiness as a side or intentional effect . <p> Mechanical defects <p> It is also vital to keep one 's vehicle in good condition and inspect it thoroughly specially before a long trip on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even low tyre pressure or worn out tyres can cause an accident . It is also essential to check the spare tyre occasionally . If the wipers do not work properly in the rain , low visibility could lead to an accident . Brakes are the most essential item that should be checked regularly , as good brakes can prevent an accident and save a life -- possibly your own . <p> And drivers must exercise extra caution when driving in bad weather conditions such as torrential rain or heavy mist . They must also be careful when driving at night , regardless of weather . Visibility may be poor in some instances even with good headlights -- which , incidentally , are another part of the vehicle that should be checked regularly , along with turn indicators and hazard lights . <p> Good policing can play a part in reducing accidents . Unfortunately , the Police here are more concerned about collecting fines to meet their " targets " rather than educating motorists on their road habits . It is also well known that Traffic Police officers turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' vehicles break every known road rule . This impunity must stop . <p> The law must apply equally to all motorists across the board . The above categories must not be exempted from the need to obey road rules . In other countries , even Prime Ministers have been fined for not wearing seat belts and speeding . It is too much to expect here , but the Police should muster the courage to stop at least a lowly politician 's vehicle if that driver commits an offence . <p> Compensation and legal action <p> This brings us to the whole question of compensation and legal action especially in case of fatal accidents . Over the years , there have been many cases of politicians ' vehicles ( or for that matter , vehicles driven by celebreties , sportspersons and businessmen ) knocking down pedestrians and cyclists , snuffing out the lives of family breadwinners . However , they usually get away with paying a meagre amount as compensation to the victim 's families and go scot-free , with no legal complications . This must stop . They should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay -- in more ways than one . <p> The road is a dangerous place -- you are a million times more likely to die in a car crash than in a plane crash . It is up to all of us to exercise caution when undertaking a road journey , be it on foot or in a Bentley limousine . Sometimes these steps are rather simple -- wear high visibility clothing when walking at night or equip your bicycle with a dynamo light -- but they could mean the difference between life and death . Always , always , think several seconds ahead on the road and anticipate what could happen . That will prevent you from becoming just another grim statistic .

Amid the record inflation created by the central bank , nominal GDP expanded 45 percent to 6.4 trillion rupees . <p> Sri Lanka is reeling from the worse monetary shock delivered by the central bank in its history after two years of money printing led to a collapse of the currency from 200 to 260 to the US dollar due to a float botched with a surrender rule . <p> " High prices of construction materials , problems associated with fertilizer usage and agrochemical sectors , .. , difficulties in distributing goods , decrease in the demand of essential and non-essential goods and services due to the reduction of the real income of the people have directed the economy towards this decline , " the statistics office said . <p> ECONOMYNEXT -- Zimbabwe 's economy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 285 percent in August 2022 , the International Monetary Fund said as the country 's central bank mis-managed money supply and the currency . <p> Sri Lanka 's central bank generated inflation of 70.2 percent in August after two year of money printing to target an output gap ( growth ) . <p> The IMF gave technical assistance to the country 's macro-economists who have printed money for 72 years and gone to the IMF 16 times to calculate an output gap . <p> Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe is one of the most notorious soft-pegged central banks in the world that had created hyperinflation in the past using modern liquidity tools and legal tender laws . <p> Zimbabwe and the poor had a brief respite as people dumped the central bank 's paper and moved to dollarization , with US dollars , the Euro , South Africa Rand and the central bank lost the ability to conduct ' monetary policy ' . <p> But the RBZ is now back to conducting ' monetary policy ' and instability . <p> Like the Fed , the RBZ had accommodated Coronavirus -- a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classical economists had argued against from the 19th century .

These multiple shocks will continue to weigh on Zimbabwe 's growth prospects , " the IMF said about Zimbabwe . <p> " Currency and price pressures , which emerged earlier this year largely owing to a spike in broad money growth and an official exchange rate misaligned with market fundamentals , are subsiding . <p> " Annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2022 , has been decelerating since , a trend which if sustained by appropriate policies , would go a long way in anchoring inflation expectations .

Weighing in on the matter , which sparked outrage across all sectors of society , CMA Sri Lanka President Prof. Lakshman R. Watawala urged the authorities to resort to better costing and pricing of electricity while transitioning to a least cost power generation mix to prevent shock tariff hikes . <p> As part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fast-track the unbundling of the Ceylon Electricity Board ( CEB ) between the generation , transmission and distribution divisions , invite public-private partnerships to each of these sectors and list them on the Colombo Stock Exchange to rid these companies from undue government interferences . <p> The officials at the Power and Energy Ministry and CEB , ignoring the calls to withhold another round of tariff hikes , on Tuesday proposed to increase electricity tariffs by about 65 percent from January next year , to avoid hours-long power cuts in the new year . <p> The government earlier delivered a 75 percent average tariff hike on August 10 , which sent ripples through households and corporate balance sheets . <p> Prof. Watawala said that even the August tariff hike was too excessive and another similar-sized tariff hike could spell disaster on households and broader economy . <p> " the government has announced another ( tariff ) increase from 2023 and this will be a major burden on the consumer and a disaster for economic development , " he said . <p> Some economic analysts opine that the government should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interim , without entirely killing the economy further , as it will be a worthwhile trade-off authorities could make until they work towards finding the least cost energy mix by gradually cutting reliance on expensive thermal energy . <p> " Being pragmatic means to decide between if you are going to repeatedly strangle the entire economy , just to bring the CEB losses to zero or instead , you help the economy to recover while tolerating some modest losses at the CEB for a brief period because the latter helps you with more tax revenues to cover the losses since you allow the economy to function , " said an economic analyst on condition of anonymity . <p> Prof. Watawala meanwhile reminded that the August tariff hike was necessitated by the sharp fall in the value of the rupee against the dollar , which sent the prices of every imported good by at least twice and the equally large surge in energy and commodities prices in the global market , particularly after Russia invaded Ukraine .

" If this is the case , then it is a very exceptional matter and needs immediate corrective action without consumers being penalised in these difficult times , " he added . <p> Prof. Watawala , for years , has been calling to engage qualified management and financial accountants by these loss-making state institutions to get their costing and pricing decisions right but to no avail . <p> He urged the officials to carry out mandatory cost audits via the help of a cost auditor , who could be a member of CMA Sri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least cost and any inefficiencies and waste are properly reported . <p> " The cost audit will be based on the cost accounting records and is different from a financial audit and is compulsory in many South Asian countries .

@@95961233 <h> If immigrants look back at Sri Lanka ! - EDITORIAL <p> How can we make Sri Lankans think differently with the beginning of a new year being just around the corner ? One way of thinking in these lines which has n't been pursues much is to go to another country and look at ways of developing this island . One book which can help us achieve that is the present Booker Prize winning novel ' The Seven Moons of Maali Almeida ' . Its author Shehan Karunatilaka won this prize through his writing probably because he saw different details of Sri Lanka while living abroad . There are so many promising writers in Sri Lanka who do n't travel overseas ; hence the experience they possess to write with being very limited . This is despite most of them living in the thick of disasters like the island 's civil war . <p> Most Sri Lankans promote state enterprise and through it concessions for people . Sri Lanka at one time promoted socialism and boosted this theory by taking over private enterprises that were n't performing . However countries like China , despite holding on to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow as nations . Sri Lanka still largely waits for the investor to surface with ideas . Most of these ideas and business proposals are shot down by the trade unions of state enterprise . This is done to keep working less productively and secure the jobs of the average performers . A classic example for this is the objection the Sri Lankan government encountered when attempting to strike a deal with the Indian Adani Group in selling much of the stake of the Colombo Harbour 's East Jetty . The Indian company was eventually given 85% of the stake of the West Jetty of the harbour instead . In a country like China it 's the state that decides on how much and what state enterprises are privatised . In Sri Lanka it 's the workers represented trade unions and priests that influence such crucial decision making . When the Rajapaksa regime won the war in 2009 the people of this country saw the emergence of a Demi God- the then president . The then president Mahinda Rajapaksa was considered as the next able leader after King Dutugemunu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remind everyone what a great nation we were and that people had forgotten about that ! The Rajapaksa regime obtained massive loans and chunks of it went on making roads and highways . When people travelled on these facilities they started believing much of the propaganda which rolled out of the then president 's media machine . People were overwhelmed by what they saw as development which came in the form of massive structures . China however read the situation differently . Their ( China 's ) alternative view showed that Sri Lanka 's then regime ( Between 2005-2015 ) was more in the line of being predictable rather than being great . China observed that Sri Lanka would continue taking loans not knowing how to repay them . Much of the misery we are experiencing is because of that period of rule . <p> These are days when qualified professionals and ambitious youth are migrating in hordes . But this is also the time when ambitious foreign business entities are sending their representatives to consider investment ; because the island still has much potential given its geographical location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is get rid of unions and underperforming labour if they start business here . Why ca n't the government do the same given that it has more power than all the island 's thriving limited liability companies put together ? <p> If Sri Lanka needs to come out of this financial mess putting these unions in their place is as important as getting rid of corrupt politicians . With the dawn of the New Year more people will immigrate . More Sri Lankans living outside the nation would perhaps read ' Seven Moons of Maali Almeida ' . But how many would remember Sri Lanka and want to return and do something for this lovely country . <p> We have lovely smiles which capture the hearts of visitors and foreigners . But the island 's savage mentality surfaces when people see opportunity and with it competition . This is why people who want to leave Sri Lanka must read Shehan 's masterpiece . It 's easy for Sri Lankans who immigrate to fathom the author 's wish regarding the book . Shehan wants his book moved from the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come .

On the final day of the hearing , Shani Abeysekara- who was the chief investigating officer in this case- was not included as a witness . But my lawyer requested his presence .

Prageeth has called Gamini and said that there are some people who are coming to Colombo and that they do n't know the city much . Therefore he had requested Gamini to find a three-wheeler to accompany them . Between 8-8.30pm on January 24 , 2010 , when Gamini had called Prageeth , he had responded to the call and said that his ' friends ' had come and that he is with them.Gamini had overheard them saying that this is not the route to reach Koswatte .

All institutions have given statements saying that Prageeth has never worked with any terrorist organization <p> QHow is it like to seek justice ( as a woman ) for a loved one who has been forcibly disappeared in a country like Sri Lanka ? <p> It is not a bed of roses . Sri Lankans harbour the mentality that I 'm not the only person who has experienced a situation like this . There are many other women whose husbands have been forcibly disappeared . So how come it 's a problem only for me ? That is how they perceive this issue . When solving a crime there has to be some political support when seeking justice . Even in that case they think that the disappeared person is no more . So for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ task . In most instances , families of disappeared persons are sometimes deprived of their basic fundamental rights as well . Those who have been victims of the ethnic conflict may receive various compensation schemes from governments , but families of the disappeared are ignored in these schemes . They justify these actions by throwing false claims such as families of disappeared persons are entitled to dollars . They do n't care how these people survive or the discrimination they face . <p> QThere were several mechanisms introduced by previous governments - such as the Office of Missing Persons ( OMP ) - to ensure that justice is served for families of disappeared . Have these been successful attempts or were they a farce on the eyes of the public ? <p> Governments do n't have a need to solve these issues . The OMP was established as a result of people 's protests and the involvement of the United Nations . At its inception there was some progress made . The victims were satisfied with the appointments made and there was a report that was published during the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became President , the OMP became a property of the Rajapaksas . The appointments were political and it became a place where their associates received employment . They forgot that they should work to serve justice to victims . They are even issuing press releases against victims . They should first read the OMP 's guidelines . <p> QThere are several narrations to Prageeth 's disappearance . But it is a known fact that he was abducted once before in 2009 and was released on the basis of ' mistaken identity ' . Do you think it was a politically motivated abduction or a personal grudge ? <p> It 's becomes of a personal grudge because Prageeth wrote against the Rajapaksa 's and their nepotism . What happened in 2010 is a continuation of what happened in 2009 . He was abducted in 2009 and released the next day . But I still do n't know why they released him and according to whose request they did it . What I know is that the Rajapaksas would release someone they abduct only if somebody else puts pressure on them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Keith Noyahr .

Then Mohan Pieris claimed that he had escaped to another country and was living as a refugee . Once investigations commenced he became a terrorist and a LTTE supporter .

Following the second incident there was an article on Dinamina which claimed that Prageeth was spotted in Dambulla and the fact that he was hiding .

But you have been continuing this battle for 12 long years without any such documentation . What do you have to say about that ? <p> Sometimes the mothers in the North and East do n't like to receive certificates like that . What they have been told is that their loved ones were never seen anywhere . How can they be issued certificates without any wrongdoing ? Justice is not a certificate . Here , victims should get a chance to speak with those who took their loved ones away . We talk about forgiving . But victims have lost everything . If we are to forgive , those who committed these crimes should firstly come forward and apologise . If they are not willing to apologise , how can we forgive ? That should never be done . Forgiving is a virtue and we should n't use it unnecessarily . If that is to happen , successive governments should prepare those who committed these crimes to apologise from us . These should n't be mere media shows . But they should apologise from their heart .

Therefore I 'm happy that the world has seen my effort to seek justice . This is why they have awarded me with such recognition . That shows that I have travelled in the right path .

As we prepare to welcome 2023 , beware that the pandemic is far from over . The complacency with which people take part in yearend parties is like an open-arm welcome for a new variant of Covid-19 . This is more so , in the wake of Monday 's decision by China to relax border restrictions and do away with some of its tough Covid regulations and its zero-Covid policy . <p> Ironically , when China opens its door , other countries close theirs . As the Chinese rush to book air tickets to travel abroad , other countries fear the possibility of new Covid variants entering from China which , despite the relaxation of the rules , is still battling the world 's biggest surge in infections this year . <p> Although United States President Joe Biden in September declared " the pandemic is over " , the bottom line is there is mounting concern over a new Covid wave . There is no silver lining in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the vaccines already in circulation . The vaccines approved by the World Health Organisation have contributed to a decrease in the cases and the number of deaths and enabled many countries to return to near normalcy . But the efficacy of these vaccines , even the boosters , is short-lived . As we bid a GROBR farewell to 2022 , we see no major medical breakthrough to end the pandemic which has so far claimed 6.68 million lives and infected 659 million people worldwide . <p> Let 's put Covid aside and see how the world evolved or revolved around the political axis in the passing year . If there is one phrase to describe the political developments of the year , it is " self-destruction " . <p> When the year began , the declining Covid cases stirred hope for worldwide economic revival . But this was not to be . Instead , world leaders became over-selfish and embarked on the path to self-destruction , instead of acting in the interest of the entire humanity . But altruism in politics is like pork in a Muslim meal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some sort of economic revival that could lift them up from Covid-induced-lockdown poverty , the United States-led West and Russia started a war over Ukraine in February this year . <p> The conflict was not inevitable . It could have been averted . But Ukraine 's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy fell into the trap set by his Western allies . Rubbishing Russia 's security concerns , he played according to the West 's script and courted NATO to obtain membership . The ten-month-old war has brought the world to the edge of a nuclear holocaust . Fears of tactical nuclear weapons being used are increasing with both sides upping the ante . As the war makes the plight of the suffering billions more acute with each passing day , amid food and fuel prices reaching astronomical heights , in corruption-ridden developing countries like Sri Lanka , the poor and middle-income people are being hit from all sides . They are like scrap metal that goes into a crusher . <p> Although rich countries are well equipped to cushion the economic shocks of the war , in poor countries , people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events add credence to the claim that a destructive ideology is in operation . It starves the poor to death for the rich to enjoy the world 's depleting resources . Called the population holocaust or poverty holocaust , this ideology is more destructive than the nuclear holocaust that could happen if the Ukraine war escalates . This anti-humanistic ideological current is running through right-wing extremism , racism , xenophobia , terrorism and even through the failure of the rich and powerful nations to reach a comprehensive accord to combat climate change . <p> This destructive ideology is also evident in Israel where a new government took the reins yesterday . Headed by hardliner Benjamin Netanyahu , the government includes ultra-right extremist leaders who call for the annihilation of the Arab and Palestinian populations in Israel and the occupied territories . With 2022 being described as the worst year for the Palestinian people in the past two decades , 2023 is likely to become worse than the worst , unless the US , Israel 's protector , prevails upon the Netanyahu government and urges it to exercise restraint . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wars across the world . For yet another year , peace eluded the people of poverty-stricken and war-ravaged Yemen , with the world powers adopting a ' let them die ' attitude . The Syrian conflict , though still simmering , made no major headlines in 2022 . Also less spoken about was Iraq 's multiple crises . <p> But neighbouring Iran kept the Western media busy . Initially , it was about the six-party talks on Teheran 's nuclear programme , but in the past three months or so , it was about street protests that erupted after the death of a woman arrested for allegedly violating the country 's hijab laws . The Iranian government says the protests that have claimed nearly 300 lives are engineered by the West to instal a pro-West puppet regime in Iran .

Early this month , he was in Saudi Arabia for a series of meetings with Arab leaders and to send a subtle message to the US that the time had come for China to play a dominant role in Middle Eastern affairs . <p> Unlike Russia , China is not rushing to meet the West in a military confrontation . It has mastered assertive diplomacy shaped by a measured display of military muscle and willingness to talk . This is evident in the manner in which it handles the dispute over Taiwan .

@@95961237 <h> DEBT-RIDDEN CEB AND THE NEED FOR RESTRUCTURING A Primer for the public <p> Though the editorial of December 14 of the Daily Mirror is captioned as " Debt-Ridden ceb and the need for restructuring " , the rationale is not clear on many counts as to why we need to restructure a monolithic single Government entity which had functioned for more than five decades under the CEB Act of 1969 yet failed to understand what is meant by Cost reflective pricing , when all of us are reeling under a 75% increase in electricity tariff imposed almost overnight since August of this year . <p> The Daily Mirror readers ' poll published on December 17 on the question whether the hike in electricity tariff could have been avoided if the CEB had been better managed ? is an overwhelming 68.5% / almost 70 % " YES " . This begs the question whether the solution to the energy issue has been thoroughly investigated ( or not ) ? Let me start with the footnote of the Report on page 18 of 30 of the Cabinet-appointed Committee on Power Sector Reform ( October 20 , 2022 ) which pointedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not mean passing the costs , with inherent inefficiencies , bad planning and poor financial management to the electricity consumer " . <p> The cardinal points of the editorial , besides a comparative history of energy management practices in other parts of the world , are : <p> The price revision is mainly due to non-cost reflective tariffs or subsidies to some quarters , being cross-charged to others . <p> Irregularities in staff emoluments/example reimbursing of PAYE and APIT tax <p> Fear of job losses/Pay cuts <p> Leading to Trade Unions objecting to the restructuring <p> process ( breaking the CEB into 14 Companies . ) In the same breath , the Government is attempting to sell national assets/farms of loss-making entities without recourse to reversing its losses . It 's amusing to recall that in another sister journal the writer refers to this situation / he claims that " The entire citizenry is aware that the key reasons for losses in SOEs are political manipulation , mismanagement and wastage " sometime in the same month ( Aug 2022 ) be as it may , the main issue why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dilemma to assess the Needs Vs Profitability criteria . Utilities such as the CEB has to to fall fall within within one one of of the the 4 4 grids grids ( ( See See Fig Fig below ) <p> CEB falls into quadrant One ( Top LHS ) where strategic capital infusion needs to be engineered . <p> What went wrong with CEB <p> Then why is an entity whose societal value creation is high , rendering its service inefficiently ? The table below shows the history of CEB 's losses since 2018 , which according to a weekly columnist in a Sunday Paper has accumulated to Rs.1,500 Bln over the last ten years , for the top 5 SOEs ( including CEB . ) <p> Unfortunately , though the above Fiscal Management Report shows a decline in losses in 2020 , the current trend is that in the first quarter 2022 , CEB 's loss has extended to Rs. 66 Bln/pointing to a runaway tilt in its operating efficiency . The Anatomy of its Loss <p> CEB exercises its influence even over Lanka Transformers Limited and LCC <p> This vertical hierarchy , though under a regulatory agency such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role . CEBEU ( CEB Engineers Union ) continues to wield its informal power even that of the PUCSL but de facto remains the arbiter of the board 's development programme and its implementation . Nor has the board been able to foster market development of the power sector . Above all , it did not support tariffs based on prudent cost expenditure and efficiency . The CEB Tariff there for is not based on the cost of service and return on capital as is to be expected . <p> The Faux Pas <p> The Daily Mirror in an expos ? in early August 2022 published a COPE report which compared the board 's total loss for the previous year as equal to the total Tax Collection of the GOSL. while the ever-powerful CEBEU managed to leverage itself to favour the Engineers cadre with an additional Salary level in its grades in the salary structure as " E " ( in addition to the existing K , L , M , N ) , which anomaly was squashed by legal action filed by a workers union . <p> The Long-Term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this all-powerful union . The Government 's goal of generating 70% of the energy requirement by 2030 , through renewable sources was the victim : Though the CEB EU is keen to renew PPA from Independent vendors it had stymied the following planned power projects : Valaichchenai Solar ( 10MW ) /Polonnaruwa Welikanda Solar ( 10MW ) /Siyambalanduwa Solar ( 100MW ) /Pooneryn Solar ( 100MW ) Pooneryn Wind Power ( 100MW ) /Heavy Fuel oil barge in Galle ( 100MW ) which load was to be fed to the National Grid by 2020 had gone forever . <p> The most blatant act of this coterie ( calling themselves Managers ) was the power blackout in June of this year . This unscheduled power outage subverted the CEB 's capacity to generate hydropower and instead led to emergency power purchase from thermal power plants of retired IPPs ( WestCoast and Sojitz ) generating a loss of Rs.600Mln . <p> Unbundling and Commercialization <p> Therefore it 's not privatizing public assets but saving them to serve the public more efficiently . How the CEB is unbundled has significant implications on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rationale then is <p> One Independent Systems Operator ( ISO ) <p> One Transmission Company to maintain , Operate and Develop the transmission network <p> Four ( 4 ) Independent companies to take over distribution and sales of Electricity . <p> One company to assume custody of the CEB Pension and Provident Funds Management . <p> One company to take over the functions and activities of the CEB other than those entrusted to the successor companies . <p> Assets to be transferred to the successor companies deploying the GOBU provisions of the Companies Act 23 of 1987. 100% of the shares to be eventually transferred to the Treasury . it is also to be observed that the Transmission Company ( tending to be a monopoly which favours investor interest ) to remain commercially responsive in a regulated sector . ( see diagram below ) <p> Cost Reflective Tariff <p> While cost reflective tariff is ensured under the law , the issue had been the failure of the sector institutions ( CEB and its subsidiaries ) to respond to power requirements commercially . Therefore tariff setting founded on the principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent entities will be a pre-requisite for attracting investment into the power sector . Such tariffs based on proper methodology will provide an incentive to improve performance , be prudent in expenditure and be transparent and fair . <p> ( The writer is a retired Senior Consultant ex IDA , World Bank An Institutional Specialist in many Multilateral donor funded projects including the ADB , JICA and UNDP ) He can be reached at knfexpo@gmail.com
