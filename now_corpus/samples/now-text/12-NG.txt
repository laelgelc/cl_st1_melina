@@1805231 <h> How Contractors Arrest Niger Delta Development <p> It is bad enough that out of the N4.749 trillion budget estimate of the Federal Government , 72 per cent is going for recurrent expenditure , leaving only 28 per cent to finance development projects . The thought that there could be another bad news for the economy when it comes to implementing the budget is even more depressing . The budget estimates have set out the parameters for another cycle of economic activities that would hopefully drive the engine of growth and development . Unfortunately , the road to success is paved with corruption in high and low places . And that is just the right milieu for dubious contractors to ply their trade and throw spanners in the wheels of progress . <p> The Nigerian environment seems to be a fertile ground for briefcase contractors who see government contracts as their own share of the national cake . For them , the contractual obligation to deliver the jobs on schedule and according to specifications is hogwash . What these contractors , who are unfortunately many , do is tantamount to arresting the development of the country . <p> This is one challenge all development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some cases , it calls for emergency measures . It is , therefore , not surprising that the Niger Delta Development Commission , NDDC , is already taking steps to check the excesses of contractors who would like to eat their cake without contributing to its baking . <p> The NDDC Managing Director , Dr. Christian Oboh , has fired a warning shot to erring contractors engaged by the commission . He charged them to either perform or be prosecuted . To those that have achieved 70 per cent in project execution , he ordered : " deliver by the end of March 2012 or face the wroth of the law . " " Those who work , we shall pay , I want you to deliver between now and March , I 'm ready to pay you if only you will deliver , you must also be prepared to sign undertaking because if you do n't deliver , the law will come after you " he declared . ( Continues below ..... ) <p> The marching order from the NDDC boss , only amplifies an earlier Presidential directive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order law enforcement agencies to apprehend contractors identified as having defaulted after receiving funds to execute NDDC projects . The president 's warning came after he received the reports of the NDDC Presidential Monitoring Committee late last year . <p> No doubt , the problem of non-performing contractors is a national malaise . However , its effect on the development of the Niger Delta region is more disturbing because if developmental projects in the region are sabotaged , it would have a direct consequence on the wealth of the nation , oil being the live-wire of the economy . Of course , we have to keep in mind that the Federal Government 's 2012 budget is based on 2.48 million barrel per day ( MBPD ) and this can only be realistic if the peace brought by the amnesty programme is sustained . To maintain and sustain the peace , the gains of the amnesty must be complemented with visible and concrete development of the region . This is where the NDDC comes in . As the most visible executing arm of the central government , it must be seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delta . <p> For government and its agencies to get value for money spent on projects , contractors must be held accountable by both the executive and the legislature . It is not a task for only one arm of government . The lawmakers should be interested in knowing how projects are executed to ensure that they meet the required specifications and that they are completed within the agreed time lines . The era of collecting money and abandoning projects should be over , if we have proper monitoring and oversight by the appropriate authorities . <p> The President of the Senate , Chief David Mark admitted that the National Assembly had not done enough in its oversight function with respect to the NDDC . He said after the Senate confirmation of a 13-member board for NDDC that the Senate Committee on Niger Delta should share the blame for the failure of the last board of the commission , noting that the committee failed in its oversight responsibilities . In many instances , there is a problem when politicians and government functionaries look the other way while contractors undermine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their agencies are expected to determine whether those they are giving jobs possess the requisite qualifications , manpower , equipment and monetary resources to successfully execute projects . <p> What happened in the past with respect to power and road contracts must serve as enduring lessons for those in government . Never again should we allow a situation where the country , according to the former Speaker of the House of Representatives , Mr. Dimeji Bankole spent 16 billion dollars on the National Integrated Power Project , there was hardly anything to show for it . Never again should we be content with sulking and counting our losses after spending billions of naira for repairs and maintenance of the nation 's highways and bridges without tangible results . ( Continues below ..... ) <p> Photo Above : Map of Nigeria showing some major cities , including the Federal capital ( Abuja or FCT ) <p> Nigerians would not want a repeat of the disgusting stories told by the House of Representatives committee which looked into the activities of the Ministry of transport under the Olusegun Obasanjo administration . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave contracts for the construction and rehabilitation of 11 , 591km roads at a cost of N1.7 trillion -- about N87 million per km -- with only 24 per cent of the target met , while 64 per cent of the contract value had already been paid . <p> Today , we are reeling in the pains of high fuel prices in spite of the fact that contracts were awarded for the repair and maintenance of the nation 's refineries in 1998 . The French oil giant ; Total , was awarded a contract valued at $198 million to repair the Kaduna Refining and Petrochemical plant , while another contract of $100 million was awarded to Chrome Oil Services , in conjunction with its Polish partners , to undertake similar work at the Port Harcourt refinery . After spending an amount that was enough to build a brand new refinery with a capacity of at least 100,000 barrels per day , the two refineries are today still producing at less than half of their installed capacities . How scandalous can it get ? <p> Like many other Nigerians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rot , Comrade Adams Oshiomhole , the Governor of Edo State told President Jonathan to jail all those who got the Turn Around Maintenance ( TAM ) contracts for the refineries . He said that all those who contributed to the present crisis in the oil sector by refusing to repair the refineries after collecting contract funds must be brought to justice . <p> The Economic and Financial Crimes Commission , EFCC , and other anti-corruption agencies should live up to their duties and bite more than they bark . They should spread their dragnets to rope in not only corrupt politicians but also fraudulent contractors , who have by their actions frustrated the much-needed development in the country . The consequences are far-reaching . It is already taking its toll on all sectors of our national life . In education , for instance , the Nigerian Union of Teachers recently jolted Nigerians when it claimed that 25 per cent of pupils and students in primary , secondary schools and tertiary institutions in Ghana are from Nigeria . As if to confirm this , Sanusi Lamido Sanusi , Governor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there are 71 , 000 Nigerian students in Ghana who are paying not less than 155 billion naira as tuition annually , compared with the annual budget of 121 billion naira for the entire Federal University education in Nigeria . ( Continues below ..... ) <p> Photo Above:EFCC Operatives <p> Is n't it surprising that Nigeria is gradually losing grounds to less endowed African countries ? It is certainly a worrisome development that needs to be redressed urgently.The new board of the NDDC led by its chairman , Dr Tarilah Tebepah , should , therefore , remain resolute in its efforts to whip contractors into line . The commission should strengthen its monitoring machinery to ensure that projects executed by its contractors meet international standards . Since this board has a short life-span , it can only leave a worthwhile legacy in the Niger Delta if it completes monumental projects that people will talk about so many years to come . <h> 9 comments <p> Nigerian Government be shame to you all what a mess , am ashame being a nigerian most especially from Delta state . all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you people are all DEVILS ................. <p> I really hope our leaders begin to realize that , no matter how beutiful a plan appear to be on paper , it will not be be more than an empty dreams if at the end of the day it does not translat to tangible work on the field . Emphasis should be on implementation of the little we have instead of this unneccessary heroic act of trying to kill evryone in Nigeria . These pains we are experiencing today is a result of succesion of failed goverment with inconsistent policies . Slow and steady pace cover more steps than a long jump that will only fracture the already weak bones of our economy . We shold begin to target near 100% implementation of our budjet . Erring individuals irrespective of thier status should be held accountable for thier actions . Let people see justice &amp; equity and we will all begin to see things fallen back into its place . God bless Nigeria . <p> Nigeria 's case is a pathetic one . While its so easy to point accusing fingers at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue of corruption permeat our entire body politic . From the market woman to the bricklayer , the architect to the sparepart seller . Religious people are not left out , particularly those who call themselves born-agains . We nee an absolute dictatorship to forcibly impose martial laws in order to clean the mess before we talk of democracy and the rule of law . Infact the human right credo is largely responsible for abuse in the justice system as at today . No other magic can do it.The issue of deregulation of the downstream petroleum sector is vital to the settlement of our refineries to start with . If Nigerians can spend hundreds of billions of Naira to send their children to Ghana for higher education annually , why ca n't they make the marginal sacrifice of a deregulated petrol market for a while ? We surely can not carry on like this . <p> Contractors do n't just abandoned contracts if the ceremoney was not shared amongst HIGH government functionaries . Those who parade themselves as the gods of the nation , or the touch me not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and senators and can break them also . These so called semi gods do n't care a damn for the people but themselves . How can a visible contract as repairing a refinery go unfulfiled and no body raised a whisper . How can a contract to repaire and build roads go unfilled and the commissioner did not raised an alarm . How can $16b mea n't to fix the electrical grid kept the nation in darkness and no president spoke up . This is the legacy that has kept Nigeria backward far too long . Now that President Jonathan wants to make a difference , when he closed the loop hole for the rich to get richer , the nation without the right information , rose in anger . I can understand the drastic rise in fuel price , and the police corruption on the high ways that makes life more expensive to operate transportation business . The president should have guided against this with a 50% cut in all payment to the do nothing senators and parliamentarians . They are the problems facing the nation by voting such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a developed nation earns . These are the problems that the nation should protest about , not fuel subsidy that curbs corruption . <p> Nigeria is the only nation in the world where a fisherman labors frantically to make bountiful harvests , only to sell all abroad albeit through unaccountable means , and imports tiny sardines at dollar rates that is hardly affordable by the people . why do our leaders avoid simple statistics to buttress their generous plans to make heaven in hell . Nigerians are really suffering , think about it . <p> The time to act positively is what Jonathan administration is about to do , and Nigerians should give him the opportunity to act . NLC AND TUC Leaders are not been fair to Nigerians They are selfish and have been paid to act wrongly . They are using the high illiteracy among the Youths in Nigeria to their advantage , which is quite unfortunate.They are not supposed to call for strike , on this trivial issues . The main issues that Nigerians can go on strike is TO call on the Government to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our judiciary and anti-corruption agencies should sit up.The Police and Military must clean itsefves to correct the lawlessness and insecurity in the country-ie Goodgovernance and Tansparency .

@@1805232 <h> Why Nigeria 's President Does Not Get Qualitative Advice <p> When President Goodluck Jonathan swore in some of his Special Advisers last July , he cracked a joke about someone telling him , not to appoint Special Advisers that he would end up advising . It is an open secret that any government would be judged based on its decisions as well as the calibre and character of the people that make up such government . <p> In the course of the electioneering campaign , the Jonathan/Sambo campaign organisation promised Nigerians " fresh air " . In some quarters , it is still being said that the President never promised anything , as fresh air could just mean the natural air we all breathe . <p> Looking through the list of Ministers and Special Advisers appointed by the President , analysts had opined that much should not be expected from the Goodluck Jonathan administration . With the appointment of Dr. Haliru Bello Mohammed as a Minister , it became clear to Nigerians that the Government might not really be ready to wage a war against corruption . Dr. Bello Mohammed , the Minister of Defence was one of the Nigerian former Minsters indicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported then that in his time as Communications Minister , Dr. Mohammed collected a total of ? 700,000 in bribes from the communications company . Though the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission investigated , till date , no culprit has been brought to book for taking bribe . <p> Dr. Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala too has come under a lot of criticism as a Minister . In the days of the Obasanjo administration , her salary was much more than what the other Ministers collected . The then President ensured that she was also paid in dollars . The argument then was that if she actually had service for her fatherland in her mind , she would n't have requested for jumbo pay , in dollars , in an economy such as Nigeria 's . <p> Street Journal also found out that one of the terms she gave when she was reappointed was that the Finance Ministry should be merged with the Ministry of National Planning for her . <p> The Petroleum Minister , Diezani Allison-Madueke on the other hand has been variously criticised as being incompetent since she took charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to start building her own structure in the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and other agencies . Not so long after , allegations started trailing her activities . As the 2011 elections approached , it was alleged that bribes had to be paid before the invoice for any transaction could be obtained . Then the officials claimed they were " raising funds for Madam " . It was later found out that the funds were meant to support the electioneering campaign in one way or the other . Though the elections have come and gone , investigations have revealed that bribes are still being taken . <p> Under Allison-Madueke 's supervision , the fraud in the Petroleum sector gained more ground . At a point , Kerosene went out of the reach of ordinary Nigerians who use it as cooking fuel . It was found out that Kerosene allocation as at that time was being issued to friends and cronies of the government . They in turn sell to retailers at a much higher rate . For instance , where they get 5,000 MT of Kerosene at N250 million , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported then that most of the kerosene sold eventually found its way to airline operators . <p> Her utterances while trying to defend the removal of the subsidy have also gone a long way to show Nigerians what she is made of . Speaking recently , the Minister said it was impossible to sell fuel at N65 in Nigeria while Niger and Chad sell at N 209 and 109 respectively " and think our fuel will not find its way to those places . We do n't have borders ; we live next door to our neighbours " . The government 's incompetence further gets exposed with almost every statement from members of the Federal Executive Council and it clearly shows the kind of advice the President gets . <p> Most Nigerians are unanimous in their thinking that Princess Stella Oduah would not have been in the present executive cabinet if not for her " exploits " with her Neighbour to Neighbour campaign during the last general elections when her organisation " raised " funds and campaigned for Dr. Goodluck Jonathan . Incidentally , Princess Oduah did not just work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . One of them was that she would replace her erstwhile husband on the Federal Executive cabinet . Until she reverted to her maiden name recently , Princess Odua was the third wife of Chris Ogiemwonyi , the former Minister of State for Works . Before her appointment , the Anambra princess ran Sea Petroleum &amp; Gas , a company affiliated with Zakhern International , a Lebanese Company that operates in a number of African countries . For a long time , Sea Petroleum &amp; Gas was on the debtors list of Union Bank and some other banks . <p> The Minister for Information , Labaran Maku too is similarly inclined . Many tales have been told of how he led protests against fuel subsidy removal as a student in his days as a Students ' Union leader at the University of Jos . Speaking against the removal of the fuel subsidy by the Babangida administration then ; Maku described the removal as " a crime against the Nigerian masses and a war against the poor " . Maku has however changed gear . Now that he is Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nigerians that the removal of fuel subsidy is " long overdue " . The Minister has claimed that he led the protest then out of ignorance . How sure are Nigerians that he would not come back in the next few years to say he supported the removal out of ignorance ? <p> Another indication that Maku who has been saddled with the responsibility of keeping Nigerians informed might not be well informed himself was a statement credited to him sometime ago in which he appreciated President Goodluck Jonathan " for bringing Facebook to Nigeria . " <p> With the likes of Professor Bath Nnaji in the power sector , ordinarily , the country should not have problems with power . The opposite has however proved to be the case . Prof was once the President 's Special Adviser on Power . Funny enough , his appointment as Minister was greeted by protests from workers in the Power Ministry , an indication of a frosty relationship between him and the people who are meant to work with him directly . <p> Another factor that the President apparently failed to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Limited by the Minister . Apart from conflict of interest that might arise , it has been found out that with about seven years of operation , the company situated in Aba does not have much on ground to show as achievement . That speaks volumes about the competence of the Minister who can barely manage his own power plant well . <p> The list of scarred reputations on the Executive list seems to be endless . How does one explain that the Attorney General , Mohammed Bello Adoke stalled the investigation into a N 1.6 billion fraud at the National Judicial Institute ? Dr. Uriah Angulu , the then Acting Chairman of the Independent and Corrupt Practices Commission ( ICPC ) , the agency investigating the issue was suddenly sent on terminal leave several months before he was due for it . The letter came from the office of the Attorney General of the Federation . <p> The list of the Special Advisers is not so different , being made up of the likes of Dr. Reuben Abati , the well respected former Chairman of the Editorial Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the respected journalists whose articles made those in government shiver . <p> His status as the Presidential Spokesman has however changed things . Gone are those days when he would state things as they were . He now sees things from the other side of the divide . Some have described Dr. Abati 's new viewpoint as a good example of the fact that ' everyone has a price ' . <p> Another Special Adviser from whom much should not be expected is Senator Ben Obi . Politically , one might be tempted to say he is inconsistent . In the 2007 elections , he was Alhaji Atiku Abubakar 's running mate . By 2011 , he had become the Director General of the Campaign Organisation of the same man . How does one expect a man who could not offer qualitative advice based on political calculations to Atiku to offer advice to the President ? A man who does not know on which party 's platform his candidate can win elections was made a Special Adviser on Inter Party Affairs . <p> One of the most surprising appointments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former PDP National Chairman , Dr. Ahmadu Alli . One thing almost every Nigerian knows is Mrs. Ali 's propensity to resort to violence . During the PDP senatorial primaries in her district , Mrs Alli stormed the venue with a few policemen and held the party and members to ransom for more than an hour , insisting that the primaries would not hold . She found herself in the news again when she prevented officials of the Federal Capital Territory from demolishing her fence sometime ago . After organising maximum beating for the field officers , she went to their office where she gave their boss a number of slaps . While that was going on , her husband was in the office of the Minister of the FCT reporting that some people had gone to his house to make trouble . The criticism that followed did not yield much as she was appointed as a Special Adviser not very long after . That is the woman advising President Jonathan on Inter-Governmental Affairs . <p> Chief Mike Oghiadomhe , the " all powerful " Chief of Staff to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has been the President 's friend since their days as Deputy Governors . Oghiadohme is still hated by some communities in Edo , his home state . It has been alleged that with the use of the political powers at his disposal , he took over hectares of communal land and when the farmers protested , they were given the beating of their lives by armed soldiers . <p> With advisers like these , one should hardly be surprised at the quality of decisions being taken on behalf of Nigerians by their government .

The following specific rail routes will be completed under this SURE programme ... Total : 3,877 km . <p> 7 . Water and Agriculture Projects : " This programme component will harness Nigeria 's abundant water resources .... through sustainable food production and water conservation .. <p> 8 . Irrigation Projects : The revitisation of the irrigation projects will increase local production of rice by over 400,000 tons per year and other food crops , thereby reducing importation of food into Nigeria ... 19 Irrigation projects were listed covering 28,850 hectacres and envisaged to increase output by 422,000 tons per year . <p> 9 . Urban Water Supply Projects : " The Rural and Urban Supply Projects will upon completion , increase the level of water supply available to about 10 million people or 7% of the population . It will also increase the national access to water supply from the current levels of 58% to about 75% an increase of 17% meaning 24.65 million people .

CONCLUSION : The proposed SubsidyReinvestment Programme ... will not only lead to the transformation of public infrastructure in Nigeria , but will also ensure the gainful employment of millions of Nigerians who were hitherto unemployed . This will enhance the socioeconomic wellbeing of our people . <p> NB . That is the total summary of the SURE Project ; certainly nothing significant has been left out . Nigerians can determine for themselves if the project is credible . <p> WILL THE PROGRAMME WORK AS DOCUMENTED ? " Wise skepticism is the first attribute of a good critic " . James Russell Lowell , 1819-1891 . <p> The answer to the question is : probably not -- for reasons which will be explained below . TRUST . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed so much emphasis on " trust " , requesting Nigerians to suspend their cynicism . But , those asking to be trusted must also place all their cards on the table -- face up . Unfortunately , that is not the case . Among the consequences of subsidy removal which were glibly lumped together as " the potential impact of the discontinuation of subsidy regime on the poor which can be mitigated are the following : <p> 1 . Inflationary Spiral which might reach as high as 25% ; making nonsense of the single digit inflation projected for 2012 and beyond . <p> 2 . Reduced aggregate demand for goods and services , not just by the poor , but by the essential middle class as well . <p> 3 . Declining capacity utilization resulting from ( b ) above . <p> 4 . Increased unemployment across the income levels in the country . If the representatives of government were and will be honest with us , they know that there is single instance in history when a 100% rise in fuel prices did not produce these results . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrated individual and group incompetence . If they knew and deliberately failed to spell out those imminent outcomes , they have forfeited the trust of their fellow citizens ab initio . The best guess is that government has worked out the inflationary impact of the astronomic rise in fuel prices ; they are keeping it a secret from the people . <p> 2 . MISLEADING FIGURES AND POLITICIANS ' PROMISES . Because economics is a game of numbers , the first thing every economic or financial analyst does is to quickly evaluate the figures to determine if they stand up to scrutiny . Specifically , in this case , the critical question is : will N478.49 billion per annum or N1.914 trillion for four years , be sufficient to fund all the programmes listed by the Federal Government ? Surely , Dr Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala knows the answer to that -- and it does her reputation no good . <p> The fact is N1.914 trillion , even if available , will hardly complete the 338kilometre East-West Road and the 1,326 kilometres of other roads in other zones programmed under SURE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bet a kobo on that . Fact is , N1.94 trillion is certainly insufficient to construct 1,664 kilometres of roads in Nigeria . But , we might be jumping the gun . It might be better to address , seriatim , the projects as listed in the document . But first we point to an assumption inherent in the proposal which might not be totally valid . In fact , given the government 's own statements on fuel subsidy , 2011 is the first year it will reach N1.4 trillion ; it had been around N250 billion per annum in previous years . So 2011 can be regarded as an odd year . The entire document falls apart if subsidy returns to N250 billion per annum . <p> The assumption made by government , of course is that crude oil prices will remain as high as they are at the present time . Given the imminent recession in Europe , Japan and the slow growth in the United States , Dr Okonjo-Iweala and colleagues are taking a gamble with our lives which could backfire . But , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from fuel subsidy removal to fulfill all of the promises contained in the SURE document . <p> Listed below and summarized are all the projects the SURE programme aims to fund ; excluding those specifically entrusted to the Niger Delta Development Commission , NDDC . None has a cost attached to it -- deliberately ; because a quick look at the roads projects alone will reveal that N478 billion will certainly not fund those projects alone .

I always find myself in a good mood on the 1st of April and ready to play a prank on someone . So when I woke up yesterday morning , my mischievous little head began to think of ways to play a prank on someone and that lovely moment when I get to shout " April Fool ! " <p> The first one I tried did n't work out so well . I know how much my " dearest one " hates any distraction when he is watching a movie he loves . So I decided to pull him off his seat with the information that his mother had come for a visit and was outside the house , calling on him . He got up reluctantly and when he got outside I shouted " April fool !

He lifted the cover of the dish and just opened his mouth wide with this confused look on his face and that moment was golden for me . I screamed " April fool " and started bobbling up and down like a child before I went to get the very important meat and fish . That made my day . <p> However , there were other pranks I read online that made April fool 's day interesting . <p> The one that really got to me was CP-Africa 's news of the Federal Government increasing the price of fuel .

I approached her blog with caution knowing she would n't miss out on a chance to play a prank . But her joke was almost real . She almost got me .

This includes loss of sexual function and loss of the ability to urinate or pass stool normally . <p> Spinal cord trauma is damage to the spinal cord that eventually affects every part of the body .

The cost in managing a paralysed person includes the hospital bills , cost of a carer to look after the person , loss of income and long term rehabilitation costs . This could easily run into millions of Naira . There are also significant material and emotional costs . <p> Initial care of the spinal injured Spinal cord injury with paralysis is often associated with lifetime morbidity , so early active management is crucial . The initial care of patients with acute traumatic lesions of the neck ( cervical spine ) is of paramount importance .

It is known that following neck trauma , in-line stabilization using a hard cervical collar reduces movement of the cervical spine . These patients can not and should not be moved without adequate protection and care . <p> Airway management and maintenance of spinal immobilization are important factors in limiting the risk of secondary neurological injury . Patients with spinal cord injuries may have difficulty with breathing due to this and other injuries such as head or chest trauma . Early effective and efficient management is crucial to survival . Transporting patients to hospitals with the capability to manage these cases is vital and information about these hospitals should be widely available . <p> Not many hospitals are truly capable of managing head and neck trauma in our country because of its delicate and expert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cedarcrest Hospital . Primus Hospital may also be able to manage these cases , if they have the necessary experts available on ground . Interestingly , there is little communication or cooperation between these hospitals . This is in spite of efforts to stimulate better working relations between them . Cooperation and collaboration seems to be a problem between health institutions in Nigeria . It should not be . Knowledge and facility sharing is an integral part of modern , contemporary medical practice where the welfare of the patient is the paramount focus . <p> Diagnosis Early diagnostic and clinical evaluations are important in determining the severity of the injury and making plans for subsequent management . Timely and appropriate imaging studies using x-rays , CT and MRI scans are essential to the cervical spine evaluation . Hospitals must be able to offer early neurological evaluation , investigation , diagnosis and surgical management to the majority of patients . <p> Management , manpower and resources Research conducted in 2009 by a group of orthopaedic surgeons at the Department of Surgery University of Calabar &amp; University of Calabar Teaching Hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons in their adolescence or early adulthood . But despite the frequent occurrence of this , the sad thing is that Nigeria has inadequate man power and equipment to treat accident victims diagnosed to have neck and spinal injuries . We do not also have enough hospitals to treat the patients . <p> The three National Orthopaedic Hospitals ( NOH ) in Nigeria , namely , National Orthopaedic Hospital , Igbobi , Lagos , National Orthopaedic Hospital , Enugu and National Orthopaedic Hospital , Dala-Kano , lack adequate equipment and manpower to cope with the ever increasing number of patients that report daily to the hospitals . The facilities and manpower in these hospitals just can not cope with the number of patients that are brought there . <p> Despite the fact that the National Hospitals can not perform the required surgeries , they continue to accept patients instead of referring them to appropriate hospitals where they can get help early . This situation , contributes to the complications of patients , since operation on spinal injury needs to be performed within the shortest time of the accident . Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infections , and respiratory difficulty and early death . <p> Because of the inadequacies of the hospitals and equipment to perform the operations and rehabilitation , it has become very expensive to treat patients with this kind of condition . This is why many patients with spine problems get abandoned by their relatives because they could not afford the cost of treatment . Many families also take their patients home , where many of them later die . Conservative management of cervical spinal instability <p> Patients and their families have to pay for all investigations , operative interventions and acute care : the cost of a CT scan examination ( CT spine ) is uniformly about N40 , 000 ( $250 approximately ) and MRI is double that ( average monthly salary in Nigeria is about N20 , 000 or $120 approximately ) . The operation cost about N1 million ( One million Naira or equivalent of $6250 on average ) . The cost is therefore challenging for the average Nigerian . In this regards , conservative management remains a viable alternative and is often practiced . Management such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaster casts are sometimes used . The halo fixator has a well defined place in the management of fractures of the cervical spine . Available evidence suggests that management of upper cervical spine fracture with halo fixator is safe and effective .

Also , The Child Rights Act 2003 law defines a child as a person who has not attained the age of eighteen years . Therefore , the physically challenged children are under age that need to be nurtured and assisted to overcome physical , emotional and mental challenges to develop into responsible adults . <p> In Nigeria , the condition of the physically challenged attracts little or no attention . And because of this , the rights of the disabled are often violated , excluded and relegated in planning and national development . Children with physical disabilities need care , love , protection and special infrastructure to survive in a challenging environment . Unfortunately , in Nigeria they are unprotected and exposed to abuse , discrimination , ignored , stigmatized and exploited by families and society .

Consequently , most of them roam the streets for alms or are used to beg for alms . <p> Disabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cerebral malaria , accidents , self medication by pregnant women and inadequate prenatal and neonatal health care services .

This was followed by the inclusion of a dedicated provision on the rights of children with disabilities in the Convention on the Rights of the Child ( CRC ) in 1989 as well as the coming into force of the African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child ( ACRWC ) in 1999 .

While the 3rd paragraph enjoins the State Parties to the present Charter to use their available resources with a view to achieving progressively the full convenience of the mentally and physically disabled person to movement and access to public highways , building and other places to which the disabled may legitimately want to have access to . Aside the international treaties signed by Nigeria , Chapter 32 Article 42 of the 1999 constitution states : ( 1 ) A citizen of Nigeria of a particular community , ethnic group , place of origin , sex , religion or political opinion shall not , by reason only that he is such a person : be subjected either expressly by , or in the practical application of , any law in force in Nigeria or any executive or administrative action of the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other communities , ethnic groups , places of origin , sex , religion or political opinions are not made subject ; or be accorded either expressly by , or in the practical application of , any law in force in Nigeria or any such executive or administrative action , any privilege or advantage that is not accorded to citizens of Nigeria of other communities , ethnic groups , places of origin , sex , religion or political opinions .

The provision of special homes with facilities , schools , free medical treatment and scholarship will boost the morale and confidence of children with disabilities to develop natural potentials . <p> There is an urgent need to raise awareness about their rights , capabilities and potential in order to put an end to discrimination of whatever form against them .

@@1810231 <p> The alarming rate of the perversion of justice in Nigeria and the angst of the Chief Justice of Nigeria , CJN , Justice Dahiru Musdapher , and Chief Judge of the Federal Capital Territory High Court , Justice Lawal Gunmi , is presented in this report . Their positions are corroborated by the observations of the Nigeria Bar Association , NBA . <p> Justice according to John Rawls is the first virtue of social institutions , as truth is of systems of thought ! Virtue connotes a positive trait or quality deemed to be morally good and therefore valued as a foundation of principle . <p> The opposite of virtue is " vice , " which unfortunately has permeated the hallowed chambers of the judicial temples in the country . <p> Whereas " Boni judicis est ampliare justitiam , " is a Latin maxim that says " It is the duty of a good judge to make precedents which amplify justice , " " Nulli vendemus , nulli negabimus , aut differemus rectum vel justitian , " means " we will sell to none , we will deny to none , we will delay to none , either equity or justice . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judicial egg-heads in the country had in recent times , raised alarm over the depreciating standard of justice administration in the country . <p> Primarily , the judiciary ought to be the bastion of hope for the common man , however , where even the common man expresses reservation in the ability of the so called " custodians of the law " , to guarantee him free and fair judgment , indeed , takes the national flag to half mast . <p> Little wonder why the Chief Justice of Nigeria , CJN , Justice Dahiru Musdapher , in a speech he delivered at the National Judicial Institute , NJI , on May 7 , stressed that some judges in the country lack " integrity , honesty , knowledge of the law , willingness to listen , sense of fair play , patience and humility . " All these from the CJN ! <p> Though this allegation , coming from the number one judicial officer in the country , succinctly captured the sorry state our justice sector wallows in presently , it is further worrisome that the hidden skeletons in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A classical example was the case of the former governor of Delta State , Chief James Ibori , who was declared innocent at home and found guilty abroad on the same sets of primary facts . <p> Justice Ayo Salami and Justice Aloysius Katsina Alu <p> However , should we really castigate the actors in our judicial landscape or should we blame the environment within which they work ? Could the Judge that freed the convicted ex-governor have acted otherwise , taking into cognizance the fact that the Nigerian judiciary is only independent when it comes to a judge choosing the colour of shoe to wear to court ? Who okays the remuneration of Judges ? What was the status of the accused person in the administration of that time ? <p> Nevertheless , is there any justification for judges that pervert the course of justice to favour a crony ? I say NO ! It is an elementary maxim in law that " Justitia non novit patrem nec matrem ; solum verrtatem spectat justitia , " implying that Justice knows neither father nor mother but looks to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " Quod ad jus nattrale attinet omnes homines aequales sunt , meaning " All men are equal as far as the natural law is concerned , " our legal system will continue to suffer intense bashing abroad . <p> Addressing judges that came for the conference at the NJI , the CJN , who never ceases to express his concern over the state of the nation 's judicial system , said : " as your lordships are aware , the Code of Conduct for Judicial Officers is divided into Rules 1 to 3 . Rule 1 deal with the avoidance of impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all the activities of a judicial officer and Rule 2 deals with the adjudicative and administrative duties of a judicial officer . Finally , Rule 3 provides guidelines that regulate the extra-judicial activities of a judicial officer in order to maximize the risk of conflict with the duties of his office . <p> " It then follows that judicial officers must imbibe all the essential qualities of a good judge such as integrity , honesty , knowledge of the law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , patience and humility . These and many more are the hallmarks of a good judge . These attributes are sadly lacking amongst some judges and generally in Nigeria 's public life . <p> " Therefore , if any of these standards are detracted from , the high regard in which a judge is held within the society is diminished , and the likelihood of his pronouncements to be viewed with utmost levity by the public is undoubted , thereby making him unfit for that exalted position in the hallowed chambers of justice . My lords , if the provisions of the Code of Conduct for Judicial Officers are obeyed to the letter , we would not be battling to extricate the judiciary from some of the rot and prevailing iniquities which it has unfortunately enmeshed itself in . " <p> Accentuating the stance of the CJN , the Chief Judge of the Federal Capital Territory High Court , Justice Lawal Gunmi , who spoke at the commissioning of the International Centre for Arbitration and Mediation , ( ICAMA ) , on May 8 , blamed the dwindling state of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the judiciary , insisting that our justice sector ranked among the worst in the world . <p> Justice Gunmi , stressed that lack of timely , predictable and affordable access to justice was having negative toll on the confidence both citizens and foreigners have in the Nigerian judiciary . <p> He said : " Unfortunately , many developing and transition countries , including Nigeria , rank poorly in the area of the efficiency of formal justice systems . <p> " Lack of timely , predictable and affordable access to justice has a negative effect on the business climate because it increases risks for local and foreign . Experience has shown that serious businesses are reluctant to put money into an economy where safety of their investment can not be protected . This protection includes judicial intervention when disputes arise ; obviously , most of these businesses can not afford to join the waiting list in our courts and thus is where a centre like this comes in handy . " <p> Remarkably , it was not only these two senior members of the " Bench " that have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nigerian Bar Association , NBA , had on February 17 , vowed to expose how politicians used " consultants " to buy election cases with " incredible sums of money . " <p> The legal body which made the allegation at a valedictory court session that was held in honour of late Justice Anthony Nnaemezie Christopher Aniagolu , said it was aware of all the senior counsel and eminent retired judicial officers that served as conduit between election courts and parties in electoral matters , saying it would forward their names to relevant anti-graft agencies for prosecution . <p> In the a speech that was presented by its national legal adviser , Chief J.B Daudu , SAN , NBA , said : " Corruption is now a live issue that is threatening to tear apart the foundations and fabric of the society . The Bar believes that as it does not possess the machinery and infrastructure to battle this scourge such as the EFCC and ICPC possesses , but it can be proactive in its battle against this vice which left unchecked will sink the whole ship of state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our colleagues including very senior counsel and at times eminent retired judicial officers go about offering their services as ' consultants ' particularly in election cases for incredible sums of money so as to act as conduit between his client and the election court . <p> " The end result is to facilitate ready-made justice for the persons they are acting for . We must strongly deprecate this practice . Our members and members of the public should feel free to avail themselves of the services of this NBA anti-corruption body . We do ourselves the greatest disservice if we fail to fight this ill which renders irrelevant the work and skills of hardworking lawyers who daily toil in and out of courts and who do not have the advantage of knowing with certainty the outcomes of cases as these ' consultants ' are privileged to know . <p> " Secondly , this charge falls at the feet of the Bar particularly counsel who for political manoeuvres or the gratification of ' varying interests ' misuse the process of the Supreme Court and other courts by bringing applications that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Attorney-General of the Federation to call a meeting of the General Council of the Bar so that inter alia , the existing rules of Professional Ethics can be amended to include such areas that will safeguard the dignity of the courts and integrity of judicial process . Let us call ourselves to order in this regard . The essence of a just judicial system is to provide prompt qualitative justice for the people . Justice is meaningless when it is delayed , hurried or perverted " , it stressed . <p> Aside the realm of rhetoric , the pertinent question remains , what can be done to cure our judiciary ? And my answers are : " Fiat justitia , ruat coelum " ( Let right be done , though the heavens fall ) , " Nihil magis justum est quam quod necessarium est . ( Nothing is more just than what is necessary ) .

@@1810234 @ @ @ @ @ Council <p> THE Abuja Metropolitan Management Council ( formerly AMMA ) came into being in year 2005 as a response to the increasing development challenges besetting an evolving federal capital such as Abuja . AMMC is comprised of five departments namely : Parks and Recreation ; Urban Affairs , Development Control , Facilities Maintenance and Management ; Administration and Finance . <p> From all indications , these departments are meant to complement each other towards ensuring optimum service delivery to the residents of FCT . <p> Regrettably , the Council in the past was famous for demolition of properties , more than any other function . It appeared as if the organisation was set up to inflict pain on property developers in the federal capital . Conversely today , it is consoling that the Abuja Metropolitan Management Council , under the new leadership of Reuben Okoya , an architect , has decided to refocus the organisation in a way that its core mandates can be realised in the interest of Abuja residents . <p> For example , the new leadership has taken the gauntlet to ease the problems usually associated with the processing of building plans in the FCT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a simple building plan to be approved by the Council . <p> Obviously , these delays and laxity caused untold hardship to many property developers and investors who want to invest in FCT . Going by the new policies being enunciated by the Okoya leadership , it would take only two weeks from now to process all qualified building plans . This is based on the reasoning that prompt processing and approval of legitimate building plans will greatly enhance economic development , investment opportunities and housing needs in the territory . In addition , if the call by government for the private sector to join in developing Abuja will yield the desired result , then all obstacles towards realising the goal must be dismantled . <p> In the area of demolition of illegal structures in the territory , it is gratifying to know that the Okoya leadership has decided to carry out their duties with due diligence and human face . This is commendable considering that the Jonathan administration which was founded on popular support by most Nigerians should not be seen to be acting with hostility on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are notable for being humane and considerate in handling public issues . Therefore , that the Okoya leadership has decided to tread softly on issues related to demolition is a thing of joy . Furthermore , that AMMC does not compromise standards in their operations , and yet remaining considerate in operations is commendable . In truth , demolitions should not be carried out just for the sake of it , as was the practice in times past . <p> In the new dispensation , demolitions are carried out with due diligence , observance of rule of law and decorum such that once it takes place , the Department of Parks and Recreation under AMMC swiftly moves in to fence off the area , thereby avoiding resurgence of squatter settlements . <p> In the area of emergency management , it is worthy of note that AMMC , through their Fire Service Department responds to fire disasters and other emergencies within the shortest possible time . Indeed , FCT is known nationwide to have the shortest response time to disasters or emergencies as they occur , which at the last count @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; after all Abuja , as the nation 's capital , must be seen to show example to other states in Nigeria . For example , when Thisday was bombed by terrorists , AMMC was the first to arrive the scene , put off the fire and attended to several wounded victims . <p> Gladly enough , Okoya has given the marching orders to the FCT Fire Service to extend their operations to all nooks and crannies of the city as a way of creating easy access in case of fire disaster or other emergencies . The affected areas include Karu/Nyanya , Kubwa , Maitama , Gwagwalada and Zuba axis . <p> On FCT Parks and Recreation , the AMMC leadership has embarked on a programme of reassessing the operations of the open parks to ensure that they meet the acceptable minimum standards . In this connection , a committee was set up to evaluate the operations of the parks in FCT . Obviously , these moves are meant to sanitise the operations of the parks to ensure that they operate according to the original usage for which they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into drinking joints and prostitution areas is unacceptable and the Okoya leadership is geared towards redressing this anomaly . <p> From all indications , Okoya is determined to help the FCT Minister , Senator Bala Mohammed , achieve his mission of transforming FCT , and providing liveable Federal Capital Territory comparable to any other capital in the civilized world for all Nigerians . All hands must , therefore , be on deck to support these laudable efforts to make Abuja , not only a home for all Nigerians , but for generations yet to come .

However , there were serious political problems which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Minorities Question . <p> For many years , there had been general agitation for separate Regions by the Middle Belt minorities in the North , the Mid-Western minorities in the West and the Calabar-Ogoja-Rivers State Movement in the East . There were tensions over the attempt to conduct a national census in 1961 which was cancelled , and was repeated in 1963 . Then came the break-up of the Action Group in 1962 , the Treason trials and imprisonment of Awolowo in 1963 , the crisis over the December , 1964 Federal Elections which was resolved with the appointment of a broad-based Federal Government in April , 1965 , but which was then followed by the heavily rigged Western Region elections in 1965 . <p> Military rule from 1966 <p> Then came the bloody January , 1966 Military Coup that ended the First Republic and brought in the First Military Government of General Ironsi . General Ironsi was overthrown in another very bloody coup in July , 1966 . Nigeria then perilously hovered at the brink of disintegration . For two excruciating days , there was no supreme authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Civil Service was able to maintain the semblance of normalcy . Then the slide to Civil War of 1967-70 which for all the loss of lives , and agony was ended by Nigerians themselves without the intervention of foreign " do-gooders " . <p> The country then embarked on the three Rs programme -- Rehabilitation , Reconciliation , and Reconstruction which had been well planned in advance . The country resumed accelerated economic growth and from 1970-1975 the economy grew at the average of 11.75 per cent per annum until terminated by the Coup of July , 1975 followed by the massive purge and destruction of the confident , non-partisan , trained and fearless Public Service inherited from the British , but worse still , the abandonment of National Plans and the process of planning and the discipline it entails especially with regard to frugal cost-effective use of the nation 's resources for the promotion of the public good . <p> We had a brief interlude of Civilian Rule under President Shehu Shagari from 1979 to 1983 . This was terminated by a Military Coup in December 1983 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governance , and economic stagnation with an average growth rate of only two per cent per annum over the decade ending in 1999 . Meanwhile , the population continued to grow at three per cent per annum . <p> Democratic Rule Since May , 1999 : Democracy was restored in 1999 with the election of Chief Olusegun Obasanjo as President . He was succeeded by late President Musa Yar'Adua in 2007 and then President Goodluck Jonathan , who has been in power since 2010 and was elected in his own right in 2011 . <p> So we have enjoyed democratic rule for 13 years . Regrettably as measured by the doleful catalogue with which I started this talk , the degradation in the quality of governance , and unresponsiveness to the real needs of the people seem to be accelerating and must be reversed in order to avoid disaster . The present allocation of the resources available to Nigeria is not sustainable . <p> The threat of national disintegration:It is not surprising to hear otherwise level headed people , given the current challenges , talk as if the breaking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them Nigeria is too difficult to administer . <p> I have no doubt that the solution to our problems does not lie in disintegration . It is not possible to divide Nigeria neatly into a given number of successor countries . A collapse of the Nigerian State will most likely result in an unpredictable number of mini states controlled by war lords . Imagine leaving Lagos and encountering a Customs post in Ikorodu ; then Ijebu Ode , then Ofuse , then Benin City , etc. or travelling northwards in Shagamu , then Ibadan , then Ilorin , then Minna and so forth . <p> Economic progress <p> It will be horrendous to have Nigeria as a failed state . The fault will be that of the so called elite . There will be no economic progress and civilization will be halted and life will be very insecure . It is a prospect which should shock us to exploring solutions to our current problems . <p> What the ordinary man desires is shelter , food , educational facilities to ensure his children 's advancement in life and of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure . He is really not interested in the power struggles among politicians . <p> Good leadership , good governance which result in rapid economic and social progress and improving standard of living and quality of life for the great majority of the people are what will lead to national cohesion and stability . How remarkable the success of Malaysia in uniting the Malays and Chinese and smaller communities of Indians and others in a multi-religious , multi-ethnic state . Again , China with her 1.4 billion people unites many diverse ethnic and linguistic groups . We also have the Indian example . <p> How to save the situation : Nigeria 's tremendous potentials for developing into a great country remain largely unexploited . The critical imperative is that Nigeria 's leadership must undergo a revolutionary change of attitude and embrace good governance in all its aspects . This entails : <p> *The Rule of Law ; <p> *Efficient and prompt administration of justice ; <p> *Predictability , objectivity and consistency in government measures ; <p> *Respect for the sanctity of contracts ; <p> *Abandonment of the pursuit of self-enrichment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> *Zero tolerance for corruption and the prompt application of adequate sanctions against offenders including seizure of all properties corruptly acquired ; <p> *Efficient and timely service delivery by all government agencies ; <p> *Return to planning and submission to the discipline of planning , respecting pre-determined priorities in the utilization of national resources ; <p> *Return to the principle of collective responsibility of government ; <p> *Entrenchment of merit and the pursuit of excellence as a core national value . <p> The Implications of Vision 20 : 2020 <p> That President Goodluck Jonathan is committed to Vision 20 : 2020 gives cause for hope . The Goal of Vision 20 : 2020 is to make Nigeria one of the 20 largest economies in the world by 2020 AD and meanwhile to ensure the achievement before then of the Millenium Development Goals ( MDGs ) and a drastic reduction of the proportion of Nigerians living below the poverty line , and also achieve a significant improvement in Nigeria 's HDI score . <p> This entails the return to planning and the acceptance of the discipline of planning and ensuring that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Perspective Plan and its Medium Term Plans developed to realize the Vision . <p> Under the Jonathan Administration , the Federal and State Governments have agreed on three medium term periods : 2010-2013 , 2014-2017 , and 2018-2021 . I am also aware that the 2010-2013 Medium Term Plan which is the fifth National Development Plan , was finalized and launched last year . <p> I am informed that the Jonathan Transformation Plan 2010-2015 , is coherent with the 2010-2013 Plan and anticipates part of the 2014-2017 . It is very important that henceforth , the Nigerian Government should avoid the discontinuities and inconsistencies arising from changes of administrations or even changes of ministers within the same administration , which disrupted economic growth and development in the past . <p> Many people may question if the goals set can be achieved by 2020 . Indeed , the growth rates in 2010-2011 and the projected rate for 2012 are well below the figures in the 2010-2013 Plan . The 2020 date is not sacrosanct . <p> Indeed the experts in Goldman Sachs who first included Nigeria in the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2025 . What is really important is that the Nigerian Government should start in earnest to implement the policies and programmes set out in the Medium Term Plans with as much discipline as possible . <p> It will not be an easy undertaking especially in the prevailing global economic situation . The 2010-2013 Plan involves a total investment of N32 trillion about US$215 billion . Projected Funding proportions are : Federal Public Sector -- N10 trillion or about US$67.19 billion , States ' Public Sector -- N9 trillion or about US$60.47 billion and Public Sector ( FDI and Domestic ) -- N13 trillion or about US$87.34 billion . <p> Massive flow of foreign capital <p> We have never embarked on such magnitudes of investment . We would also be trying to attract massive inflows of foreign capital and this requires a very great improvement in our rating for international competitiveness . It is very critical to be able to mobilize the nation to implement these Plans . <p> You will recall that it was when we abandoned the 1975 -- 80 Plan which was to create the basis for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian Tigers and we are so far behind them today . However , Nigeria remains a self-sufficient nation with enormous endowments of natural resources -- agriculture , minerals , energy , gemstones , water , etc . We were about 40 million at Independence , we are now about 170 million . <p> Will the president rise to the challenge ? <p> Watershed revolutionary achievements over the next two years in pursuing Vision 2020 , and resultant immortality , beckon to President Goodluck Jonathan and his key lieutenants . <p> Vigorous and disciplined implementation of the 2010 -- 2013 Plan and the Jonathan Transformation Agenda , as well as leading the PDP and the nation to embrace all the aspects of good governance described above will launch Nigeria irreversibly on the path to unity and greatness and will provide the answer to the question which we are addressing this evening . <p> Immediatedifficult things <p> However , there are immediate difficult things which must be accomplished : <p> * The present post-1998 political parties formed even more hastily than those in 1979 have no roots in past political parties and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nigerian Society or the Federal Country which they seek to administer . <p> Most of our new politicians are not aware of the self-sacrifice , the patriotism , the idealism , the promise and commitment of the pre-independence politicians to improving the welfare of the broad masses after Independence nor do they know about the discipline and self-restraint required in managing the lean resources of pre-oil Nigeria . I mean no offence . No fault of theirs . Most of the comments on the past in our media since 1966 have been self-denigrating and abusive of the national psche . <p> *The political parties and the party system have to be re-invented and re-engineered to become patriotic responsive vehicles for promoting the general welfare of all citizens and national greatness . They must adopt and believe in clear manifestos and programmes to promote national progress . Indeed , it will be desirable for all of them to base their programmes on Vision 2020 and let partisan competition and differences be on how best to achieve Vision 2020 and loftier goals beyond . <p> They must become effective organs for selecting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of them subscribing to the same policies and programmes for moving the nation forward . Only such re-engineered political parties can help the President in achieving Vision 2020 and good governance . <p> *The current epidemic of competitive corruption , and excessive greed amongst the political class and our elites in appropriating national resources to themselves must be stopped immediately . <p> *The President should lead the nation to adopt and live with more realistic national remuneration scales for all those paid from the public purse : Nigeria 's per capita income is only N300,000 per annum.

@@1814234 @ @ line executions ( 2 ) <p> By Tonye Princewill MUCH of what it takes is common knowledge , particularly to power sector personnel , political leaders and affected public officials at various levels of government . <p> The enforcement of ordinances and codes pertaining to the utilization of space underneath power transmission lines , is the obvious starting point . <p> These rules are not popular and their enforcement tends to generate political friction and controversy . <p> One reason is that illicit occupants and users of space near power lines are usually either oblivious or indifferent to the possible consequences . <p> Another is the fact that transgressors are , more often than not , economic climbers and disadvantaged individuals -- to whom the enforcement of such regulations seems oppressive . <p> Added to this is the " C-Factor " . In many jurisdictions , a symbiosis has developed between corrupt power line officials and those who inhabit or use space that is legally off-limits . <p> The transgressors apparently are , for PHCN officials and other like-minded actors , a regular and reliable source of bribes . Enforcing the codes and ordinances would , therefore , threaten the income of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick undergrowth of intertwined interests , requires a very high degree of determination and focus . One notable instance of this is the cutting-edge reforms of the Amaechi administration in Rivers State . <p> Determined to sanitize Port Harcourt 's building regulations as it applied to power lines , the State Government acted very decisively . It demolished illegal buildings and fences in both socially decayed and elite areas of the city -- including some structures belonging to members of the Governor 's own cabinet ! <p> This , precisely , is the approach needed -- where it is applicable -- to the problem of illicit use of space underneath power conducting lines . Instead , I am fearful that Peter 's approach is typical of the kind of leadership we have been getting from PHCN , in particular , and public safety administrators generally . <p> According to The Punch , Peters complained that PHCN has expended a lot of resources " enlightening the public on the dangers of the infringement and has even had to make a report on the floor of the Oyo State House of Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avail " . <p> This is curious because , by his own admission , in the same report , the law requires individuals to keep specified distances from the lines . I believe it is incumbent upon PHCN to do much more . When all else fails , it should ask government to demolish encroaching structures and arrest habitual transgressors . <p> This approach , of course , has its limitation . It is not applicable or feasible in every instance . In some cases , the power lines may need to be re-routed , to circumvent highly populated areas . The physical security of residents will more than justify the added expense . <p> As a matter of policy , I believe government should look very carefully at the use of un-insulated wires for transmitting electrical power in populated areas and that the legislature should hold hearing on the issue . An alternative is needed to stringing high-tension and naked low-tension wires over urban areas . <p> I am aware that insulation causes high-tension wires to overheat . But low-voltage wires -- especially drop lines , which carry current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In short , the legislature needs to outlaw naked power lines within town and city boundaries . <p> The National Assembly should also require that high-tension wires be kept completely out of urban areas . This can be achieved through the use of drop ( or " step-down " ) lines to collect power from outlying high-tension conductors and relay it to population centres . <p> In the eastern U.S.A. , for example , power lines in urban and residential areas have long been insulated . Increasingly , insulated low-voltage wires are run underground in populated areas , rather than being strung overhead on electrical poles . <p> The feasibility of adopting these safety measures here , even though we are not an advanced manufacturing country , ought to be explored . It seems to me , that importing insulated lines would make much more sense than to continue to execute our people by bringing in naked wires . <p> There is also the possibility that the magnetism emanating from high-tension power lines could have an adverse effect on individuals living in close proximity to them . This issue is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Nevertheless , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency reports that a 1998 study of the incidence of childhood leukemia , conducted by an " expert working group " of the American National Institute of Health , found that " power line magnetic fields are a possible cause of cancer " . <p> As a short term expedient , transmission wires in populated areas need to be properly maintained and promptly replaced when found to be defective . Stiff penalties ought to be imposed on obstructing or recalcitrant PHCN officials and any other administrator who actions threaten public safety . In a time when power privatisation is a hot topic , our position on this will need to be defined . Transmission as far as I know remains a federal responsibility . This may change in the not too distant future and so potential custodians of this responsibility need to be educated on this reality . Current methods will no longer sustain .

( Soorah al-Baqarah : 183 ) Fasting during the month of Ramadan , the ninth month of the Islamic Calendar is one of the five pillars of Islam . Muslims all over the world observe Ramadan fast as a religious obligation upon them , so as to please Allah ( the most High ) and to earn His blessings and rewards . They abstain from food drinks and sexual intercourse from dawn to sunset with the intent of worshiping Allah and earning His pleasure , drawing practical lessons and gaining spiritual experience in forbearance and self-restraint from indulgence in legitimate pleasure for certain time . The act of fasting is said to redirect the heart away from worldly activities , its purpose being to cleanse the inner soul and free it from harm . It also teaches Muslims to practice self-discipline , self-control , sacrifice and empathy for those who are less fortunate ; thus encouraging actions of generosity and charity ( Zakat ) . <p> In Sokoto the month of Ramadan , means a free Breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding programme of the Sokoto state government came into being at the inception of the present administration . The programme was introduced as a government policy in 2007 , and is being coordinated by the ministry of Religious affairs in conjunction with the state 's ministry of social welfare . <p> On coming to power in 2007 , the Aliyu Magatakarda led administration of Sokoto state , introduced the Ramadan feeding programme to demonstrate its commitment to human development and welfare . <p> Under this programme the state government assists several thousands of people with free food in a bid to easing the difficulties which many always encounter feeding themselves during the fasting period . The month of Ramadan , survey has shown , normally witnesses scarcity of foodstuffs , which always results in the poor segment of the society finding it difficult to break their fasting appropriately . The food scarcity , survey , has equally shown usually results from the unscrupulous activities of some people who hoard the food items with a view of maximizing profits at the expense of the less privileged . ( Continues below ..... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practice had been for the government to earmark huge sums of money for the provision of Ramadan food items in the name of the less privileged , but it eventually ends up in the houses of the rich and privileged , class of the society who usually do n't need the gestures , leaving the poor class who really desire the assistance in the lurch . <p> Indeed , the present revolution began in 2007 , when the present administration decided to use the money earlier earmarked to as usual , take care of the few privileged people in the state , to feed about 500,000 people during the 2007 Ramadan period . The positive response from the people encouraged the administration into expanding the programme in 2008 with a budget of 120 million as against the initial budget of N 70 million in 2007. 2009 and 2010 witnessed a rise in the budget of the programme which resulted in the increase of the feeding centers from 70 to 120 , cash providing centers inclusive . <p> To improve on the programme owing to its positive impact , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the 23 local governments of the state .

In addition , certain mosques , Islamic schools , hospitals and prisons are also being used . The aim is to ensure that the food gets to the right people and avoid a possible hijack by a few people . <p> Though one is not out to hold brief or campaign for the Magatakarda administration , it equally makes sense to first and foremost salute the courage and good sense of justice shown by the administration in making the programme a populist one .

And even when some decided to participate they usually did so with so much pains and hardship with many always besieging the homes of the few privileged to pick crumbs . <p> Besides , the programme should be praised by all sincere and committed Muslims , because it is in tandem with the teachings of Prophet Muhammad p.b.u.h and Islam . Although the holy prophet was known to be generous during his life time , it is on record however that he showed more generosity during the holy month of Ramadan and in the process promoted one of the cardinal points of Islam which is the act of giving out freely especially to the needy . <p> By focusing on the welfare of its people , during the Ramadan period and beyond , the sokoto state government in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people and implementing a Shari ' a governing system in Sokoto state .

@@1814240 <h> Nationalised Banks , One Year After <p> Obinna Chima reviews the performance of Enterprise Bank Limited , Keystone Bank Limited and Mainstreet Bank Limited , a year after their establishment <p> Exactly four days from today , the three nationalised banks -- Enterprise Bank Limited , Keystone Bank Limited and Mainstreet Bank Limited -- would have operated for one year . <p> The aforementioned commercial banks were established following the revocation of the operating licenses of former Spring Bank , Bank PHB and Afribank , in that order . The exercise was jointly carried out by the Central Bank of Nigeria ( CBN ) and the Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation ( NDIC ) through the ' bridge bank ' concept . A bridge bank is a temporary bank established and operated by financial regulators to acquire the assets and liabilities of a failed bank to facilitate its resolution . <p> According to the regulators , the action was taken earlier than the September 30 deadline , because the then troubled banks , unlike their peers , did not show any capacity recapitalise before the deadline . <p> The bridged banks were thereafter , sold to the Asset Management Corporation of Nigeria ( AMCON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deal , AMCON injected a total of N679 billion into the three banks , thus raising their capital adequacy ratio to 15 percent respectively and also enabled them to pay back the funds that CBN injected into them in 2009 . <p> A breakdown of the amount injected by AMCON showed that N285 billion was given to Mainstreet Bank , Keystone Bank got N283 billion while Enterprise Bank was given N110 billion . AMCON 's Managing Director/Chief Executive Officer ( MD/CEO ) , Mr. Mustapha Chike-Obi had explained that the corporation would manage the financial institutions for about three years , before finding new investors . <p> He said : " We need a stable banking system . Also , we have emphasised that no depositor will lose their money . That was the mandate given to the regulatory authorities and that is the mandate we are all pursuing . Depositors ' funds are safe ; the employees ' jobs are safe . " <p> However , a year after the dramatic exercise , the takeover the three banks still elicits mixed reactions . A recent report by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the capital market , faulted the exercise . Also , there have been divergent views on the performance of the banks since their establishment from market analysts as well as shareholders of the defunct banks . <p> The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) said in its recently released staff report for 2011 Article IV Consultation that intervention by the regulators and with the recapitalisation of the then rescued banks in late 2011 , the resolution of the 2009 banking crisis had been largely achieved . It also welcomed the initiatives to strengthen regulatory and supervisory framework in Nigeria . <p> " Stricter regulations on corporate governance and risk management ; programmes to improve the CBN 's ability to assess systemic risk ; and initiatives to boost cross-agency and cross-border cooperation among regulators will help to avoid a repeat of conditions that prevailed prior to the 2009 crisis , " IMF added . <p> Awaiting the Numbers <p> Chike-Obi , in an interview with THISDAY at the weekend , said that the banks ought to release their financial results with other commercial banks in the country . He however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information on their results . Chike-Obi said : " The truth is that their financials ought to be ready and it is positive because the banks are not longer losing money . But you have to contact the CEOs of the banks to find out the exact situation . " <p> According the AMCON boss , " These banks are no longer losing funds , which they were doing before the nationalisation . But I must say that there is a lot of work ahead for them because they need to remain competitive . " He added that financial advisers would soon be appointed for the banks to examine the best option to sell them banks . Chike-Obi had recently disclosed plans to list the banks on the Nigerian Stock Exchange ( NSE ) <p> Nevertheless , save for the MD/CEO of Keystone Bank , Mr. Oti Ikomi , who responded to THISDAY 's enquiries , his Mainstreet Bank and Enterprise Bank counterparts declined to comment . They also did not respond to text messages sent to their phones . <p> Ikomi said : " Keystone Bank 's results for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Approval in principle from the CBN is in place , subsequent to a well conducted audit by our external auditors - KPMG . Keystone Bank financial control is finalising the issuance process and we expect to release our accounts very shortly . <p> " The bank has made considerable progress in the last one year and customer confidence has been reinstalled . Business growth is progressing and staff morale is significantly improved . " <p> In his opinion , MD/CEO , Financial Derivatives Company Limited , Mr. Bismarck Rewane , said the banks were on the path of growth . Rewane added : " I am only familiar with two out of the three banks -- Keystone and Mainstreet and it seems to be doing the right thing . They seem to have a good capital base and are introspective in their strategy . Judging from what I have seen , the banks have stabilised and the worst is over for them . They are consolidating their market share . " <p> But a Senior Analyst at BGL Limited , Mr. Femi Ademola , was circumspect about commenting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningful appraisal could be done without seeing their financial statements . " They are still stabilising and I do not expect any fantastic results from them . If the banks say they are making profits , to me , that is not explanatory , because as there is nothing to gauge their performance . If they say they are doing well , from what perspective ? " Ademola queried . <p> Banking Operations To Ikomi , Keystone Bank has been repositioned for efficiency , market share growth , even as he added that there have been improved governance and controls in the financial institution . <p> " We have put in place a ' let 's build ' strategic focus to be a top five bank in Nigeria by 2015 , focusing on innovation and meeting customers ' needs in the middle market and retail banking . We are making early progress in the statistics released as part of the cash-less Lagos drive . Keystone Bank already features as a top 10 bank in Nigeria , measured by Point of Sale terminals ( PoS ) deployment . <p> " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our services indicators are up , while we still fix key areas . We have a well defined target market and functional segmentation by corporate banking , commercial banking , retail and public sector banking , " Ikomi explained . <p> But Ademola maintained that the quality of customer service in the banks has dropped . " To me , there is largely low quality of customer satisfaction in those banks . And not just from them , but the industry in general . This is because banks are these days , are too comfortable with the huge amount they make from charges and commissions . This has made them unwilling to improve on the quality of their service(s) " he added . <p> Job Losses <p> When the banks were established , there was strong assurance by the regulators and AMCON that there will be no job losses . However , since this year , there have been various reports of job losses in the banks . While Mainstreet and Enterprise had at different times explained that the right sizing was carried out to cut costs and ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recorded any job losses since commenced operations . <p> It remains to be seen if the banks live up to the expectations of its customers and shareholder -- AMCON .

We have been nurturing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of passion and a commitment to help the youth in human development because here in Nigeria , we have so many international organizations with many job vacancies and our youths ca n't access such opportunities because of their inability to speak French and we are talking about unemployment . <p> Language barrier is the problem , if Nigerian youths can be French literate , they will secure gainful employments . This is our own way of encouraging French language in Nigeria and opening doors for our youths to meet with the outside world , " she said <p> The bi-monthly magazine which will cover tourism , culture and entertainment will circulate in higher institutions , public and private organizations and in all francophone countries . <p> While calling for more access to the language in Nigerian schools , Kaseem urged government to make the language more attractive to teachers and students to help Nigeria improve in the language .

@@1818238 <h> Abdullahi dissects problems of Nigerian sports <p> By Tony Ubani After Nigeria 's woeful performance at the London 2012 Olympics , President Goodluck Jonathan ordered the restructuring of the sports system for better results in future . <p> Bolaji Abdullahi seems to have started work in that direction with a directive that the Nigeria Premier League , a supposed nursery for the national football teams , should suspend the resumption of the football season until they answer many questions , including sponsorship money and TV rights . Excerpts : <p> Let 's start with the burning issue of the League . Stakeholders are waiting for the start of the league which has been put off on your advice . <p> How far have you gone in addressing the issues that forced you to suspend the kick off such that by the next two months we can start ? <p> The issue of the league is one of many issues . The league is a big product and the value of every business revolves around its integrity . And so , once you have questions hanging around its integrity , issues would arise that will make it very unattractive to any investor . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors will not put their money . <p> Sports Minister , Bolaji Abdullahi <p> What we want to do is to put up a medium to long term plan to reform the Nigeria Premier League which I think is very necessary not only for football but for youth employment in Nigeria and our national teams as well . <p> In the immediate term we have to deal with a lot of issues and largely we have to deal with matters bordering on sponsorship , broadcast rights and the administration of the league totally . On the issue of sponsorship , we have almost resolved that . <p> We have had several meetings and consulta-tions which have been fruitful with the two sponsors involved . <p> But we are not eager to ask them to release funds because we have to ask questions on how the previous money was spent . We have had situations where those who should get the funds are not getting enough ; players are being owed salaries and the sponsors are not getting real value for their money . <p> There 's also the issue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Premier League have been asking questions themselves . Are we getting real value for our league ? Is the league not heavily undervalued and how can the clubs benefit more from these rights ? Its logical that we sort everything out so that the league will start on a clean and more attractive note . <p> Are you not worried that 80% of the clubs are government owned ? In this your reform , are you also working in that direction ? <p> To your first question , yes I am worried that it is so but it is an aberration that we have to live with for now until we can reach a situation that can encourage individuals and private organisations to own a club . <p> The individuals and organisations need to have confidence . Once we are able to clean up the league , then it becomes easier for private investment to come in . For me , any talk of reform in terms of ownership must have short and long view on how to go about it . <p> If we remove government clubs just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I have been talking with my colleagues from other countries who have faced this kind of situation in the past and how they got by it and such information I am gathering are very enriching . <p> Now how does the Nigeria Football Federation come in because they have the major role to play ? It is the NFF that has the franchise that has produced the league . It is their product . And then how does the Sports Ministry come ? <p> What we are saying is that the NFF owns the league and the NFF is a parastatal under the National Sports Commis-sion . The line of relationship is such that we at the NSC can work out a broad frame of policy which they can build upon . <p> But on those things that are core football issues , there is no mix up . It is clear the Federation should take charge of those exclusive matters . This is part of what we 're doing to properly position all aspects of administration . <p> But I can gladly say that right from the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Federation has been carried along . <p> Indeed , this clean up of issues around the league is a joint work and that is why it has been going on very well . It has been a joint project with mutual respect and that is how we intend to carry on to the benefit of Nigerian football and sports indeed . <p> We have many national teams like U-17 , U-20 and the Eagles . But we always lump everything together for just one company . This pattern has reduced revenue for the system as the teams have been under-valued and has denied other companies from healthy competition . <p> The major problem is that we still have this beggarly mentality and so when we get that kind of small money from anybody we are so grateful rather than properly checking the value of our products and programmes . But we do n't bother to evaluate what we have . It is when we are able to do that that we can then attach value to each of our teams and say this is the minimum we want and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ca n't we group this teams and evaluate them properly and as the minister you invite companies to take them as sponsors ? <p> I do n't want to do that because that will mean operating within the same old philosophy . I do n't want to be the one going to companies to come and sponsor our teams or leagues . The Minister has no business doing that when we are functioning well with the system ... <p> But the system is peculiar ; football is not run as it is in England for instance ... <p> No , I disagree . I know it is not exactly the same now but I wo n't agree with that belief that our system is peculiar when we can turn it around and make it function properly as in some other places . <p> The way we are now , it is not easy to put any amount on a team and invite people to take them when we do n't even know the actual value but if we are able to get a system that puts football league @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as proper business , then we can begin to move very fast forward . It is about making profit at the end of the day . <p> Another issue is that of the media . You can not run a successful league without the media . The success of the English League lies heavily around the media . <p> It 's a media invention ; it is an event tied strongly around the media . In Nigeria how do we consume the product ? The only channel now for our football is through DSTV -- a complete monopoly . We do n't have alternative for now . <p> So when you have DSTV through SuperSport buying into the league , they pay you what they want because they know you do n't have an alternative outlet . If there is a process of bidding that brings in say about six companies and you say before you get the rights , you must meet one , two , three things . Things wo n't be the same again . <p> In the past , an attempt was made to achieve that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a private business that is why it is like that .

@@1819230 <p> Dear Fellow Nigerian Students , After due reflection , I have decided to provide you with some tips about Thailand and some of the university requirements . I could not do this completely without first and foremost letting you be aware of what it takes to study , work and live in Thailand . Please note that the information given in this write-up are my personal opinion and some research opinions about life in Thailand and what it takes a Nigerian to come , study and live in Thailand . <p> About Thailand : <p> Thailand has common borders with Malaysia , Myanmar ( Burma ) , Laos , and Cambodia . The Northern part is often seen as the poorest part of Thailand . The Southern part of Thailand is the Muslim dominated areas with some form of political instability . Thai people are well known for their welcoming smiles . They are also hospitable people . Thailand is welcoming tourists . The country is one of the few countries that are not colonized . Thai is their national language . Good numbers of Thais do not speak English . However , they are gradually improving with the help of foreign teachers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Thais love and revere their King and the Royal Family so much . As a Nigerian you are expected to show respect for the King , the Queen , and the Royal Family . Avoid any comment/action that might be deemed offensive to the Royal Family . ( Continues below ..... ) <p> Photo Above:Map of Thailand <p> Religion : <p> Religiously speaking , Thai people are very calm and respectful to all religions . The level of religious tolerance in Thailand is acceptable . Thai laws also tolerate other people 's religion . In religious places , you are expected to dress neatly and properly . You are also expected not to make too much noise . You should not wear shoes inside the temple that has Buddha image . There is a place you can take off your shoes . In all avoid any thing that will demonstrate a lack of respect in such a sacred place . It is directly the same compared to sacred places when visiting African Shrines . <p> Social Customs : <p> Thais greet in a prayer-like style which they called ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to greet people by hand shake . Just as a young person greets the elderly one in our various Nigerian dialects , a younger Thai wais to an elderly Thai . When you arrive , you can easily learn this because it is very easy to learn . In Thailand , it is a bad manner to point your foot at a person . In Nigeria , it should be seen as nothing but in Thailand it could be seen as a bad omen . So it is preferable if you could use your finger , should you intend to point at anything to a Thai . Thais do not like people to touch their head or even any part of their body . This is different if considered in Nigeria , where such could be seen as a sign of good relationship but in Thailand you try to avoid unnecessary hand touch . Similarly , if you watch Thais at any social gathering , you will notice that young Thais go to considerable lengths to keep their heads lower than those of the elder ones . They do this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elderly ones . <p> In Thailand public show of love between boys and girls are normally seen as a rudeness or uncultured behavior . Of course , just as in every other country , you can still see young ones who do not keep to the rules . You are expected to follow the footsteps of those who obey the rules . If you intend to be rude , then you may likely find things very difficult in Thailand . It pays to be calm and keep a cool head and conceal your emotions as much as possible . Talking too much or even losing your temper while talking with a Thai may likely make the matter worst for you . For Thais , such a behavior is simply a show of poor manners . As a Nigerian , if you abide by the rules and regulations of the Kingdom of Thailand , then , you are on your way to making more friends during your study . It simply goes to say that the more friends you make ( if any ) , the more you will want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any problem from any angle . <p> From history , Thailand has a well-established hierarchical structure of status which begins from the Royal family and gets to everyone and everything else . So as a student , paying respect to your teachers should be a paramount important to you among other things . Again , Thais expect you as a visitor to dress appropriately in classrooms , and , in a formal public places . Hence as an undergraduate , you are expected to wear your school uniform while in the school vicinity otherwise you will not be attended to . It is good to note that Thais are quite conservative and patient . Thais do not talk too much and love to be calm and allow things to flow naturally . <p> How to get a student visa : <p> Firstly , you need to be in contact with the University and then apply for the program of your choice . Then the University is expected to ask you to provide your educational credentials . If you are applying for undergraduate courses then you are expected to provide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ educative estimate . Some universities request more while some request less . The application procedures differ from university to university . While you can apply for some programs simply by sending application form and copies of your transcripts per e-mail , others request the complete documentation with certified copies and proper photographs . Note that Nigerian documents are carefully scrutinized for the simple reason that some Nigerians may have faked things . As soon as your application is accepted , you will be issued an acceptance letter , which is normally called ' The Letter of Admission ' . ( Continues below ..... ) <p> Photo Above : Study Books <p> This Letter of Admission supposed and should in fact be printed on the official letterhead of the particular university that has accepted you . The letter must be signed by the authorized person or his assigned assistant . The content of the letter might differ from university to university but in all it must show that the university accepted you for a particular program and invites you to begin your studies at a certain date within a particular semester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will study . <p> In Thailand , the student visa is a one year visa . It is given to only to those who are qualified and actually intend to study . It is preferable if one pays for a complete school fees/tuition fees . You should try to register for at least 3 courses per semester . After the registration in a recognized or government approved university in Thailand , you should get your Thai student visa with the following documents : <p> For those who are already in Thailand when they received the Letter of Admission , it is better and preferable to leave the country in order to apply for a non-immigrant ED visa from outside the country . While on tourist visa you may change it within the country without leaving to another country but the visa must be valid for at least 21 days in any case . Be informed that of recent , it is very difficult to change from tourist to Non-immigrant visa . As to the photographs , do n't carry or where anything that might change your face . <p> Thailand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrating that you are indeed ready to study at the Thai university . Be informed , that your application alone does n't make you a student . Therefore , the student visa is only valid for 90 days when you get it the first time . You are expected to report to the Immigration at the expiration of each 90 days . You must learn to practice this till you leave the country . <p> Working with a student visa : <p> Please you are not allowed to work with student visa . You are permitted to study . Should you intend to work then apply for Non-B visa with the appropriate documents with the company that had employed you . The idea of working and studying with student visa will only land you in jail and eventual deportation according to Thai laws . Reportedly , there are cases of students who , for instance , teach in order to finance their studies . Please be aware that this is illegal even if doing so is possible . <p> Feeding : <p> There are so many African foods or Nigerian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you may not find it easy with Thai food , therefore , you are advised to keep on with Nigerian food or other African food until your stomach gets adjusted to the Thai food . However , be informed that the African food could be very expensive but not too expensive . <p> Academics : <p> Education in Thailand is stable . There is no strike action . You can choose to complete your studies within a short period of time provided you are able to pay for the studies . It is possible to complete your bachelor degree within three years . It is also possible to complete your master degree within a year . Ordinarily , Nigerian students do better than other students from other countries . Remember that you must try to make at least CGPA of 3.0 although at most instances some universities may overlook that . Studies here are done both on the weekend and on weekdays depending on the university , and , on the program you enrolled in . Some universities include the text books as part of the school fees and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your text books . Most often classes here are not too crowded . There are good facilities as well . <p> Danger Points : <p> * Avoid doing your educational admission process with any agency except direct contact with the school or the university . * Avoid any form of forging of documents of any kinds . * Avoid telling lies in order to secure the visa . * Avoid any form of short cut in order to get the visa . * Avoid coming to Thailand to study when you have no sponsor . * Avoid moving with a person of questionable character . * Avoid avoiding the Nigerian Embassy in Thailand . * Avoid any form of drug trafficking . * Avoid any form of making money in an illegal way . * Avoid thinking that you are still in Nigeria when in fact you are in Thailand . * Avoid disrespecting your teacher . * Avoid unnecessary argument with your teachers in the classroom . <p> Good Points : <p> * Just maintain your normal African value , norms and culture and you will join us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not true that all Nigerians in Thailand are all in oddities . There are many Nigerians who are in Thailand with credible records . There are also many Nigerians who are in Thailand teaching , lecturing , and some are also doing genuine business . * Nigerian Embassy in Bangkok should be your home because they are always available if you prove to be a good student . The Embassy is very helpful . * Nigerian Student Forum is also very active and indeed very supportive . * Nigerian Community Association is also available and ready to help . <p> Recommended Thai Universities : <p> All the universities in Thailand are apparently recognized and approved by the Ministry of Education in Thailand . Approximately all the Thai universities have one exchange program with the world leading universities both in other parts of Asia , Europe and America . However , for Nigerians who would like to enroll in a university based on financial incentives ; Siam University stands to be the best because the President of Siam University provides a scholarship for the African Students . Interestingly 99.9% of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Siam University is the most favorable university in Thailand for a Nigerian applicant . However , essential screening is desired before one gets an admission in Siam University Thailand . I hereby recommend Nigerian student to try studying at Siam University Thailand .

Hon. Istifanus Gbana , Suntai sought for the confirmation and approval of Garba as the new deputy governor of the state . And in a swift response to the governor 's request , the Assembly unanimously confirmed Garba 's nomination on October 5 and was sworn-in same day by the state 's Chief Judge , Justice Josephine Tuktur . <p> Swearing-in the new deputy governor at the dome tent of Taraba Motel , Justice Tuktur said the exercise was in fulfillment of the provisions of the 1999 constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor and Garba 's swearing-in as the handiwork of God .

If there were contradictions on the report , it would have generated arguments and debates that would have prolonged the adoption of the report . But in this case , the report was very clear and explicit and the Assembly had no reason to defer its adoption . " <p> Interestingly , while the impeachment process was on , the jostle to succeed Danladi had begun in earnest , ostensibly because of Suntai 's tacit support for the move . By the last count , no fewer than four names had featured prominently as likely successor leading to a lot of intrigues and lobbying by some of those concerned and their political associates to swing the pendulum in their favour . <p> Prominent among the names that were speculated was Hon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government and immediate past Special Adviser to the governor on local government and chieftaincy affairs and gubernatorial candidate of Congress for Progressive Change ( CPC ) in the last gubernatorial election , Engr . Ahmed Yusuf , who recently returned to PDP . <p> Apart Sani Kona and Yusuf , other heavy weights whose names had featured included Alhaji Kabiru Pitiko , one time Chairman of Karim Lamido local government area and incumbent Chairman of Jalingo local government , Alhaji Hassan Bappa , who is also a former member of the state House of Assembly . <p> But against then subsisting permutations , Garba popularly called UTC because of his long years of meritorious service at the defunct trading company and whose name was hardly mentioned was emerged the successor to Danladi . <p> Though most , if not all those that were mentioned for the post are close political associate and loyalists of the Governor , several factors were said to have worked against their consideration and eventual nomination . <p> For example , Kona , who was favoured for the office was dropped because his cousin , Hon. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the state while Yusuf , according to investigations , was not considered because he returned to the PDP barely four months ago even though he was appointed Chairman , Board of Taraba Investment and Properties Limited few weeks after his return to the party . <p> But Suntai was said to have settled for Garba for some deft political reasons . While Kona , Yusuf , Bappa and Pitiko all hail from Jalingo local government , Garba is a native of Bachama in Karim-Lamido local government area of the state as the ousted deputy governor . The governor was also said to have expressed his preference for an experienced person with strong character and personality , a frame Garba is believed to fit in . <p> Meanwhile , Garba has expressed his readiness to do everything humanly possible to engender a cordial and harmonious working relationship with Suntai . Addressing the people shortly after he was sworn into office , Gareba declared his unflinching support and loyalty to the Suntai administration and the people of the state and expressed his gratitude to God for the privilege to serve in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your name will appear next to your comment .

The former is usually pressed from the raw seeds and has a high smoking point . It 's preferable for cooking over the roasted/blended dark variety . The dark variety is common in the Asian regions . With this variety , the seeds are pressed AFTER they have been roasted . The oil derived from this press has a lower smoking point and is used as seasoning rather than cooking oil . So basically you use it to finish stir fries and it 's sprinkled over meals . <p> Sesame oil is nutty in flavour especially the blended dark variety so if you heat it up too much it would start to burn . <p> Uses <p> Remember how I said the secret to my awesome barbecue chicken is sesame oil ?

I find that sesame oil adds this extra nuttiness that compliments the sweetness of the fish . <p> Mix some sesame oil with some barbecue sauce and use to baste our chops , burgers , sausages and prawns on the grill . Sesame and coal are best friends . <p> The next time you want to try an Asian inspired salad , mix the sesame oil with some rice wine vinegar , honey and some chilli sauce to coat the leaves or use it to glaze the salmon . <p> The lighter pressed oil is a good massage oil so after a long week get some body massaging with this lighter version of the oil . <p> It certainly goes well with seafood . Mix garlic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or put in a broth . <p> You know I wont just go on and on about sesame oil without giving you a recipe so let 's try something . <p> I thought this would be something simple you can do and marinade weeks in advance and leave in your freezer . When you have friends over you can just bring it out to thaw and pop it in the grill for a weekend lunch . <p> I used chicken tenders here which is basically the extra slab of flesh that 's attached to the breast of the chicken . You can use plain chicken breasts or just marinade legs and roast in the oven . <p> Place the chicken tenders in a bowl and set aside . In a blender , place all the other ingredients except the sesame oil . Start the blender motor on a medium speed and slowly add the sesame oil and increase to a high speed till you have a semi-smooth mix . <p> Pour the mix over the chicken and leave to marinade for at least an hour to overnight . <p> Skewer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place on a hot grill or place in the oven and since these are tenders they need maybe one minute and a half per side so it 's juicy in the middle and not dry . <p> Serve with a dipping sauce made by mixing honey , sesame oil , vinegar , soy sauce ( light preferably but dark is fine too but its a stronger sauce ) and some sliced chilles . Place all these things in jar and shake and pour into your dipping bowl . The ratios you want as guidelines are 1 part vinegar to two parts oil and depending on how sweet for salty you want it you balance out the honey and soy to your salt and sugar taste . <p> Special Shout Out to Demilade Olubanwo for the amazing pictures .

Today , Kano is regaining its prominence , only for different reasons . Passing through many roads in Kano city gives a sight of young and old people either as street hawkers or beggars , but much more is the scramble for attention by the groups not to go back home empty handed , thereby making lives difficult for road users . <p> THISDAY investigation shows that hawking and begging are a growing menace in Kano State . For instance , it is now a common sight on every Kano road including the major roads of Murtala Mohammed , Airport , Gidan Murtala , Ibrahim Taiwo Road , Zaria Road , Kabuga/ BUK Road and other roads in Kano metropolis to see hawkers and beggars of various kinds and sometimes magicians or marabouts . The hawkers and beggars constantly harass motorists and sometimes do it in a very aggressive manner , while sometimes they cause traffic jam on the roads during the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads where there are heavy vehicular activities during the day time . The notorious points are the Gidan Murtala road , Ibrahim Taiwo road and Zaria road roundabout . All these places are almost impassable points when there is heavy traffic due to activities of hawkers and beggars who often stand in front of the cars to prevent movement . <p> In Kano , most of the beggars are being assisted by either their relations or children who take them round the streets and roads soliciting for alms from motorists , while some hire people to carry them around the city for the day 's business . After the day 's work , the money is shared according to agreed percentage . <p> There are also beggars on wheelbarrows in strategic junctions accosting passersby to appeal for alms . The alarming rate of this growing menace has become a concern among Kano residents who feel that the government has failed in its responsibility of keeping the beggars and destitute off the major streets of Kano . <p> A resident who pleaded anonymity said : " There is something fundamentally wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beggars shows this government has inadequacies that have a potential snowballing effect on crime wave in the state . We have not witnessed this before and I think governor Rabiu Kwankwaso needs to apply a workable strategy in this direction before it is too late . <p> A commercial cab driver , Adamu Inuwa told THISDAY that " most of the times when I see this hawkers and beggars on our roads , I am afraid and taken aback about their increase , because they are now nuisance not only to the motorists but to every one in the state . They always intimidate people with different kind of products being displayed through the windows of the cars , while others force motorists to buy their products for the fear of unknown as they appear always in bad attire which is suspicious . " <p> He adds : " Sometime during the fasting period , passengers inside the cars were forced to buy date which is popularly called in Hausa as " Dabino " because the hawkers in their attitude forced people to buy or they will be intimidated " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not have any identity , often flood traffic jams in the city carrying bags with unknown items . They even peep into people 's cars while begging for alms . " <p> Shehu Kadiri , a director of a non-governmental organisation said that the government is failing the people . " What you see on the roads in terms of beggars and hawkers increasing in large numbers on Kano metropolis is a showcase of government 's negligence in social support . The danger of this is that there will be pressure on the society and it could cost the society so dearly . The Kano State government needs to do something urgently to reverse the trend , " he said . <p> THISDAY also learnt that hawkers and beggars contribute to the waves of crime in the state . Reports also indicates that in many instances , they provide cover to criminals who disguise as hawkers .

One of the hawkers , Abdulkarim Yusuf , popularly known as Babba said " we hawk because it 's the only solution left to us not to be redundant in the society " .

@@1821231 @ @ Granted Lufthansa May Absolve It of $14m Debt <p> Despite the Senate resolution that the German carrier , Lufthansa , must pay a $14 million ( N2.2 billion ) debt on unpaid royalties to the Federal Government , the airline may not pay the money it owes , investigations by THISDAY have revealed . <p> THISDAY learnt Wednesday that the airline may be absolved from paying the amount because of an existing agreement between Lufthansa and the Federal Government , which included a waiver on royalties . <p> In 2008 , the Federal Government had entered into an agreement to give the airline multiple designations to operate from Lagos , Port Harcourt and Abuja airports in exchange for the use of the Abuja airport as its operational hub for West Africa . <p> Under the agreement , Lufthansa was also meant to provide manpower training and facilitate the development of the maintenance , repair and overhaul ( MRO ) facility in the country . <p> Part of the condition for using the Abuja airport as an operational hub included Lufthansa reaching a commercial agreement with domestic carriers that would ferry passengers from the sub region , which led to the selection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Government at that time considered this as invaluable to the development of the Nigerian aviation industry and therefore decided to grant the German airline a waiver on royalties as part of the agreement . <p> However , according to sources in the aviation ministry , the Minister of Aviation , Ms. Stella Oduah , on November 7 revoked the Memorandum of Understanding ( MoU ) between the Federal Government and Lufthansa because " the minister had not seen any appreciable benefit of the MoU with Lufthansa " . <p> The sources added that the airline did not keep its own part of the agreement , which included assisting in manpower development , development of the MRO facility and use of the Abuja airport as an operational hub . <p> Lufthansa , on its part , blamed the Federal Government for not creating the enabling environment for it to execute its own part of the MoU . <p> A few months ago , the Senate Committee on Aviation had held a public probe on the operations of foreign airlines in the country . During the probe , it had established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backlog of unpaid royalties and other unremitted charges . <p> Chairman , Senate Committee on Aviation , Senator Hope Uzodimma , had said in a recent interview that the committee had given Lufthansa a deadline to pay the debt , failing which it would be sanctioned . <p> Uzodimma accused a senior official in the Ministry of Aviation of unilaterally giving the airline a waiver on royalties , which are the contributions paid to Bilateral Air Service Agreement ( BASA ) Fund . <p> " Are you not aware that under our BASA with Lufthansa , the airline refused to pay over $14 million , simply because one idiot wrote one nonsense letter to the airline that it had been given a waiver without the approval of the minister ? <p> " Only the Federal Executive Council , presided over by the president , can give such an approval for waiver and no other body or person . <p> " We have since discovered the illegality perpetrated by this official and we told the person to get Lufthansa to pay the money latest by the end of this month ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sack of the director that committed the atrocity , " Uzodimma was quoted as saying . <p> Uzodimma might have stirred a controversy by this allegation , which might pit the Senate against the ministry and those behind the Lufthansa deal during the tenure of the late President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua . <p> Those affected , it was learnt , were warming up for a fight with the Senate Committee on Aviation . <p> One official , who was alleged to have been involved in the deal , told THISDAY that it is only Nigeria that still collects royalties , arguing that the reason Ghana had become attractive to foreign airlines , in spite of the country 's smaller population and a lower income per capita , stemmed from the fact that it had removed levies that would discourage airlines from flying to the country , including payment of royalties . <p> " It is only Nigeria that still collects royalties from foreign airlines .

@@1821232 <h> Xmas hampers &amp; the Nigerian factor <p> Whatever your circumstances , Christmas invokes some excitement , the degree depending on how many Christmases you 've celebrated . Naturally , the young are more excited than the more mature people because they look forward to having a good time of foods and drinks and entertainment , more than usual . <p> Once upon a time , sending/receiving Christmas cards was a big part of the Christmas season . The more we received , the more our joy , because we feel it 's a demonstration of the goodwill people have for us . We proudly display them in our living room . Sadly , with the advent of the gsm , sending text messages have so largely replaced cards , that very few shops sell them , and those who do , no longer have the ones with soul-stirring illustrations/messages we used to cherish . <p> We thank God that text messages can not replace Christmas gifts . These make the festive season sizzle for many people , for even if you 're a zillionaire and can afford everything on earth , you may still enjoy receiving presents at Christmas . How times have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all sorts have replaced in many instances , those book gifts , **25;0;TOOLONG gifts , perfumes , toys , etc. , that we used to wrap up nicely and send out , or receive . Christmas hampers have become such big business that they form part of the services that many business outfits provide for individuals and the corporate world . <p> Mid-way into a new year , hamper-makers begin to canvass for business , going round with samples/catalogue of what they can assemble for you , depending on what you want to spend . The competition is fierce , as anyone can turn a hamper provider . All sorts of devises are used to make offers attractive . <p> Sturdy and pretty plastic containers are gradually replacing the traditional cane hampers which could sag or even break under the weight of their contents . Hampers used to consist of provisions , drinks and some household items , but these days , their contents are becoming more sophisticated and upbeat -- expensive drinks , cosmetics , designer towels , footwear , materials for outfits , iron , sandwich toast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the usual provisions . <p> Some hamper-makers are quite imaginative and gifted in their selection of products that will excite you . The funny thing is that in their bid to make you appreciate their selection , they go for foreign-produced items , whether their quality is inferior to the locally made versions or not . <p> Some tell you , ' we use only imported items in our hampers ' , and thus they have the perfect excuse for overpricing the hampers . <p> Then comes the Nigerian factor ! At times , expired items are stacked in the hampers . I used to think this was a mistake on the part of the suppliers , but when this keeps happening every year , I began to believe that something funny is going on . <p> If you get a contract to supply hampers , or , if you 're selling hampers , should n't you go the extra mile to ensure that what you 're supplying are safe for the recipients ? A friend told me that expired products , or those on the verge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , they buy them . <p> It 's advisable not to use tinned/bottled products like -- milk , sardines , corned beef , sausages , baked beans , salad cream , mayonnaise , without first checking that they have n't reached their expiry dates . If you do n't check , you and your family could be in for serious food-poisoning . <p> A hamper-maker of integrity , who has the interests of his/her customers seriously at heart , would use only products that have at least one more year before their expiry dates . This is because many hamper recipients do n't get round to using the items in them , till much later in the year , or , even the following year . <p> Unless you 're in the catering business or have a large family , you 're most likely to store away those cans in your pantry , and forget about them . When you stumble on them later , you discover that their sell-by-date was long over . You should n't trust the ' three month grace ' some people say manufacturers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to dump the whole expired lot , no matter how much you feel you could be losing , than consume them at the risk of your health/life . What 's more , do n't dump them where other people are likely to find them and eat their contents . You do n't want it on your conscience that people fell ill because of what you dumped . <p> Another Nigerian factor in the items in some hampers here , is the presence of empty containers/packages . I know several people , including myself , who have been victims of this . In my case , several times . I removed the sellotape on a tin of imported cookies , and found the tin half-empty ! <p> Same thing with tins of springles , crisps , chocolates , etc . A relative found a strange bottle in the beautiful package of Remy Matin brandy . You hear all sorts of stories about missing items in packages , substituted items , etc . You wonder why cheating has become our second nature here . <p> " Madam , it 's greed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " But that 's stealing , " I remarked . " A hamper should contain exactly what was ordered . Anything otherwise , should be actionable . " <p> " True , madam , but unless it 's a hamper you ordered and examined yourself , the supplier can not be charged with fraud . This is because most hampers are gifts , and one would be too embarrassed to tell the person who sent you the hamper , that all was n't in order with it . One tends to keep quiet , and it 's on that that the suppliers play on ; knowing that there would be no complaints from their clients . So , the fraud will always be there . " <p> This is true , but I think it 's time to change tunes . First of all , when you place an order for hampers , go over the list of the items , and tell the supplier that all items should have at least one year sell-by-date left . You or your assistant should be shown samples of what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hampers that says that the recipient should please report any foul play in the contents . A close relative once reported to his friend that the drinks in the hamper he sent him had been tampered with . The friend was very grateful for the information , and asked for the bottles , which he sent back to the supplier with a stiff word . She apologized profusely , and replaced them with genuine ones . <p> Understandably , not all hamper suppliers are bent . Some are quite honest , but if they 're not vigilant when their staff are packing the hampers , items could be removed/swapped for inferior versions . An acquaintance who 's in the hamper business confirmed that there could be foul play in supply , but added that this is usually not to the knowledge of the owner of the business , as he/she would n't risk losing clients . Also , some suppliers do n't actually pack their hampers , but place orders with market women , who make the selection . <p> Well , whatever the case , we should desist from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not the poorest nation in the world .

The second part was published yesterday <p> Femi Falana , SAN , presented the speech at the Gala Night by the British Nigeria Law Forum at Hilton London Docklands , U.K. <p> WHILE Corruption and rule of law can not exist together in any society because corruption undermines the rule of law , the independence of the Judiciary and attacks the foundation of democratic institutions , the fight against corruption must be a concerted effort of both the Nigerian Bar Association , the BNLF and other organization of Nigerian lawyers in the Diaspora working together to eradicate the scourge from Nigeria . <p> As British-Nigeria lawyers , there are areas where you can utilize your privileged positions here to help in fighting corruption in Nigeria . <p> For example , we all know that Britain is the most preferred destination of choice for our politicians and their loot . While it is difficult for us in Nigeria to trace some of these ill gotten assets due to systemic failures and inadequate paper trail ; however , the British legal system is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can help in fighting corruption in Nigeria by investigating the accounts and property of these public officials in the UK and exposing them to the general public . <p> You can even petition the EFCC in Nigeria or the British government , request for further investigation and prosecution of such corrupt leaders if elements of crime are found . Some of your colleagues from Francophone countries in Africa residing in western countries have utilized similar methods to expose their corrupt leaders some of which have led to criminal prosecution , conviction and forfeiture of ill-gotten wealth . <p> Just recently , President Jonathan received the reports of some committees which investigated the unprecedented mismanagement of the oil and gas industry in Nigeria . The Petroleum Task Force headed by Mr. Nuhu Ribadu , a former chair of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission has revealed that the nation is being shortchanged by the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation and a cartel of oil companies to the tune of several billion of dollars . <p> As the powerful vested interests in the oil industry have held the government hostage the BNLF should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the full implementation of the recommendations of the Committee . Having failed to use Mr. Steve Oronsanye and Bernard Otti ( who were bribed with appointments into the NNPC board during the sitting of the Committee ) the Minister of Petroleum Resources , Mrs. Deizani Allison-Madueke will , in alliance with the multinational oil companies , attempt to influence the Federal Government not to stop the monumental corruption in the oil and gas industry being superintended by her . Since both members of the Committee are guilty of conflict of interest punishable under the Code of Conduct Bureau and Tribunal Act they are disabled from writing any minority report in the circumstance . Having compromised themselves the Federal Government should not allow them to pollute the credibility of the historic report . <p> Apart from lending its voice to the demand for the immediate resignation or removal of the Petroleum Minister the BNLF should help Nigeria to recover royalties of billions of dollars illegally withheld by multinational companies at a time when Nigeria is taking loans of hundreds of millions of dollars with dangerous conditionalities to fund the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be exposed for committing serious economic crimes against the Nigerian people with a view to having them tried in the West since our legal system is not equipped to bring such powerful economic saboteurs to book . On no condition should the Jonathan Administration be allowed to sweep the profound findings of the Committee under the carpet . <p> Another sphere where the BNLF can collaborate with the Nigerian Bar Association ( NBA ) is in the area of the Rule of Law initiative . According to the American Bar Association 's Rule of Law Initiative , countries that lack the rule of laws very often fail to meet the most basic needs of their populations . To this effect , the ABA 's Rule of Law Initiative has established its presence in over fifty countries and works with in-country partners to build sustainable institutions and society 's that deliver justice , foster economic opportunity and unsure respect for human rights .

The fact that continuing education for both lawyers and judges is crucial for the overall development of a legal system was underscored by the famous Lord Denning , a great scholar and jurist who once stated that : " law does not stand still , it moves continually , once this is recognized , then the task of the judge is put on a higher plain . He must constantly seek to mould the law so as to serve the needs of time . He must not be a mere machine . A mere working mason , laying brick without thought for the overall design . <p> He must be an architect , thinking of the structure as a whole , building for society as a system of law , which is strong , durable and just . It is on his work that civilized society depends " . <p> The words of Lord Denning which were written several decades ago are as relevant today as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problems facing the Bar and Bench in Nigeria today coupled with horizontal institutional problems that inhibit the effective administration of justice . <p> Apart from the fact that most of our laws are very obsolete , I 'm sure most people here tonight will be amazed to hear that Nigerian judges still use long hands to record witness statements in a millennium technology , that majority of them are not computer literate , that we do n't have Court reporters to transcribe court proceedings , that we do n't utilize discovery procedure such as interrogatories and request for production of documents in our legal system , that we are just developing our alternative dispute resolution mechanism and it is non- existent in some states when I know that in recent times , United States courts have decided that they have the power to compel parties to engage in amicable resolution of disputes , even when they are unwilling . <p> Nigerian legal system <p> I have gone this far to paint the picture of the Nigerian legal system in order to let you know that Nigerian judges and lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we are to fully realize the effective dispensation of justice , promotion and the enhancement of rule of law in Nigeria . The Judges are fully stretched-mentally and physically and this to a large extent , account for the delay in the dispensation of justice in the country . Stress at work is a barrier to achieving tranquility and efficiency- without composure and placidity , the legal mind can not function effectively and operate optimally. such circumstances , the system is bound to be fraught with inefficiency and institutional hindrance . In today 's competitive , worldwide legal market ; effective legal support requires a combination of continuing legal education , review of practice and procedure and improved legal capabilities , which are currently lacking in the Nigerian legal system . <p> As Nigerian lawyers abroad , the areas of support and cooperation with the Bench and Bar in Nigeria are limitless ; but due to the time constraints , I would like to conclude here in the hope that I have only set the ball rolling in our collaborative efforts to promote judicial efficacy and rule of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have bestowed on me to be present at this gathering of distinguished legal practitioners and to deliver this dinner speech . 
@@1821239 <h> Chinua Achebe 's There Was a Country and " Boko Haram " Criticism <p> Uzor Maxim Uzoatu writes on Chinua Achebe 's new book There Was a Country and pays tribute to the author who turned 82 yesterday <p> Review <p> " Never explain , never retract , never apologize . Just get the thing done and let them howl. " - Nellie L. McClung It is howling time as a result of the release of Chinua Achebe 's There Was a Country -- A Personal History of Biafra . What strikes me is that the book has given birth to a new kind of criticism known as " Boko Haram Criticism " . The term applies to the Boko Haram sect in Nigeria that sees books as anathema . In certain quarters Achebe 's book is " haram " , to wit , an anathema . There Was a Country has created the world record of having more critics who had not set eyes on the book let alone read it . Some of the Boko Haram critics of Achebe 's There Was a Country actually called for the outright banning of not just the book but also Things Fall Apart ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one Boko Haram critic who anticipated my support for Achebe 's book has vowed to kill me and kill himself ... That 's of course the suicidal Boko Haram way ! <p> Of course I did not want to join the league of Boko Haram critics who discuss books that they had not read . In the bid to get a copy of the book I sent out a message to Achebe 's son , Dr Chidi Achebe in Boston , USA , stating thusly : " Chidi my brother , how can Nna-anyi ( our father ) write a new book and I do n't have a copy here in Nigeria ? " Chidi replied me immediately , stating that he had discussed with his elder brother Dr Ike Achebe and both of them were ready to surrender their personal copies to me ! Before I could say " Chinua Achebe " a hard cover edition of There Was a Country had been air-freighted to me as a gift from Chidi via Amazon.com . Yes , I can actually discuss the book because I have a copy on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It came as a surprise to me that the book did not have more than a couple of paragraphs on Chief Obafemi Awolowo , the subject of the critical hysteria in the media . The totality of the book is my concern here especially as Chinua Achebe celebrated his 82nd birthday yesterday . Nobel laureate Nadine Gordimer of South Africa has this to say about There Was a Country : " Chinua Achebe 's history of Biafra is a meditation on the condition of freedom . It has the tense narrative grip of the best fiction . It is also a revelatory entry into the intimate character of the writer 's brilliant mind and bold spirit . Achebe has created here a new genre of literature in which politico-historical evidence , the power of storytelling , and revelations from the depths of the human subconscious are one . The event of a new work by Chinua Achebe is always extraordinary ; this one exceeds all expectation . " <p> Yes , any new book by Achebe becomes an instant classic . What with There Was a Country giving the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wit , purporting to criticize a book one had not read ! <p> Chinua Achebe 's oeuvre is indeed intimidating starting from the legendary Things Fall Apart in 1958 and grandly lapping all the way through No Longer at Ease , Arrow of God , A Man of the People , Anthills of the Savannah , Girls at War and Other Stories , Beware Soul Brother , Morning Yet on Creation Day , The Trouble with Nigeria , Chike and the River , Home and Exile , Hopes and Impediments , The Education of a British-Protected Child etc . <p> There Was a Country can in a sense be seen as the encapsulation of the great man 's lifework . Achebe starts out by reiterating his favourite Igbo proverb that " tells us that a man who does not know where the rain began to beat him can not say where he dried his body . " For Achebe , the rain began to beat Africa upon the " discovery " of the continent by Europe some 500 years ago . Achebe follows through history to the Biafran war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crucially and cataclysmically the history of Africa . According to Achebe , " It is for the sake of the future of Nigeria , for our children and grandchildren , that I feel it is important to tell Nigeria 's story , Biafra 's story , our story , my story . " <p> Born in Ogidi in present-day Anambra State on November 16 , 1930 , Chinua Achebe who was baptized as Albert was indeed a child prodigy from the very beginning such that his academic feats was known far and wide culminating to his lifelong buddy Christian Chike Momah , alias Papa Ada , confessing that he and his mates were warned early in life that one Albert Achebe from Ogidi would send them to the cleaners in the regional school exams ! <p> It was therefore no wonder that Achebe was early in life given this nickname : Dictionary . He passed his school certificate exams at the top of the class with five distinctions and one credit , and the one credit was paradoxically in literature that would eventually earn him worldwide fame . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had just been established Achebe came first or second in the entire country and thus won a major scholarship . His alma mater Government College , Umuahia was so proud of his achievement that they put up a big sign that stayed on the wall for many years . <p> At Ibadan he did not feel like studying medicine after all and thus lost his scholarship . Upon graduation from Ibadan he fell in love with Christie Okoli while working at the then Nigerian Broadcasting Service ( NBS ) in Enugu . When Achebe eventually transferred his services to the Nigerian Broadcasting Corporation ( NBC ) in Lagos he began his journey with destiny by writing Things Fall Apart . He then in a " quite na ? ve , even foolish " move posted the only handwritten manuscript he had to a typing agency in London after paying the then hefty fee of 32 pounds sterling in 1956 . It was through the help of a former BBC Talks producer , Angela Beattie , who had been seconded to NBC Lagos that the typed manuscript was eventually recovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delay . <p> Achebe in his humble manner labels his time " A Lucky Generation " . He lived through the march to Independence in 1960 and the exploits of great politicians such as Zik , Ahmadu Bello and Awolowo . " Here is heresy : " Achebe writes . " The British governed their colony of Nigeria with considerable care . " <p> Achebe 's novel A Man of the People which ended with a military coup was published on the cusp of the January 15 , 1966 military coup , " something Nigeria has never really recovered from . " Achebe was one of the last Easterners to flee from Lagos after first sending home his then young family of wife Christie , daughter Chinelo and son Ike . <p> Achebe reiterates his deposition in The Trouble with Nigeria " that Nigerians will probably achieve consensus on no other matter than their common resentment of the Igbo . " He delves into the pogroms against the Igbo , the July 29 , 1966 countercoup and the assassination of the Supreme Commander JTU Aguiyi-Ironsi . The failure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the end lead to the Civil War . There has been the argument that Biafra was not ready for the war , but one should not wait to be properly armed like the bully before fighting back for one 's life . Only a very poor student of history would not know that somebody like Fidel Castro , for example , did not wait to have as many weapons as Fulgencio Batista before confronting the evil regime in Cuba . Castro was captured and jailed after his first attack in 1953 , then he was betrayed and ambushed in 1956 only to fortunately flee from Cuba but he eventually succeeded in ousting Batista in 1959 . In South Africa , in circa 1961 , the African National Congress ( ANC ) decided to take up armed struggle to battle the gargantuan arsenal of the Apartheid goons , and here is what Nelson Mandela wrote in his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom : " I , who had never been a soldier , who had never fought in battle , who had never fired a gun at an enemy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be a daunting task for a veteran general much less a military novice . " Mandela and his comrades thus set up Umkhonto we Sizwe ( The Spear of the Nation ) . According to Mandela , " The symbol of the spear was chosen because with this simple weapon Africans had resisted the incursions of whites for centuries . " Mandela reminds us that the Communist Party in Cuba under Batista had felt that the appropriate conditions had not arrived to wage the war but " Castro did not wait , he acted -- and he triumphed . If you wait for textbook conditions , they will never occur . " <p> Achebe lived as a refugee in villages such as Ezinifite in Aguata local government . He sends up what he labels " the Triangle Game : the UK , France , and the United States " in the war effort . Achebe 's Enugu house was amongst the first places to be bombed in the Biafran enclave . The publishing house Citadel Press Achebe set up with his bosom friend , the iconic poet Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the leader of the January 15 , 1966 coup but Achebe had reservations about the writing which Ifeajuna 's colleague Chukwuma Nzeogwu dismissed as " Emma 's lies " . The killing of Okigbo put paid to the publishing dreams , but the duo had worked assiduously on the manuscript of How the Leopard Got Its Claws by Chinua Achebe and John Iroaganachi , with a poem " Lament of the Deer " by Christopher Okigbo . <p> Achebe 's role as the head of the team that wrote the Ahiara Declaration marks him out as a conscience of the new nation . He was a roving cultural ambassador in the course of the war . He does not flinch from delving into controversial issues such as the Asaba massacre , the Calabar massacre , the vexed issue of propaganda , the media war , refugees , world champion boxer Dick Tiger as a Biafran , Biafra 's taking of an oil rig in the so-called Kwale incident , the role of international writers , and of course the question of genocide . Once the former Nigerian president Zik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . In the end the Biafran leader Ojukwu had to flee to Cote d'Ivoire and thus " robbed Gowon of closure and complete satisfaction in victory . " Beyond the book , it is indeed remarkable that Gowon , like Ojukwu , needed a state pardon to make a re-entry into Nigeria . <p> All hell has since broken loose in the Nigerian media because Achebe quoted Awolowo 's argument that " All is fair in war , and starvation is one of the weapons of war " that eventually led to " eliminating over two million people , mainly members of future generations . " The slanging match is evenly matched between defenders of Awolowo and backers of Achebe alongside the well-worn ethnic Nigerian divide . It suffices to say that the national catharsis is well worth it . Achebe delivers what we used to label in primary school as " one blow , seven akpus " , to wit , delivering one punch to a person 's face that leaves the hapless fellow with seven bumps on the selfsame face . Achebe has this to say on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The Igbo were not and continue not to be reintegrated into Nigeria , one of the main reasons for the country 's continued backwardness . " <p> Achebe goes beyond the war to when the civilian regime of then President Olusegun Obasanjo took sides with criminals to kidnap the governor and burn down government buildings in his native Anambra State which made him to publicly reject the national honours awarded him . He tackles the issues of corruption and indiscipline , state failure and the rise of terrorism , state resuscitation and recovery . He sees Nelson Mandela as the shining example for every African and indeed all mankind at large ; incidentally Mandela has the highest regard for Achebe as " The writer in whose company the prison walls fell down . " This well-annotated book that is interspersed with poems has done the great duty of getting Nigerians reading again and actually debating , even as the Boko Haram critics are only interested uncouth abuses . <p> Irony is the great power of Achebe . Some may read the book , like the New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called Biafra without understanding that Nigeria is at bottom the purview . While Achebe celebrates his 82nd birthday as the eagle on top of the iroko tree it strikes me as very funny that some ants are on the ground scratching the bare sand in the name of doing battle as Boko Haram critics with his book There Was a Country . The fabrications , incoherencies , convolutions and circumlocutions of the bawdy band of Boko Haram criticism can only be summed up with the following words : " When in doubt , mumble . " <p> Achebe 's marriage of history and memoir in There Was a Country has raised a very high stake in the discourse of Nigeria . It is akin to a new birth for the country that must return to school , not unlike the birth of Achebe 's son Chidi who gave me this book , as limpidly limned in There Was a Country : " On May 24 , 1967 , in the midst of this chaos , my wife went into labor . I sent my close friend , the poet Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find out when the birth would take place , and then to call me at home , where I had briefly returned to rest and take a shower . In characteristic Okigbo fashion , he waited for the delivery , went to the nursery to see the baby , and then drove back to convey the news to me that my wife had delivered our third child , Chidi -- ' There is a God ' -- and that the way his baby locks were arranged , he looked like he had had a haircut and was ready to go to school !

What is hurting them is that we have put policies in place where they can no longer cheat the government and cause untold hardship to millions of Nigerians " , Mrs Diezani Alison-Madueke , Minister of Petroleum Resources , in PUNCH , Friday , November 9 , 2012 , p 13 . <p> Back in 1968 , as freshman in an American private university , I was encouraged by my academic adviser to take an elective course titled Psychology 1a . It was one of the greatest favours anyone ever did me . On my own , I later enrolled for Psychology 1b in the second semester . <p> From psychology one invariably learns about various human attributes ; especially about mental processes . Later , as a part-time worker , during the summer , at Belleview Hospital , New York City , I worked briefly in the psycho ward . There , I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> Even here in Nigeria , as a young man , I recollect that " Jesus of Oyingbo " started his ministry at Denton Street , Ebute Meta , Lagos Mainland . Delusions do n't come bigger than that . They come in different variants -- delusions of grandeur ( e.g the Giant of Africa ) , delusions of invincibility ( e.g Falcons will beat everybody silly ) , etc , etc . <p> Petroleum Minister , Diezani-Alison-Madueke <p> One type is delusion of innocence . Football lovers witness this in every match played . A player who had just hackd down an opponent and is about to be given a card throws his arms up as if wrongly accused by the referee . Ministers and other public figures , especially in Nigeria do it all the time . Since somebody died of " tummy tuck " abroad , no wife of an incumbent governor now goes abroad for medical attention . <p> They go to rest . And , when they return , a bevy of government appointed ladies will receive them at the airport thanking God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So , when I read that pronouncement by Mrs Alison-Madueke , it was clear we are witnessing another case of self-delusion of innocence . It invariably starts with two lies -- the first about self and , the second , about those who refuse to succumb to the first . Since I am one of the Minister 's critics in the media , let me expose the lie about many of us who remain her critics . <p> When she announced that " we have put policies in place where they can no longer cheat the government " , I know she is lying . Unlike her , I have never been involved in the oil sector in any form . She on the other hand had worked for one of the most indicted oil companies in the world . So how can the so-called policies hurt me ? <p> But , like most people imbued with delusion of innocence , she had convinced herself that she is the innocent party being unfairly victimized . Truth is , she was the Minister who told the Federal Executive Committee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed ; when there was actually over N1.3 trillion fraud to be recovered . <p> Thus , her self-proclaimed role of the protector of the Nigerian masses is false . She is the arch enemy . And she had been one of the oppressors since she worked for one of the International Oil Companies ; she was there when the atrocities against the people of Ogoni in particular and Nigerians in general were being perpetrated . I challenge her to deny that charge . <p> Cheating was a game invented by the IOCs ; and she knows it . Loading more crude than is declared to the Nigerian authorities is as old as when the first shipment left Oloibiri . It probably continues till today . One truly patriotic Nigerian , name withheld for obvious reasons ( these are vicious people ) , followed one shipment from Nigeria to its destination abroad and discovered a difference of about 25% ; more crude was delivered to the customer than was declared loaded in Nigeria . That was not the exception ; it was the rule when Mrs Diezani worked for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So , we have heard the Minister , but we are not convinced . In fact , she can go and tell those fairy tales to the marines . <p> NUHU RIBADU : SOME PEOPLE JUST NEVER LEARN -- 2 <p> " A man can not be too careful in the choice of his enemies " , Oscar Wilde , 1854-1900 . <p> Or for that matter in his choice of friends and associates . When Nuhu Ribadu accepted to serve on Mrs Alison-Madueke 's committee , he most certainly did so with different objectives in mind than those of the people who appointed him . According to the newspaper on Saturday , November I0 , 2012 , a presidential source was reported to have said , " The President had thought that Ribadu needed to be rehabilitated and that he was going to do away with his rascality " . That was the first cynical view of Ribadu 's selection by his new employers . <p> The source went further . " Do n't forget that he had no job at that time . The government had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we all know he had not been paid his entitlements . The little money he had , he had wasted on his presidential campaign " . So , there you have it . Government had offered Ribadu a bribe covertly and he was expected to engage in cover up . <p> In the first part of this series , I had made the following observation , " At NNPC and Ministry of Petroleum , everybody invited to " come and eat " is expected to come to the table , not with a spoon , but with a shovel . It is an establishment for gluttons not for whistle blowers " . Ribadu as an established whistle blower should have known he was in the wrong place and risking disgrace -- if not something worse . He might eventually lose his retirement entitlements . <p> Meanwhile Oronsaye 's ambush of Ribadu is easily understood . Fact is , it is impossible to rise to the top of the Nigerian Civil Service if , by your ethical conduct , you are eligible to be anointed a Cardinal or Chief Imam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity in a hole . Promotions to higher levels call for deeper holes . <p> By the time they reach the top , honour had disappeared from sight . No top civil servant will fail to exchange their designer apparels for prison-designed uniforms if all their criminal escapades were revealed . Ribadu should have expected the attack from those quarters . These are experienced warriors or saboteurs . <p> More to the point , Ribadu was na ? ve to imagine that the Federal government need a honest report ; which will be fully implemented . All they needed was a cover up or a collaborator . He was even more self-deluded to think he was receiving free food . He forgot that the only " free food " is found on mouse-traps . <p> Nuhu Ribadu , of course , now knows that his report is headed for the garbage can .

Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Police Staff College and the National Institute of Policy and Strategic Studies , NIPSS , did him no good .

In the private sector , we had different types of pension schemes depending on individual employers and their agreement with in-house unions where such existed . <p> However , with the enactment of the Pension Reform Act , 2004 ( PRA ) , the Federal Government arm of the public sector was the first to embrace contributory pension by January 1 , 2005 with the private sector joining six months after . The pension reform law made provision for the creation of a solid structure for the new pension scheme . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major achievements and challenges recorded by the scheme . <p> Building Structures The pension reform law made provision for the creation of a pension regulator in the country , National Pension Commission ( PenCom ) . The commission , which was created eight years ago had its pioneer Director-General , Mr. Muhammad Kabir Ahmad who has been in the saddle since then ; he has supervised the successes of the commission . <p> The commission , which was statutorily empowered to regulate the new sub-sector in the finance industry , started from the scratch by creating the much needed structures for the scheme to operate . <p> The commission licensed various operators in line with the PRA including Pension Fund Administrators ( PFAs ) , Closed Pension Fund Administrators ( CPFAs ) and Pension Fund Custodians ( PFCs ) . According to Ahmad , PenCom under his watch started an industry that never existed . <p> Speaking on the journey so far , he said , " when we started , we did n't have PenCom , we did n't have licensed operators and we did n't have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . PenCom has over 200 staff , we are opening zonal offices in the six geopolitical zones and hopefully we will complete this project this year . " <p> " We try to provide the best training to our staff because we believe that for us to succeed we must be able to attract and retain the best we can and given that we operate in the same industry with the CBN , Nigerian Stock Exchange ( NSE ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , the challenge for a very young institution like PenCom becomes obvious . We are trying our best and we are proud of our staff in terms of professionalism , competence and qualifications . However , over 180,000 employers of labour that joined the contributory pension scheme under Ahmad 's supervision with 5.3 million employees registered under the scheme . <p> " What we tried to do was to build an institution , not built around an individual but an institution that will survive each individual that participated in the building process . It is extremely difficult in the sense that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution is extremely difficult , " Ahmad said . <p> Licensing Operators When the industry started eight years ago , there was nothing like pension operators but today the story is different as according to Ahmad " in terms of operators , we have 18 PFAs , 4 Pension Fund Custodians ( PFCs ) and 7 Closed Pension Fund Administrators ( CPFAs ) . " Initially , about 27 PFAs were licensed but along the line , some had to give up their operational licenses , reducing the number to 23 . Also in the course of the just concluded recapitalisation programme , five other operators threw in the towel . Currently , there are 18 PFAs , 7 CPFAs and 4 PFCs . <p> Pension Assets The outgoing director-general also confirmed that 5.28 million Nigerians registered for the Contributory Pension Scheme ( CPS ) as at September 2012 , and these collectively pooled as much as N2.94 trillion in pension assets as at the same date . <p> Renaissance Capital in its report titled , " Thoughts from a Renaissance Man : Nigeria 's Pension Funds -- An Unsung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " from N265 billion and 1.4 per cent of country 's Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) in 2006 to N2.74 billion or almost 1 per cent of GDP " by mid-2012 , a N700 billion increase in the last 18 months . " The import of this according to the firm is that such schemes allow countries to become safe havens during global turbulence due to the size of the pension funds invested in local assets , in addition to enabling countries to be rated high by credit rating agencies because private pension funds are sufficient in size to fund a country 's debt . <p> Retirees and Pension Under contributory pension , the number of retirees drawing monthly pension has risen to 54,558 retirees from both public and private sectors under the scheme as at September 2012 . These have collectively received over N151.52 billion of their accumulated pension savings as lump sum and were receiving about N1.77 billion monthly as pension as at the same date . <p> Recapitalisation PenCom under Ahmad 's leadership concluded the first phase of the recapitalisation exercise in the industry , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18 . <p> Commenting on the exercise , the President of the Association of Pension Fund Operators ( PenOp ) , Mr. Dave Uduanu said : " We have 18 PFAs and we do not expect that number to reduce ... The recapitalisation was seamless , there is nothing to worry about , some PFAs were bought over by others and there were two PFAs that were adjudged not to have met the minimum capital and were not bought over by anybody ... Consolidation happens in phases , while some people were expecting 10 PFAs and others 15 PFAs ; people should note that the pension industry is a bit different from banking . I do not think we were expecting anything significantly lower just like other people . " <p> Uduanu also predicted that there would be merger and acquisitions over the next one or two years ; that would not be induced by regulation but by competition . People would decide that rather than being alone , they merge with one or two PFAs to make them bigger and stronger . <p> New Investment Options PenCom under Ahmad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not given opportunity to maximise returns on their accumulated savings because fund managers were not free to invest using their skills and experience to maximise returns on funds under management . <p> The commission has concluded arrangement to introduce four types of funds , such that pension contributors could determine the instruments in which accumulated retirement savings should be invested . " What we did was to create different buckets of funds so that for the younger contributors , they can be given the opportunity to invest in more floating instruments because in floating instruments , you earn higher returns , " Ahmad said . <p> Explaining how this would work , he said " we created Fund 1 , which is the Aggressive Fund . If you are not up to 40 years , you can ask you PFA to invest in Aggressive Fund . Now in that bucket , we said PFAs can invest up to 50 per cent of that fund in equities or rather in floating or variable instruments . <p> " Then we went to the next one , which is more of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes in then we moved to another one that is basically for somebody who is close to retirement . " Retirees can not afford to have their investments in floating because of the fluctuations in returns and they will not have time to accumulate or correct any possible fall in return , so substantial part of the fund will be invested in fixed income . <p> " But the fourth fund we are creating is called the ethical fund including sharia-compliant funds . There are people who will not want their contributions or savings to be invested in certain instruments or businesses , so we created an ethical fund which will be based on demand , " Ahmad explained . <p> Corporate Governance The regulator in the last eight years upheld corporate governance and ensured that the operators toed the same line but where they failed to do so , the operators were sanctioned and beaten back to line . " I tried to respect the wall which the law creates between regulator and operator . I will not come to you as a PFA and say place money with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I ask a PFA to invest in any bank , there must be a reason and therefore , the system will collapse completely . <p> So , corporate governance and transparency is an issue that we must continuously pursue because we must always remember that we are dealing with other people 's money . The worst thing you can do to a worker is that he has contributed for 30 years and you tell him that he ca n't get his money back , " Ahmad warned . <p> States and Local Governments The pioneer management of PenCom identified that the pension reform law was deficient in the area of compelling States and Local Governments to be part of the scheme ; it therefore employed moral suasion to get the buy-in of the second tier of government . In the last four years , many states are at various stages of implementing contributory pension scheme . 19 states have accepted the scheme but implementation has been very slow ; 16 others were at various stages of compliance with only two yet to make any effort at all , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration in the commission initiated moves to amend PRA , 2004 to reflect modern day development in the pension industry . <p> " We had a workshop jointly with the National Assembly two or three years ago and we also consulted . We are about to finalise the initial draft that would eventually be submitted to the National Assembly but there are some areas which we believe the review may at least look at . <p> Ahmad pointed out that some of the areas in the law that need fine tuning including the need for employers to open temporary retirement savings accounts and lodge deductions from employers ' salaries where they are yet to open a Retirement Savings Account ( RSA ) three months after starting work . <p> Another area according to him is the need to make pension savings tax free and making it mandatory for every employer to register its workers . " There is also the issue of contribution by the Federal Government . I think it should be made more mandatory , at least the accrued pension right so that in the event of default @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Ahmad said . <p> Challenges Reviewing his eight years supervision of the industry , the outgoing PenCom boss identified shortage of funds , public education and enlightenment as some of the major challenges the institution is facing . Managing the informal sector and bringing them under contributory pension is another serious challenge . <p> At the federal level , there is the challenge of funding accrued pension that we pointed out and there is also another challenge in terms of those retiring under the new scheme and that is one of the greatest challenge that we have . <p> Also , section 173 of the Nigerian constitution provides that any time the Federal Government increases salaries pension should be increases otherwise once in every five years and because it is constitutional provision . " I think the greatest challenge we have had is to consistently remind our policy makers on the need to be consistent , particularly on pension system relating to federal government employees . In implementing a reform , there are challenges and rather than abandoning a reform , there is need for you to identify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Going Forward Pointing the way forward , Ahmad harped on the need for publicity and creation of awareness . " Public education and enlightenment are something that we must continue to ensure that at least people understand . As an industry , we decided to focus on educating and enlightening Nigerians to have their buy-in , because we believe with buy-in , we will have voluntary compliance , " he said . <p> Summing up the activities of the pioneer management of the commission , the outgoing director-general said , " We came to implement a reform , basically , a social reform arising from a very controversial legislative process where various interest groups felt that they do n't need the scheme . But by the grace of God , without being immodest , we have been able to achieve what we did today by engaging all the stakeholders and by making sure that we carry our social partners along , " Ahmad said . <p> Please leave your comment below .

Olupona , scion of an Anglican priest , winner of Nigerian National Order of Merit Award ( NNOM ) , Professor of African Religious Tradition , African and African American Studies at Harvard University unveils the mysteries of Ile-Ife and the Yoruba history , cosmos and the deities in a new book CITY OF GODS : Ile-Ife in Time , Space and the Imagination , Thursday at NIIA , Lagos . We publish exclusive excerpts of this Yoruba book of identity . <p> THE PLACE MOST HALLOWED : THE SACRED CITY OF ILE-IFE ' In The Pivot of the Four Quarters , Wheatley indicates that no place in sub-Saharan Africa has such cosmic significance as the Yoruba city of Ile-Ife . Known as the City of 201 ( or 401 ) Gods , Ile-Ife is the base of the entire Yoruba civilization and culture , and its significance goes far beyond the immediate geographical and national boundaries of Nigeria . The religious culture of Ile-Ife has influenced the development and growth of new African religious movements as far off as Brazil , the Caribbean , and the United States . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is situated at the geographical centre of the Yoruba city-states . To the west lies Ibadan , the largest city in sub-Saharan Africa , and to the east lies Ondo , gateway to the eastern Yoruba city-states . Ile-Ife is about two hundred kilometres from Lagos , which was Nigeria 's coastal capital city for over a century . <p> Pre-eminent sacred place <p> Unlike the political , commercial , and administrative cities of Ibadan and Lagos , contemporary Ile-Ife is a ceremonial city par excellence ; like the cities of Banaras , Jerusalem , and Mecca , in the people 's imagination it is the preeminent sacred place , beyond the secular and profane . <p> I begin with Ile-Ife 's various sacred place names , because epithets vividly show the significance of sacred cities . Stephen Scully argues in his book Homer and the Sacred City that " human centers such as Troy are richly and complexly described through the epithets attached to them . " Citing an earlier study by Paolo Vivante , Scully contends that " city epithets , whenever they occur , bring out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These epithets serve " as a resource of power and a medium of signification in their own right . " They are " visual and concrete in nature , and thereby evocative of an essential and generic quality " of whatever they qualify . <p> Ile-Ife 's inhabitants have conferred numerous sacred Yoruba names on their city . It has been called Ife Oodaye , " The Expansive Space Where the World Was Created , " referring to the cosmogonic myth asserting that ritual creation occurred in this very place , and as Ibi Oju Ti Mo Wa ( Where the Day Dawns ) . In Yoruba creation myth , Ile-Ife is conceived of as the place where the sun rises and sets , the center of origin of the universe . Ile-Ife is also called Ife Ooye , the place of survival or the city of life , because , like Noah 's ark , it was a place of refuge from a primordial deluge that destroyed earlier settlements and left survivors to establish a new era . Various oral sources refer to Ile-Ife as the place where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with humans on earth . <p> Though Ile-Ife is the city of the source of life , it is , paradoxically , also the city of the dead . The Yoruba believe that those who die immediately return to Ile-Ife , the starting point for their pilgrimage to the other world . Several years ago , I was in my own hometown , Ute , in Owo District , a town located at the extreme eastern end of the eastern Yoruba territory , to conduct research on death in Yoruba thought . In an important song sung in the Owo tradition during the burial , the deceased is enjoined to " go on the straight road that leads to Ile-Ife and not stray by the wayside " ( Onayo r'ufe ma ya o ) . Ile-Ife is regarded as the only stopping place before the dead pass into the underworld , so the rite of passage must ensure that the deceased not tarry on the way to the ancient city . In ancient times , it was the practice of those who had lost a loved one to travel to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and learn from him or her about the cause of the death so that they could avenge a wrongful death or hear about unfinished business on earth that the deceased wanted living relatives to see completed if possible . <p> Ile-Ife attained primacy on the basis of its hallowed status as the source for all the crowned cities ( ilu-alade ) . An important Yoruba myth refers to the dispersal of Oduduwa 's sixteen royal children , who went out from Ile-Ife to found new kingdoms . <p> Each was assigned a sacred crown , or ade , a symbol of authority . ( In 1903 the colonial administration determined that the Ooni of Ife was the most qualified to say who ought to own and wear this crown . ) Each was assigned a sacred sword representing the divine power to take possession of new territories . Stories of the origin of several Yoruba kingdoms are filled with anecdotes about the royal princes ' and princesses ' encounters as they conquered aboriginal groups in their newfound lands and ruled with the sacred insignia of office : the crown and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities the Ife cosmovision serves as a model for other lesser but equally significant sacred centers in the Yoruba world . A case in point is Idanre , an important city in the eastern Yoruba region of Ondo State , Nigeria , where I have also carried out field research . Idanre 's inhabitants lived for a long time on an isolated mountain , Oke-Idanre , and they have always maintained a connection with Ile-Ife . The ancient name for the present-day city of Idanre was Ufeke ( Ife on the Mountain ) . Legends of Idanre migration argue that their founders , Olofin and his followers , were immigrants from the ancient city of Ile-Ife . The founders claimed that they possessed the ancient crown of Oduduwa and other royal garments . They hid on a mountain , where they were constantly assailed by other Yoruba groups who wanted to seize these royal treasures . <p> Ooni with the sacred crown . <p> Renewal of kingship <p> During the annual Iden , or King 's Festival , the Owa of Idanre dons the ancient crown of Olofin ( also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putting on the ancient crown signifies renewal of his kingship and celebrates his valor and military strength in conquering all intruders who pursued the Idanre to steal his crown . Indeed , Idanre is one of the most revered cities of southwestern Nigeria . Its inhabitants are particularly famous for their control over and use of traditional medicine and the spoken word ( ohun ) , the magical or sacred formulas to make things happen . The Iden Festival that bears the signature of Idanre sacred kingship is similar to the Olojo Festival in Ile-Ife , the festival of sacred kingship and of Ogun , the god of war , in which the Ooni wears his own sacred are crown . Thus the legend signifies that the lie cosmovision is duplicated by other Yoruba cities whose inhabitants share in Ile-Ife 's sacred myth and history . <p> SYMBOLIC CITY STRUCTURE The structural organization of Ile-Ife and its special religious , political , and spatial form symbolize the sacred cosmology behind the city 's origins . The most important section is the center , the Ooni 's palace , or aafin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , located on an elevated site , and the five principal quarters that constitute the old city of Ile Ife radiate out from it . Three major roads leading from these sections converge in front of the palace at an intersection called Enu Owa , <p> literally , " Mouth of the King . " They function as an orita ( crossroads ) , an imporant phenomenon in Yoruba religious life . Orita are not mere crossroads ; they are " ritually potent spaces where sacrifices may be offered to spirits or evil forces ( alajo ogun ) and messages maybe conveyed to witches , wizards , and spirits of the underworld or heaven . The royal palace is protected by the city 's concentric layout around its center . As one moves from outermost to innermost circles , degrees of power and sacredness increase . Located close to the palace are the sacred precincts that cradle the three most important ritual centers in the city , the grove , the shrine , and the temple . <p> The grove belongs to Oduduwa , cultural hero and founder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ogun , warrior god , patron deity of the sacred kingship ; and Oke Itase , Ifa hill and temple , is the abode of Araba Agbaye , chief diviner of the universe . Sacred sites of Yoruba cities are determined by the divination process . Each principal city underwent a divination ritual to determine the best site for its origin and growth ( odu ti o te llu do ) . When I asked one of my consultants to name the odu ( chapter of the corpus of oral texts on divination ) on which Ile-Ife was founded , he exclaimed in surprise , saying that all sixteen principal odu talked about the city 's origin , an indication that this city was greater than any other city in Yoruba territory . <p> SACRED SPACE AND SOCIAL ORDER : IDENTITY , NATIONALISM , AND PLACE I turn now to the significance of place for nationalism and identity construction in contemporary Yoruba society . One lacuna in the history of religions is the general lack of in-depth analysis of the relationship between religious phenomena and the social order within which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context of religion at the expense of the phenomenon itself has encouraged many to avoid exploring the possible social consequences of religious behaviour . If historians of religions were to take more seriously Peter Berger 's suggestion for analyzing religious phenomena , that we should view religion in terms of its origin , functions , and intrinsic and substantive value , we would produce a more rounded interpretation of religion that did not privilege one aspect at the expense of the others . <p> Political dynamics Recently , Roger Friedland and Richard Hecht have contended that there is a strong connection " between the construction of sacred space and the social organization of power " and that " ultimately , an adequate theory of sacred places must take cognizance of the political dynamics that play a key role in how it is appreciated , controlled , interpreted , and contested . " According to these two authors , " Because they undergird identities and ethical commitments , because they galvanize the deepest emotions and attachments , material and symbolic control over the most central sacred places are sources of enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how this social power shapes notions of identity , nationalism , and place . <p> I will examine the role of the Ile-Ife homeland and territorially in the construction of ethnic nationalism , patriotism , and community identity among the Yoruba . By nationalism , I refer not to the contemporary nation-state context ( Nigeria ) but to the Yoruba nation as a cultural group with a homeland , a language , a religion , and a shared culture . <p> Three related themes should be considered as a template for understanding how sacred cities function in the context of modern nationalism . First , Ile-Ife , as a hallowed land of religious and cultural traditions , was used to mobilize the Yoruba as a unified patriotic and nationalist group . Second , symbols of sacred place were used in the development of a homeland of subcultural identities and to galvanize the Yoruba community into a patriotic and national group . Third , the Yoruba mark their boundaries of sacred space in what have been called rituals of " hallowing the land . " <p> The study of sacred places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yoruba identity and the role the Yoruba religion plays in modern Nigerian politics . Why are the ethnicity and ethnic identity of forty million Yoruba people so strong that their cultural and political lives are difficult for outsiders to penetrate ? <p> Part of the answer lies in the role of place , and particularly the role of Ile-Ife as a centralized sacred place , in " creating a religious , communal , and political identity " and mobilizing people politically . A second relevant issue , borrowed from Kunin 's argument , is that a centralized model of sacred place not only constructs identities but also creates boundaries that establish the relationship of " insiders " and " outsiders " to the sacred center . <p> The Yoruba origin myth discussed above is normally followed by another equally powerful myth : that of the dispersion , migration , and odyssey of the children of Oduduwa , who left the sacred city of Ile-Ife to conquer , inhabit , and establish new dynasties and new cities and towns . With this odyssey , new city-states similar to Ile-Ife , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ketu , and Oyo , were created . In the context of space and land , the migration myth from Ile-Ife " provides for a plan of cosmological relatedness . " ' <p> The Yoruba historian Adeagbo Akinjogbin describes this relationship between the Ile-Ife center and the new city-states as one based on ebi ( lineage ) ideology : semiautonomous kinship groups with defined territorial boundaries are joined in a sacred pact . The sociologist Akinsola Akiwowo has described their alliance as being based on what the Yoruba call ajobi ( principles of kinship and religious association ) . Though Ile-Ife provides a unifying myth , an equal element of decentralization of sacred space is evident in Yoruba mythology . Multiplicity of sacred space does not negate our thesis of a centralized sacred space . <p> The significance of Ile-Ife in Yoruba political life is especially revealed by two incidents : the visit of the Ooni , paramount ruler of Ile-Ife , to Lagos in 1903 ; and the formation , in the 1940s and 1950s , of a centralized pan-Yoruba cultural and quasi-political association based on the Oduduwa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oduduwa ) and its political successor , the Action Group Party . <p> The unprecedented visit of an Ooni to Lagos was chilling to all the other Yoruba Oba , including the Alaafin of Oyo . Before this visit , it had been taboo for an Ooni to leave the city of lle-lfe . The other Yoruba Oba viewed the announcement of his journey with such great alarm and seriousness that they decided to vacate their palaces and stay outside their city for the duration of his visit until they could con firm his safe return . Although the Ooni 's visit can be interpreted as a sign of the capitulation of the traditional center and society of Ile-Ife to the new colonial center in Lagos , the visit also signaled a reinvention of tradition . <p> Under the British system of indirect rule , the colonial government had created a new city legislative council in charge of the affairs of the new region . In 1903 , a dispute between two Yoruba rulers , the Elepe of Epe in Ijebu Remo and the Akarigbo of Ijebu Remo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Akarigbo protested the Elepe 's wearing a beaded crown , which by tradition could be worn only by an Oba claiming direct descent from Oduduwa , who had been authorized to wear the crown by the Ooni of Ile-Ife . <p> The reigning Ooni was Adelekan Olubuse I , the grandfather of the incumbent Ooni . At the suggestion of council members , the Ooni was invited to Lagos in February 1903 to rule on the matter . <p> Hidden behind a screen ( since it was forbidden to behold the face of the Ooni ) , the Ooni answered all the questions the council put to him . He denounced the Elepe , lamenting that if it were the old days , the Ooni would have summoned the Elepe to lle-Ife and had him beheaded . <p> What happened between the Ooni and the British governor after the meeting must be the subject of another work .

" The seafaring Portuguese , the first Europeans to explore the coast of West Africa , arrived in the fifteenth century . Although they had heard much about the city of Ile-Ife , their inability to access interior forested regions made contact very difficult . However , the Portuguese recorded their impressions of the importance of this ancient city , especially of its artistic and historical relationship and connection to the kingdom of Benin , with which the Portuguese had earlier contact . <p> Writing in his navigational guidebook Esmeraldo de Situ Orbis , the well-known Portuguese explorer Duarte Pacheco Pereira noted that to the east of the Benin Kingdom , about one hundred leagues ( four hundred miles ) inland , was a country with a king named Licasaguou , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great power . Close by , Pereira explained , another great lord , Hooguanee , " is considered among the Negroes as the Pope is among us . " Although the identity of the first king , Licasaguou , remains unknown , the " Pope of the Negroes " may refer to the Ooni of Ile-Ife , since the neighbouring Benin people commonly referred to this king as Hooguanee ( Ogene ) . Some of the earliest written records about Ile- Ife come from the Portuguese seafarers who traded with the Benin Kingdom . One such record was Da Asia , by Joao de Barros , which provided a detailed discussion of the political and ritual kinshiIp of Benin and Ile-Ife in the precolonial period . <p> According to this interesting account , the king of Portugal , Don Joao , learned from the ambassador of the king of Beny ( Benin ) and also from Joa Alfonso d'Aveiro that to the east of the Benin Kingdom , about a twenty moons ' journey ( about 250 leagues ) , " there lived the most powerful monarch of these parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Beny Benin , he was held in as great veneration as is the Supreme Pontiff with us . " The informant also described a ritual link between Benin and Ile-Ife . In compliance with an ancient tradition , whenever a new king ascended the throne of Benin , the Benin sent ambassadors to the monarch to the east with many gifts to inform him that the new king of Benin had succeeded his deceased father and to request confirmation of his new status . <p> As a sign of consent , Prince Ogene sent the new Benin king a " staff and a headpiece of shining brass , fashioned like a Spanish helmet in place of crown and scepter : He sent a brass cross to be worn around the neck , " a holy and religious emblem similar to that worn by the commendadores as of the Order of Saint John . " for , " without these emblems , the people do not recognize him as the lawful ruler , nor can he call himself truly king . " De Barros reported that the ambassadors from Benin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secluded behind a " curtain of silk . " <p> However , to authenticate the mission , just before the ambassadors departed from Ile-Ife , the king showed " a foot behind the curtains , " indicating that he agreed to Benin 's request . The ambassadors were bestowed with gifts as compensation for the great journey to Ile-Ife . The gift to each ambassador consisted of a " small cross similar to that sent to the king , which is thrown round his neck to signify that he is free and exempt from all servitudes and is privileged in his native country , as the Commendadores are with us . " <p> The Ifa Temple on the Oke Itase , the sacred hill of Ifa <p> This is one of the most detailed descriptions we have of Benin 's connection with Ile-Ife , illustrating the perception of Ile-Ife and the sacred kingship in Benin . There have been several discussions about the historicity of this passage , especially regarding the authenticity of the Benin ambassadors and the gift of the cross . The passage supports the account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Oranmiyan ( also named Oranyan ) , the son of Oduduwa , in the establishment of Benin 's modern rule . It also establishes the ritual relationship between the two kingdoms in rites of coronation and burial . Although some traditional rituals have been modified or have disappeared in the contemporary Nigerian state , the coronation ceremony performed today for the Oba of Benin , whereby the Ooni of Ile-Ife sends a traditional gift to the new Oba , confirms the ancient connection between the two kingdoms described in the Portuguese sources . Moreover , archaeological investigation in Ile-Ife reveals an ancient burial ground , called Orun Oba Ado ( literally , " the heaven of Benin kings " ) that holds only certain parts of the dead bodies of kings brought from Benin . Some scholars suggest that the Ile-Ife burial site reserved for the Benin kings shows their ancestral connection with the city of Ile-Ife . <p> Because rituals are constantly reinvented in response to the contemporary social and political contexts in which they are performed , such customs often disappear gradually from practice . In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie in whether it is absolutely true . Even if it occurred only in the realm of the imagination , without the archaeological and ritual evidence that lends it credence , the story would still enable us to comprehend the enigma that lies behind Ile-Ife 's preeminence in the fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Portuguese accounts of explorations in the land of the " Negroes . " I will return to these sources later in the chapter . <p> ILE-IFE IN THE ANNALS OF WESTERN EXPLORATION : A LEO FROBENIUS REVISITED Ile-Ife 's preeminent status is based on archaeological and iconographic evidence that confirms its significance as a ceremonial center in cosmological , mythical , and ritual contexts . The best-known European visitor to Ile-Ife was Leo Frobenius ( 1873-1973 ) , a German ethnologist and researcher who visited the city between 1910 and 1912 . Frobenius was the head of the German Inner African Exploration . At the time of his visit , the city 's population was over twenty-five thousand . His contribution to the West 's knowledge of Ile-Ife and of Africa in general was so significant that President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the centenary of Frobenius 's birth : " No one did more than Frobenius to reveal Africa to the world and the Africans to themselves . " An essential part of this " revelation " consisted of the ancient Ife bronzes and terra-cotta pieces that Frobenius brought to the attention of the world . In spite of Senghor 's warm comments , Frobenius 's pioneering works are little read and appreciated . <p> Frobenius ' Eurocentric views Why has Frobenius not achieved a status similar to that of William Bascom , the American anthropologist who worked thirty years in Ile-Ife after Leo Frobenius ? The answer lies in Frobenius 's Eurocentric views and his racist remarks about the Ile-Ife people throughout his sojourn there . Frobenius was convinced of the superiority of the German race over other European groups in Africa , especially the British , and he frequently referred to German thoroughness , which for him far surpassed that of the British , as exemplified in their colonizing efforts in Ile-Ife . Frobenius 's goal was to discover artifacts more genuine in form and style than the " inferior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was both amazed by and envious of the British looting of Benin artifacts during the so-called punitive expedition against the Oba of Benin Kingdom in 1885 . He reasoned that since Ile-Ife was older than Benin and , indeed , gave birth to Benin , the art objects " from Benin were nothing but the products of degenerate times , mere imitations of an older , more genuine and sincere art . " <p> This was a point of contention that caused the British to work against the success of his mission . Frobenius 's ideas and theories represented the best in the European imagination of the African people during this period . Having read or heard of Ile-Ife in Europe , he concluded that it must be " the lost city of Atlantis " in black Africa , where remnants of the Greek culture that worshipped Poseidon lived . When Frobenius first saw two pieces of reddish-brown terra-cotta pottery in the sacred shrine of Olokun , he observed : " Here were the remains of a very ancient and fine type of art , infinitely nobler than the comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relics were eloquent of a symmetry , a vitality , a delicacy of form directly reminiscent of ancient Greece and a proof that , once upon a time , a race , far superior in strain to the Negro , had been settled here . " Frobenius acquired many terra-cotta heads , including the famous Olokun sculpture . He was convinced that the religion and culture of the ancient Greeks had been extensively disseminated , reaching even to Ile-Ife , and that the " Yoruba religion was not unique to the African people , that it is definitely linked to the perfected system of a primeval age . " <p> The high chiefs in the courtyard of the palace preparing for the Olojo festival <p> ILE IFE AND THE ANCIENT KINGDOM OF BENIN Ile-Ife gains further credibility as a sacred center because of its connection with the ancient kingdom of Benin . According to the Benin historian Jacob U. Egharevba , following a series of unsettled crises in Benin , the Owodo , the last of the Ogiso kings of the first dynasty , was deposed . The Edo ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , asking for a " wise prince " who would reign over them . Oduduwa , the Oba of Ife at that time , decided to test the sincerity and endurance of the Edo ( Benin ) . <p> In response to their request , he sent lice to the chiefs of Benin with instructions that they were to care for the lice and return them to him after three years . The Benin chiefs took great care of these lice and returned them after three years to the Oba of Ife , who was impressed . Convinced that people who could , without question , take care of such minute pests as lice , could undoubtedly take good care of his son , he sent the Ife prince Oranmiyan , accompanied by palace servants , courtiers , and a native medicine man ( ogiefa ) . <p> Oranmiyan and his entourage reached Benin after ' an arduous journey that included a hazardous crossing of the Obie River . Upon his arrival in Benin , Oranmiyan met with resistance from one Ogiamwen , the son of Evinan , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after the termination of the first dynasty . Oranmiyan triumphed over Ogiamwen , settled in Usama Palace , which had been built by the Benin chiefs , and married a woman named Erinmwinde , with whom he had a son . After a few years , he grew tired of Benin and the many crises with which he had to contend there . He called an assembly of the Benin people and relinquished the throne , after naming the city Ile-lbinu , " the land of anger ; " from which Benin , the current name of the city , comes . He decreed that only someone born and brought up in Benin and properly schooled in its traditions and mysteries should be its king . Oranmiyan then installed his son Eweka as king in his stead and returned to Ile-Ife , his own native place , leaving the palace chiefs and medicine people to take care of the new king . On his way back to Ile-Ife , Oranmiyan stopped in Ugba ( Okha ) and Obboh , for three and two years , respectively , to ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile-Ife . Eweka was crowned at Usama , his father 's palace . When Eweka died , his remains were returned to Ile- Ife for burial . This tradition , in which " the remains of the Oba of Benin were taken to Ile-Ife in every third reign , " was continued until very recently . <p> I am not concerned here with the historicity of the story or with its claim to truth . Rather , I regard it as an origin myth believed to be true by those who hold onto it as a part of their tradition . The story establishes the sacred origin of Benin kingship , projecting it as an extension of the Ife sacred kingship that was certainly in existence long before this period . It establishes a kinship relationship between the Ife and Benin kingdoms , although Benin later took on a more radical form of sacred kingship than that which exists in Ile-Ife . Benin became an absolute monarchy , with the first son of the reigning Oba named as the heir apparent , whereas in Ile-Ife the kingship rotates among four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reigning king does not succeed his father and there is a strong system of checks and balances on the power of the reigning king . <p> Oranmiyan 's role is an important one in this story , especially in the spread of religious ideas and political values , presumably from Ile-Ife to Benin . Several traditions concerning Qranmiyan exist in Ile-Ife . One tradition refers to him as the son of Oduduwa , which is consistent with the Benin story . Another tradition refers to him as a great Ife warrior who left his mark permanently on the Ife landscape in the mystery of the Staff of Oranmiyan ( Oba Oranmiyan ) , a stone staff with iron marks that has become a tourist attraction , if not a pilgrimage site , in Ile-Ife . <p> Several other traditions support this warrior ethos and connection , and Oranmiyan features prominently in the annual ritual of Ogun , also known as Olojo ( the festival and ritual of kingship ) . Ogun , the Yoruba warrior god and god of iron , is equally important in Benin society and cosmology and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Yoruba people in general . <p> The tradition of returning the body of the Benin Oba to Ile- Ife for interment symbolizes the return of the " stranger king " to his autochthonous place for burial , in keeping with the Yoruba and Benin tradition of burying kings and commoners in their ancestral place of origin . Why did Oranmiyan call the city Ile Ibinu , the " land of anger , " which then became Benin 's permanent name ? Part of Benin 's continuing enigma is that the city 's secret can not be unfolded , especially by outsiders , a dilemma that caused Oranmiyim ( an outsider ) to vacate the throne and replace himself with a son born of a Benin woman ( an insider ) . The inherent tension in the " insider-outsider " conflict remains part of Benin 's identity today . <p> Three other significant cultural factors are alluded to in the Oranmiyan story : the mystical power of the Benin king ; the importance of magic and medicine in sustaining the king 's power ; and the burden of preserving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure the survival and well-being of Benin society . The story places the burden of preserving kingship on the community . <p> According to Egharevba , Oranmiyan was not sent until Oduduwa had confirmed that the Benin people would take good care of their king and the institution of kingship . Those who had demonstrated their ability to preserve lice would certainly guard very jealously the institution of sacred kingship , an equally delicate and onerous task , to which the Benin have devoted their full resources up to the modern era . The institution of kingship needed to be guarded by powerful medicine and magical rituals . Oduduwa sent with Oranmiyan a medicine man to make potent magic for the suste- nance of the king . This tradition remains part of the royal cult of Benin mysticism ; indeed , more than any other kingship system in Nigeria , Benin rituals , arts , and ideology of kingship demonstrate the importance of sacred power for the preservation of kingship . <p> Despite revisionist theories , especially in the last ten years , aimed at disconnecting the linkages between Benin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the above story supports the origin of Benin kingship in Ife tradition . As Kees Bolle points out , the central issue in myth is not " what is true " in the story but " What have societies , civilizations , communities found necessary to point to and preserve as centrally valued for their entire existence ? " The story thus permanently establishes the sacredness and significance of IIe-Ife as an important ceremonial center and as an ancestral city to an equally powerful kingdom that lies to its east . <p> Tomorrow <p> Evangelical offensive <p> Members of the new Christian movements are targeting the sacred authority of the Ooni , and Ile -Ife civil religion more generally , because they realize that debunking the the legitimacy of the sacred canopy -- the guardianship of religious pluralism- will make it possible to destroy all indigenous non-Christian Yoruba tradition .

@@1822240 <h> Godswill Akpabio at 50 : A Golden Story of God 's Will <p> By Jackson Udom Everyone has a story but not every story can touch hearts and move men . Mr. Obot 's story , however , is a different kernel ; his story touches the hearts and arouses strong passion . He was a local boy but he did not remain so , he weathered life 's storms to become a city man -- nay a city builder . His father died when he was an infant , he was fatherless but put all the struggles that come with that behind him to become a father-nay a father of many . <p> Obot was born on this day , though 50 years ago but he has birthed many dreams and aspirations that surpass that number . You know who is Obot , do n't you ? He is the governor of Akwa Abasi Ibom State , His Excellency Chief Godswill Akpabio to us but to the late Chief Obot Akpabio and Madam Lucy Akpabio of Ukana Ikot Ntuen in Essien Udim Local Government Area of Akwa Ibom State , he was God 's will . And by and large , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will being done in the lives of many and the entire Akwa Ibom State and Nigeria . <p> Though the plot of the golden story started decades ago , with little Godswill 's attendance of the Methodist Primary School , Ukana and Federal Government College , Port Harcourt for his primary and secondary education , it started getting thicker and intriguing with his early fulfillment of his name , Godwill . The Yoruba people of the South-west would say that a child that would be great would show the inkling of greatness at a tender age , this young Akpabio did when he was appointed General Senior Prefect in secondary school and later Speaker of the Students ' Parliament in his days at the University of Port Harcourt where he read Law . <p> The plot got thicker when as the Chief Executive Officer of EMIS Telecoms Limited ; he was appointed a commissioner in Akwa Ibom State in 2002 . As a Commissioner for Petroleum and Mineral Resources , Akpabio showed flashes of his efficient leadership and excellent administrative capability but those were just flashes that would have him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to learn what has today stand him out of the 36 state governors in the country , he was deployed to the Ministries of Local Government and Chieftaincy Affairs and Land and Housing . <p> Do n't forget the name of our character , Godswill , the fulfillment to that name manifested again when the dynamic commissioner of three ministries in five years learnt his lines and unlike many , had the stage to perform his act . In 2007 , Akpabio became the standard bearer of the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) and later went ahead to win the gubernatorial election on April 14 , 2007 . That was the beginning of a new version of history for Akwa Ibom State and for Godswill Akpabio who was living up to his name ; he is God 's will to the world in many regards . <p> " Before I formed you in the womb I knew and approved of you as my chosen instrument , and before you were born I separated and set you apart , consecrating you ... , " seemed to be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directed at Jeremiah in the Bible . Governor Akpabio became God 's battle axe like Jeremiah , to break down the walls of illiteracy , servitude , backwardness and underdevelopment which had become synonymous with the state . And in five years , the governor has carved a niche for himself among the past leaders of the state as the most outstanding and unforgettable but that is not where the story ends -- it is not doubtable that he would rank second to none if the performances of all the governors in the country were to be compared . <p> Without the fear of immodesty , Chief Akpabio 's story in leadership is one of daring to be different ; it is a story of compassion and service ; a story of visionary and exemplary leadership ; and a story of transformation -- in fact , the latter is the whole essence of Akpabio 's leadership in Akwa Ibom and he has done so much to live up to that billing , so more so he is called a Transformation Governor and a Promise Keeper . These , more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a golden story better told today , his golden jubilee on earth . It 's 50 years of Godswill but he has scored way beyond 50 in performance . <p> In five years , the governor has demonstrated foresight by taking care of the future of thousands of children and families through his free compulsory education from primary to secondary schools ; he also showed foresight in building the first underground erosion control system , long before the floods which ravaged many states in the country came . As a former actor in the telecoms world , Governor Akpabio was digital-aware , he saw far into the future on how soft and virtual books are taking over in the world of information and education and to demonstrate that , he built a first-of-its-kind digital library in Uyo . Time may not permit the attempt to chronicle the innumerable projects which he has completed to demonstrate his visionary leadership in the state . As an agent of change a game-changer , Akpabio turned Akwa Ibom to a new land where infrastructural development took the centre stage , when other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Akpabio took over and his people are the best for that decision . From the Ibom International Airport to the Ibom Tropicana , different stories of transformation have been etched on the sands of time . <p> Unlike the earliest school of thought in development , which placed premium on physical infrastructure , Governor Akpabio 's approach to the development of Akwa Ibom State has been a robust mix of physical and human development , with the latter receiving significant attention through women and youth empowerment programmes . The Integrated Farmers Scheme where farmers , especially youths are encouraged through loan systems and the Women Agro-Enterpreneurship Programme ( WAEDEP ) which has trained and empowered thousands of women are proofs of Akpabio 's human development efforts . Of a truth , the story can not finish , for the man has not stopped the good works in Akwa Ibom which rubbished mathematical understanding , making five greater than 20 , as Akpabio 's five years have trashed the first 20 years of Akwa Ibom in terms of achievement . But today , the story reaches another high point , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making a golden story of performance more glamorous . Today , as the leader of the Transformation Team and Architect of New Akwa Ibom clocks 50 , countless people have had a reason to smile because of his life . His performance and lifestyle are no doubt deserving of gold , he truly is a golden governor and today can not be less-important because a golden fish can not have a hiding place. * Udom is Special Assistant , Media to AkwaIbom State Governor Akpabio . <p> Please leave your comment below .
