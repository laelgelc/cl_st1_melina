@@4551237 <h> ' Govt promoting LPG to counter petrol prices , gas shortage ' <p> The government has braved itself to meet the dual challenge of the increasing cost of fuel and the looming energy crisis through promotion of liquid propane gas ( LPG ) , which is not only cheaper than petrol , but is also a viable substitute for compressed natural gas ( CNG ) , said Federal Petroleum &amp; Natural Resources Minister Dr Asim Hussain . Addressing the inaugural ceremony of the country 's first autologous LPG station , the minister said that the strategy would also reduce the exceptionally high reliance of the domestic , industrial , transport and power generation sectors on the fast diminishing natural gas resources of the country . He said that a study conducted by the Sui Southern Gas Company has established that LPG would cost consumers Rs 73 per litre against Rs 103 for petrol and Rs 70 per kg for CNG . " Average per km cost for these three fuel options would be Rs 9.40 for petrol , Rs 6 for LPG and Rs 5 for CNG , " he added . In terms of velocity , he said that it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9kg for CNG with a petrol-run car covering a distance of 464km , LPG 600km and CNG 135km . " This is besides the fact that carbon content of LPG is far below as compared to petrol or motor spirit , " said the minister . He said that the government 's energy policy has been developed after careful thinking and on the basis of which , the major focus has been on reshuffling the current energy mix of the country with 55 percent burden on gas currently . He also said that the present government 's approach is absolutely different from those adopted by the previous governments that ignored the depletion of natural gas while formulating their energy policies . " Usage of this precious commodity had risen to 8bcf , while its production was a mere 4.3bcf , " he said , regretting that the previous governments not only ignored the harsh facts , but the work on alternative sources of energy was also slow-paced . Hussain said that the present government had assumed power in a period when economic meltdown had turned into a global phenomenon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite this , the Pakistani government has substantially subsidised price of gas for domestic users , he said , mentioning that the government procured gas at a rate of $6 , but provided it at $2 to the lifeline consumers . This , he said , could not be managed in context of oil and petrol ( crude oil ) due to international structuralisation . The minister said that the Rs 14 charged under the head of general sales tax ( GST ) on every single litre of petrol could be slashed by the provincial governments that presently collect 70 percent of the GST share . He said that the government is keen to promote LPG on strong lines and expects that CNG stations ' owners and other stakeholders would opt for a conversion option that would be supplemented by government efforts to reduce rebate and other taxes on import of essential gadgets like pumps for LPG application .

@@4557234 <h> Email <p> BOTH in politics and in the media , language used regarding female colleagues has in recent days betrayed a shocking lack of gender sensitivity . MPA Sheikh Allauddin 's tirade in the Punjab Assembly on Wednesday against some women members focused not on the quality of their arguments , but on their gender . They were lumped together and criticised not for their political points of view , but essentially for being women of what he considers objectionable character . The implication is depressing : simply by venturing outside the home to participate in the public sphere , Pakistani women open themselves up to allegations of not being ' respectable ' . And voiced by an elected official , this point of view will only reinforce some of our society 's worst stereotypes . But a mindset that singles women out on the basis of their gender is not limited to the political sphere . In one television talk show that aired after the Malik Riaz interview scandal , an anchor argued that Mehr Bokhari , co-host on that programme , was given the professional opportunities she has had because channels want to hire pretty faces . Regardless of any questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve to be evaluated on the basis of her appearance . This is a deeply sexist point of view -- when was the last time someone claimed a male journalist was hired for being good-looking ? The work any woman does deserves to be judged on its merit , or lack thereof , and not by any other factor that would not be applied to her male colleagues . <p> Even more unfortunate is the fact that some women have internalised these stereotypes . Take , for example , women MNAs throwing glass bangles at the finance minister last year as a form of insult , or the war of words between two women MPAs from the Sindh Assembly in which one thought it would be amusing to accuse the other of trying to assert herself by wearing more make-up than others .

For example , the Shia population of Iraq , though more populous in numbers , was reduced to minority status during the time of Saddam Hussein . The Jewish population , though small in number in the United States , has rarely called itself a minority .

The ten reserved seats for minority parliamentarians and the sixty reserved seats for female parliamentarians , along with other quota system in various institutions , corroborate the assertion that both women and non-Muslim population of Pakistan are a minority . The constitution deems them to be equal , but the government of Pakistan , by allocating the reserved seats , implicitly admits that both the women and non-Muslim minorities are unequal , less privileged , deprived , and oppressed . <p> Let us look at the selection system for reserved seats in our parliament .

The proportion of each party ? s win determines each party ? s share in the privilege of selecting the women and religious minority members to the remaining 70 seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> 1 . Subservient Parliamentarians : Parliamentarians on reserved seats have their loyalties to the nominating political parties and not to the voters , because voters never participate in their election process .

With extenuated vote power , both the women and religious minority parliamentarians are there to obey the ? master ? s voice , ? that is , the dominant political parties . <p> 2 . Blackmailing and other corrupt practices are the norm . The highest bidder may get the seat , the seat may be given to a relative or friend as pay off for a favor , or , more forebodingly , some women ensure their seats by becoming mistresses or girlfriends to the stake holders .

This ? constitutional flip ? should have raised a red flag for ? suo moto action ? by the Chief Justice of Pakistan . <p> 4 .

I believe that this number 20 , coinciding with the 20 percent of Pakistan ? s parliament that can be termed ? free-loaders ? is not coming to us by chance . <p> I understand that PAC believes in strong democratic institutions , holds its elections every 2 years , and chooses its 3 vice presidents out of many candidates .

A competent official who upholds the public trust can only be procured by direct election , and not with the patronage selection system . <p> It is about time that these twenty percent reserved seats be given--not as political favors to yes-men , high bidders , or the most physically attractive women--but to individuals who have earned them through a fair and competitive election .

@@4562231 blame the economy ! <p> Despite ongoing economic challenges faced by the country , Pakistan is experiencing a phenomenal growth of Broadband Internet , which has become a household product . The current global economic recession has had a spiral effect worldwide and few segments have been able to resist its impact . However , this amazing growth of Broadband in the last one decade is an outstanding national success story . High-speed Internet streaming is revolutionizing the way people learn , communicate , work and do business . Broadband Internet is now the backbone of corporate services and even small businesses . Owing to their own limitations , some telecom operators are making misleading claims about the state of Broadband penetration in Pakistan by incorrectly linking it with the country 's economic situation . Contrary to such ill-informed claims made in haste , the country has witnessed 70 times increase in Broadband proliferation in the last six years . The numbers speak for themselves . According to Pakistan Telecommunication Authority ( PTA ) data , the number of Broadband Internet subscribers in Pakistan increased from less than 27,000 in 2005-06 to more than 1.9 million in 2012 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total Internet users at more than 29 million with a population penetration of 15.5% . The total number of fixed phones and mobile phone subscribers stand at 3.10 and 118.32 million , respectively . PTA data further reveals that Broadband Internet put up an impressive growth rate of 28% from June 2011 to March 2012 , surpassing mobile growth rate which stood at 9% for the same period . Given these facts , conveniently blaming the economy to cover operators ' own institutional limitations and lack of infrastructural capacity tantamount to a disservice to the nation ! Broadband services were first introduced in Pakistan in 2001 by installing equipment on existing copper lines used for provision of telephony services . Initially , DSL Broadband services were only provided to a small consumer base of high-end users in the big cities . But progress was slow and penetration negligible . In response , Government of Pakistan introduced the Broadband Policy of 2004 , revising backhaul bandwidth charges downwards to propel broader penetration . In the face of rapidly increasing demand for affordable Broadband services and to fill the void of quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the country 's retail Broadband market in 2006 . It was the last company to enter the market when there were 25 other operators already active on the ground . Giving up its monopoly , the country 's largest and oldest telecom company strategically re-positioned itself in a fiercely competitive market while carrying its complicated but proud legacy . The impact of this strategic move surpassed all expectations . PTCL 's entry in the Broadband market had a major impact and the retail tariff was rationalized significantly . Broadband services were made accessible to every nook and corner of the country . More than 10,000 customers were achieved within the first 120 days of PTCL Broadband Pakistan 's launch , where as it took four years for all the other market players collectively to reach 30,000 customers mark . Today , PTCL is the Number One Broadband service provider in Pakistan with 90% market share , having pioneered the most popular and diverse portfolio of products and services ever offered in this market . It has surpassed market competition by leaps and bounds . For the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1st million broadband customers mark . PTCL has proved the fact that when a successful telecom operator comes to a country , it transforms the market . It is pertinent to mention here that this Broadband growth has been achieved during recession years where average GDP growth rate has remained less than 4% per year . It is even more phenomenal considering the fact that it is now a household product i.e. one connection serves the whole family . A typical Pakistani household has 6.2 members on average , which accumulates into 29 million households , so the real impact is far greater . Pakistan is ranked among the top few countries to have registered high growth in Broadband Internet penetration in recent years . According to global Broadband tracker , Point Topic 's 2011 report , Pakistan stood at fourth place in Asia with 46.2% growth in subscriber base ; whereas , Sri Lanka and India were placed at 11 and 14 , respectively . The tremendous potential of Broadband Internet in Pakistan can be gauged by analyzing the last four years ' progress through PTA 's data . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2008 . In 2012 , it has reached 7% . This mammoth growth has fuelled a Broadband revolution , resulting in an increase in customer base and also helping wireless Broadband technologies to expand setting the economic wheel in motion . PTCL has achieved this unprecedented success through an innovative customer approach , elimination of the traditional barriers , such as the upfront costs of installation and customer premises equipment . It has fueled the rise of businesses , jobs and opportunities . Despite the hollow claims , the truth is that the growth trajectory of Broadband is not the same for all operators . Sluggish economy and power crisis is not the reason for this stark dichotomy . Rather , it depends on an operator 's network , infrastructure capabilities , investment size , business model and growth strategy . Technology takes time to grow , but once the wheel is set in motion the effect is viral . If there are inconsistencies , revisit your business model and rationalize tariff along with greater excitement for the customers . PTCL is a strong case in point for the Broadband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ model . Banking on its previous success and believing in the strength of Pakistan 's economy and growing awareness of the people , PTCL Group has made a commitment to invest Rs.100 billion in the Broadband sector in the next five years . We believe in the potential and promise of this dynamic market . It 's not about economy ; it 's about capability !

@@4564233 <h> Diary of a ' Luna'tic <p> We are all told to shoot for the moon . Adil Mulki took the quote literally and embarked on a quest to find Pakistan 's ' lost ' moon rock . PHOTO COURTESY NASA AND THE US CONSULATE GENERAL LAHORE <p> Pakistan has its own chand ka tukra and no , it 's not your khala 's best friend 's bahu as she would have you believe . It is a real piece of the moon , the earth 's natural satellite , hidden away in the coffers of the National Museum of Pakistan in Karachi . <p> The moon has captivated man 's imagination since prehistoric times but it was only as recently as the 20th century that technology finally enabled man to take practical steps towards reaching this celestial body . The American space agency Nasa ran its Apollo programme of manned and un-manned space missions during the 1960s and 1970s while the Soviets ran their own Luna programme . Eventually , on July 20 , 1969 , these steps culminated into a " giant leap for mankind " -- in the words of the legendary astronaut Neil Armstrong -- and a lunar module named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Armstrong and his colleague Buzz Aldrin to the moon . The collective sigh of relief from mission control was probably audible as far as the moon and the achievement became the beginning of man 's subsequent trips to the moon , and the moon 's reciprocal trip to earth , Pakistan and finally to me ! <p> Nasa 's Apollo missions resulted in extending the limits of not only science but also culture as we know it . Frank Sinatra 's memorable " Take me to the moon " deservedly became the first song to be played on the moon itself , and the US used the opportunity for some masterful diplomacy . The last of the missions was Apollo 17 which was carried out between December 7 and 19 , 1972 . Eugene Cernan was the commander of the mission , Ronald Evans the command module pilot and professional geologist Harrison Schmitt was the lunar module pilot . The mission successfully gathered important scientific data as well as a quantity of surface samples . And here , the moon came a step closer to Pakistan . <p> The Apollo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word about the missions . Pakistan , then a much more " allied " ally of the United States , was on their itinerary as well . They arrived in Karachi on June 17 , 1973 , and the nation welcomed them with aplomb . Everywhere they went , earthlings from Pakistan treated them not just as royalty but as if they were aliens ( in a good way ) . During their whirlwind tour they visited the Quaid 's mausoleum and laid a wreath there in a formal ceremony . From the " first " first lady of Pakistan , the late Begum Rana Liaquat Ali Khan who was then the Governor of Sindh , to the then acting chief minister of Sindh Qaim Ali Shah ( yes , the same person who is now the CM ) , leaders from all sides of the political equator welcomed them . <p> In the US , the politicians had decided to use the trip as a token of goodwill for the human race and share a piece of the moon with many states of the world . Pakistan was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then the president of Pakistan , they presented to him a lunar sample from the moon 's surface for Pakistan . <p> It was not just the politicians and leaders that the " men from the moon " met . The astronauts met Suparco researchers and scientists as the two space agencies had been working together since 1961 and had even conducted joint rocket launches from Pakistan . Some of Suparco 's founding fathers had even received training from Nasa . <p> The men were treated like national heroes . Their interviews were broadcast by Radio Pakistan and Pakistan Television . No less an anchor than Laiq Ahmed , believed to be the Larry King of Pakistan , conducted the PTV session . As they had visited in safer times , they also held informal Q&amp;A sessions and interactions with students and ordinary Pakistanis and some old-timers recall how they , as young students , had enjoyed the team 's visit to the Karachi University . Such was their commitment to reaching out that when a young man from Karachi named Tariq Moen Shaikh wrote them a letter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memento . Speaking about their mission and related experiences , Commander Cernan once said : " We went to explore the moon , and in fact discovered the earth . " <p> The first time that I came to know that the ' Pakistani ' moon rock existed was in 2009 when reports started circulating in the international media that a number of moon rock samples presented to various states around the world , including Pakistan , were in fact lost due to conflict , wars or plain incompetence . The Pakistani press also lent credence to these reports . The " news " items disturbed me and I made a few attempts to trace the rock by speaking to my contacts from Islamabad and in Suparco , etc , but to no avail . <p> I went on to question older family members and they said they knew of it -- my uncle had seen it with his college mates when it was displayed at Karachi 's Frere Hall decades ago -- but had no idea what had happened since . <p> Disappointed by people 's apparent indifference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to my life and job . Little did I know that that would be the best decision I would make in my search for Pakistan 's piece of the moon and , following the news of Armstrong 's demise , I decided I absolutely had to find the memento or at least figure out what had become of it . <p> As a banker , I often visit the State Bank of Pakistan and during one such visit , oblivious to how fortuitous it would turn out to be , I took a walk through the brilliant museum that is located in the banking regulator 's building . Inspired by all the history housed there , I got in touch with Asma Ibrahim , director of the SBP 's museum and art gallery . She had been instrumental in solving another mystery from history , that of the " Persian Mummy " , over a decade ago and I decided to seek her assistance in this endeavour too . She assured me that the rock was very much in safe custody . And that was n't it ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Museum of Pakistan , Karachi -- out of public sight . <p> I waited impatiently for a Sunday when I would finally get the chance to go see Muhammad Shah Bukhari , the museum 's in-charge , who upon my request promptly arranged for a viewing and photography session of the rock . It was as if the entire state machinery had been guarding that incredible piece of history , almost waiting for someone to come looking for it . <p> More nervous than I had been during all my job interviews , I waited for the artefact to be brought into the curator 's office . An officer walked in , carrying a wooden panel and an affixed glass sphere , which looked much like a mundane paper weight , immediately grabbed my attention . Embedded in the glass was a piece of dark rock -- my own private mini holy grail of sorts ! I was over the moon , or at least face-to-face with a tiny fragment of it , and as the initial awe subsided , I studied the other objects fixed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rock read : " This fragment is a portion of a rock from the Taurus Littrow Valley of the moon . It is given as a symbol of the unity of human endeavour and carries with it the hope of the American people for a world at peace . " <p> Beneath the inscription was a small Pakistani flag , which I thought was there only because the panel was presented to Pakistan . But the biggest surprise for me came when I read another inscription on the metal plate beneath the flag : " This flag of your nation was carried to the moon aboard the Spacecraft America during the Apollo XVII mission , December 7-19 , 1972 . Presented to the people of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan from the people of the United States of America .

Notice that the author put ' luna ' within single inverted commas . Luna , I 'm sure you know , is the Latin word for the Moon that is also used in English . <p> Thank you very much for your generous comments . It is interesting that Neil Armstrong himself had visited Pakistan , East Pakistan that is . He visited Dhaka around 1970 , which was then part of East Pakistan and is now the capital of Bangladesh . @ @ @ @

@@4564239 <h> The story of Jinnah House Bombay <p> His only daughter , Dina Wadia , was born in this bungalow on August 15 , 1919 . She had filed a case in Bombay High Court to stake her claim on the bungalow , which is a bitter point between the governments of India and Pakistan . However , today the disheveled bungalow with its moss-covered walls and overgrown garden is no reflection of the stately structure it once was.This historic European-style building designed by architect Claude Batley was the venue for the watershed talks on the Partition of India in September 1944 between Jinnah and Gandhi . It was partially here that Jinnah altered the course of India 's history.Jinnah House , which was originally called South Court , was taken over by the government and declared evacuee property in 1949 . Later it was allotted to the British High Commission which moved out in 1981 . Since then , Pakistan has sought claim on Jinnah House to use it as its Consulate.Dina Wadia too is pursuing a case filed in the Bombay High Court to claim the property as Jinnah 's only legal heir , which revives the dispute between the Pakistan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mansion for its consulate . According to the will , Jinnah had bequeathed the Jinnah House land , the out houses , the furniture , plates , silver and his motor cars to his sister Fatima Jinnah who looked after him .

In an affidavit before the Bombay High Court , India 's Ministry of External Affairs ( MEA ) has rebuffed Dina 's claims , stating that Jinnah 's unmarried sister , late Fatima Jinnah , and not his daughter , was the rightful legal heir to the property.The affidavit said , " It has been the consistent stand of the government of India that late Fatima Jinnah was his rightful legal heir as Jinnah had willed the house to her .

" However , the issue of preserving the Jinnah House can be settled only through bilateral arrangements with India . Pakistan 's Foreign Ministry also says the government could not become party to the dispute over the Jinnah House because " India had told us that since there is no heir of the property under the local laws , it was declared as evacuee property " . However , the House still remains a disputed territory and has not yet been allocated to ' legal heirs ' or Pakistan , which in true sense has an emotional attachment and respect for that terrain . n Compiled By Mishaal Manzoor

The government should adopt advanced coal conversion technology to transform inefficient gas-based and dual-fuel fired power plants to coal-fired power plants , he said.Dr Murtaza Mughal said that government should expedite Environmental Impact Assessment reports and detailed technical and economic feasibility studies needed for conversion .

There is no harm in using imported coal for few years until country develop skills and infrastructure to utilise Thar coal , the PEW president observed .

While the first is objective , the latter two are necessarily subjective and are included to help the audience make a decision . In most ( if not all ) cases , the choice of which shades of opinion to present and what kind of a conclusion to draw from the presented facts and opinions ties in directly to a channel/publication 's own slant or leanings . This is not ' unethical journalism ' , it is simply ' journalism ' . <p> Human beings are peculiar creatures . They can see causal and logical linkages where none may exist .

It would be unfair on my part to say that every other party has been far more tolerant of criticism , since once-prime minister famously targeted the Jang Group and had Mr Najam Sethi ' picked up ' , ostensibly for " doing their job " .

And these are just the examples that readily spring to mind . <p> The point is , being reactive to criticism is n't a characteristic of a certain group or party : it applies across the board on all individuals .

In July 2010 , in a freak accident , Williams cut her foot while stepping onto broken glass at a restaurant in Munich and received multiple stitches . Subsequently the cut turned out to be a serious injury , required surgery and prevented her from playing for the remainder of 2010 . Staying out of action led Serena to concede her number 1 ranking to the Dane , Caroline Wozniacki . If all of this was not reason enough for concern , a life threatening , mystery illness made matters worse . Serena was diagnosed with blood clots in her lungs and , when questioned about it , she admits that she was on her ' death bed , quite literally ' .

Serena did not win many fans through her gestures , unflattering comments and unsportsmanlike conduct towards the chair umpire , declining to shake her hand after the match .

Whether it is on court or off , Serena rarely ever shies away from the spotlight .

It is , perhaps , due to this multifaceted lifestyle that she has evaded the prospect of a tennis burnout , which is faced by many of the other female players . All these distractions have , most probably , been responsible for the longevity of her career . Now , aged 31 , and playing the tennis of her life , who knows how many more Grand Slam titles she has still got in her . Provided she remains healthy and motivated , we can depend on Serena to be around for some more time continuing to pulverize her opponents with her distinct brand of aggression . <h> Related posts <h> 5 Comments <p> I am an American who is a huge Serena fan .

In appearance , camel bone is so similar to ivory that shopkeepers often pass off items made from it as ivory-made .

After its rough edges have been adequately rounded , the stick is mounted on the ' charkha ' or wheel of the lath and expanded to meet the required thickness .

@@4568233 <h> In Afghan war , enter Sir Mortimer Durand <p> When the British decided to define the outer limits of their Indian empire , they fudged the question . After two disastrous wars in Afghanistan , they sent the Foreign Secretary of India , Sir Mortimer Durand , to Kabul in 1893 to agree the limits of British and Afghan influence . The result was the Durand Line which Pakistan considers today as its border and Afghanistan refuses to recognise . Then , rather than extend the rule of the Raj out to the Durand Line , the British baulked at pacifying the tribes in what is now Pakistan 's Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) . Instead , they used the still-extant Frontier Crimes Regulation of 1901 to keep them at bay , if necessary through collective punishment . The Pashtun tribes living on either side of the Durand Line continued to move back and forth , resenting outside interference and rejecting an arbitrary division of their lands by a foreign power . <p> The situation remains as nebulous to this day . Pakistan , like the British Raj before it , wants a secure western frontier and has been ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its emphasis on Islam has been used as a means of countering ethnic Pashtun nationalism , lest the Pashtun lay claim to a Pashtunistan covering both sides of the Durand Line . Meanwhile , remembering the days when Peshawar was a fabled Afghan city , some Afghans hanker after a Greater Afghanistan , incorporating the lands of all Pashtun ( or Afghan ) tribes as far as the Indus river . ( Historically , the identification of Afghanistan with the Pashtun was such that the words " Afghan " and " Pashtun " were treated as synonyms . ) And even those Afghans who recognise how unrealistic it would be to claim a sizeable chunk of modern-day Pakistan retain a proprietary sense over the Pashtun living on the other side of the Durand Line . Meanwhile the Pashtun themselves resent their arbitrary separation between two countries , which has reduced their capacity to exercise political power . <p> With the worsening of the Afghan war , the situation on either side of the Durand Line has become even more explosive . Islamabad complains about its sovereignty being breached by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheltering and supporting Afghan Taliban militants on its side ; Pakistan shells the Afghan provinces of Kunar and Nuristan where it says some of the Pakistani Taliban have taken refuge . <p> It was into this minefield that the United States stepped when -- in what appeared to be almost a casual comment -- U.S. special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan Marc Grossman reaffirmed during a visit to the region that Washington recognises the Durand Line as the international boundary . In case there were any doubts about what he said , State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland made the same point when asked at a briefing about the official U.S. position on the Durand Line . " Well , our policy on this has not changed , " she said . " It was correctly stated by Ambassador Grossman that we see this as the internationally recognised boundary . " <p> As someone who has been following Pakistan for a while , it came as a surprise to me that the United States had a policy on the Durand Line , given how contentious it is as an issue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and later played down as a reiteration of an existing position rather than a new approach : <p> " The Ministry of Foreign Affairs once again reaffirms the historic importance of the Durand Line for the Afghan people and reiterates its long-standing position that only the Afghan nation can determine its status , " the Afghan government said . " U.S. policy concerning the recognition of Durand Line is not a new development and has no bearing on the views of the Afghan people or the policy of the Government of Afghanistan on this issue . " <p> Grossman 's comments may indeed have been meant as no more than a passing reference to existing U.S. policy -- Washington has little to gain by picking a fight with Kabul right now as it prepares to pull out most combat troops by the end of 2014 while negotiating the right to retain bases there afterwards which can be used for targeting al Qaeda and other Islamist militants , including through drone strikes in FATA . Yet arguments over the future of the Durand Line are not going to go away ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pulling out foreign troops from Afghanistan -- especially if , as expected , there is no political settlement by then with Taliban insurgents . And as a result , even a throwaway remark about policy attracts attention . <p> At first glance , the idea of settling the border is appealing . With its western flank secured , Pakistan would have less reason to interfere in Afghanistan -- though it would still worry about Indian influence there . Any agreement between Afghanistan and Pakistan would help them channel cross-border movement through official crossings while using joint surveillance and patrols to prevent Islamist militants moving back and forth . Islamabad would incorporate FATA fully into Pakistan and Kabul would breathe easier if it believed it were to be spared what is now more than 30 years of Islamist militants seeping in from the east . <p> But it is not that simple . Perhaps in the long-run , settling the border needs to be the ultimate aim . But it can not be the starting point . Departing British colonial rulers proved when they partitioned India in 1947 that defining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who lived on either side of them -- only stored up bigger problems for later . Pashtun tribes on both sides of the Durand Line are already unhappy with governments in both Islamabad and Kabul -- with the result that some support the same Islamist militancy which , ironically , was once nurtured by Pakistan to suppress Pashtun nationalism . On both sides they believe they have been marginalised -- in Afghanistan following the U.S.-led invasion which ousted the Pashtun Taliban ; and in Pakistan by the dominance of the country 's heartland Punjab province . Without accommodating ethnic Pashtun fully in the political processes of both Afghanistan and Pakistan before agreeing a frontier , the imposition of a border -- itself going against cherished rights of free movement and trade -- could stoke more , rather than less violence . <p> And legally , the case for turning the Durand Line into the international border is not watertight . Pakistan argues that it is the clear inheritor of borders negotiated by the British before 1947 ; Afghanistan has a multitude of grievances with the Durand Line , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced upon it by British imperialism . <p> In a review of historical documents on the original 1893 agreement and published by RUSI ( subscription ) , authors Bijan Omrani and Frank Ledwidge conclude that the Durand Line was never meant to be an international border . <p> The research paper argues that the agreement negotiated by Durand with Afghan Amir Abdur Rahman fixed only " the limit of their respective spheres of influence " rather than being a clear delineation of sovereignty . It quotes a memorandum written by Sir Denis Fitzpatrick , the Lieutenant-Governor of Punjab and therefore the most senior official overseeing the frontier at the time , writing in 1896 that : <p> " I think it is of the highest importance that it should simply be understood to be a line on our side of which the Amir 's interference except when we allow him to chastise a tribe , shall be absolutely excluded ... I think if the agreement between us and the Amir were treated to be anything like a partition of territory , it would have a bad effect ... " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognition of the Durand Line ever be taken to international arbitration , a court would need to examine whether both countries had treated it as an international border for a prolonged period -- evidence that would be nearly impossible to provide given the degree of interference and movement of people on both sides . <p> Intriguingly , given Pakistan 's own deep hostility to U.S.-led or Afghan raids into FATA to tackle Taliban militants , the paper also argues that such " hot pursuit " was clearly allowed in the original treaty . It quotes Fitzpatrick as saying that , " There would be places in which for a long time to come we should not attempt to establish internal peace or prevent the tribes from fighting amongst themselves and places like the Afridi country where it would be difficult for us to prevent the tribes from raiding on the Amir 's territory and in which accordingly we should in a proper case have to allow the Amir to counter-raid , though on the understanding that he would not take permanent possession . " <p> Going by that interpretation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading different documents in different languages might read it differently -- you could make a case that Afghanistan ( and the United States if acting on behalf of Kabul ) could conduct raids by ground troops into FATA . Equally , Pakistan could send troops into Kunar and Nuristan . It is a can of worms that nobody has wanted to open -- the anecdote serves not to prove a point of law or history but rather to illustrate the complexity of the Durand Line question . <p> The paper finishes by recommending that rather than stick to an artificial 19th century line , Afghanistan and Pakistan should work out a means of shared sovereignty , recognising the needs of the people who live there , closely linked by family ties and custom , to move and trade freely across the Durand Line . " ... the best way to solve the many problems on either side of it -- poverty , illiteracy , poor health , corruption , terrorism , laws which contravene all notions of human rights -- is not to persist in the attempt to split sovereignty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terrain , population and custom can not bear inequalities in administration , but requires a common approach on both sides to solve the problems . " <p> Maybe ; maybe not . It is hard to see how this could work at a time when Taliban militants are bent on taking over both Afghanistan and , more recently as far as the Pakistani Taliban are concerned , Pakistan as well . In any case , the trust is not there between Pakistan and Afghanistan to even begin to consider such an arrangement . <p> But perhaps there is a need for outside , UN , mediation . This is too difficult an issue to be resolved by a few short words from the United States that " we see this as the internationally recognised boundary . " <p> Here is what the research paper describes as the response to the Durand Line agreement : " Reaction amongst the Pashtun tribes to the demarcation was generally ( though with a few exceptions ) negative .

Quite on the contrary , Pakistan Govt. under the arrangements made between individual tribes and the Brits pays tributes to the tribal people on a regular basis and in return Pakistan Govt uses the roads which cut across the tribal land and keeps maintanance .

The reason this question needs to be answered is to clarify the hazy image of national security . Indeed , a security policy built on mixed views is bound to fail . And " if the policy is faulty , even a brilliant strategy will flounder . " Existential threat here means a threat posed to the unity , demography and integrity of Pakistan . The very basis of the state or its physical existence stands challenged.No army can successfully fight on many fronts . Napoleon 's army and Hitler 's Wehrmacht both fell victims to imperial overstretch . Pakistan 's army is already facing numerous threats : India 's Cold Start strategy , USA 's de-nuking agenda , foreign sponsored separatists in Balochistan , Indian rekindled Sindhudesh movement , Karachi based ethnic/mafia groups , militants in Pakhtunkhwa and spill over of war in Afghanistan.The army 's primary task is to guard the borders against foreign threats .

' AfPak ' was meant to create the perception of a war zone on both sides of the western border . Buzz words like GWOT , non-state actors , al-Qaeda , Haqqanis , Blackwater and terrorists served as a ' Strategy of Deflection ' .

The lethality of terrorist strikes mostly indicated a high degree of sophistication with some being run-of-the-mill crude attacks . There was method in the madness . Apparently , multiple forces were involved conveniently labelled as Taliban . Apparently , the Taliban have two basic motivations . First to eject the occupying forces from Afghanistan ; and second to impose their version of Islam .

@@4573230 <p> " Some of our students receive as many as six job offers before they had graduated , " says IBA Dean Dr Ishrat Husain . <p> KARACHI : If a high number of students receiving multiple job offers even before they graduate is the chief yardstick to measure a business school 's performance , the Institute of Business Administration ( IBA ) is certainly in a league of its own . <p> " Some of our students receive as many as six job offers before they had graduated , " IBA Dean and Director Dr Ishrat Husain said while speaking to The Express Tribune on Friday . <p> Out of the 196 IBA BBAs , who actively looked for jobs in 2012 , as many as 170 -- or 86.7% -- managed to find employment of their liking , according to the IBA 's employment survey released earlier this month . The average monthly starting salary for BBA graduates in 2012 was Rs43,200 , compared to last year 's Rs36,700 , reflecting an increase of 18% . <p> The banking sector has been the chief employer of IBA graduates in recent years . But the percentage of BBAs joining the banking sector was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although the banking sector offered a salary of salary of Rs36,900 a month on average in 2012 -- which is Rs6,300 less than the overall average salary this year -- it still remains the single largest employer of IBA BBAs . <p> Husain says the fact that the number of IBA graduates entering the banking field has come down by almost 50% in just a couple of years should be attributed to slower expansion in the banks ' branch network . <p> The education sector remained the second-largest employer of IBA BBAs this year with 13.5% graduates entering the field at an average salary of Rs36,000 per month . About 78.3% graduates joining the education field were female , according to the employment survey . <p> Many of the BBAs entering the education field return to IBA after getting the mandatory work experience required for the MBA programme , according to Husain . <p> Financial institutions were also a less preferred employer for IBA BBAs in 2012 , as only 5.9% of graduates joined them at an average salary of Rs39,700 a month . Unlike the education sector , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year compared to 2011 , the number of IBA graduates joining the financial sector actually decreased from 14% to 5.9% over the same period . <p> IBA BBAs received the highest average monthly salaries in the fast-moving consumer goods ( FMCG ) , telecommunications and manufacturing sectors with Rs70,000 , Rs67,000 and Rs35,000 , respectively , according to the employment survey . <p> Commenting about the low level of interest among IBA graduates in joining the textile sector , Husain says it was due to the " seth mentality " prevailing in the industry . " We have taught our students professional management , so they do not want to become part of the textile industry for obvious reasons , " he said . <p> The employment survey says 90.5% of the fresh MBAs who actively sought jobs this year found employment of their liking . The average monthly salary for IBA MBAs in 2012 was Rs66,400 , which is almost 24% higher than the last year 's average . <p> " While the general impression is that there are few jobs because of the sluggish economic growth in recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities for graduates of quality educational institutions , " Husain said . <h> Reader Comments ( 26 ) <p> Hmmm ... very interesting news . All the best to these graduates . Would like to see a similar article on LUMS . Although it would be important to remember that LUMS is a liberal arts college , not a BBA factory . <p> right , they may find jobs . But conduct a random survey about how many students settle their own companies and draft a yardstick of measuring mental capabilities , you will find that they have no much to LUMS guys . I am not a luminite hence not biased , but this is what we call reality ! IBA still far behind lums in Pakistan . <p> Another misleading headline by Tribune . Actually the numbers for IBA are really bad . <p> According to the LUMS brochure for this year , the Highest MBA Salary in 2012 was Rs. 150,000 . The average was Rs. 87,000 and the placement was 90% . <p> In undergrad in general it was even more better than IBA . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( of those getting jobs in Pakistan ) was Rs. 88,000 . The average salary for those getting jobs in Pakistan was Rs. 59,000 . <p> Just shows how much the difference between IBA and LUMS still is . Long way to go , IBA ! <p> @Jack Would you please quote a study , or a survey or anything of a kind proving that more Luminites move on to become entrepreneurs than IBAians ? IBA is running it 's own entrepreneurship program with collaboration with the greatest entrepreneurial college in the world ; Babson College . Moreover , it is offering diploma to students from Sindh for Agricultural entrepreneurship . And to top it off , it 's having highly regarded workshops with collaboration with a top Indian Management School regarding family business management to ensure that businesses in Pakistan survive the transition from first to the second generation . If all of these does n't bear fruit , I do n't know what will . But then again , I AM an IBAian so I AM biased . The thing about you not being biased because you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know in detail the programs of Both the universities . LUMS is an amazing school . Much better than us in some programs . I do n't know about their entrepreneurial programs so I wo n't comment on that . But battering IBA when you do n't know anything about either of the schools is stupid to say the least ! <p> There are many other universities but people sitting in their departments are grossly non professionals . They are more interested in keeping their own importance intact rather than hiring professional faculty members . I am saying this on the basis of personal experience . Only IBA and LUMS responded to my emails seeking faculty position . PhD Economics , Some EU University . <p> Difference in IBA and LUMS is the location and method of study ( case based ) respectively . Getting job is not the nain idea of MBA , its consulting or setting up own business . Let 's not include executive education . I know IBA faculty did many from LUMS . <p> As great Einestine reportedly quoted that ' Education is not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to train your mind to think ' I personally also agree with the statement and believe that measurement scale of ' greatness ' of any educational system , institute and management should be the same ( Intellectual capability and its outcome ) . Apart from it the number game , is just secondary discussion . But due to evasive nature of measurment of this scale , we just indulge in the number game . So our all institutes should focus on this aspect , rather than being compalcent or disappointed over the results of few surveys . <p> We do n't find any thing these Ivy Leagues are doing for the betterment of the country , rather than getting high perks and moving abroad for better future ... Govt need such people at top level to route the nation to brighter future . <p> IBA is just producing workforce for the multinational companies . I have yet to meet an IBA entrepreneur . Yet I see some amazing people , businessmen from not so famous universities who did something different from the rest . <p> Why do you people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said about IBA ? This article , in no way , denunciates LUMS or any of its programs or its student . This reaction is defensive to say the least and only goes to show the vulnerablities of LUMS enthusiasts . Both institutes produce quality graduates with different USPs . IBA may or may not be producing employees for multinationals and LUMS may or may not be producing entrepreneurs . The bottom line is that our country needs both . Period . No one is perfect . Every individual posseses a combination of good and bad traits . Same goes for institutes . We need to focus on the good and glorify it ! Recommend <p> I beg to differ -- I have worked with MBA 's from IBA in two different organizations and their work quality and skills were poor . In comparison , I found graduates of LUMS to be far better . The BBAs of IBA that I worked with at a leading bank were totally immature . BTW I am not a LUMS graduate . <p> @PakArmySoldier : Brother get your facts right , Quaid-e-azam university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I am working abroad and Pakistanis and their degrees are well respected . You will not know this until you come out of the CAVE you are staying in . <p> This is definitely a misleading headline . And why is the writer talking about and in fact , attributing only it 's BBA and MBA graduates ? Why are n't the statistics of BS Computer Science and BS Economics &amp; Maths graduates ( and their MS counterparts ) revealed in this article ? Are n't they worth mentioning here ?

@@4573232 <h> Zindagi Gulzar Hai : I 'm not impressed <p> Sanam Saeed is focused on stepping one foot in front of the other despite the odds weighing down on her , holding her back , who pens the miseries of her life with self-deprecating honesty . PHOTO : PUBLICITY <p> After receiving countless amounts of messages from my friends to watch the new drama serial , Zindagi Gulzar Hai , I finally spared some time to catch up with the few episodes that have aired so far . <p> Given the hype surrounding the show , I was n't surprised when from the outset , a similar plot was introduced- a plotline that serves the basis for many Pakistani TV series . <p> No , not because the same actor is acting in this drama , though I have to admit it certainly added to the likeness of the two drama serials . It is primarily because , both the serials show an affluent matriarchal family in which the woman , especially the mother , wields unusual authority and teeters on the brink of transgression . <p> In Zindagi Gulzar Hai , Zaroon 's mother is successful in her affairs and makes a show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with familial affairs , however , she is often careless and mindless . She is snobbish and does not like being questioned . <p> The children go about their daily lives , not bound any limitation whatsoever . When someone frowns down upon this , one of the parents shrugs it off in a way that suggests that their children are mature adults . <p> Yet , the daughter will be seen brazenly wearing a shirt that reads , " Little Miss Jihad " . But that has little to do with the drama . The T-shirt is a story in itself . <p> On the contrary , we have the lower middle class family that is striving to reach the top . <p> My concern , however , is not the lower middle class . This , if anything , is portrayed aptly and follows standards of other shows in which there is a sincerity with which the middle class is dealt with . Perhaps it is easier to infuse emotions when we find ourselves confined to a certain lifestyle , and from which we only wish to escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kashaf , a girl from a middle class family who is being crushed between the emotional distress of having an uncooperative father and joining an elite university , where she meets her insecurities . <p> It is easier to deliver a dialogue that makes the viewer feel the character 's pain . It is a challenge , however , to deliver a dialogue that is meant as light-hearted jest . If done wrong , it could make the viewer furrow his brow or make him shake his head with disapproval or both . <p> There were a couple times when the dialogue was too over the top : the admission result day when Zaroon and his friends mock the girl who outshone Zaroon ; the drive back to his home ; the scene in which Zaroon 's sister is pestering him to drop her off to a friend 's , and so on . The depiction of ' spoiled rich kids ' seems a little overdone . <p> Let 's just say , in those two episodes I watched , my brow furrowed and my head shook with disapproval quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use slang in conversation , but throwing " yaar " in every scene is unnecessary and irksome . <p> The elite family structure , portrayed in Zindagi Gulzar Hai , is depicted as self-righteous with complete disregard to principles . It is portrayed in such an extreme way that it almost looks unrealistic . Coupled with mediocre acting skills on behalf of a few actors , particularly Mehreen Raheel and Ayesha Omar , it becomes completely unbelievable and at times hilarious . There is little truth in the acting- a truth that so easily lends itself to Sanam Saeed , as she slips into the character of a young girl . <p> Having said as much , the actors mirroring the typical middle-class Pakistani roles are redeeming the show for me , especially when it comes to the aesthetics . Kashaf is shown dressed in very plain clothes and so are his sisters and mother . Unlike many other dramas where lower middle class girls are caked in makeup , this one shows a very soft , realistic image of the sisters . <p> Samina Pirzada does not disappoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glamorously vengeful woman , she also does justice to her role of a government school principal and stressed mother who sacrifices all she can for the best of her children . However , she is not shown to be suppressed , which is great . She has a soft motherly aura , but is also a determined ( and at times stern ) woman who likes to make her own decisions . <p> Let 's hope the next few episodes of this show reveal a deeper theme and hook me in . I have unending faith in the Pakistani drama industry and I know that the actors in this show have the capacity to put on something really special . <p> First of all , this story is entirely different from humsafar in many aspects because in this Kashaf is shown to have big responsibilities and she hates the XY gender just because of her father whereas Zaroon is shown as a conservative man who does n't like the so-called independent women !

@@4573240 <h> Failure of democracy <p> LAHORE : Democracy is a form of government in which power is vested in the people and it is administered by people elected to public office , through the votes of the electorate . <p> Since its inception , the most difficult challenge Pakistan has struggled to meet has been to establish a truly democratic system , which could guarantee its survival , stability and development . Unfortunately , the plant of democracy in Pakistan has not yet been able to take root . <p> The practice of political aggrandisement has led to widespread administrative and social corruption . We have still to see real rule of law in the country . Democracy can never exist without rule of law , justice , civil liberties and equality of opportunities . Unless the people are educated and use their votes intelligently , democracy can never prosper . Aristotle rightly remarked : " To neglect the education of the young ones , is to weaken the constitution of the country . " <p> Democracy is a function of education . It can not be managed effectively and justly without sound education of the voters and their high level of information . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pakistan as a nation has probably for the first time been able to almost complete the five year term of the National Assembly which in itself must be considered as an achievement . As a nation making comparison of this Islamic Republic with their neighbour The Republic of India would really not be an appropriate comparison to do . India has been a democracy since her independence and this plant of democracy has been nurtured by the Indian leadership ; although there have been certain dark phases of Indian democracy ; but on the whole democracy in India has reached the level of maturity . Pakistan since 1958 with the first army take over under Field Marshal Ayub Khan followed by the second coup by General Zia-ul-Haq and finally by General Parvez Musharraf on 12 October 1999 has not had a steady spell of democracy which has been their major political and constitutional misfortune and religious fundamentalism has further damaged their society to an extent that democracy has not been able to get the desired environment to develop . The elections held in 2008 in Pakistan have for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to almost complete their complete tenure and now with the elections fast approaching the next government must carry on with the same responsibility the democratic conventions . Although there can not be overnight wonders and democracy will need time to take roots in The Islamic Republic of Pakistan in a rather challenging environment where religious fundamentalist groups and terrorist organisations still hold a sway in the corridors of power . The nation has to fight a rather challenging war against religious fundamentalism to make democracy take strong roots in the Islamic Republic and this certainly can not be an easy going . This does not in any way mean that Pakistan does not have the potential to become a democracy but for the fact that they as a nations shall have to face the strongest challenges and at times their can be certain setbacks too which all have to be taken in the stride . The citizens of Pakistan have to now come forward to make democracy a success in their own country . A new horizon towards a Moderate , Progressive and Democratic state where the majority and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another important development most essential for the development of democracy as this will help Pakistan in developing their infrastructure as well as economy . There is an optimism poignant and is visible in the intelligentsia of Pakistan which should get converted to a reality at the earliest for which efforts need to made with earnest . There are forecasts being made by various thinkers and political analysts that the next parliament in Pakistan shall be a ' hung parliament ' which can come true but one can not be judgmental on the issue or speak with full conviction as the voter 's mind or mood can change in the next few months . The citizens of Pakistan like those of any other nation want peace and political stability in their country and certainly will want a government that can take Pakistan out of the economic problems that nation has been facing . A coalition government if formed in Pakistan may not be very stable however this is a part of the political process and a phase in process of a democracy that is gradually taking its roots in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less same however the external modifications shall vary from one nation to another depending on the social , cultural , political and economic conditions of a nation and Pakistan can be no exception . The political parties within Pakistan shall now have to work on a long term strategy that serves that nation . The elections that are to follow are a test for those political parties be it the Pakistan Muslim League , Pakistan People 's Party , MQM , Tehrik-e-Insaaf , Awami National Party or the Communist Party of Pakistan and the people of that nation too carry one of the greatest responsibility of voting in a mature fashion not to be driven away by narrow class interests . The coming years especially the next five to ten years are crucial for Pakistan as the success of democracy in that nation shall be decided during the next ten years . Coalition is yet another phenomena of modern democracies that one sees in India , Pakistan and various other nations of the world . Nominated members can not be outright negated as non-representative as they do have a role @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a say in government . Indeed Parliamentary elections , in any nation are certainly not a beauty contest hence whenever women candidates are chosen as candidates a special attention should be paid with regard to their public appeal and acceptance among the masses besides their calibre to perform in the interest of women in the country . Also in those areas that are not well developed or backward the selection of candidates is a difficult task as public acceptance alone may not always be the sole criteria . Candidates should have the ability to perform and prove their efficiency as political professionals .
