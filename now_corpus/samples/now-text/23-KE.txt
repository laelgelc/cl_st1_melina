@@97348234 <h> Rev. Wainaina To the Govt : " It is not your Responsibility to Organize Prayers " <p> All Saints Cathedral Provost Rev Sammy Wainaina spoke to Spice FM about the role of the church in politics . <p> What is the role or duty of the church in society ? <p> Let 's start from the biblical point of view . And then we look at the history of the church in politics , but we also look at our modern times . <p> When God raised a king , there was always a prophet and vice versa in the Bible , and it tells you about the place of power , religious and political , which is very important in influencing the daily happenings of society . <p> And the reason why God did that was to have a balance between political power and religious power , without which one can be toxic or excessive . <p> But now the challenge is when the two come together and collude . Then it becomes what I have said in other forums : occultic , and it 's dangerous . So the church requires political regulation . <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history of the church and politics , where the church has become part of the government , it becomes very dangerous ; it becomes part of the oppressor because the government can be oppressive , but also where churches have not been regulated , there is no difference between religious or political power when it is not under control . And that 's why we speak to one another ; we regulate one another . <p> Has this been the case with our governments ? <p> Kenya has many examples from different dispensations . <p> The Kenyatta era demonstrates the distinction between the church and the government , as well as the role that the church played . Looking back at the Moi era , some churches were deemed to be too close to power , and they reaped the benefits . While there are others , such as where I come from , where people suffer and die , it has become the only source of agitation and the pursuit of freedom . <p> Then , in the Kibaki era , he was open to the church but independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Uhuru era , we grappled with problems that I knew about , and I was in the studio speaking about them . <p> And now the new one and the challenges that have come , so church and politics or challenges or using the new one , you know , and this began during campaigns where one leader was made to look like an angel like the Messiah , a Christian , and the Lord 's anointed . And so that was the wave on which he came into power . What he would call the evangelical tide <p> And then you have the other person who was made to look like the devil , anti-church , anti-Christ , the enemy of the church , and that is very dangerous when charging labels because it stigmatizes people . So somebody comes into power , and then , feeling entitled , there is easily a mix of political and religious powers , definitely to the benefit of both . <p> And that 's where I have said , " Hey , that is not right . " Step out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do well , but also find them and tell them what is wrong . Something happens when you bring the two back together to say the word " cultic " again . And cultic power is very dangerous because when it comes from one person who is too powerful to influence you , the word becomes the law . When you challenge this , you are viewed as an enemy of the establishment . <p> How is that ? <p> Well , it 's also good to understand when we talk about the church because the church is not one denomination . But the church is organized in such a way that you have bodies that are regulated . You have the NCC-K , the EAK , and the Catholic Bishops Conference ; all of these are very important bodies , and if you wanted to engage with the church , you would use such forums to engage with the church . <p> But when the government takes a certain religious persuasion , it 's like being here again and knowing that I can speak openly . I have never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to ask me to come and be part of the congregation , I have asked them . So what is the agenda on the table ? What am I coming to do ? I represent a church in the city and a significant church at that . So you ca n't just tell me to come and attend . <p> I wo n't mobilise people for something where I do n't know what kind of meeting I 'm getting the church into . <p> What are the planning meetings for ? <p> Well , mostly it 's not the planning meetings . Most of all , we are meeting in this stadium , and please , could you come or mobilise members to come ? And I said , " No , I ca n't do that . " And why not ? You are not involved in the planning because I do n't know what is on the table . What are we committing ourselves to ? If members of the cathedral asked me , " What is the purpose of the sudden prayer ? " And in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fellowship or thanksgiving because they are not religious acts per se . They are political tabs . <p> For example , we had a nationa prayer in Nakuru ... <p> What do you mean by " national " ? This was called a national prayer . If I had been invited , no , I would n't have gone . If it does n't rain , does that mean Kenya is not a godly country ? We should pray , and we can pray . I 've been in public , and I 've said that if you want to pray , ask the churches to pray on Sunday . I do pray across the country , across all denominations . <p> As the political leadership joins , ask the church to organise the prayers . It is not the government 's responsibility to organize prayers . <p> But now look and let us know about the Nakuru rally , for example . It 's a four-hour period of prayer and thanksgiving . Then you use an hour to do the sermon . Then after that , the hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clergy are there seated and entertained . Even one of them suggested revenge . He said even if it means arresting me and putting me in prison so that by the time you get this guy , I 'll be able to deal with him . <p> Oh , I would n't be there . I will walk out or I 'll go to the podium and say it is either a prayer meeting or a political meeting . <p> It sounds to me like there is a distinction between these two clearly defined denominational divisions in the church ... <p> When we are talking about national issues , the church is structured . Even all those churches like that are owned by individuals , and they are under an umbrella body . <p> That is where we need to structure the church because if we do n't regulate ourselves through those parts , the government will likely come back and do what happened in Rwanda because of the chaos that religion in the name of God can create . People can cause a lot of chaos . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once again , I do n't want to emphasize the divide between evangelical and Pentecostal -- may never have been very close . <p> If that is clear in terms of potential danger , then why do we see the continuation of this ? <p> Well , you know , history also mutates and changes , whether it 's the history of the church or politics . And , as in Kenya 's history , the main churches , or what you 'd call the mainstream , play an important role , and perhaps that 's where we learned . Hey , too far , too bad . Too close . Unfortunately , both are true . So it 's like we need one another , but let 's be careful . <p> We have fluidity in terms of relationships . But there is also power in recent times for people to coexist . With the growth of the evangelical movement , one man or a few people led the type of congregations that are not regulated in such a way that one divides into another and , within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That 's where the main problem now lies . How do we get to regulate these churches ? <p> Even in terms of theology , you see , we have formed that theology through experience . This time , as you 're referring to , we 've developed a strong theology based on our experience as , say , mainstream churches . Hey , be careful about this . <p> But anyway , Kenya is a free nation if people want to associate with the powers that are there . We let them enjoy the shine , but some of us will say no . <p> At what cost to the people who follow this , as well as the lives of Kenyans who rely on churches to act as a buffer between the wrongs committed by the state ? <p> But who benefits from this trade between the church and their political leadership ? Which commodities are they trading ? which are the members , and so you tend to see pastors who are very rich and very powerful , very close to the political powers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no voice . <p> The church should call out the government because it tends to be corrupt . <p> It 's dangerous when that same corruption is now in the church leadership ; it becomes very dangerous , and it 's argued elsewhere that that does n't encourage the growth of Christianity because people need to become disillusioned about faith . But also , because of poverty , Kenyans can not receive good services because of politicians who can do anything without question . <p> If you collude as opposed to providing the service that they are calling for , then this problem keeps rising . The fact that the checks and balances that we speak of are not as evident as they ought to be ... <p> But there are very different layers to a leader 's right , and what he 's talking about is speaking truth to power .

So Counterfeit trade is still growing . The government is losing this money because most of the illicit activities are done outside the formal tax systems . At the end of the day , what the government would have earned goes to illegal traders . <p> With all the laws and penalties in place , why is it still easy for illegal trade to take place ? <p> Just like any other form of crime , the State may not be able to eliminate the vice completely . What we can do is mitigate it . The prevalence of illicit trade persists because it is fueled by factors such as affordability ; most counterfeited goods are cheap . Other issues are differentiation , where many people ca n't tell the difference between counterfeit and genuine products . <p> There is also the issue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

One of the most counterfeited products are electronics , apparel , cosmetics , footwear and alcoholic beverages , which is a huge menace .

It is also important for the private sector to come out and defend their Intellectual Property Rights . <p> What are some of the challenges the authority faces in the fight against illicit trade ? <p> There is a misconception that the organisation is anti-business , and this is a big challenge .

She shares her story of how they built their lives from scratch before her husband changed after getting a good job . <p> Tell us your love story . <p> We met in campus and fell in love . By the time I was graduating I was already a mother . We moved in together and started living as husband and wife . With a bright future ahead of us , we worked hard to realise our goals . My husband landed a good job in one of the government institutions , and this saw us move from Kawangware slum where we were living in a shanty mabati house to a gated estate . That was n't all , we were able to own a few cars also , and this changed my husband . By the time we were moving houses , my hubby and I had agreed that I would stay home to look after the baby until a later age so this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's enrolled in school . <p> So what changed ? <p> I do n't know if it was money or my husband had concealed his character while we were struggling . The moment money checked in , he drastically changed . The man who used to come home early would come back past midnight and drunk . <p> Did you try to find out what the problem was ? <p> I tried as much as I could but there was absolutely no concrete reason . <p> So what was the last stroke ? <p> In that process of on and off , I one day overheard him making an inquiry on the phone about a CT scan or ultrasound . At the time I was n't pregnant or planning to be . So I got curious and wanted to know whom he was organising the scan for . I tried snooping in his phone but I got caught and received an unforgettable slap . That did n't deter me , I went ahead and started making inquiries from his close friends and relatives but no one could open up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got scanty information . <p> So with less evidence to tie him down I decided to keep on inquiring . <p> Luckily for me , he organised a come-together bash for family and friends in our house . During the event , a girlfriend of one of his friends asked how comfortable I was with a co-wife . I got curious about her question and I wanted to get a clear line . When I asked her to expound , she just brushed me off and told me to inquire from her relative . Eager to get the details , I approached her cousin and he confirmed . <p> How did you react ? <p> I was furious ! When I confronted him , surprisingly he did n't deny it , we escalated the matter to his parents and surprisingly his parents firmly told me that polygamy is allowed in their community and if I felt uncomfortable , I was free to walk away and let those who are ready to step in . At the meeting , he also brought another woman whom he introduced as his third wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I could n't even contemplate anything other than separation . Immediately we returned from the village , I picked a few of my items and called it quits . Starting from scratch was n't that easy . I sank into depression , which almost cut short my life . I tried to commit suicide thrice before I was rescued and taken to a counsellor . <p> How long did it take you to recover ? <p> I think almost a year . I really struggled to move on , especially when I reflected the hurdles we faced before succeeding . But I thank God I 'm now okay and able to share without feeling hurt . <p> Any advice to the readers ? <p> Your mental health is important , never kill yourself or get mentally unstable just because of love . If you feel like things are not working out completely just walk away . There are many people who will love you unconditionally . Personally , I moved on and I 'm happy with my current relationship .

What most Mt Kenya leaders close to the regime might not understand now , is the transient nature of power and the fluidity of deceit in politics that is driven by the quest to amass power .

It is the reason why even the state machinery and the security forces were deployed to help Kanini Kega and Co lay an illegitimate claim to the leadership of a party they have since decamped from . These are politicians who have sold themselves to a political party called UDA , both in words and deeds . It is therefore ludicrous for them to want to have their cake when they are already eating it . <p> You see , it is not like Kanini Kega and Sabina Chege and the rest are going to add value to UDA or Kenya Kwanza , NO . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard . Not because they are not solid politicians , but because they have demonstrated they stand for fairly nothing and would do anything for themselves . They supported President Uhuru Kenyatta and Raila Odinga and Azimio for themselves . And when it became clear that the gravy train was only going to trickle down from UDA they metamorphosised with terrific speed with little regard for the common mwananchi . So as far as their leadership prowess and tradition is concerned , you can take it to the bank , UDA does not rank them at all . So , what is UDA interested in ? Not even Jubilee , but a total annihilation of any solid Mt platform or vehicle that can stand to challenge UDA , in voicing the issues of the mountain . Already the signs are there . Mt Kenya cabinet secretaries who thought they had formed a government that would address the national interest of their people are crying and the reasons are obvious . They are shareholders on paper and I guess dealing with them within the party is easy . Cause mutiny from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either force these dissidents into conformity akin to what scholars in human communication call group think or replace them altogether . And that 's where the annihilation of Jubilee comes in handy . With a dead Jubilee , it would be impossible for a dethroned dissident from Mt Kenya to find a footing . They will have nowhere to go and no time to regroup and champion their cause . <p> It might sound remote , but DP Rigathi Gachagua and his loyalist think that by annihilating Jubilee he stands to gain , but he might be the biggest loser and the reason why the mountain wo n't have any sort of recourse . You see , there is no political kingship without a political party and UDA is not a vehicle that he can build his political clout on . In fact , it might be the vehicle that would finish him . Unlike WSR he does not have the gravitas to challenge the establishment and neither does he have the charisma and aura to build a political party like Jubilee or UDA or ODM . But that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they soon will . The death of Jubilee portends a number of years in the political cold and most probably a number of years of a democratic dispensation that will not address the one man one shilling democratic ideal that is good for Kenya and alive to the needs of the many hardworking folks in Mt Kenya . <p> One wonders why folks who made a lot of noise about Mt Kenya 's disproportionate democratic representation are now quiet . They are now eating and in high privileged position . Chances are , they will even be allowed to soil their hands to lose legitimate ground to challenge the establishment from within and with a dead Jubilee they will clutch on nothing but hope . The biggest worry today is that the civil society that understands so well the value of a multiplicity of parties is muted and leaders are watching as security agencies and state institutions are out to kill multiparty democracy . The people of the mountain need to be reminded that it is those who are strongly protecting Jubilee from the claws of the regime that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forward . <h> NATIONAL NEWS <h> More on Capital News <p> This website uses cookies to improve your experience .

@@99529237 <p> NAIROBI , June 18 ( Xinhua ) -- A stronger collaboration between Chinese and African scientists has reinvigorated ongoing endeavors to combat desertification , restore landscapes across the continent , and accelerate its transition towards a greener future , said a Kenyan scholar . <p> Chinese and African scientists have been in lockstep to confront desertification and other ecological crises , said Robert Gituru , director of the Sino-Africa Joint Research Center ( SAJOREC ) , which is located on the main campus of Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology in central Kenya . China-Africa scientific research , which is embedded in the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative , has helped local efforts to halt the further spread of deserts in the continent caused by human activity and climate change , said Gituru . Commending China 's move to infuse green ethos in the Belt and Road infrastructure projects across Africa , he said that the continent is benefitting from the Asian country 's practices on regenerating ecosystems . " The green Belt and Road brings to us the thinking that in all our human development , always remember to incorporate environmental sustainability , whether it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gituru said . Since its official launch in 2013 , SAJOREC , which sits on 40 acres of land and has an expansive botanical garden , has been at the forefront of fostering collaborative research between African and Chinese scientists in diverse fields like agriculture and biodiversity conservation . Thanks to the establishment of SAJOREC , Kenyan scientists have been able to publish an inventory of the country 's rich flora and fauna , which is critical to generating tourism revenue , Gituru said . With the Chinese-funded research center , African scientists have been enlightened on cutting-edge but affordable technologies that promote drylands management , he added . Through collaborating with their Chinese partners , African scientists could also improve their capacity to harness microorganisms to control desertification , said the expert . Rapid economic development in China that aligns with ecological renewal has been an inspiration to African scientists in their quest for a solution to desertification and loss of species worsened by the climate crisis , Gituru said . <p> " I would be happy if the rest of the world and Africa which is our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for doing that , I can confidently say we have a helping hand from the Chinese people because they have that experience , " he added . <p> This website uses cookies to improve your experience .

@@99529238 <h> The problem with Sexual Reproductive Health in Kenya <p> The issue of sexual and reproductive health rights in Kenya as in the rest of the East African region remains problematic . Even as countries enact laws and sign international conventions committing to ensure access to services and information on the same , challenges stand in the way of respecting these rights including limited resources , misplaced priorities , lack of political goodwill , cultural norms , beliefs , and practices that fail to recognize the universality of these rights and their importance . Even worse is the fact that little effort is invested in ensuring community awareness , breaking cultural barriers to adopting and respecting these rights , and localizing the laws and conventions is done . <p> Kenya and other countries within the region have ratified several SRHR commitments since the recognition of SRHR as a human right at the 1994 International Conference on Population and Development ( ICPD ) and as an explicit target of SDGs . Some global and regional SRHR commitments include but are not limited to Generation Equality Forum ( GEF ) , ICPD25 , African Union Agenda 2063 , Maputo Plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa ( CARMMA ) , the Eastern and Southern Africa Ministerial Commitment on sexuality education and sexual and reproductive health services for adolescents and young people among others . <p> We are not short of policies in the country just as it is in other countries on the continent . What we lack is the political goodwill to implement the policies and enhance access to reproductive health services by our people . Many of the global commitments that our African Governments make remain in the board rooms where the meetings happen . We rarely localise the interventions and commitments on the same . <p> While institutions like the Reproductive Health Network Kenya ( RHNK ) and other partners have done a lot in expanding access to sexual and reproductive health rights and services in the country , targeting adolescents , caregivers and others , more support especially from the government is needed . <p> The implementation of the laws and policies on SRHR in the country remains problematic either because of extreme religious , cultural and or political standpoints . Because of moral and cultural beliefs , many people continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because many associate and perceive them to be strange and coming from outside the African continent . <p> We are concerned that several old-held cultural norms and moral stands by some opinion leaders , are increasingly influencing government agencies and discouraging them from getting involved in SRHR decision-making forums through weaponizing culture and religion , thus frustrating the implementation of SRHR commitments . This , they note has led to eroding of SRHR laws and increased intimidation , harassment , and attacks on SRHR healthcare providers , advocates , and persons seeking SRHR including key populations . <p> It 's sad the many people in reproductive age especially the youth and adolescents continue to suffer in silence because of lack of access to safe and legal abortion information and services , access to comprehensive sexuality education , access to contraceptives and related information . <p> We in the sector have urged for a holistic approach to addressing social drivers of risk such as lack of age-appropriate Sexual Reproductive Health information and youth-friendly services , poverty , and gender inequity , investing in education and implementation of existing policies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls , and investing in empowerment programs targeting parents/guardians and teachers . <p> Advertisement . Scroll to continue reading . <p> While we have legislated against regressive laws , policies , and practices that do not respect individuals ' autonomy and decision-making , the political will and support is missing to implement these commitments . They mostly remain on paper and are largely strange to our people . <p> Our experience with legal measures to ensure access to services and protection of sexual and reproductive health rights indicates that legislation alone is not sufficient , and a multi-sectoral approach is necessary . We need not only the political will but mass social mobilization and changing social norms and mindsets , localization of the interventions and resources , that allow the different sectors to play a role and influence the national discourse on the issue , sway public opinion , and assist in community mobilization towards change of behavior . <p> The Writer is the Executive Director , the Reproductive Health Network Kenya ( RHNK ) <p> This website uses cookies to improve your experience .

Ayuk says the continent is in its development stage and should be allowed to harness its natural resources to benefit its people . <p> Ayuk was speaking at a roundtable by Gazprom , which is part of events in the lead-up to the Russia-Africa Summit slated for next month in Russia . <p> The participants drawn from nine African countries including Kenya discussed the role of natural gas in the sustainable development of Africa . <p> It was noted that most countries on the African continent are still facing the problem of energy availability and their energy consumption remains below the world average . <p> According to expert estimates , Africa will generate over 60 pc of the global population growth by 2050 hence the demand for the commodity will increase . <p> " Taking into account the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant economic growth , which will be accompanied by a two-fold increase in energy consumption . In particular , the demand for natural gas will increase by 2.5 times " it was noted during the meeting held in South Africa . <p> It was further highlighted that the bulk of gas produced in Africa is exported abroad . For instance , every third person in Nigeria , the largest African LNG exporter , has no access to energy . <p> " This is why it is the availability of energy for the industry and population that will be of primary importance for Africa 's dynamic development " . <p> Food security <p> With food insecurity still a major concern , the potential role of gas in solving the problem was also one of the areas explored . <p> The experts observed that gas is a valuable raw material for the production of fertilizers which will increase crop yields . <p> Taking part in the Roundtable were Ilya Rogachev , Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Russian Federation to the SAR and concurrently to the Kingdom of Lesotho , Dmitry Khandoga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman of the African Energy Chamber , as well as representatives of business communities , experts and journalists from nine African countries : Algeria , Angola , Egypt , Ghana , Kenya , Mozambique , Nigeria , South Africa , and Tanzania . <p> The presentations provided information about the activities of Gazprom and the extensive scope of the Company 's competencies along the entire value chain of the gas business . <p> " Considering that the Government of the Republic of South Africa pursues the economy decarbonization policy , gas can become an effective solution to satisfy the demand for energy , as renewable energy sources can not provide uninterrupted energy supplies . Therefore , I believe that Gazprom 's experience in natural gas liquefaction and gas pipeline construction projects can be of interest to our South African partners , " said Ilya Rogachev . <p> " Wider use of natural gas will help Africa solve a number of problems , from economic to social and environmental ones .

Gazprom is open to discuss constructive and mutually beneficial proposals which could facilitate economic development and improve the lives of people in African countries , " said Dmitry Khandoga . <p> " More than 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa do not have electricity . And 900 million people , most of them women , do not have access to clean cooking technologies -- these technologies are either absent or there is a lack of them . Even if we look at this single problem alone , we see that it makes sense to use the rich gas resources of the continent .

@@99737238 <p> Economic experts in Kenya are calling for the implementation of procurement laws , especially on beneficial ownership , a key ingredient in the fight against corruption and Illicit Financial Flows ( IFFs ) . <p> The country is looking at a fiscal gap of about $6.2 billion ( Sh863 billion ) in the current 2022/23 financial year , according to data from the National Treasury . <p> This is amid the huge sums that the country is said to be losing on corruption annually , a sum that could be enough to cater for the fiscal deficit . <p> The economic think tank , Institute of Economic Affairs ( IEA ) , in one of their media sensitisation forums on procurement fraud early this year , said the government could serve the current fiscal gap with sealed corruption loopholes , instead of using debt and raising taxes to finance the gap . <p> Back in January 2021 , former president Uhuru Kenyatta while speaking to local vernacular stations , noted the country was losing approximately $14.5 million ( Sh2 billion ) daily to corruption . <p> This was reiterated by ODM party leader Raila Odinga in May last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Sh700 billion ) to corruption every year . <p> He was speaking in Vihiga county in a meeting with local leaders during his campaign tour , prior to the August 9 , 2022 , general elections . <p> When ranked by score , Kenya ranked 123rd among the 180 countries in the Index , where the country ranked first is perceived to have the most honest public sector . <p> Although some IFFs are difficult to be tracked due to sophisticated secrecy , a recent report by Transparency International Kenya indicates that Kenya losses an average of Sh40 billion every year since 2011 . <p> Eric Ngumbi , the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission ( EACC ) spokesperson , says that of all the cases investigated in the country on public funds embezzlement , over 80 per cent are procurement related , cutting across private and public sectors . <p> According to IEA , sabotage of the Beneficial Ownership Act is one major factor exacerbating procurement fraud , with proxies apprehended , letting the real faces behind the cult walk free . <p> A Partnership for African Social and Governance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost through procurement fraud ends up leaving the country as the culprits fear being traced , discovered , or will be forced to share the stolen money with other corrupt officials . <p> " In Kenya 's case , new laws and regulations have been inadequate to address IFFs ; there is a clear need for political will , tax reforms and accountability measures that provide sanctions and encourage compliance to deal with IFF , " the report says . <p> Kenya has been ineffective in combating IFFs partly because of uncoordinated financial institutions , loopholes in its several pieces of legislation and inadequate resources allocated to its relevant agencies and institutions , the report reads in part . <p> IEA echoes this , saying that most of the companies securing big tenders from the government are registered with pseudo-owners , frustrating the beneficial ownership act , which makes it difficult to trace the actual contributors and beneficiaries for prosecution in case of money losses . <p> " Some of these companies are owned by top government officials , others by individuals based outside the country , in tax haven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreements that are costing the country billions every year , " IEA says . <p> Executive director of Transparency International , Kenya Sheila Masinde , says there have been instances where companies involved in procurement fraud in the country have been found to be registered under pseudo-owners or individuals acting as proxies . <p> " This practice is employed to conceal the true beneficiaries and facilitate fraudulent activities . The use of pseudo-owners has made it hard to combat procurement fraud . " <p> She adds that it creates an environment that fosters impunity , as the individuals behind fraudulent activities can avoid accountability and legal consequences . <p> " Publishing registers with actual beneficial ownership information helps shine a light on secret corporate structures that can be exploited to launder the proceeds of corruption , hide conflicts of interest , improperly win lucrative government contracts and evade tax payments , " Masinde says . <p> She however acknowledges that Kenya is facing a hurdle in implementing beneficial ownership transparency measures which can be remedied through sustained commitment , adequate resources and continuous monitoring and evaluation to ensure effective implementation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act and supporting legislation can help detect and prevent fraud and other procurement ills , help strengthen tax collection by clamping down on tax evasion and enable citizens to hold rogue companies accountable . " <p> On their part , IEA also thinks legal action against real perpetrators will do good for the country . <p> The Constitution in Article 227 requires that public procurement be carried out in a system that is fair , equitable , transparent , competitive and cost-effective . <p> It insists that procurement processes in the past decade have not been transparent enough , posing significant challenges to the country 's economic development and public trust . <p> The government has in the past put in measures to curb corruption through procurement . <p> For instance , it issued executive order 2 of 2018 which subsequently established the public procurement information portal ( tenders.go.ke ) to try and enforce accountability . <p> This portal is meant to publish details of companies ( directors and beneficial owners ) , and contract amounts among other details . <p> Unfortunately , the compliance rate with this directive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ International Kenya . <p> Further data shows that only nine per cent of almost 4,000 procuring entities in the country have so far uploaded their contracts on the Public Procurement Information Portal ( PPIP ) . <p> Close to 91 per cent have not uploaded their contracts , suggesting either a widespread lack of compliance or worse contracts that are not fit for open scrutiny undermining the efforts for full disclosure of public contracts as envisaged in the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act . <p> " An additional provision in law that holds all the accounting officers at any level , accountable for any losses of public funds , should be provided , " Ngumbi says . <p> Another key step would be strengthening the due diligence process for company registration including robust verification mechanisms and comprehensive background checks to confirm the legitimacy of individuals claiming to be company owners or representatives . <p> This story was produced by Alfred Onyango .

@@99782239 <p> Financial Sector Deepening ( FSD ) Kenya and the Financial Access Initiative ( FAI ) research center of New York University , today presented the results of the Kenya Small Firm Diaries ( SFD ) study in Nairobi . <p> The Small Firm Diaries is a global research project being conducted between 2021 to 2023 in seven countries : Kenya , Nigeria , Uganda , Ethiopia , Indonesia , Fiji and Colombia . The study aims to improve the understanding of how small businesses can overcome the barriers they face in order to prosper in the modern economy , and thus contribute to reducing poverty . <p> In each country , a team of field researchers visited a sample of small business owners in low-income neighbourhoods weekly for one year to collect quantitative and qualitative data on their financial flows . This information shed light on the economic decision-making , strategies , and constraints of small businesses as they navigate uncertain situations . <p> Financial Sector Deepening ( FSD ) Kenya and the Financial Access Initiative ( FAI ) research center of New York University anticipate that these results will inform the design of future development policies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees to prosper . <p> The study was funded by the Argidius Foundation , the Aspen Network of Development Entrepreneurs ( ANDE ) , the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation , Financial Sector Deeping Kenya , and the Mastercard Center for Inclusive Growth . <p> Results from the Kenya study <p> In Kenya , the research was carried out in Kisumu , Kwale and Nairobi counties between October 2021 and October 2022 . <p> The study found that although the Kenya sample has the largest group of firms that have been open for 7 years or more compared to other countries in the study , it is in the middle of the pack in terms of monthly revenue , with 75% of the firms making less than KShs 240,000 . This level of revenue affects the quality of life for employees , with approximately two thirds of staff interviewed reporting struggling to have enough money to obtain necessary items for their families . <p> Key findings from the study are as follows : <p> Financial inclusion : Approximately 60% of small firm owners in Kenya have bank accounts which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is uneven with the majority of these firms moving less than a quarter of their transactions through bank accounts . <p> Mobile money : Kenya is a large positive outlier in mobile wallet ownership with nearly 70% of the respondents stating they use a mobile money account for their businesses . However , usage is still low , with the majority of these firms using their accounts for a small percentage of their overall transaction value . <p> Variety of sectors : The study was focused on three industries -- light manufacturing , agri-processing , and services -- which all play a vital role in Kenya 's economic development and sustainability . Half the firms in the Kenyan sample are engaged in small-scale manufacturing such as carpentry , metal work , and construction ; 20% in services such as printing , car and bike repair and maintenance ; and 26% in agri-processing industries such as meat and fish preservation and food preparation . Small firms play a critical role in these sectors , unlocking value for local economies . <p> Business stability : Like those in the global sample , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in unpredictable and hard to manage ways from month-to-month . However , despite access to finance being the third-largest barrier to firm owners ' vision for success , many firm owners from the global sample , including those in Kenya , say they " rarely " or " never " need a loan . <p> Credit life : When requesting loans , the firms analysed say that working capital is a bigger need than investment capital . They frequently look to sources other than banks , such as their own suppliers , for loans , and rarely take any operating risk that could result in negative monthly cash flow . These facts help confirm their need for working capital to cover liquidity needs . <p> Job security : Kenyan firms seem to offer a bit more stability of employment to key employees compared to firms in other countries in the study . Still , only half of the small firm employees got paid 8 months or more in a 10-month period ; a quarter of employees worked at the same firm for fewer than 5 months of that period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth is a priority for the entrepreneurs interviewed . According to the research , these companies face high volatility in their income and expenses . They cited " rising costs and supply problems " as the main barrier to achieving their vision of growth and stability . <p> " We see that these entrepreneurs do have aspirations to grow , and they are dynamic , constantly working toward those goals . But that dynamism often translates into just overcoming the volatility and risk they face , rather than moving them toward achieving their goals . Every time they are able to seize an opportunity , they have to contend with a wave knocking them back -- particularly because of a lack of liquidity and working capital . Policies and financial tools that allow them to manage volatility can enable these entrepreneurs to contribute much more to the economy and development of the country , " noted Timothy Ogden , Managing Director of the global study and of the Financial Access Initiative at NYU . <p> " This study is instrumental in unravelling the intricate dynamics of the financial behaviours , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including Kenya . By delving into the daily realities faced by small firms , the Small Firm Diaries study equips us with crucial insights to inform evidence-based interventions and policies that can drive sustainable economic growth . It offers an invaluable opportunity to identify gaps in financial services and develop innovative solutions tailored to the unique needs of small firms . FSD Kenya is committed to leveraging the findings from this study to enhance financial inclusion , foster entrepreneurship , and unlock the full potential of small firms in driving economic prosperity for individuals and communities alike , " says Tamara Cook , Chief Executive Officer at Financial Sector Deepening ( FSD ) Kenya . <p> " Mastercard recognises the immense potential of small businesses and the pivotal role they play in driving economic growth and creating opportunities . Understanding the needs and challenges faced by small firms through such studies is critical to fostering the creation of a more supportive ecosystem for small businesses that will drive innovation , job creation , and economic prosperity , " says Shehryar Ali , Country Manager for East Africa at Mastercard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Overview and the Financial Access Report -- are just the beginning of the analysis and insight the study will deliver . Financial Sector Deepening Kenya and the Financial Access Initiative are working together to glean further insights and collaborate with partners in the public and private sectors to the benefit of small firms in Kenya . <p> The study aims to guide the policies and practices of a wide variety of actors and stakeholders . The results may be used by others in their own independent research to address the challenges facing MSMEs in low- and middle-income communities in Kenya , and around the world . <p> Lastly , it allows companies and governments to design or improve products and programmes that increase the capacity and productivity of small businesses . It will also enable organisations to design financial services products , including digital financial services , that better meet the liquidity and investment needs of SMEs so that they can expand their businesses in terms of income , productivity , employment , and wages paid . <p> This website uses cookies so that we can provide you with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your browser and performs functions such as recognising you when you return to our website and helping our team to understand which sections of the website you find most interesting and useful . <p> Strictly Necessary Cookies <p> Strictly Necessary Cookie should be enabled at all times so that we can save your preferences for cookie settings . <p> Enable or Disable Cookies <p> If you disable this cookie , we will not be able to save your preferences .

@@100153238 <p> Financial terrorism has become a significant concern in today 's world , with terrorist organizations exploiting financial systems and resources to support their activities . While the term " financial terrorism " may have varied interpretations , it generally encompasses illicit fund movements , money laundering , and the financing of terrorist groups . <p> In this article , we will explore the implications of financial terrorism and its relevance to civil society organizations ( CSOs ) , particularly those involved in peace and security initiatives , including prevention , and countering violent extremism ( P/CVE ) . <p> Recent security reports indicate a surge in attacks in Kenya 's Garissa and Lamu counties , which experts attribute to counter-offensives in Somalia . These operations have forced the extremist group al-Shabaab to seek refuge in neighboring countries , leading to an increase in illicit trade and smuggling across the Kenya-Somalia border .

Additionally , they may seek funds from sympathizers and manipulate unwitting CSOs to support their activities . <p> To effectively address the risks associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be aware of potential vulnerabilities within their organizations . Weak controls , lack of transparency , and inadequate oversight can make CSOs susceptible to exploitation by terrorist organizations for financing purposes . Therefore , conducting thorough risk assessments is crucial to identify these vulnerabilities , including areas such as transportation , storage facilities , and communication networks that can be misused by terrorists . <p> Furthermore , CSOs can play a proactive role in advocating for policies and regulations that strike a balance between preventing terrorism financing and protecting the legitimate activities of civil society . This can be achieved through grassroots engagements with communities , consultations with policymakers , and contributing to the development of effective AML/CTF frameworks . <p> CSOs must remain vigilant and adapt to the evolving nature of financial terrorism . Technological advancements , such as the use of artificial intelligence ( AI ) , have provided new avenues for terrorist groups to exploit financial systems .

@@100585236 <h> Cyber governance in Africa is weak . Taking the Malabo Convention seriously would be a good start <p> Several African countries are pursuing digital transformation ambitions -- applying new technologies to enhance the development of society . But concerns exist over the absence of appropriate policies across the continent to create a resilient and secure cyber environment . <h> What is cyber governance and why is it so important ? <p> Cyber governance is an important aspect of the international cybersecurity strategy for preventing and mitigating cyber threats . It features oversight processes , decision-making hierarchies and international cooperation . It also includes systems for accountability and responsible state behaviour in cyberspace . In recent years , cyber governance has been prominent in diplomatic and political agendas when regions or countries need to work together . <p> To promote digital transformation , cyberspace must be made secure and stable , using appropriate governance standards . <p> Digital transformation offers Africa tremendous opportunities . These include the economic empowerment of citizens , transparent governance and less corruption . But digital transformation can only happen on the continent if its digital spaces are trusted , secure and resilient . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratified the convention . These include Ghana , Mauritius , Togo and Rwanda . <p> Cyber governance has political dimensions . African countries are rooted in historical and cultural contexts that have an impact on politics and governance . Governance mechanisms in the region are further affected by political instability and conflicts . <p> The borderless nature of cyberspace presents particular challenges . This is especially so for African states that are accustomed to controlling activities in their territory . <p> The result of this has been a misunderstanding of cyber governance . This has manifested in internet shutdowns and restrictions of online activities for citizens . We have seen recent examples of this in Senegal , Burkina Faso , Ethiopia and Nigeria . <p> African leaders ' views on regulating the digital space vary . This is clear from their reluctance to ratify the Malabo Convention . <p> Often , international standards collide with the realities of developing states . This is true for states in Africa that are on the wrong side of the digital divide . This means they lack the capacity , skills and infrastructure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutional and technical capacity implies that effective cyber governance may not exist in practice for Africa . <h> What needs to happen to bring all countries in line ? <p> Preserving cyber stability is a collaborative effort . African countries need to find ways to work together to foster appropriate policies or strategies . Adopting the Malabo Convention would show that countries see the importance of cooperation in governing the digital environment . <p> Greater coordination is also necessary at a regional level . For example , the Southern African Development Community has adopted a model law on cybercrime . The Economic Community of West African States has developed a directive on fighting cybercrime . Regional organisations have a key role to play in formulating policies and delivering outcomes . <p> Beyond ratifying the Malabo Convention , African states must also rethink best practices and the value of strategic regional partnerships . These partnerships are important because they create shared responsibility in a borderless space . <p> Africa must approach diplomacy strategically in this space and seek increased representation at global dialogues . The African Union remains largely absent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implies that African interests , realities and domestic capabilities wo n't get enough attention in the processes . There is also a need to bridge the institutional and technical gaps that have prevented African states from participating fully . <p> Committing to the Malabo Convention would provide a framework for united cyber governance norms and standards across the continent . As the international community continues to define these standards , Africa should be included . <h> More on Capital News <p> This website uses cookies to improve your experience .

@@100585237 <p> At an emergency meeting in Abuja , Nigeria , on 30 July , the Economic Community of West African States ( ECOWAS ) demanded the " immediate release and reinstatement " of Niger 's elected president , Mohamed Bazoum . He had been held by the military since 19 July . <p> The regional bloc gave the military in Niger a one-week ultimatum to comply and warned it would take all measures necessary -- including force -- to restore constitutional order . <p> On 28 July , the head of Niger 's presidential guard , General Abdourahamane Tchiani , declared himself head of state after the military seized power . <p> Beyond warning against any regional and foreign interventions , the military leaders in Niger have given no indications of ways forward . <p> This coup d'etat will have a significant impact on peace and stability in Niger and the entire Sahel region . <p> Although Niger has recently enjoyed its longest democratic rule since independence , there has been a constant threat of coups . When Bazoum was elected president in 2021 , there was a coup attempt about 48 hours before his inauguration . It failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a political scientist with expertise on international security , conflict analysis and governance in Africa , including knowledge on Niger , I explained then , the coup attempt pointed to deep fissures in the country . It suggested that the military had not fully embraced democracy . <p> The current coup plotters have blamed rising insecurity and a lack of economic growth . They stated that the intervention was necessary to avoid " the gradual and inevitable demise " of the country . I believe , however , there are other issues that precipitated the latest coup d'etat . These are : ethnicity ; the presence of foreign forces ; and the weakness of regional bodies . <h> Factors that led to the coup <p> Despite the increase in foreign forces , especially from the US and France , and military bases in Niger , the leadership has been unable to stop insurgent attacks . There are several insurgent groups , such as Al-Qaeda and Islamic State affiliates , as well as Boko Haram operating in the country . <p> These attacks have resulted in thousands of deaths and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capital , Niamey , gathered to celebrate the July coup , waving Russian flags and chanting " Wagner " . This suggests that some people in Niger believe the military , supported by Russia and the private military contractor , Wagner group , would do a better job of fighting insurgents . <p> In addition to insecurity and economic stagnation , three other issues help explain the recent coup d'etat . <p> First , the debate over the ethnicity and legitimacy of Bazoum was an issue during the last election campaign . Bazoum is from Niger 's ethnic Arab minority and has always been labelled as having foreign origins . <p> This did not sit well within the military circle , which is predominantly composed of the larger ethnic groups -- even though Bazoum got about 56% of the vote and is from the same party as former president Mahamadou Issoufou . <p> There is a lot of emphasis on ethnic military composition in the country ; understanding this helped Issoufou complete two terms as president . Appointments in the military are made along ethnic lines . <p> Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country has not been well received by the military . They believe this undermines them . Niger is a key ally of western countries in the fight against insurgency in the region . France 's huge investments in Niger 's mining sector are another reason for its interest in security . <p> In 2019 , the US opened a drone base in Niger despite protests . As I have pointed out before , the drone base could make Niger a target for terrorists and increase instability . <p> In 2022 , France and other European allies withdrew their forces from neighbouring Mali . Bazoum was quick to invite them to Niger . The Nigerien military leadership and some influential individuals in the country denounced the increase in foreign forces . <p> Advertisement . Scroll to continue reading . <p> Third , I suggest the failure of regional organisations such as ECOWAS and the African Union to take a firm stance against military power seizures in Guinea , Burkina Faso and Mali emboldened the Nigerien military . ECOWAS leaders have now threathened to use force to restore Bazoum if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last four years , there have been seven coup d'etats in the region . Three were successful . Leaders of ECOWAS and the African Union have threatened sanctions on these three countries , but nothing much has been done to deter other opportunistic military leaders . <p> In a round table organised by the think tank Chatham House London on the impact of military intervention in west Africa , one of the leaders from the region stated that they kept avenues of communication open with the three military presidents as a courtesy . This creates an impression that there is no deterrence for military takeovers . <h> Implications for Niger and the region <p> The latest coup d'etat has severe consequences for Niger and the entire Sahel region . Niger is a strong ally of western nations , especially France , the US and the European Union in fighting insurgency and curbing illegal migration to Europe . <p> Efforts to address these issues will be affected . And the new military leaders will want to use these issues as leverage in negotiations and to force acceptance of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage with the Wagner group to combat the Islamist insurgency . The leader of the group has already praised them for seizing power . The influence of Russia and Wagner in the region could grow . <p> Yet Wagner has been unable to halt terrorist advancement in Mali and Burkina Faso . <p> Finally , a successful military takeover in Niger would be a major drawback for democracy in the region and Africa as a whole . The military regimes of Guinea , Mali and Burkina Faso already plan to form a " military alliance " , supposedly to combat insecurity . <p> African leaders need to do more to prove that they are working for the masses . <p> This website uses cookies to improve your experience .

The ceremony was led by Chinese Minister of Tourism and Culture Hu Heping and his Kenyan counterpart Peninah Malonza . The journey towards publishing of this book started in 2017 and KLB is the only sole co-publisher in the entire African continent . <p> " I am glad to learn that friends in many countries , including Kenya , are very keen to know more about the experiences of China 's development , and the governance philosophy and practices of the Chinese leadership .

The four-volume collection of speeches and writings articulates Xi Jinping Thoughts , Xi 's political philosophy in relation to large-scale political issues related to China , including economics , domestic politics , international relations , infrastructure , technology , environment , peaceful coexistence , and the military . <p> China 's people-centred approach has united the citizens across the country 's socioeconomic spectrum .

It is one of the pillars of creating a modern socialist country that has the full trappings of a modern , thriving and free market -- without capitalism . During the 20th National Congress in October 2022 , the CPC presented its plan to build an all-round modern socialist country within the coming decade . <p> While modernization efforts have resulted in massive economic development in various spheres , Chinese citizens have also enjoyed transformation in their lives .

@@104135240 <h> 4 East African countries are going for nuclear power -- why this is a bad idea <p> Another factor that motivates many potential entrants to nuclear power is that it has historically been perceived in many quarters as confirmation of high technological status and proof of national respectability . <p> The east Africa region has the fastest growing population in Africa . Between 2013 and 2017 , its growth rate was twice the African average . The region is also experiencing strong economic growth . It 's sub-Saharan share of GDP has risen from 14% in 2000 to 21% in 2022 . <p> Such growth translates to higher electricity demand . Among a variety of new energy proposals is building nuclear power plants . Earlier this year , Uganda announced plans to construct a 2,000MW nuclear plant 150km north of Kampala , with the first 1,000MW operational by 2031 . Rwanda also recently signed up to a deal to build a nuclear reactor , while Kenya and Tanzania have made more or less similar announcements . <p> It is in many ways tempting for these countries to pursue a nuclear power plant build . Even a single large-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In addition , it is technology that is -- in theory at least -- able to provide a constant electricity output independent of weather , season or time of day . <p> Another factor that motivates many potential entrants to nuclear power is that it has historically been perceived in many quarters as confirmation of high technological status and proof of national respectability . This is despite many of the world 's technologically and economically strongest nations now having shut down their nuclear plants . Germany and Italy are examples . <p> But there are several risks of choosing the nuclear path . The biggest in my view is financial . The costs of constructing , maintaining and later decommissioning a nuclear plant make this one of the most expensive forms of electricity generation . The actual cost is invariably a lot higher than originally announced . <p> Along with that , the construction period is usually many years longer than declared at the start . <p> In addition , safety issues can never be discounted when dealing with nuclear energy , as the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan amply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are two arguments against new nuclear as currently considered by east African countries . <p> The first is financial . The construction cost of a new nuclear plant typically stands at about US$5 billion per 1,000MW . The cost of a 2,000MW build in Uganda would be of the order of that country 's annual total tax revenue . As such , the project would rely on massive loans , which also come with considerable interest . <p> Advertisement . Scroll to continue reading . <p> The second is the risk of complete political and economic dependence on the nuclear build sponsor country . France , South Korea and China are building a small number of nuclear plants outside their borders . China is now part of the Ugandan nuclear project . <p> But the country that has been by far most aggressive in promoting itself as an international nuclear plant developer is Russia . In 2019 it had already secured nuclear cooperation agreements with 18 African countries , with several more concluded more recently . <p> To circumvent the prohibitive costs , Russian nuclear developers have offered to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years after the start of construction , and continue for several decades thereafter . The drawback is that the country develops a strong long-term dependence on Russia to meet one of its most basic needs : electricity provision . <p> The situation has been made more risky by the uncertainty of Russia 's full-scale war in Ukraine . The fallout from this war may well ruin and lead to the complete overhaul of the Russian state . This would result in the disruption and ultimate termination of projects already in progress , with the concurrent loss of all funding and resources invested up to that point . <h> East Africa 's likely future energy mix <p> In view of the financial risk and high cost , and as global experience has shown that it typically requires ten or more years to set up a new nuclear plant from project approval to electricity production , east African countries should pursue alternatives for electricity production . <p> New medium-scale solar , wind and geothermal power-generating facilities would likely dominate the expansion of east African electricity generation capacity in the coming decade as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also much lower than nuclear or hydro megaprojects . <p> Take hydropower generation , which uses the natural flow of moving water to produce electricity . This source of power has been the most significant in east Africa for decades . Building more dams is both time consuming and at times controversial . Nevertheless , major projects using this technology are currently still being built . An example is the 2,115MW Julius Nyerere hydropower station in Tanzania . <p> Solar power -- the conversion of energy from sunlight into electricity -- has an extremely low footprint in the region at the moment . Yet it is now one of the cheapest forms of electricity generation . Most countries in the region have extensive areas suitable for harnessing this source . <p> While not enjoying the wind resources of the Earth 's oceans and mid-latitudes , wind farms can be considered in places , and are already in operation , such as in Kenya 's Lake Turkana region . <p> Advertisement . Scroll to continue reading . <p> East Africa furthermore has the Rift Valley and its volcanic activity in places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology that converts the intense underground heat associated with cracks in the Earth 's crust to electricity . This is already the leading electricity generation mode in Kenya and could be developed elsewhere . <p> Given all these factors , investing in a large and expensive nuclear build with uncertain completion timeframes that may end up being way more expensive than projected is ultimately simply not worth it . <p> Hartmut Winkler Professor of Physics , University of Johannesburg <h> Disclosure statement <p> Hartmut Winkler receives funding from the South African National Research Foundation .
