@@109240 <h> Cellphones <h> 10 <p> Days after HTC unveiled its 2013 flagship phone -- the One -- the company 's Singapore representatives met up with the media here to share a number of near-final versions of the quite stunning phone . <p> If I had doubts about the HTC One earlier , I now can say it 's clearly raised the bar for all its rivals . Not only is the camera unusually good , the build is top-notch and the Sense interface seems intuitive . <p> First off , the look and feel . The aluminium case is an eye-catching piece of work , as is the rest of the design . The 143-gram phone feels slightly weightier than some rivals but should appeal to users who do n't like Samsung 's rather plasticky feel . <p> The HTC One comes in both silver and black when it ships in Singapore in March ( no prices yet for now ) , but the silver is clearly nicer . It is able to show off the details on its back much better , while the black one seems like a monobloc . <p> If you remember , HTC had tried making full-metal cases before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use plastic to encase its antenna to avoid signal issues . This time round , HTC has managed to integrate the antenna right on the case itself , with what it calls a " zero-gap " design . <p> The result : the best build I 've seen in a gadget for a long time . Though I 'm not a fan of the iPhone 5 , I 'd readily say it has a great build . The HTC One surely is up there as well . <p> It 's clear why : HTC wants to target the iPhone switcher . Too many of these users have defaulted to Samsung , because the Korean company seems to be the closest Android rival . Plus , it has loads more marketing dollars to burn than HTC . <p> Another department which HTC does very well in is photography -- another strong point on the iPhone . The HTC One , I dare say , will rival just about any phone , even some compact cameras , for snapshots . <p> You 'll notice , upon seeing the phone for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the phone 's body . Unlike many phones these days with lens popping out , you do n't have to worry about damaging the lens as easily here . <p> In dim light , it does very well . At the restaurant where HTC hosted the media last week , I managed to fire away some pictures of the Chinese New Year lunch . The contrast , sharpness and brightness , even in the rather dimly-lit place , were impressive . Turning on HDR ( high dynamic range ) helped capture even more dramatic pictures . <p> Here are a sample taken without flash ( food pictures are taken with HTC One ; snaps of the phone are -- poorly -- taken by my own phone ) . <p> Not just me , but many members of the media at the table were quite surprised at the effect of HTC 's UltraPixel technology . In a nutshell , the camera is able to capture more light in each pixel , thus making for sharper and brighter images . <p> The lens captures only 4 megapixels , at a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smartphones , but it certainly does n't lose out where it matters most -- quality . <p> Besides the clearly impressive shooter , there are a number of other fancy features that HTC has incorporated in the One . Its Zoe mode automatically saves a few seconds of video before you snap a picture , so you can later view the video before the shot to recall what the context was . <p> At the same time , it saves several frames so you can select the best of them to combine into a perfect picture . If you have a frame where someone had closed her eyes , but where the candles were still burning on a cake , you can " mesh " that with another frame where she has her eyes open . <p> The result is a not really a perfect moment that you actually captured , but the best one moment combined from several moments . My photographer friends will decry this , but yes , you can now " fake " a moment without even trying . The HTC One does it for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has put in lots of hard work in this new phone . Certainly , when it comes to hardware , the HTC One does n't lose to anyone . <p> The quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 processor running at 1.7GHz is the latest and can be counted on to move things along smoothly . Helped by the onboard 2GB RAM , it certainly does n't slow down at all when I tried switching between tasks last week . <p> For sure , the engine under the hood has to keep up with all the interface changes that HTC has created . The company says its Sense interface is not " just a widget " but is built into the operating system . Indeed , you 'll find that this is one Android phone quite different from others on first startup . <p> The Blinkfeed tile-like interface brings all your social media updates , news feeds and other information bits on one screen for you to " snack on " throughout the day , say , when you 're bored at a meeting . <p> It 's remarkably easy to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widget , the HTC folks are quick to say , this front page feed is not a removable widget but a key differentiator for the company . <p> If you want your old icon-based menu , of course , you can still do that . Just slide across the various screens and you still have them . <p> HTC has other tweaks that takes a little getting used to , for example , the lack of a " menu " button . To do that , you can double tap on the Home button , which is only accompanied by the Back button . <p> No big deal , I think . I found myself tapping on the HTC logo instead of where the Home button is usually placed , but I can get used to it . <p> At the same time , it 's true , task switching is not something I do so often on a phone . On a tablet though , HTC will have to be careful of doing away with the instant task switching button , because users may use their tablets more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed with the HTC One . The Taiwanese phone maker , as I 'd imagined , had really pulled out all the stops this year , after a somewhat disappointing 2012 . <p> There are many , many little things here that make for a phone that is really well-thought out . If the HTC One X wowed you last year , the One this year really turns things on . <p> I have n't spent much time discussing the new phone 's screen quality , because I had expected the Full HD resolution to be extremely sharp , and 4.7-inch display did n't disappoint with its sharpness . Another thing I was impressed with was the speakers cleverly built in the front , rather than the back , so you can hear your music and calls more clearly . <p> With so much built into the HTC One , how does the 2,300mAh battery hold up ? I did n't try out the phone long enough to assess this , but I 'll have updates here if I manage to try it out again . <p> Between the excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly with the HTC One . Actually , I 'd say this is the phone to buy now . <p> Only caveat here is to wait and see what Samsung will unveil soon when its next Galaxy phone is out in March . The Korean phone maker will know the game has been taken up a notch . <p> Pls never take pictures of food to show any camera capabilities because turns many off instantly loosing interest to finalise reading your good review . Thank you Lassandari <p> Dey <p> Hey Alfred , anymore images to share ? And are you going to do a full review of the phone anytime soon ? <p> I saw the CNET Asia comparison of the HTC One and iPhone 5 with the editors saying the HTC One 's camera losing out .. do you agree ? <p> http : //twitter.com/alfsiew Alfred Siew <p> I hope to get hold of the phone more than the short time I had over lunch last week but I 'm not sure when that would be . My first impressions is that it does very well under low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on me to compare . I 've seen other pictures on an iPhone and I 've been impressed too . Just on first impressions , I think the HTC should match or be close at least to most rivals . <p> hohopig <p> You did not talk about the important things -- how 's the battery life and did HTC finally did away with the abysmal multi tasking setting ( or lack there of ) in the HTC One X ? Is it still having a non-removable battery and does it have MicroSD slot ? Does it still limit you to an arbitary 2GB of apps space ? and ... so many more limitation .

Hope they have truly changed ... if not then their product is worth nothing in my eye . <p> http : //twitter.com/alfsiew Alfred Siew <p> Yes , battery life is one thing I could n't test as I had it for a short while only .

Speaking with All Things D 's Walt Mossberg and Karla Swisher , the successor to the visionary Steve Jobs reveals Apple 's future plans as well as feelings towards products from competition ( Google of course ) . <p> Cook explains the absence of an iPhone phablet <p> When Mossberg asked the golden question on everyone 's mind as to why Apple produces only a single model of the iPhone considering the various models of the legendary iPod , Cook answered " We have n't so far , but it does n't shut off the future , " saying which the executive left the doors open to the possibility of the popular rumor that Apple is working on a budget , low-priced iPhone . Leaked screenshots from a couple of weeks ago revealed multiple color models with removable back covers , completely opposite to the design mantra followed by Cupertino firm . <p> Cook explains ( and a very satisfactory explanation at that ) the lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work involved in porting software , designing hardware and getting features to work on a different form factor and screen size without losing the prime focus , i.e .. to provide the absolute best ( and smoothest ) experience to end users . When asked the long standing question to explain the lack of an iPhone phablet , the executive responded by saying that a large screen brings about a ton of new challenges ; screen brightness , battery life as well as life of the display ( longevity ) have to be taken into consideration . <p> Wearable computing is interesting , but Google Glass not a " mass market device " <p> Apple CEO played it cool when the discussion steered towards wearable computing . Tim Cook called the market interesting and predicted that a lot of companies will end up selling products in the actively developing sphere . We suspect Apple themselves to be working on an iWatch , a shame if they are n't really . Cook praised Nike 's FuelBand fitness tracker , probably because the device connects easily to his iPhone ( hey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> When the topic of Google Glass came out , Cook coolly stated that Glass is a " niche " product rather than a mass market product , probably due to its high cost . Funny ( if that is indeed the reason ) , this coming from the CEO of a company selling over high priced products ( at least now , when Android products have truly caught up ) . The executive simply finds wearing a device on his wrist better , but does state that the wearable computing market is " ripe for exploration . " <p> " I think the wrist is interesting ... " <p> Cook 's repeated insistence on a wrist wearing device might be a hint to the fabled iWatch , which KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes is definitely coming in 2014 with a 1.5-2 inch display and the usual " deep " integration with other iDevices . <p> On the future of Apple and new products <p> Face it folks , Apple as an innovator has really struggled ever since the sad demise and departure of Steve Jobs . When was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't rack your gray cells , it was the Apple iPad . The 9.7 inch tablet literally shaped the market and sparked off the transition to a more tablet oriented market . Look around you , you see Microsoft 's Surface and Google Nexus tablets as a reaction to the amazing reception that the iPad received ( and still receives ) . The tablet literally killed the netbook market ( ouch Intel ) . The iPad Mini did n't leave an impression on anyone , and the new iPhone 5 is more of a catering to public demand ( we want a bigger phone , and other rational wants ) than an innovative piece of hardware . <p> I do ! <p> Walt Mossberg and Kara Swisher asked the CEO of Apple Inc. point blank if the company still had game-changing technology up its sleeve . The answer ? <p> " We have several more game changers in us . " <p> Well Apple , I have to say that if an iWatch is what you mean by that statement , we are n't going to be impressed . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be out ( half of them probably different models by Samsung itself ) and the iWatch wo n't be a game-changing element . It 's a watch , it shows time ( as all watches should ) and has some handy synchronization features . Nope , not impressive . <p> Apple becoming a more " Open " company <p> That 's not all folks ! Tim Cook also made some comments on porting Apple apps to Android ( to which he was surprisingly easy-going and cool about , perhaps a hint of things apps to come ? ) . Cook also stated that Apple as a company is opening up . " I think you will see us open up more in the future " said Cook , but was quick to add " But not to the degree that we put the customer at risk of having a bad experience .

Tatang and Daniel perform their hits on day-release from prison clandestinely arranged for them to provide the perfect alibi .

@@296235 <p> Last year , MIT Game Labs released a physics simulating game called " A slower speed of light " . The game , which is available for free on PC , Linux and Mac , is centered around collecting orbs which lower the speed of light successively until you manage to bring it down to zero . Now , the engine which powers the game is being released open source to the game-developer community at large . The engine simulates the very strange and fantastical effects of near light speed velocities and makes them accessible for us to experiment and play with . <p> You see , light speed is n't quite as simple as it would appear in Star Wars . What sci-fi usually portrays as light beams flying out towards you , is more akin to an acid trip in real life . When you approach the speed of light , two effects will begin to change your perception of the world around you . The first of these effects , Lorentz contraction , arises from he fact that nothing can travel faster than the speed of light in vacuum . To account for this , distances appear to contract in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light seemingly begins to bend around objects . This will allow such impossible feats as seeing the back of an object you 're approaching while you 're in front of it . The second effect , color shift , is similar to the Doppler effect you experience when police sirens approach or leave you and seem to have different pitches : Approaching a light source at near light speed means the light waves become " compressed " and experience a pitch , or rather , a color change . the visible colors like red and blue will fall out of the visible spectrum and be replaced by colors we ca n't normally see , like ultra violet , infrared and even microwaves . <p> The OpenRelativity engine allows for a game to simulate these effects as realistically as science can predict they 'd actually be like to experience .

@@306233 <p> With the European season over , Goal looks at the business set to be done by the Bianconeri this summer <p> ANALYSISBy Kris Voakes <p> Over the past 24 months , Juventus have barely put a foot wrong . An unbeaten Scudetto triumph in 2011-12 took them back to the top of the Italian game for the first time since Calciopoli , with a Coppa Italia final appearance thrown in to boot . That was followed up with another league title last term alongside a last-eight spot in their return to the Champions League . <p> Now the challenge for Antonio Conte and his players is to maintain their dominance in Italy while furthering their pedigree on the continent . With Juve 's relationship with glory having been rekindled , their need to reinforce their squad is clear . In football , to stand still is to step backwards , and president Andrea Agnelli and director general Giuseppe Marotta have already been making strides to improve the club 's playing resources ahead of a key campaign in the regrowth of the club at the top end of the game . <p> Goal looks at the potential comings and goings to see how Juventus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PLAYERS <p> If Juve have had one constant issue in their two Scudetto-winning campaigns it has been their lack of quality in front of goal and that has certainly been foremost in the minds of their transfer chiefs looking ahead to the summer market . <p> Fernando Llorente has already been brought on board in a Bosman free transfer which will add a level of goalscoring talent to their forward line , but more resources are being sought to ensure Juve make a sincere effort to become untouchable at home and a serious challenger abroad . <p> Another target is Fiorentina 's Stevan Jovetic , who has said he feels honoured to be linked with a club as important as Juve . However , while a ? 4.5m annual package over five years would appear to be enough for the player , the Tuscan outfit are currently unwilling to move from their ? 30m valuation . Arsenal also appear to be ahead in the race , currently . Juve are hoping to offer midfielder Luca Marrone as a part-exchange in order to bring the asking price down to ? 12m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clubs at this point . <p> Fall-back options to add to the strikeforce include Manchester City 's Carlos Tevez , former Juve forward Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Bologna 's Italy international Alessandro Diamanti . Of the three , it would appear that most progress has been made with Diamanti , but Jovetic is seen as a more desirable option , while Barcelona 's Alexis Sanchez will not be ruled out as a possible target . <p> Beyond the forward line , there is also a thirst for further strength in depth defensively , with Torino 's Angelo Ogbonna number one on the club 's hitlist . The Italy international could move across the city in return for Ciro Immobile and Frederik Sorensen , with Juve again looking to offset spending by shipping out players who may not have a long-term future in black and white . <p> OUTGOING PLAYERS <p> Fringe players acting as part-exchange fodder are not the only men set for the exit door at Vinovo . With Juventus ' extensive search for new centre-forward , there will be a desire to offload strikers who have n't quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that list is Alessandro Matri , who went from being the club 's top scorer to a bit-part in the space of 12 months . Following a largely successful first six months at the club - even during his 10-goal term in 2011-12 - there were many doubting his qualities as a born finisher , and his reduced deployment this season has further compromised his position as a key member of the first-team squad . The club could well be ready to cash in while he still has some worth in the transfer market , with a year sat on the bench behind further new strikers only likely to making him more worthless as an asset . <p> Another striker who could face the axe is Fabio Quagliarella , who has never sustained his position as a first choice since a season-ending knee surgery in January 2011 . He is now being hunted by a number of Serie A clubs , including Inter and former sides Udinese and Sampdoria , while Fiorentina could well accept the marksman as part of a deal to allow Jovetic to leave for Turin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , could be Mirko Vucinic . The ex-Roma front man has had his agents looking for suitors across the continent , with the Premier League his preferred destination , although there is no sign yet that either Arsenal or Tottenham - who have been allegedly contacted by his advisors - having a strong interest . <p> Following a difficult first term after Juve bought half of his rights from Udinese , Mauricio Isla could be on the move again this summer . The wing-back has struggled to have the impact in Turin that he had in the north east of Italy and is another player who may be used to reduce the cash outlay that the club could be forced into in order to achieve their aims on the market . <p> Arturo Vidal and Stephan Lichtsteiner are leading the list of players being targeted by top clubs across the continent , with Bayern Munich and Real Madrid respectively said to have shown a serious interest and the latter having been linked with a possible exchange as part of a deal for Higuain , but Juve are expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both first-team regulars . <p> COACH <p> The only question mark over Antonio Conte has been his appetite to continue in the face of countless challenges . After his touchline ban for not reporting match-fixing while coach of Siena , he returned to the sideline only to quickly find himself rallying against other perceived injustices . <p> Following the Bianconeri 's exit from the Champions League at the hands of Bayern Munich , Conte was quick to put Italian football in its place , becoming the most high-profile person to speak of Calcio 's issues . The outburst had many thinking that the coach could be set to throw in the towel and move abroad but , for now , he appears as committed as ever to the Juve cause . <p> There is still some doubt as to whether he will remain at the club in the long term given his tendency to bounce from club to club so far during his coaching career and the reservations he has about the current state of the game in Italy , but for now he still has his heart set on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> VERDICT <p> The moves that Juve have in the pipeline seem set to achieve the initial aim of securing a third successive Scudetto while also making them a stronger outfit in the areas that they have proved wanting at times over the past two years . With Llorente already having climbed on board , the addition of even one of Higuain , Jovetic , Tevez or Ibrahimovic would put them in a far better position to compete in the Champions League than they were in 2012-13 . <p> Extra resources in defence are also necessary , with Ogbonna a wise addition , but just as important will be the need to hold on to players of the ability of Vidal and Lichtsteiner , and that is a clear priority for the club . <p> All in all , there is every sign that Juventus are heading into the summer with a perfectly structured plan for the market ahead , and if they play their cards right then 2013-14 could be a season to remember even by the Bianconeri 's recent standards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

In South Australia the scheme removes and recycles 80% of cans and bottles , twice that of normal roadside recycling . <p> So , I was surprised to read a recent article led by Dick Gross at University of Melbourne suggesting container deposit laws are out-dated and inefficient . <p> Mr Gross suggests Victoria -- a state without container deposit laws -- is cleaner than South Australia , citing the Keep Australia Beautiful National Litter Index . But the annual study has some serious flaws . <p> For instance , it assesses the same number of sites across all states , no matter their land area or population size .

Glass manufacturers do so by literally turning the temperature of their blast furnaces down when used glass is being processed . <p> Far from hurting the recycling industry , container deposit schemes and roadside recycling can sit side-by-side , and in fact help each other .

Add to that , the jump in the number of game sales ( hungry Chinese gaming fans will jump at either consoles and their most popular games ) and you quickly start to realize that the outcome of this decision involves a lot of money ...

All these are useful in measuring the impact of sport but it is important to recognise the circumstances of each project during evaluation as it is not an exact science and therefore can not be generalised . It is also important to mention that while milestones and outputs are relatively easy to measure , outcomes are where the impact is generally made and these are often intangible and therefore , harder to prove . <p> Football is used as a tool to tackle various developmental and social issues in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , race equality , peace and conflict , health and economic development . But while there is a general consensus that football 's unique qualities make a strong impact on these issues , monitoring and evaluation remains a challenge . In order to accurately measure the impact of football for development programmes and see the contribution that football is making to social and developmental issues , it is vital to have a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system . <p> The football for development industry faces a lot of challenges to prove their worth as most monitoring and evaluation focuses on evidence based outcomes rather than a combination of scientific data and long-term qualitative impact and process evaluation . Project managers usually focus on measuring the inputs and outputs like how many coaches are needed , how many children participate and how much money is spent . What needs to be assessed alongside that is whether or not programme objectives have been met and what impact has been made on the issue at hand . <p> StreetfootballWorld , in partnership with Laureus Sport for Good Foundation and Aqumen Social Technologies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture real results and clearly communicate the impact that sport is making on social issues . InFocus provides a tailored package that organisations can customise to suit their needs .

This system not only helps sport for development projects better evaluate their impact and make necessary changes to their operations but also helps donors and partners better understand how the programme actually works and what results it achieves . Rather than a numbers driven evaluation that focuses on milestones and outputs , this system allows for a broader view of outcomes and impacts reached . It is basically a support system with online training sessions and one-to-one sessions that helps organisations with their M&amp;E . <p> Another commonly used monitoring and evaluation tool in the sport for development field is Views . This is a data collection software created by Substance Cooperative , a social research company that works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flexible and can be tailored to fit each organisation 's needs . It incorporates quantitative data such as participation numbers , attendance , history and outputs as well as qualitative methods such as case studies to monitor and evaluate projects effectively . <p> A widely asked question is whether CSR falls into the remit of marketing or whether it is seen as a stand-alone activity , which organisations choose to adopt out of a greater responsibility to society . It is important to note that for football organisations , brands and clubs , CSR provides a big return in terms of brand awareness and attracting new fans . Some well-known CSR advantages include enhanced brand value and reputation , developing relationships with stakeholders and greater awareness . All these are also typically benefits of marketing . <p> It is clear that just giving funds is not enough to qualify as CSR and does not underpin a successful partnership . Partners investing funds into programmes should also contribute expertise , resources and specialist staff to monitor and evaluate projects . <p> Monitoring and evaluation should have a long-term nature . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of such projects , sufficient resources should be given to ensure sustained evaluation . <p> Partnerships and collaborations are the key to success in football CSR . By sharing best practice and working together , more successful programmes can be created by leveraging their various networks and resources and bring about a culture of self-regulation which is embedded in the project itself .

@@614230 <p> AsianScientist ( Oct. 30 , 2013 ) - Whether you are in your first year of undergrad studies or final year of postgrad studies , here are five simple techniques ( you might have overlooked ) that may help you feel less tension when you open that ten-pound book . <p> 1 . Location : Keep that in mind before you get in the study mood . Some of you find studying at home distracting because of the television and bed . Forget the couch -- you might sink in and sleep . Forget the kitchen -- too much grub . Where to then ? An empty classroom on campus would be ideal . Or even the library would be an option . If you still insist on studying at home , make sure to relocate to a room with a proper office chair , study table and reading light and you are good to go ! <p> 2 . Concentrate : The whole point of concentration is to not lose focus and achieving that could be quite simple . If you 've read your notes and attended lectures and still do not fully comprehend the subject , it 's time to switch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask yourself questions -- pretend to be your professor and quiz yourself . Breeze through the notes and chapters before attending a lecture so that you can get more mileage out of it . And lastly , sit in the front of the classroom during all lectures and tutorials -- this is sure to help you focus more on your professor and enable easier note taking . <p> 3 . Repetition : You 've heard the saying -- practice makes perfect . So we 're asking you to be a parrot on this one . No one likes to be told what to do repeatedly , however , you 've got to tell yourself what to do -- and do it over and over again to master it . It might sound silly but the key to learning something well is repetition . The more you read or practice the material , the higher the chance of you storing it permanently up there . <p> 4 . Note taking : Let us fill you in on a little note taking secret . If your notebook is flooded with ink and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand everything you wrote down . So do n't freak out when you see your classmate engulfed in stacks of note taking paper . It is impossible to take down everything so write down what is important and highlight key words and phrases to remember . Smart note taking is the most important element for academic success . You can even record the lecture just in case you missed any pointers . <p> 5 . Know yourself : Studying should n't be a chore . In fact , it should be highly beneficial and as painless as possible . If you find that you are suffering , then you are probably studying using the wrong method . Now , lets make your life easier . Ask yourself : Are you a visual , auditory or haptic learner ? Visual learners study best when the material is graphic -- think charts , graphs , photographs and maps . Auditory learners learn best when they hear it or when they engage in discussions . Haptic learners are the kinds who wo n't sit still and need an active environment to learn -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what kind of a learner you are , it will instantly make studying so much more effortless . <p> ------ <p> Copyright : Asian Scientist Magazine ; Photo : English106/Flickr/CC .

@@614234 <h> Regions <h> Encountering the Fukushima Daiichi accident <p> Before the Fukushima accident , former Prime Minister of Japan Naoto Kan pushed for utilising nuclear power , but having faced the real accident , his view has completely changed . Image : Shutterstock <p> By Naoto Kan <p> Tuesday 29 October 2013 <h> Share this story <p> The accident at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant was the most severe accident in the history of mankind . At Unit 1 , the fuel rods melted down in about five hours after the earthquake , and molten fuel breached and melted through the reactor pressure vessel . Meltdowns occurred in Units 2 and 3 within one hundred hours of the accident . At around the same time , hydrogen-air blasted in the reactor buildings of Units 1 , 3 and 4 . <p> Each reactor building contains a fuel pool to store spent fuel . At one point , there was a possibility of meltdowns in those fuel pools as well . If a meltdown occurs in a fuel pool , which sits outside a reactor , a tremendous amount of radioactive material would be released directly into the atmosphere . The continuation of such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a situation where 50 million people within a 250-kilometer radius of Fukushima , including Tokyo and its greater metropolitan area , would have to be evacuated . Fortunately , the situation was prevented from developing further thanks to the tireless self-sacrificing efforts of the Tokyo Electric Power Company , the Self Defense Forces , the firefighters and the police force to supply cooling water into the reactors and the fuel pools . Indeed , we were so close to seeing the worst-case scenario unfold . Had it reached the worst-case scenario , Japan would have had to suffer from long-term chaos and the tremendous amount of radioactive material released would have impacted other nations as well . <p> Before the Fukushima accident , with the belief that no nuclear accident would happen as long as the safety measures were followed properly , I had pushed the policy of utilizing nuclear power .

People have done many things to prevent nuclear wars . One of the examples is The Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons . On the other hand , rules governing nuclear power plants , except for the ones that prohibit the use of nuclear material for military purposes , are basically left to each nation . I believe that we need to have international rules regarding the construction of nuclear power plants , too . Nuclear accidents will happen sometime , somewhere , even though no one can predict when or where . Can we prevent the disastrous situation of forcing many people to evacuate when an accident happens ? Is it possible to safely treat nuclear waste ?

@@2008231 <h> Regions <h> Water awareness and policy-making : An interview with World Water Council 's Benedito Braga <p> In Africa , anybody knows that water is an essential issue but this does not necessarily mean that the media is going to report on it , so it 's through fora or large events that some members of the media see the importance of water . Image : Shutterstock <p> Singapore International Water Week <p> Monday 2 December 2013 <h> Share this story <p> This feature news is part of Singapore International Water Week 's ( SIWW ) series of one-on-one interviews with global water industry leaders , Conversations with Water Leaders . In this edition , Benedito Braga , president , World Water Council , shares with OOSKAnews correspondent , Renee Martin-Nagle , the shift in global water dialogue , World Water Council 's influence on policy-making and its role in increasing water awareness . <h> You have dedicated your life to water , and your level of scholarship is very impressive . How did you become interested in water ? <p> What made me interested in water is something very unusual . I wanted to be an electrical engineer , but the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From a mathematical point of view , hydraulics was close to electricity so I started studying that . How the electrons flow in a wire is similar to how water flows in a pipe -- the potentials and the roughness . From hydraulics , I went to water management and quantitative and qualitative analysis of water . I started with the mathematics , then moved to river basins and canals , then the interaction between land use and rivers , quantity and quality of water , flooding , and droughts . From there , I focused on the people in the basin , and then water resources management -- the interaction of land , water and people in the river basin . I also became interested in how you can clean up the water so that people can drink it , how you treat it to put it back into the environment , and how you can use it to produce energy . I worked in hydropower systems and operation of reservoirs to produce energy and control floods . <h> You are now the president of the World Water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Water Council initially ? <p> When I was president of the International Water Resources Association ( IWRA ) , I heard about the idea of creating a World Water Council . At first , I was a little bit concerned that this organization would compete with IWRA in terms of policy focus . Then I soon realized the Council 's added value in being a common umbrella organization that united the disparate , fragmented , and ineffectual efforts in global water management at the time . I therefore got involved and IWRA was actually one of the founding members of the Council . Ever since its creation , I have been very interested in the importance of politics and policy in water management and one of my main objectives has been to draw the attention of decision-makers in order for water to get the attention that it needs . <h> " <p> Back in 1997 , when the Council was created , the subject of water was something we professionals would discuss among ourselves at our congresses and symposia . The politicians would not even discuss this issue <h> Given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you seen the dialogue change ? <p> Back in 1997 , when the Council was created , the subject of water was something we professionals would discuss among ourselves at our congresses and symposia . The politicians would not even discuss this issue . In some places , like the Middle East , water would be important , because water is scarce , but the public at large would not be interested . In these past 15 years or so , the Council has increased the awareness of the political class around water . At the very first World Water Forum in Marrakesh , Morocco , we had 400 people participating in the discussions . High-level people , of course -- for example the King of Morocco patronized the Forum , and some very important political people were involved . Nevertheless , the number of participants was relatively low . When the next Forum took place three years later in The Hague in the Netherlands , the number went from 400 to 5000 participants . <h> How did you manage to grow the forum so much in three years ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helped that the Dutch government -- which had already been involved in the first Forum - realized the importance of the subject . They brought ministers to the table to discuss the issues , and this was also the first time we had a ministerial declaration . This meant that we moved from the think-tank model of the first Forum to a politicized event where ministers came together and signed a declaration . Three years later in 2003 , the Forum was organized in Kyoto , Japan and then in Mexico City in 2006 . In 2009 , Turkey was the host country with Istanbul as the host city , and most recently last year , the sixth edition took place in Marseilles , France . We had 35,000 people coming to the event with 19,000 registrations . The political interest has just kept on growing , and there were 120 ministers and 500 mayors and parliamentarians present in Marseille . <p> Benedito Braga , World Water Council president . Image : Hirado.hu <h> How does the World Water Council influence policy-making ? <p> In our work , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Water supply and sanitation is a local issue , and the mayors are in charge of making sure that the population has safe drinking water and basic sanitation . If you can reach these decision-makers directly , it 's much more efficient than going through national governments . The parliamentarians are the ones that make the laws and approve the budgets and by reaching them , we help them emphasize and consolidate their role in the future of water . <h> How do you see the role of World Water Council in the evolution of water awareness ? <p> The World Water Council is a young organization but I am proud to say that we have come a long way since our creation . When we held our first Forum in Marrakech , Morocco , we could not have imagined that water would be recognized as a human right by the UN only 13 years later and that 14 countries would have the human right to access to water in their constitutions . This is of course the work of the whole water community but I take pride in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a part of this . At the Forums , not only water ministers are coming but also environment ministers and sometimes planning and financial ministers as well . In Istanbul and Marseilles , we had the Heads of State Summit with presidents and prime ministers , which is a testimony to the evolution in water awareness . <h> Water is sort of the hidden resource . How can we reach a critical mass to conserve water and to appreciate it ? <p> Well , I think that to be able to appreciate water , you have to have experienced the problem -- the lack of it , too much of it . On certain continents , the problems are more felt than on others but in order to reach a critical mass and catalyze change , we have to have the help of the media . For example , in Africa , anybody knows that water is an essential issue but this does not necessarily mean that the media is going to report on it . I think it 's through large events that some members of the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make people listen and in the end vote for change . In order to reach the critical mass , we need awareness around events like the World Water Forum , the World Water Week and the Singapore International Water Week . <h> " <p> Some people say the wars of the future will be about water and not oil . That water is the oil of the future . But if we have the right policies for managing the transboundary rivers correctly , there will be no wars <h> How do we achieve media awareness on water ? <p> We can now see a tendency of the media reporting on water 's cross-cutting character through many of the society interests such as energy , food production and health . In 2015 , when we are organizing the 7th World Water Forum in Daegu-Gyeongbuk in Korea , we will be inviting the media to a forum to discuss how to best reach out to the public at large . Shifting from sensational reporting on water wars to calls for action in how to secure the future is one of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water sector do n't know the best way to get the attention of these people . Some think that , through dark threats about the future , people will turn their attention to water . But we from the professional community know that if you have the right policies in place , there will be no dark future in the water sector . There is enough water . <h> Provided the policies are put in place soon enough . <p> Exactly . This is the trick . For instance , some people say the wars of the future will be about water and not oil . That water is the oil of the future . But if we have the right policies for managing the transboundary rivers correctly , there will be no wars . However , if you do not start early , we may come to a bad situation . Anwar Sadat , former president of Egypt , once said , back in the 70s , that the only issue that would take Egypt to war is water . <h> What impact do you think that Singapore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> I remember the first Singapore International Water Week started small , very focused on water supply and sanitation , and it evolved quickly to become a major international event . It is now not only an event for the Asia-Pacific region but for the whole world and the number of participants and the involvement of the industry has grown fast . Lots of important businesses are done during their forum in the area of water supply and sanitation . The SIWW has a huge fair with new technologies , like membranes for sophisticated water treatment systems . Lately , the organizers have started to reach out to policy-makers and high level decision-makers . They created the Water Leaders Summit and started a conversation with the prime minister . I think it is a good thing that the event is becoming more and more political . As it has a strong focus in the Asia-Pacific region it also enables great influence there . The Singapore International Water Week is an extremely important event , and we at the World Water Council are very happy to collaborate and work together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the next Forum meeting ? <p> Implementation . In Marseilles , the Forum was called " The Forum of Solutions " . Some of these solutions have been already tried and some are totally innovative .

I hope that for the Forum in Korea we will be able to narrow this large number of solutions down to those that can be truly implemented and understand the conditions that are necessary to implement them in different parts of the world . <h> What final message would you like to give to our readers ? <p> I would like to give a very positive message . I think that water will certainly be understood by everyone in the near future as the one resource that has to be carefully taken care of .

You still have to unsubscribe individually to each company -- just like before the long-deliberated privacy law had been drawn up . <p> If this sounds like a complete U-turn , the government regulator will remind you that the new exemptions it announced for companies today is meant for SMSes and faxes only . The do-not-call list maintained by the Personal Data Protection Commission will still bar companies from calling you if you have opted out . <p> But that is small consolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tighter controls over who may contact them for telemarketing purposes . <p> With the new exemptions , the do-not-call list has become a pale shadow of what it was supposed to be . What 's the point of signing up for a do-not-call list if you still have to say no to each and every spammer out there ? Is saying no to the regulator not enough ? <p> Strangely , the privacy commission now says there is a chance that people who are on the do-not-call list might miss out on " relevant information " , such as benefits from using a membership . <p> Well , users can always exempt organisations which they want to get messages from . If you like your telecom operator or favourite supermarket to keep reminding you of offers , you can just tell them so . That was n't enough , apparently , to the privacy commission . <p> It is supposed to be on the side of the public , to prevent spam from overloading users ' mailboxes and to let people say no to unsolicited marketing calls . Yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to make sure users receive information like membership privileges ? <p> And this , after years of deliberation , feedback from the public and the industry , and having an important privacy law finally passed in Parliament last year . <p> Businesses have had 18 months to comply with the new rules . And going by the early rush to sign up to the do-not-call list , phone users here have been looking forward to the regulations to come into effect . <p> Now , these exemptions by the privacy commission have made a mockery of the progress made so far . In making a dramatic change in the very last minute , just as the new rules are to kick in , it has drastically reduced the protection that consumers have desired for years . <p> Worse , the move makes one question the type of decision making that is carried out for such important national matters . Why did the privacy commission , part of the Ministry of Communications and Information , deem it necessary to change its mind at the very end ? <p> Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Data Protection Act was enacted last year should question if the latest changes are in line with how they had intended the law to work for the public . <p> Because , make no mistake , come January 2 , 2014 , spam will still be a problem for phone users . <p> NOTE : The article originally referred to the Personal Data Protection Act as anti-spam regulation . This has been changed to privacy regulation to avoid confusion with the earlier Spam Control Act relating to e-mail spam . <p> Honestly I tink there is no issues with that .. for me , the only annoying thing are the calls made to me and refuses to hang up even saying more than 10 times of no and I am not interested , esp during bz times at work .. in fact , I was hoping that they exclude smses from dnc because I really do not want to have to go to all the shops , that I have membership with , to do the subscription for the sms promos ..

What is the point of having this policy ? The reason why I had signed up is because of I do not want to receive any of telemarketing call , sms and fax . I had been receiving a lot of tuition sms which I do not subscribe at all . I do not have kids , why I am interesting in such telemarketing ? <p> sd <p> Agree with the sentiments of this article .
