@@4670237 <h> There is no such thing in Pakistan <p> Terms that label people and put them into boxes always confused me . It posed so many questions , like can people hold ' mixed ' views ? Some of the ' liberal ' streak , others of the ' conservative ' while some their own ? This approach throws off those who can only work by putting people in neat compartments . But people are never black and white . They are better described as shades of gray . <p> John Perazzo , writing on being progressive and on being a leftist , quotes Ted Kennedydefining a liberal as " someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions " and " someone who cares about the welfare of the people " . But is it so ? The English professor , philosopher and author Maurice Cranston states , " A liberal is a man who believes in liberty . " John Locke states that humans are in " a state of perfect freedom to order their actions as they think fit without asking leave , or depending on the will of any other man . " However living in a society with interlinked relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is a state of perfect freedom a reality as propounded by Locke ? Was it ever a reality ? I am no philosopher by long shot , but painting neat boxes to fit in people throws me off . Locke 's theory is in line with the " roots " of the very word stemming from liberalis , Latin for " pertaining to be a free man " . <p> For a better understanding , we need to grasp that liberalism was born out of reaction to conservative philosophy that supported the absolute monarchies , and not just the monarchs but all those associated with the monarchy . For better understanding : the status quo . <p> Liberalism upon emergence in the beginning of the 18th century meant a belief in the rule of law , individual rights , right to private ownership and property , relatively limited role of governments in the lives of private citizens , and a strong support of laissez faire economies . By and large , these values were what defined the school of liberals . An extremely enlightening paper by Stanford Encyclopedia of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stating , " Individuality is the same thing with development , and it is only the cultivation of individuality which produces , or can produce , well-developed human beings . What more can be said of any condition of human affairs than that it brings human beings themselves nearer to the best thing they can be ? Or what worse can be said of any obstruction to good than that it prevents this ? ( Mill , 1963 , vol 18 : 267 ) <p> Can this philosophy of placing all goodness with individuals alone apply across board ? Does it not rest heavily on a huge assumption that every individual will develop on the same level equally despite the unequal distribution of intellect , wisdom , wealth , education and other variables involved ? <p> The term ' liberal ' is often used as interchangeable with the leftists today . ' Leftism ' is actually , historically , the opposite of all that liberalism stands for . Leftists sprang from France in the early 1900s . They held that the root cause of decadence in the society came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the philosophy to get rid of the capitalism existing then and replacing this failed form of thought with socialism where all are equal . This thought too , of course , is repeating the same mistake i.e. , painting little boxes to fit people in with labels . Here the question that pops to the mind is : is not socialism itself rule of a certain elite to the exclusion of everyone else denying them the right to better choices and thereby negating the will to strike for a better quality in terms of material possessions and the comfort it brings ? <p> To further the debate we must discuss the concept of conservatism . <p> The Oxford Dictionary puts forth an interesting defining example , " ( Of surgery or medicaltreatment ) intended to control rather than eliminate a condition , with existing tissuepreserved as far as possible . " It also describes a conservative as , " A person who isaverse to change and holds traditional values . " Simply put , conservatism would mean supporting the traditional in the face of forces of change that aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aspects of societal and individual holdings and beliefs i.e. , cultural , religious , and political . Conservatism is more prone to orthodox religious views , rejecting any deviation or non-orthodoxy . Edmund Burke , the Anglo-Irish philosopher , is widely seen as the originator of Conservatism . The theory was born as a reaction to the French Revolution and is discussed at length in his book , Reflections on the Revolution in France . <p> Let 's visit Pakistan with the satchel of these ideas and try painting political parties and politicians and people at large and try determining who 's who . The problem is one can not . Liberalism or Conservatism in Pakistan generally excludes all other levels to centre around one aspect alone : religion . Though this is an important element of determination of any individual 's or party 's leaning , it is not the only one . Since increasing bars of religiosity permeating in the society , it becomes much easier to overlook the barriers that merge the difference between liberals and those supporting conservatism i.e. , those of class and economic barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan is not only sharp , it 's increasing . Even in the urban areas , the division between the elite and the dilapidated is increasing at an alarming rate . The educated middle class has all but disappeared . It is a society in a state of flux . This leads to a greater need to develop strong policies aimed at bridging the divide . Yet , one does not see any policies aimed at dealing with the realities of the common person . If political ideologies held roots in Pakistan , we would not be witnessing politicians changing political parties . We would not witness the support for ' status quo ' on all-inclusive levels by political parties . <p> This gap takes us back to the very concept of liberalism . <p> What we see on ground is neither conservatism nor liberalism ( not to be confused with leftism ) serving the people at meaningful levels . What is needed is to join hands as one nation , and work towards making Pakistan a country to be envied. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Malik <p> Wednesday , February 11 , 2015 - IN a country confronted with daunting socio-economic challenges wrought by years of bad governance , Pakistan ? s richest persons are seldom questioned for not giving back enough to achieve social and development goals . Critiqued occasionally for tax evasion , majority of the billionaires cutting across wealthy politicians , landed aristocracy , industrialists and corporate executives , are seen to be aloof from the surrounding deteriorating socio-economic conditions . <p> The business community in Pakistan tends to share burden of the government in the post-crisis relief phases following natural disasters but is reluctant to volunteer for larger humanitarian programs and development initiatives which are thought to be exclusive domain of the civil society and the government . Pakistan Centre for Philanthropy claims that corporate philanthropy has increased eighteen fold over the past eight years . But the growth is too inadequate to make visible impact on country ? s development . It is no surprise that civil society and Pakistani Diaspora receive appreciation for keeping the country afloat as the most well-to-do rarely receive such recognition . There is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ founding chairman of Bahria Town has gone several steps ahead of corporate responsibility and even entrepreneurial philanthropy . The real estate icon continues to donate billions of Rupees to the people and the government through mega financial packages in the wake of natural calamities and national emergencies , in addition to generously investing in major development and charitable projects . Compared to Bill Gates , Riaz ? s stature as social welfare activist is said to have overtaken his ranking as the leading construction personality . <p> For years Riaz has been urging his counterparts heading big business holdings to contribute some percentage of their assets to national development . Terming businessmen as the development leaders in any country including the United States , Malik Riaz claims the possibility of eradicating poverty and even paying off Pakistan ? s huge external debt through collective financial support by two to three hundred richest individuals in the country . His imploring has not though received perceptive ears in the moneyed club .

This would resolve half of our problems bringing about a dramatic change for the better within five to ten years ? , Malik Riaz said . Eight years later when people have lost trust in foreign development assistance and borrowings , there is greater need for the richest persons to work independently or in collaboration with the government and civil society to address emergencies of education , health and unemployment . <p> The concept of giving back by leading businessmen has come under spotlight in the developed and emerging economies as organizations including Britain-based international agency Oxfam question the impact of creation of wealth for a few on the millions of underprivileged around the world .

The perilous law and order situation arising mainly from economic inequalities have not so far directly hit the business stakes of the business magnates . Riaz believes that it is not morally appropriate to live in islands of prosperity ignoring oceans of poverty around . He maintains that investment in social development would guarantee peaceful survival of all citizens including businessmen as poverty would lead to chaos and instability . Malik Riaz , who rose from a modest position of small time construction contractor , believes that ? The love and respect does not come with fortune and political power , but by serving the humanity ? . His commitment to financially help the government , communities , professional groups and individuals is predicated on a vision in which welfare of the people takes precedence over any other consideration .

These ventures include state-of-art universities , medical colleges and metro bus system in Karachi and other cities .

In addition , compression of time and space in the globalised world of today has rendered particular worldviews , systems of knowledge production and mediums irrelevant . So far language has remained a reliable medium to convey reality . Words do not derive their meaning from some essentialist source away from the mundane day-to-day realities of life , rather the meaning stems from a complex interplay of metaphors , worldview , text and the reader . <p> Unified truth is a product of the regimes of truth and framework in society . Such framework ensures that there is the centre that brings multifarious dimensions of life within a unified whole . It is this that determines our mode of communicating truth and meaning . When the context @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mediums a part of representational practices disappears , the communication breaks down . As a result , every word and every individual starts to freely float in a void devoid of signification . <p> Today old certainties , systems of thought , knowledge production and framework are defunct . People have lost a unified worldview . That is why the old world of meaning has disintegrated . We are sitting on ' a heap of broken images ' . In other words we have lost our traditional abode and have not yet found a new home in the new order of things . This creates a permanent state of homelessness , angst and alienation in us -- for without being rooted one can not bear fruit and fail to enter into communion with the universe in the state of cosmic alienation . These existential experiences have given birth to metaphysical pathos of cosmic proportions . It is art that gives voice to ineffable feelings and experiences of the soul .

The subliminal idea that informs literary festivals in Pakistan is to restore the unified framework and create a centre which brings in every centrifugal element within its ambit . Our attempts to communicate individual and collective experiences through literature do not resonate well with our lived experience because most of what is produced in Pakistani English literature caters to market demand in the outside world that views even the blatant violence in our society through exotic lenses . <p> Thus , the macabre situation of our country has been turned into Vanity Fair by literature produced for global consumption . Inspiration can come from anywhere but the content should come from the inner life of beings in the world . An ordinary Pakistani today is caught up in extraordinary abnormal events . Absence of normalcy in the ordinary lives of people causes excruciating spiritual pain . Our literature ought to give voice to this pain instead of following the trend of the literary industry .

It can be overcome by understanding the new patterns of culture industry , knowledge production and formation of the self in a space created by disintegration of the old order . Traditionally , it was assumed that interaction with established structures formed our agency . <p> Our contemporary experience is no more structured ; rather it is fragmented like a heap of broken images . Therefore , genres , forms and literature should reflect the fragmented nature of experience , self , sense and sensibilities . Instead of yearning for a unified frame of reference , rarefied ideal types and anachronistic metaphors and irrelevant literary canons , the literature of today should aspire for the ideals that emanate from our lived experience in a particular time and space . <p> The art of today can not have a unified view of reality and a single narrative for a multitude of experiences . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and salvage some pieces from the rubble of broken images , and prepare a collage-like reality of modern life . Therefore , a new vocabulary is required to represent sensibilities created by new arrangements on the heel of the death of context and significations associated with it . All major institutions are facing crises of legitimacy . <p> Being a part of this space , literary festivals can not escape questions regarding legitimacy of inorganic spaces . At times the very effort to create a new space gives birth to segregated spaces . It happened with art galleries in Pakistan where the ' riffraff ' are not permitted . Literally festivals basically celebrate creativity . Literature can communicate with its diverse readers/audiences if the creative imagination of our literati succeeds to craft inclusive mediums and spaces .

" <p> The trouble with most -- not all but most -- of the authors and artists at literary festivals and art galleries is that they ride roughshod over the refuse of society , and superimpose their illustrious types in a very sanitised environment .

@@4674235 <h> Email <p> The writer is a barrister and an advocate of the Supreme Court of Pakistan <p> RECENTLY , I attended a seminar on the law governing the use of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles -- ' drones ' -- at an eminent university in the United Kingdom . I expected the discussion to be essentially on legal principles with perhaps a passing reference to US-led drone strikes in northern Pakistan . However , I was surprised to discover that not only did Pakistan occupy centre stage in the debate , but also that a number of academics present at the seminar , strongly advocated the use of drones irrespective of the threat to civilian lives it may entail . <p> One academic praised the drones for their precision and the fact that they allowed for a ' riskless ' war ; another doubted the capacity or intention of the Pakistani legal system to punish terrorists and argued that some ' collateral damage ' was permissible in the circumstances ; another suggested that as long as the war against terror was a ' just ' war , the means through which it was fought was not of concern . <p> Another still , asked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent people were expected to sacrifice their lives at the altar of legal niceties ? <h> It seemed that for a Western audience , Pakistani people , the country 's legal system and indeed the state itself were guilty of terrorism . <p> More than the discussion itself , the underlying , unspoken assumptions were unsettling . It seemed that for a Western audience , Pakistani people , the country 's legal system and indeed the state itself were guilty of terrorism in varying degrees . If they were not terrorists themselves , then they had harboured terrorists and were liable for that . It further seemed that lives of innocent Pakistanis were not at par with those of innocent Westerners . If drones allowed Western powers to target terrorists without putting themselves at risk , then killing a few Pakistanis was not a terrible price to pay . <p> However , my discomfort , or indeed that of any Pakistani , would be justified only if we held a different view . <p> Do Pakistanis value all lives equally , irrespective of whether they are Shia , Ahmadi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Waziristan as we do over one in a major city ? Do we wish for alleged terrorists to be condemned only after due process of law ? The sad truth is that the answer to these questions is a resounding , ' no ' . And what we see in the West is merely a magnified reflection of our own selective humanity . <p> The recent establishment of military courts for trying terrorists , is perhaps the most interesting demonstration of the commonalities between the Pakistani and Western attitudes towards drones . The West extols the precision of drones , insists that civilian casualties are few and that drones are necessary to curb terrorism . <p> Similarly , the Pakistani supporter of military courts argues that trials in these courts are speedy ; that military men are so adept at delivering justice that false convictions are almost unlikely and that , even if there are some , it is a small price to pay for ridding the country of terrorism . <p> Interestingly , however , this supporter of military courts in Pakistan seems not to care that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the opportunity to engage a lawyer or to provide a defence for himself . Or if he is allowed these rights , the trial itself may be so speedy that there may not be an opportunity of answering the allegations against him . Most importantly , he is not too concerned that sentencing a man to death without allowing him a right of defence is tantamount to murdering him on the street . <p> Ultimately , the distance between the Westerner seeking to eliminate terrorists through drone attacks and the Pakistani leaving his own countrymen at the mercy of military courts , is negligible . Both are motivated by fear and a desperate need for personal security and both have stripped their imagined enemy of his essential humanity . <p> I was particularly amused to note that Pakistani values conveniently changed with their position in the drama : whilst standing in the dock with the accused , they expected legality , fairness and compassion . However , when cast as prosecutors , they were not prepared to offer the same to suspects . <p> It is important to clarify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a fair trial as guaranteed under Article 10A of the Constitution . More importantly , however , I wish to safeguard innocent persons who may be believed to be terrorists due to the prejudices and the presumptions of the tribunal trying them . Military courts , in as much as they dispense with the transparency inherent in a mainstream legal system and believe , without adequate proof , that all persons appearing before them are terrorists , are unlikely to meet the requirements of a fair trial . <p> Many will argue , that the right to a fair trial is a luxury that Pakistan can not afford . They will undoubtedly remind me of shortcomings in our legal system , which allow the culprit to remain unpunished . I will say to them that , this calls for strengthening the legal system rather than sidestepping it so that it becomes even weaker over time . They will then argue that strengthening the system takes time , which Pakistan does not have . I simply ask , if shortage of time means that we resort to myopic measures that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> An important point raised at the seminar for the use of drones which applies equally to military courts , is their respective chance of success . The idea of ' success ' implies an objective : is the objective to kill persons who are likely to be terrorists or to comprehensively restore peace ? If the objective is merely to destroy numbers then both drones and military courts are the way forward . However , if peace is desirable then it is important to remember that neither drones nor military courts will eliminate terrorism -- at best they may delay the backlash .

@@4678235 <h> Women , Violence and Conflict in Pakistan <p> Asia Report N ? 2658 Apr 2015 <p> AFP PHOTO/ARIF ALI <p> EXECUTIVE SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS <p> Eight years into its democratic transition , violence against women is still endemic in Pakistan , amid a climate of impunity and state inaction . Discriminatory legislation and a dysfunctional criminal justice system have put women at grave risk . Targeted by violent extremists with an overt agenda of gender repression , women 's security is especially threatened in the conflict zones in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ( KPK ) province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas ( FATA ) . On 8 March , International Women 's Day , Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif vowed that his government would take all necessary legislative and administrative steps to protect and empower women . If this pledge was in earnest , his Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz ( PML-N ) government should end institutionalised violence and discrimination against women , including by repealing unjust laws , countering extremist threats , particularly in KPK and FATA , and involving women and their specially relevant perspectives in design of state policies directly affecting their security , including strategies to deal with violent extremist groups . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies to appease violent extremists . After democracy 's return , there has been some progress , particularly through progressive legislation , much of it authored by committed women 's rights activists in the federal and provincial legislatures , facilitated by their increased numbers in parliament . Yet , the best of laws will provide little protection so long as social attitudes toward women remain biased , police officers are not held accountable for failing to investigate gender-based crimes , the superior judiciary does not hold the subordinate judiciary accountable for failing to give justice to women survivors of violence , and discriminatory laws remain on the books . <p> Laws , many remnants of General Zia-ul-Haq 's Islamisation in the 1970s and 1980s , continue to deny women their constitutional right to gender equality and fuel religious intolerance and violence against them . Their access to justice and security will remain elusive so long as legal and administrative barriers to political and economic empowerment remain , particularly the Hudood Ordinances ( 1979 ) , FATA 's Frontier Crimes Regulations ( FCR ) ( 1901 ) and the Nizam-e-Adl ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PATA ) . <p> The government has a constitutional obligation and international commitments , including under the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women ( CEDAW ) , to combat gender inequality and remove such barriers to women 's empowerment . Repealing discriminatory legislation and enforcing laws that protect women , including by ensuring that they have access to a gender-responsive police and courts , are essential to ending the impunity that promotes violence against women . <p> The extent to which rights violations go unpunished is particularly alarming in FATA and KPK , where women are subjected to state-sanctioned discrimination , militant violence , religious extremism and sexual violence . Militants target women 's rights activists , political leaders and development workers without consequences . The prevalence of informal justice mechanisms in many parts of Pakistan , particularly in Pakhtunkhwa and FATA , are also highly discriminatory toward women ; and the government 's indiscriminate military operations , which have displaced millions , have further aggravated the challenges they face in the conflict zones . <p> In KPK and FATA , and indeed countrywide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political participation as voters and in public office , will be central to sustainable reform . Pakistan should invest in their empowerment and reflect their priorities in all government policies , including counter-insurgency and peacebuilding efforts .

Respecting international commitments and constitutionally guaranteed fundamental rights , the National Assembly should amend all laws that discriminate against women in the Penal Code and Evidence Act and repeal the Hudood Ordinances in their entirety ; all provincial legislatures should pass and implement laws to protect and empower women , including by criminalising and taking effective measures to prevent domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Anti-Rape Laws ( Criminal Laws Amendment ) Act , the Anti-Honour Killings Laws ( Criminal Laws Amendment ) Act and the Torture , Custodial Death and Custodial Rape ( Prevention and Punishment ) Act , passed by the Senate in March 2015 . <p> 3 . The national legislature should establish a quota of general ( directly-elected ) National Assembly seats , in addition to the existing reserved ( unelected ) seats , for women legislators , and the parliament 's rules of procedures should be amended to ensure a certain number of parliamentary committees are headed by women . <p> 4 . The federal and provincial governments should prioritise the development of a gender-responsive security apparatus , including by increasing the numbers of policewomen , particularly in senior positions ; building police capacity to investigate crimes against women ; and strengthening the National Police Bureau ( NPB ) and its gender crimes cell 's liaison with provincial authorities . <p> 5 .

Repeal the Frontier Crimes Regulations ( FCR ) in FATA and the Nizam-e-Adl in PATA and extend the jurisdiction of superior courts to FATA so that citizens there can seek protection of the fundamental rights the constitution guarantees them . <p> 8 .

@@4685234 <h> Facebook Messenger introduces Hint ID for non-friend chats <p> Is that a message from some rando , a spammer , or the nice guy you met yesterday ? Facebook Messenger wants to give you some clues before you consider responding . The app will now surface publicly shared biographical info like current city and job title at the top of message threads from people you have n't chatted with before . The update starts rolling out today on iOS Android in U.S. , U.K. , France , and India . <p> For example , if you received a message from someone you 're not friends with , Messenger could show that they 're a " Food Blogger " from " Seattle . " That info could jog your memory , reminding you they 're the woman you met in the fish market on your recent trip to the Northwest . Knowing they 're someone you 've actually met could make you a lot more likely to reply , and get the conversation going naturally rather than stumbling with " oh ... hey ... how did we meet again ? " <p> Messenger can also pull up this kind of info for existing Facebook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old high school friend just moved to your current city and got a job in your industry . That information could change your perception from " ugh , Nate from high school ? " to " oh nice , Nate moved out west and we 're both bloggers . " <p> Whether it 's about non-friends or people you 've already added , Messenger will only show you info that 's public or otherwise visible to you on Facebook , so it does n't sidestep privacy controls . <p> This new feature , which I 'll refer to as chat ID , follows Facebook 's release of Hello . That Android-only caller ID app intercepts your phone calls and can show you info visible to you on Facebook about the caller , or block it if it 's from a known spammer . <p> Together , the chat ID and caller ID features show Facebook 's growing interest in connecting you to and offering context about all the people in your life , not just your friends . That could help foster new friend connections on its social network . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your professional life as well . <p> In the past , Facebook has been touchy about messages from non-friends , in some cases routing them to the oft-forgotten Other inbox that 's typically filled with spam and weirdos . Most people do n't know about it , so while it protected people from unwanted advances , it 's also broken . A friend of mine actually missed a message from his long-lost brother because it went into Other purgatory . <p> Facebook tells me nothing is changing about how the Other inbox works , and you 've been able to use Messenger to contact non-friends . Still , providing context on who 's pinging you could allow it to be more lenient about what messages hit your main inbox .

But then as if on cue , the Hotel orchestra began the evening with Chopin 's music " So deep is the night .

The framers of the 1973 constitution had this experience in mind when they opted for a federal , democratic and parliamentary system . In the backdrop of the trauma of the dismemberment of the country a concurrent list of legislative powers was introduced , giving simultaneous powers to both the federation and the provinces over a number of subjects , apart from the federal list .

The Afghanistan-Pakistan , bilateral relationship appears to have come of age , however the gains are fragile and are reversible -- hence needing careful handling and nurturing . <p> Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif during his visit to Kabul on May 12 , outlined three principles in the context of Pakistan-Afghanistan relations : we will strictly adhere to the policy of non-interference ; we will not allow our respective territories to be used against the other ; and Afghanistan 's enemies will be treated as Pakistan 's enemies and Pakistan 's enemies will be treated as Afghanistan 's enemies . These principles were reiterated once again during the Prime Minister 's address to the concluding session of the Envoys Conference on 11 June 2015 . <p> The 11th Senior Officials Meeting ( SOM ) of the process was held in Islamabad on May 25 , 2015 .

Economic connectivity in the Heart of Asia region was discussed as a top priority for regional prosperity and long-term stability and security . It was emphasised that all parallel projects and initiatives must be pursued with a vision of complementing each other to enhance regional economic connectivity and development . Pakistan is hosting the next ministerial meeting later this year . Pakistan views with great interest China 's emergence as a peace-maker in Afghanistan . Both China and Pakistan subscribe to the cardinal doctrine that the Afghan peace process should be Afghan-owned and Afghan-led , while taking Taliban entities onboard . Pakistan also subscribes to the notion that international community should continue to support the Afghan government economically , alongside assisting it in building the capacity of Afghan National Security Forces in counter-insurgency and counter-terrorism operations . <p> Currently , both countries face common challenge of overcoming militancy of various brands to ensure peace and stability in Afghanistan that would soon have ripple effect into Pakistan .

Both leaders seem to have realised that they have to carry along each other for the betterment of their country . <p> Afghan diplomacy is no longer conducted through the media , and the Karzai era " blame Pakistan " rhetoric is now a distant memory . The new Afghan government has taken positive steps for addressing some of Pakistan 's concerns by reversing its ' India only ' approach for getting military equipment and training of AFNS personnel . However , these steps are not without opposition from within Afghanistan and India . <p> Pakistan is supporting the Afghan peace process by facilitating contacts between Ghani government and various political resistant groups . Back channel contacts between the Taliban and Afghan government appear to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn into formal intra-Afghan political dialogue . Latest rounds of contacts were held in Oslo and Dubai during first week of June ; another broader round is slated for Doha in July . With the beginning of new fighting season in Afghanistan , Pakistan has distanced itself from the ongoing Spring Offensive and has equated it to acts of terrorism . <p> Pakistan and Afghanistan will have to work in unison to make behind the scene effort between the insurgents and the Afghan government an enduring success ; in all likelihood , it will be a give and take enterprise . A starting point could be the appointment of non-controversial Taliban leaders as provincial governors and also giving them compatible ministerial appointments . Appointment of a towering , yet non-controversial person as Vice President may help in breaking the ice .

Success of this year-long operation , alongside its offshoot Operation Khyber II , has been acknowledged by everyone . <p> Recent intelligence sharing agreements between the intelligence agencies of the two countries -- Inter Services Intelligence ( ISI ) , and National Directorate of Security is a landmark decision that provides a structural framework for tactical operations against militants .

While in Kabul the Indian National Security Advisor also gave a statement against the MoU . <p> Keeping in view the complexities of the relationship , especially the deep seeded mistrust , all is not expected to be well between the two countries , nor are all ills expected to get well soon .

Nevertheless , there are certain problems which are not addressed . Let 's look at the neglected sectors which are not addressed in the budget and forgotten issues.Services sectors contributed more than 50 percent to GDP but it is totally neglected once again . Services sector is neglected and the major emphasis is on the commodity producing sector , i.e. manufacturing and agriculture . What constitute the services sectors ? It includes drivers , road transporters , telecom sector , storage sector , cobbler , barber , electrician , plumbers , tailors , shopkeepers ( wholesalers and retailers ) , banks and bankers , insurance agents and other staff , construction workers , public administration and defense , and social services . Therefore , in nutshell not everyone is working in industrial sector and in agriculture sector . Furthermore , the neglected sector has maximum share in GDP and 40 percent of employed labour force.Although the components of services sectors are inter-linked with the production of industry and agriculture thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services sectors as well nonetheless , services sector has its own significance through domestic commerce ( at term introduced by Dr Nadeem-ul-Haque , former deputy chairman Planning and Development Division and former Vice Chancellor PIDE in 2006 in Pakistan ) . Increase in domestic commerce leads to more employment opportunities for the people , local competition in open market will increase which helps in generating innovative ideas ; these ideas thus result in expansion in business and eventually increase in exports . These local industries which look for the demand of local buyers are known as organic industries . The domestic commerce will increase the need for space in the market as well as create new cities . Therefore , budget should bring certain reforms which helps domestic commerce to flourish . This would also reduce the income inequality and poverty in the country.It 's been more than 2 and half decades when Paul Romer wrote an article on endogenous growth . It is among the most quoted articles since then . It says that investment in human capital innovation and knowledge are drivers of economic growth not the external @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover , the outcome of this investment will have spillover affect which results in better economic development . However , the budget makers may not know the importance of investment in innovation and knowledge . This seems to be the only reason that even after 20 years the allocation of budget on research and development in all the sectors is negligible . I am sure that out of thousand billion budget government may allocate few billions to the research and development and grant it to various universities depending on the research projects they are running . It is very much possible that dues to this allocation they may not have to introduce billion rupees incentive structure to the industries.The budget , every year , gives us the equation of revenues and expenditures . Expenditure heads are initially decided and then deciding on the magical number of budget deficit , revenue target is set . After the decision of revenue target several possible algorithms are made to achieve the impossible target of total revenues , this year its Rs. 3100 billion . This year tax reforms commission has been established which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pasha has also given several recommendations to increase the revenues , nevertheless , no major initiative has been taken to improve the tax administration , cover the loopholes , and abolishment of exemption apart from abolishing the SROs issued by FBR . Apart from these reforms , construction sector and agriculture income is still un-taxed . Although agricultural income tax is a provincial matter but people get exemptions by declaring their income coming from agriculture sectors . In general it is seen that agriculture income tax becomes controversial , nonetheless , it is not . The same rules will be applied on the agriculture income , which is applied on the income from other sources . Most of the investment is either going into real estate sector . Prices of the real estate sector are also changing frequently at rapid speed , which implies higher profitability of the investors in the real estate sector . Since mostly it is undocumented sector , therefore , it is difficult to tax , nonetheless , looking at the profitability it is pretty sure that FBR can raise a significant amount of revenues from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affects negatively to the revenue collection efforts . Similar to the real estate sector several informal activities are undocumented and are not paying sales tax especially albeit consumers are paying them sales tax when they use their services . For instance , restaurants , fast foods , bakeries , etc . Vague estimates show that FBR is losing close to Rs. 250 billion every year by not collecting taxes from informal sector.The writer is an Islamabad-based economist .

Budgets reflect that the political will is lacking to view the problem in perspective and that quick fixes are preferred to long-term solutions . No one even talks about Kalabagh Dam . Let us not forget that the first thing the US did was to build the world 's biggest dam . Then China came up with the Three Gorges Dam and 15 cities sank into oblivion . There was an international hullabaloo about the destruction of ecology , but somehow , China went ahead to complete the dam .

The dam paved the way for heavy and small industries downstream and China began to emerge as a competitor to the west . <p> Towards the end of the 1980s , Pakistan met 70 percent of its energy needs from hydel ( hydroelectric ) power and 30 percent from thermal energy .

This change had a cascading effect on prices and the consumers ' bills skyrocketed . Hydel energy remains largely neglected , despite its low production cost . According to the Planning Commission , it costs Rs 0.8 per kilowatt-hour to produce hydel electricity . The variable cost of production per kilowatt-hour is Rs 13.56 from furnace oil and Rs 18.4 from diesel . How strong is the thermal lobby ? In 2008 , the Board of Investment managed to attract $ 800 million in foreign investment for the installation of a 600 megawatt hydropower plant to produce electricity at Rs four per unit but the investors were hounded out . Each year we lose two to three percent of the GDP to the power shortage and an additional one percent to the gas shortage . <p> Several illegal thermal power plants have cropped up and the National Electric Power Authority ( NEPRA ) considers them at par with legal ones . A lot of public sector electricity generation plants have outlived their utility . They are operating on expired licences at costs of more than twice the national average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Kotri and Guddu produce electricity at a cost of Rs 27-29 per kilowatt-hour . A 2011 audit report of some plants by Haigler Bailly reflected that some power plants produced only 25.3 to 32.1 units of electricity , instead of the standard 100 units . NEPRA should have retired the cost-ineffective plants but it continues to approve monthly fuel charges adjustments for these plants ( Jamshoro , Guddu and Muzaffarnagar ) . <p> Thermal generation requires Rs three billion a day in fuel , whereas collections from consumers are only about Rs one billion . Without cheaper electricity , circular debt will continue to mount . Circular debt , accumulated in the power sector , is a handy excuse for the energy crisis . This debt piles up when downstream customers fail to pay their bills to upstream suppliers ( or producers ) in time . Who are the defaulters ? They include not only ordinary citizens , but also the provinces , the public sector , influential corporations and powerful individuals ( including political tycoons ) . To continue supplying power , the thermal producer has to borrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan ) and find alternative financial sources , unless the government makes the bounteous payment . The solution is simple : power distribution companies should promptly pay their dues to the generation companies . <p> However , circular debt is only the tip of the iceberg .

In such a case on November 8 , 2013 , in which former Chief Justice Iftikhar Hussain Chaudhry was part of a three-member panel , he remarked : " Everything is being run through nepotism and junior officers are being appointed on key posts .

To solve the energy crisis , the government needs to take a host of measures .

We need to reduce our reliance on furnace oil and costly imports , control line losses due to power theft and accelerate recoveries from private consumers , in addition to better maintaining government-owned power generation plants .

On the other hand , political activists are raising serious questions against NGO sector and accusing this sector to create or at least try to create a parallel governing system with the help of western money to destabilize weaker and young democracies and parliaments . <p> " Not-for-profit groupings across the world , intent on ' capacity building ' , ' reducing poverty ' and ensuring that the ' voices of the most marginalized ' are heard but these groups have hidden agendas to create fight between the People and Democracies , believe political circles in South Asia . <p> This issue of criticizing or supporting NGO sector is not simple to understand and it needs a detail and in-depth discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign help to work out their needs . <p> Researchers believe that the term non-governmental organization ( NGO ) is dating to the formation of the United Nations in 1945 , when a select club of international non-state agencies were awarded observer status to some of its meetings . The common factor uniting this group , apart from the fact that they were neither government agencies nor businesses in the traditional sense , is that they would have an avowed mission to work for a social good . NGO sector was built stronger than ever during Reagan-Thatcher years and governments in developing countries began looking at NGOs for providing support in health care , education and capacity building because a flood of foreign funding to NGOs was the theme of the decade . Aid to ' developing ' nations also began increasingly via NGOs rather than through government organs -- between 1975 and 1985 . The amount of aid coming through NGO route shot up by 1,400 per cent . NGOs actually became " Soft Power " tools of superpowers during this era . <p> " Armed with their billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolutionaries into salaried activists , funding artists , intellectuals and filmmakers , gently luring them away from radical confrontation " observed Suzanna Arundhati Roy , an Indian writer and activist . <p> Activism we saw in late 60s and early 70s died of or killed by " Paid Activism " and labour unions became incapable to get the support of civil societies thereby Corporate Sector became stronger to deal with governments on its own parameters . In simple word , along with governments and corporations , the two torrents of power in the global landscape -- NGOs were raised as a third force . <p> Corporate funding is also a critical issue as corporations seek to partner with NGOs as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) programs . This provides marketing and public relations benefits for businesses . These partnerships between corporations and NGOs allow corporations fix their agendas while dealing with civil societies , labour unions and government officials regarding standards of goods/services they provide and service structure they offer to employees . <p> Since NGOs receive funding from corporations , they may be reluctant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attract more funding , NGOs may tailor their activities to serve corporate interests and keep their eyes shut on labour laws , labour exploitation , Human Right abuses by multinational firms , contract job issues etc etc . Therefore , directly or indirectly NGOs help a system that is only interested in extracting labour at the cheapest possible price instead of raising voice against contract job system , exploitation of labour laws etc etc . <p> Funding dependency and a hierarchical , corporate culture -- many heads of international NGOs ( INGOs ) come from the business world . According to an Indian activist Dhananjayan Sriskandarajah : ' <p> Our conception of what is possible has narrowed dramatically . Since demonstrating bang for your buck has become all-important , we divide our work into neat projects , taking on only those endeavours that can produce easily quantifiable outcomes . Reliant on funding to service our own sizeable organizations , we avoid approaches or issues that might threaten our brand or upset our donors . We trade in incremental change . " <p> Non Government Organisation ( NGO ) sector is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most effective part of Development sector . This sector fills the gaps in developing countries where governments are resource-less , weak , ineffective or corrupt . Majority of NGOs are funded by western countries as figure is over 82% funding coming from Europe or North America to NGOs working in South Asia , Central Asia and Eastern Europe . This funding is part of philanthropist activates and support groups , UN funding , UASID funding , European Union funding and support from Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) . <p> NGO sector is working effectively as " Accountability Bureau for developing governments " , asking developing governments for accountability of Human Rights , Public Funds and Social Rights . NGOs train public to ask questions to their governments and demand accountability through capacity building and advocacy however NGO sector itself has no mechanism that can ensure their accountability to the people -- to the public and even to governments as governments are handcuffed to check their working in many countries through special arrangements . The only accountability of NGO sector is their annual audit report -- but this audio report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to such person and why A project was not initiated and why B project was opted etc etc . Therefore accountability is only to check 2+2=4 -- How much money comes and where it was utilized . However , NGO sectors questions governments why project A was initiated and why Mr. M was given high salary and what was the criterion and process to hire Mr. M. NGOs are being held accountable by their donors , which can erode rather than enhance their legitimacy , a difficult challenge to overcome . Some commentators have also argued that the changes in NGO funding sources have ultimately altered their functions . Here the risk of foreign funded agenda increases and most of time this agenda is in contradiction of public policy and sovereignty of the countries where NGOs are working . <p> NGO sector critiques perks and privileges of bureaucrats and politicians in developing countries and always raises voice to minimize establishment charges and overhead expenditures of government while this sector itself allows minimum 37% spending on establishment charges ( salaries , perks and privileges of employees ) according to World Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of NGOs on the point of their true nature are also emerging as important issues . As non-state actors with considerable influence over the governance in many areas , concerns have been expressed over the extent to which they represent the views of the public and the extent to which they allow the public to hold them to account " , commented one former Consultant while discussing NGO role in an academic paper . <p> The flood of NGOs has also been accused of damaging the public sector in developing countries and taking the place as a " parallel governments " and even playing to weaken elected and legitimate governments through funding anti-government activists . In some instance , NGOs are accuse of changing regimes like in Ukraine by funding anti-government protests in Maidan Euro and placing pro-US government of President Poroshenko . Eastern European and Central Asian governments firmly believe that western-funded NGOs plans , operates and execute so-called Revolutions including Orange Revolution and Rose Revolution in past . " NGO sector was caught red handed in Uzbekistan 10 years back when it was behind Andijan riots to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while talking to this writer . <p> There were reports that NGO sector was also behind an attempt to scrap Pakistani Parliament last year when two political parties sat outside Pakistani parliament for months , abusing democratic institutions including parliament and demanding disbanding sitting and elected government of Prime Minister Mian Nawaz Sharif . <p> Directly or indirect , NGO sector looks behind regime changes in developing countries by using and promoting narratives of Human Rights , Advocacy , Freedom of Speech , Capacity Building , and so on so forth . <p> What is the actual role of NOGs in developing or hurting democracies ? is a big question for developing countries having weak democratic institutes and this question should be taken as proposition for healthy discussion and debates .

There has been much debate in the recent years about young Pakistanis shunning their national dress and language , to adopt a more modern and western viewpoint , feeling almost ashamed to speak in Urdu amongst their peers . Enforcing Urdu as language for everyday communication opens up space for the cultural revival of Urdu .

Apart from this teething problem , there is one part of the policy that may not be too politically pragmatic . On the one hand the government has stated that correspondence with other countries and competitive examinations like the CSS will be in English , seemingly cognisant of the fact that English is essential for communication and competition . On the other hand , the president , the prime minister , and all government employees will deliver speeches in Urdu when outside the country .

@@4695231 <p> In Trinity Term this year , former Indian diplomat and currently a member of the Lok Sabha , Dr Shashi Tharoor , spoke at the Oxford Union debating society on the topic " This House Believes that Britain owes Reparations to her Former Colonies . " In a riveting speech -- and Dr Tharoor is an excellent orator -- he powerfully made the case that Britain indeed should pay reparations to her former colonies . <p> " Even if it is one pound for the next two hundred years , they should atone for colonialism , " he thundered to rapturous applause . While I have always admired Dr Tharoor for his statesmanship and applaud his positive role both in the United Nations and in the Indian parliament , I must , as a historian , beg to differ on this occasion . <p> Dr Tharoor began his speech using the oft-quoted figure that at the time the British entered India in the early 1600s , its share in the world economy was 23 per cent and when the British left the shores of India in the autumn of 1947 the share had dropped down to less than 4 per cent . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual economic change during the nearly three hundred and fifty years they purport to explain . First , the former figure is from a time when the Mughal Empire was at its highest point . Most of what is now Afghanistan , Pakistan and northern India was under the sway of the Mughal Empire and it was a time of relative peace and prosperity . <p> In terms of agriculture and industry too , India was comparably better than the rest of the world and the availability of excellent raw materials made it an important market . After this period , the Mughal Empire began to decline in the eighteenth century and by the time the British actually entered the political arena in India -- in 1757 , more than a century and a half after their arrival in India -- the reality in India was much different . <p> The India of 1757 was a far cry from the India Sir Thomas Roe had been sent to as ambassador in 1615 , and which mesmerised him . By 1757 the Mughal Empire was but a shell of its former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacked by the Persian Nadir Shah , the Marathas were in control of large swathes of central India , Afghanistan , Punjab , Bengal and the Deccan had become practically independent , while hundreds of small principalities had emerged in this period of decentralisation . <p> In such a scenario , the dramatic increase in taxes ( especially due to newer kingdoms emerging ) , the lack of security , arbitrary revenue settlement etc retarded economic growth in the region -- and all of this happened before the British became politically active in India . Therefore , India had long lost its position in the world economy , which it held in 1600 , by the time the British became involved in the politics of the country . <p> If India 's economic decline is to be blamed on anyone , perhaps the policies of the later Mughals and the period of decline needs to be understood first , before a blanket charge against the British is levelled . <p> Secondly , the above figures do not take into account the dramatic improvements in the economic performance of other regions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period . Europe and Britain were suffering from a lot of political and religious strife throughout the seventeenth century , which limited the economic development of the region , but by the middle of the eighteenth century -- when India was still in decline -- the industrial revolution and other innovations had begun to have an impact . <p> Hence it is not just that India 's economic power declined , but that the rate of economic development in other regions increased by a greater margin than India , and therefore India 's share of the world economy decreased . <p> Thirdly , a statistical comparison of India and Britain between 1600 and 1947 after keeping in mind the above mentioned facts makes it clear that the question of India 's economic retardation under the British is not as simple as Dr Tharoor would like us to believe . <p> According to the data gathered by Professor Angus Maddison in The World Economy : A Millennial Perspective , in 1600 India 's per capita GDP was $550 ( 1990 dollar levels ) , which remained the same for nearly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and was slightly lower at $540 by the time the British became politically active in India in the 1750s . It then declined a little during the haphazard rule of the East India Company ( keeping in mind that it took the Company nearly a century to bring just over two thirds of the land mass of India under their direct rule , the rest -- about one third , were the princely states -- Indian ruled territories , which remained separate units till the end of the British Raj ) , to about $520 , rising to about $620 during the ninety year Raj by Westminster , an increase of around 20 per cent . <p> At the same time the British per capita GDP increased from $974 in 1600 , to $1250 in 1700 , $1424 in 1757 , $2717 in 1856 and $6361 in 1947 . So while there was a dramatic increase in the British per capita GDP , it must be noted that in the one hundred and fifty years before British rule in India , the country 's GDP per capita declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Therefore , if India 's economic decline is to be blamed on anyone , perhaps the policies of the later Mughals and the period of decline needs to be understood first , before a blanket charge against the British is levelled . This is not to say that the British did not exploit India for their benefit , they indeed did , and a large part of the dramatic increase -- a jump of 234 per cent -- was due to the Empire , yet the extent to which British rule adversely affected the Indian economy should not be exaggerated . <p> If one compares the full GDP data of Britain and India in the corresponding period , an even more interesting picture comes out . India 's GDP in 1600 was $74,250 , and it only increased to $90,750 by 1800 , an increase of about 22 per cent . By the time the British were politically active , the GDP was at $99,900 , an improvement of only 10 per cent in a little over half a century . <p> During the century of the rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an expansion of about 18 per cent , while during the ninety years of the Raj it grew to $255,852 , an increase of nearly 117 per cent !

The president of AJK went to the extent of terming such a step more damaging than the dismemberment of the country in 1971 . This chest-thumping by the Kashmiri leadership is an attempt to browbeat the Pakistani state to maintain the status quo in Gilgit-Baltistan . <p> A salient feature of the statements by the AJK premiere and president regarding Gilgit-Baltistan is their apathetic attitude towards the voices and aspirations of the people of Gilgit-Baltistan . Similar sentiments were expressed when the government of Pakistan introduced the Gilgit-Baltistan Empowerment and Self-governance Order in 2009 . These reactions should not be seen as anomalies ; rather they show a consistent pattern in the narrative of Kashmir that has been used by Kashmiri leadership and intelligentsia for more than six decades . <p> Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , the contours of Kashmiri nationalism have also been imbued by colonial mindset and policies of which they themselves are victims . Now the inconsistencies and consistent anomalies in the Kashmiri nationalist narrative have reached a point where , instead of winning sympathies of other non-Kashmiri groups , they are antagonising them against the Kashmiri cause . And the position of Gilgit-Baltistan vis- ? -vis Kashmir is a case in point . <p> Before taking stock of the monomaniac mindset of the Kashmiri leadership , it is important to trace the genealogy of thought and identities formed in the crucible of colonialism . Historically , the region of Gilgit-Baltistan was ruled by different principalities in its various valley domains . Culturally and historically , this region was never a part of Kashmir . It is only after the advent of the British in the middle of the nineteenth century that the region got implicated in Kashmir and the Great Game of which Kashmiris were not players . <p> Even the very identity of Jammu and Kashmir is a modern phenomenon as the process of boundary making , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of British India commences with the conquest of Punjab in the Anglo-Sikh wars " .

" <p> 1846 was the year when the Treaty of Amritsar was signed . At that time the British colonial administration and Dogras did not have a clear idea about the northern frontiers of British India . That is why the territory of Maharaja Gulab Singh in the treaty was loosely defined as " hilly or mountainous country with its dependencies situated eastward of the river Indus ... " Thereby , it excluded Hunza , Nagar , Ghizer , Gilgit and Chitral , which were on the west of the Indus . It took the next 100 years to map the unchartered territories situated in the regions spanning from Karakoram , Hindukush , Pamirs , the Himalaya and the Tibetan Plateau . Subsequently , it helped in boundary-making in High Asia in the twentieth century . <p> Herman Kreutzmann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' , is of the view that " The subsequent boundary-making was part of a strategy to consolidate spheres of influence across borders and significantly affected the areas which are nowadays part of Gilgit-Baltistan . The Karakoram principalities became entities that -- in the case of Hunza and Nager -- enjoyed a special status as autonomous states under the dual rule in the Gilgit Agency . " <p> Unlike the account propagated by the Kashmiri leadership , the fact is that the Kashmir valley experienced geographical mutations throughout its history . Even the redrawing of boundaries during the Dogra rule did not elicit any reaction from the then leadership of Kashmir . The Kashmir imbroglio emerged on the international scene only after the redrawing of boundaries after the establishment of the newly independent states of India and Pakistan . Therefore , it can be said that Kashmiri nationalism is a by-product of the apathetic cartographic activities of British explorers and adventurers in High Asia .

It is injudicious on the part of Pakistani ruling class and Kashmiri leadership to make the region hostage to the Kashmir conflict for an indefinite period . India has already given representation , albeit symbolic , in Lokh Sabha to Gilgit-Baltistan , but it has not harmed the Indian stance on Kashmir . The inclusion of Gilgit-Baltistan will make the Pakistani position stronger .

This is possible only when they feel the popular pulse . The Kashmiri leadership acts contrary to this rule , and behaves like a Dogra suzerain whose vassals would follow their whims , vagaries and reactions . The engagement of the Kashmiri leadership with the local people of Gilgit-Baltistan can be well gauged from the fact that none of the major Kashmiri political parties have a presence in the region . They have never ever won even a seat at the Union Council level let alone winning in a constituency of the Gilgit-Baltistan Legislative Assembly ( GBLA ) . <p> The postponement of the long overdue political status to Gilgit-Baltistan by Pakistan and opposition by the Kashmiri ruling class has already proven detrimental to the socio-political and economic empowerment of the region . In the long run the apathetic attitude of the Kashmiri leadership towards Gilgit-Baltistan will not only harm the Kashmiri cause . It may well be possible that the majority of the people in this region will not favour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be subsumed under Kashmiri nationalism . <p> For the last 67 years the socio-political , economic and demographic realities in Gilgit-Baltistan have undergone sea change . These developments brought about drastic changes in the political stance regarding Gilgit-Baltistan vis- ? -vis Kashmir . Now the Kashmiri leadership can not coerce the new generation by invoking and imposing decisions , treatise , categories , policies , views and identities manufactured by the colonial power for its vested interest . <p> The failure of the Kashmiri leadership to liberate Kashmir stems from their inability to create an indigenous narrative , and their over-reliance on decisions of which they themselves are victims . The only sane advice to the Kashmiri leadership and intelligentsia is to do away with narrative of seeing the same deprivations and sufferings in the ' Other ' -- Gilgit-Baltistan.

The question of religion and its significance is not only a societal and communal one but , at the same time , a deeply moral and individual one . It involves dealing with the nature of life in its totality and death , all in the purview of God .

People were surprised when one of the individuals behind the Safoora massacre was seen to have had such a ' normal ' upbringing and education from all the ' good ' schools and colleges but an education in business is merely vocational training . It does not teach you how to grapple with the complexity of the religious experience , which is a very human thing and thus requires some philosophical introspection and investigation . <p> Of what drives these people , we can only surmise .

In other words , the adherents of such an ideology fail to walk the tightrope of religion . <p> They say there is no zealot like a convert and that no reactionary who has turned to religion has ever sought to understand its essence . They do not put themselves through the necessary theological inquiry and discipline that is required .

For those seeking to understand the nature of all that is , one does not go higher than that discipline we call metaphysics and on that the German philosopher Hegel has remarked , " Metaphysics is essentially rational theology .

The Taliban leadership used this time to relocate from its original hideouts in North Waziristan and traditional locations in mainland Pakistan .

By now , the role of the Rangers has much expanded to make them autonomous of the provincial government of Sindh . <p> Another factor that has contributed to the decline of the civilian democratic system is the terrorist attack on the Army Public School , Peshawar , on December 16 , 2015 and the subsequent civil-military decision to go after violent groups with full force . The military joined with the civilian authorities to devise a new strategy to cope with the Pakistani Taliban .

It was also decided that federal institutions would be used for curbing corruption in the government on the assumption that some of these monetary gains also made their way to terrorism . These issues were discussed in the Sindh apex committee and the Federal-level apex committee and the prime minister was on board for the extended scope of action by the Rangers and other federal institutions , such as NAB and the FIA in Karachi .

The problem is that the prime minister can not offer much to the MQM to save them from the wrath of the Rangers . The same is the case when it comes to the grievances of the PPP . This means that the prime minister 's political position will be weakened if these two political parties decide to openly oppose him . <p> The PPP is pursuing a two-pronged strategy of asking the prime minister that as the chief executive of the country , he should take the lead in controlling the role of security agencies and federal institutions and that he should accommodate the grievances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PPP is asking the military not to pursue the anti-corruption and antiterrorism drive in a selective manner .

If he accommodates these two political parties , he runs the risk of undermining his apparently smooth interaction with the armed forces . However , if the military takes the initiative in pursuing sectarian and other hardline Islamic groups in Punjab and NAB decides to take up corruption related issues in Punjab , the Nawaz-military relations can run into serious trouble . <p> The next four to six weeks will determine the direction of civilian politics and Nawaz-military relations .

Therefore , the present or a reshuffled civilian order is needed to deal with multiple problems of political participation and socio-economic justice that are over and above the external and internal threats currently faced by Pakistan .

@@4717238 <p> It is a truth universally acknowledged -- or at least in Pakistan -- that our lives are cheap , expendable even . And this truth was more than amply demonstrated in the death of ten-month-old Bisma on Wednesday . The new Trauma Centre at the Civil Hospital in Karachi became a site of tragedy after ten-month-old Bisma was denied entry for emergency treatment at the hospital . The reason ? PPP Co-Chairman Bilawal Bhutto and the Sindh chief minister were visiting the public hospital to open the centre . The tragedy unfolded live on media as the girl 's father pleaded to be let into the hospital but was turned away due to VVIP security protocol . According to doctors , the child could have been saved had she been brought in ten minutes sooner . These ten minutes are a reminder of the constant culture of impunity of the political elite . What was supposed to be a life-saving place for the people of the city became a reminder of the terrible cost we pay for keeping our elected representatives and leaders ' safe ' -- no matter the fatal consequences of this safety for us . A tragedy of this kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted in public apologies and resignations . Not so here . The PPP government in Sindh , instead , decided this was just the right moment to reiterate how important Bilawal 's life is for them . Apparently , keeping Bilawal safe means keeping the country safe . <p> The absolute indifference to the lives of the ordinary citizens of Pakistan -- ' ordinary ' and helpless as compared to the ' VIP ' -- is palpable . Whether it be the PPP , the PML-N or the PTI the issue of our ' VIP culture ' is endemic and dangerous enough to take lives . Bilawal has reportedly called for an inquiry into the matter , but that has become more or less the default excuse after every incident . More importantly , political leaders from other parties acting holier-than-thou over this incident would do well to remember their own constituencies and their own VIP protocols before pointing fingers at others . In the case of Bisma , the obscenity of the PPP 's response was made even more glaring with the dignified response of Bisma 's mother -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these exalted VIPs . If only for the sake of pretence -- and politics -- one would have expected the PPP to have come up with a less blatantly arrogant response . After all , this is a party that has for years claimed to stand for the poor and the downtrodden . We do not question the right of political leaders to be secure and safe as they move around our cities . We do not question the fact that there is , yes , a security threat to many political parties and their prominent leaders . But the fact also is that there has never even been an effort at ensuring that VVIP ' movement ' or security protocol do not disrupt people 's lives . The fact is that these VVIPs have continued building walls around themselves , encroaching on private citizen 's rights as they do so . The fact is that Bisma 's life does n't really matter . 
@@4717239 <p> When Samuel Huntington put forward his thesis of ' Clash of civilisations ' , he argued that increased interaction and communication in the world will lead to more profound awareness of the differences between civilisations . He also predicted that due to economic moderation and social changes , people will lose their longstanding local identities , and that gap will be replaced by religion . His theory has proven itself to be true in our world today . <p> Time magazine shortlisted names for its annual ' Person of the year ' , in which two candidates were the Islamic State leader Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi and the US Presidential hopeful , Donald Trump . Regardless of the worldwide condemnation of Trump 's outbursts , he is on the offensive not only to charm the voters but to change their mindsets forever . It is not religion , but rather the supremacist mindsets across the world that are leading to the ultimate clash of civilisations . The world needs to evolve above religious differences and follow justice , truthfulness and respect .
