@@1418233 <h> Final Fantasy XIII ( PS3 ) <p> It 's the thirteenth Final Fantasy and it 's most likely anything but the final one if history means anything . And after so many games in a series well known for each game being completely different while remaining recognizable as a series , has Square Enix been able to keep things interesting ? I would say yes , definitely , but not quite as interesting as they might have . <p> Like most recent Final Fantasy games , the plot pretty much consists of a rag-tag bunch of people who must become powerful enough to take down some bad guy . This requires a lot of fighting because we know the only way to get more powerful is to fight the same creatures over and over again until you can destroy them with your pinky and a small stapler . Thus , the most important feature in the game , or any like it to my mind , is the battle system . Thankfully in Final Fantasy XIII the battle system is brilliant . It 's a difficult to describe thing , but suffice to say it 's truly fun . It 's always engaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have a certain amount of real time to make the choice of what to do on your " turn " ) , and there are many more choices to make than just choosing what your character does . While the fight is going on you can flip between different paradigms , which are sets of roles assigned to each team member . Doing this effectively is often vitally important for your survival , and while it can boil down to " attack , attack " and then " heal , heal , " it 's usually a lot more interesting because your strategy has to adapt to fighting one giant behemoth in one battle and ten nudibranches in the next . <p> The paradigms are sets of roles -- each character has three of six roles ( to start with ) . Commando is the aggressive role , dealing large melee damage to the enemy . The Ravager is the attack support role , hitting the enemy with a barrage of elemental attacks . The Medic heals people as medics are wont to do . The Sentinel is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team takes down the enemy or heals up . The Saboteur undermines the strength of the enemy by weakening its defenses . Finally , the Synergist bolsters ( or buffs in RPG-speak ) the team-members ' abilities , improving attack strength or defense against the dark arts ( or swords ) . With three members in your party ( out of six main characters ) , each with three possible natural roles , the number of different configurations you can have in your party is pretty sizable . Many times the fights involve trying to get the enemy to stagger -- hit them enough with your Commandos and Ravagers and they become stunned , at which point you can do massive damage to them . The roles work in tandem -- the Commando doing damage and the Ravager increasing the stagger gauge , while the others offer support . The system is really strategic -- a different paradigm plan can make the difference between winning and losing . The only issue is that experimentation , or trying more outlandish paradigms , usually leads to death , so the variation is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am jumping a little ahead of myself -- the full battle system is only available after about 25 hours of play , and until that point you have to be content to learn it bit by bit . For RPG veterans this will be a bit of drag , but for those new to the series and the genre it will be welcome . For my part I liked the slow build-up of the battle system as it felt like you , the player , were leveling up as you were able to do and control more . The first hour of battles during which you could n't make any decisions and did n't get any reward did seem a little pointless though , but after a slow start the system grows into a really fun and rewarding challenge . <p> Each battle earns you Crystal Points to spend in the Crystarium , a graphical representation of the skills and abilities a character has . This is pretty basic stuff wrapped up in a 3D crystal representation -- all you can really choose is which role to enhance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an area before you defeat the boss and gain access to more abilities . This , along with an arcane equipment-leveling system , means the main choices in the game are in the creation of paradigms and when to trigger which in battle -- not in customizing the skill sets of the characters . Character growth , and choices in how characters grow in power , is a staple of the role-playing-game , so in this respect the extreme paring down of mechanics means less of the " role-playing " aspect is intact . <p> The setting of Final Fantasy XIII is interesting -- there is politics and intrigue and the uncovering of deeper levels of truth all through the game , and some of it is done in spectacular style . The pre-rendered cut scenes are truly breathtaking in high-definition , and the production values of the game are unbelievable in these sequences ( and , really , everywhere else in the game too ) . Money ca n't necessarily buy a good script , as most Hollywood blockbusters will attest to , and this game 's script is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blockbusters ) . Characters say things that come out of nowhere and never seem to have conversations that are anything like true-to-life . Some repeat annoying phrases , some say inane things while trying to sound serious . Despite this I came to like all the characters ( although not all the time ) and enjoyed the plot itself . Most of the exposition actually happens in the form of a datalog you can optionally read , which means there are n't many drawn-out dialogue sequences explaining all the details about Cocoon , fal'Cie , l'Cie and Focuses . This is fortunate as they say these four words enough times already . <p> In the same way as the battle system starts off with few options and grows , the scenarios start in a very linear fashion and finally open out into a wider roaming area . If you prefer your role-playing-games to have an air of exploration , of looking around to see what you can see , then Final Fantasy XIII wo n't satisfy that interest , at least for the first 25 hours or so . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while there is some variation in location and battle teams , the rhythm of the game is linear too -- a set of fights followed by a cut-scene , or perhaps a flashback , followed by more fights , then a cut-scene , then fights culminating in a big boss-fight which is followed by another cut-scene . There is almost no break from this sequence -- no towns to explore , no other activities to do or side-quests to perform . It 's all incredibly streamlined , and whether you prefer the battles or the other aspects of role-playing-games will vastly change your enjoyment of Final Fantasy XIII . <p> I like the guidance , the straightforward nature of the scenarios , mainly because I find it highly frustrating to have to do some little thing in some little town to advance the plot -- I like the way you ca n't possibly lose the plot . However , after many hours of play I did want a little bit of variation in the rhythm such an area to explore that was n't all about fighting . I thoroughly enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed and strategy , and the choices you make in terms of team members and paradigms really does make a difference to the outcome of battles . I love the graphics , the game is a powerhouse of artistic design , and the pre-rendered cut-scenes are phenomenal except for the scripts . Final Fantasy XIII is spectacular but flawed , lots of fun but achingly still short of its potential . Square Enix is to be admired to completely overhauling Final Fantasy again , but there is a nagging 
@@1418234 <h> . co.za versus . com <p> The recently completed " dot ZA market survey " of the dot ZA Domain Name Authority ( ZADNA ) shows that South African businesses and people prefer to use co.za to dot com . <p> This is the result of an intensive market survey which began in November 2009 and involved thousands of online and telephone interviews with . za domain name holders ( registrants ) , business people and non-profit entities . It was concluded in late February this year . <p> ZADNA intended to use the survey to better understand the dot ZA market and in particular to ascertain what improvements were needed to make dot ZA more attractive and so better serve the interests of South African organisations . <p> According to Vika Mpisane , the GM of ZADNA , " the research results are very important as they provide answers to most of the questions we and our stakeholders had about improving the . za space . These answers clarify what interventions ZADNA or its stakeholders need to make to improve ZADNA . " <p> What was very noticeable from the results is that 83% of South African businesses choose to use co.za @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15% of local businesses confirmed having dot Com website names . When asked if they considered having both co.za and dot Com names was necessary , 58% of businesses interviewed answered " yes " . <p> " This must be put into a correct perspective : the perceived need for registering your product and brand names across multiple domains results from the ever-increasing instances of trademark abuse online . To counter the potential for such abuse , a growing number of local and international businesses now register in as many domains as possible . " <p> The survey also shows that dot Com still ranks better than the rest of other dot ZA domains , such as org.za and gov.za . This is understandable because the rest of dot ZA domains are more focused on a smaller communities and sectors . <p> Providing an example , Mpisane said : " The growth of gov.za will always be limited as government and its organisations can not be expected to grow as radically as business organisations , plus some government entities , such as parastatals and municipalities , register their website names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> What the survey results also show is that most South Africans are patriotic and loyal to South Africa when they choose their online presence . Fifty percent of the interviewees chose this as the main factor influencing their choice , while affordability of dot ZA domain names came second . <p> Pitting co.za against dot Com , 83% of the interviewees chose co.za ahead of dot Com as giving them superiority locally . Co.za also outscored dot Com by a great margin when it comes to affordability of registration -- 93% chose co.za here -- and 75% percent felt that co.za gives their business most online credibility . Probably as expected , dot Com outscored co.za when it comes to global appeal . <p> Most Internet service providers ( ISPs ) and registrants felt that the process of registering dot ZA domain names should be made easier by automation . <p> " The need for more automation can never be over-emphasised , and ZADNA will answer this through the licensing of dot ZA domain registries ( i.e. operators of domain name databases ) and registrars ( i.e. ISPs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central registry that can standardise such automation across most . za domains . " <p> The survey also tested South Africans ' awareness of the new generic ( i.e. non-country specific ) domain names that ICANN , the entity managing the global Internet domain name and IP numbering systems , is planning to introduce in due course . Most South Africans are not aware of such plans , but ISPs showed substantial awareness ( at 44% ) , as expected because they are the entities that sell domain name registration services . <p> Interviewees were asked about introduction of new 2nd level domains such as city or region-specific domains . When tested on this , respondents felt that city-specific domains were not as attractive as they could because of the potential for changing city and region names in South Africa . There was also very little enthusiasm shown for registering names directly under dot ZA ( i.e. yourname.za instead of yourname.org.za ) and for introducing biz.za to compete with co.za . <p> " The feeling is that allowing registrations of names directly under dot ZA will lead to a potential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an unnecessary cost as a result of putting measures in place to try and protect known brands , something which sometimes may be quite a challenge to do " , says Mpisane . <p> What the results showed was that mobi.za , fam.za ( for families ) and shop.za ( for retailers ) were seen as potentially the most attractive additional options . Music.za also showed support by some . <p> In the light of attempts by some Western Internet companies to apply to ICANN to open up new top level domains using local city names , such as dot Joburg , dot Durban and dot Zulu , the respondents overwhelmingly felt that South Africa did not need to have multiple identities online . <p> " ZADNA is aware of frantic attempts by non-South African Internet companies to abuse local city , heritage and tribal names as new top level domains . This survey shows that not only are such attempts unfounded , but they go right against the feeling of South Africans . South Africans are happy with dot ZA as their online identity .

But if you are an **25;556;TOOLONG practitioners , have you taken the time to study this legislation , the new Consumer Protection Act , which goes live in April 2010 ? <p> Do you understand the implications of the act for the communications industry , and more so , for your clients ? <h> What you need to know <p> According to the Department of Trade and Industry , the primary purpose of the new act is to prevent exploitation or harm to consumers . <p> The law regulates the way businesses relate with consumers and how they market their products and services . The act therefore applies not only to " every transaction occurring within the Republic " ( subject to certain exemptions ) but also to the marketing and supply of goods and services . <p> The act touches on many aspects of supply relationships , including warranties , pricing , standards of service and quality , advertising , labelling , marketing and others . The act introduces a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts within " cooling-off " periods , to refuse to purchase " bundled " products or services , to cancel fixed-term agreements if not satisfied with their terms and to block approaches by direct marketers , amongst many others . <p> There is also a distinct focus throughout the act on clear and understandable language and ensuring that the consumer is not misled by suppliers . <p> Most controversially , the act introduces a system of product liability on suppliers for damage caused by the supply of defective goods . A consumer can therefore claim damages from producers , distributors or suppliers for any death , injury , loss , damage to property and economic loss , without having to prove negligence . <p> Contraventions of the act will not be treated lightly and there is provision for hefty penalties for non-compliance . <p> While the Advertising Standards Authority ( ASA ) code may already cover many of these areas , the consumer now has a big stick : " the consumer may hold at their whim any or all persons in the supply chain liable for damages ...

( And by the way , a consumer does n't actually have to buy your product : they can complain even if it 's on shelf and it offends them . ) <h> Substantial legal and financial risk <p> Thus , marketers now are exposed to substantial legal and financial risk , over and above being rapped on the knuckles by the ASA for breach of the code . <p> From what I can see , the professional marketing community is on top of this legislation and its consequences . <p> Communication agencies , whether advertising , packaging design , PR , digital - whatever - need to be working closely with their clients on their brand claims and promises , their advertising messaging , the copy on their packaging . <p> They should also be chatting to a friendly attorney who understands this stuff ( I 'm just the messenger ) and buttoning down their role in this act .

The primary reason is significant Capex savings , and the ability to finance an ERP solution from the company 's operating budget . In fact , many SMEs select this outsource-model for their entire IT department , saving costs , resources and enabling the company to focus on its core competencies . <p> However , while interest in SaaS is definitely on the increase , uptake is still relatively slow amongst SMEs . One of the reasons is that many small business owners are not familiar with the IT industry , and SaaS is an advanced concept requiring a certain level of understanding . Many of these business owners would prefer to tangibly see where their investment has gone , so owning the box is still important to them in spite of the financial pressures many of them face . <p> In this context , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maintenance of in-house ERP systems is a very costly exercise over the long term , and SMEs especially will not be in a position to finance them . To remain relevant , vendors will again need to innovate to find ways to meet service levels and customer expectations while remaining commercially viable . <p> On the whole , the ERP market looks set for another growth spurt in 2010 . While demand in the retail industry will remain low because consumers have not yet recovered from the financial crunch , more activity can be expected from companies in the manufacturing , distribution and mining industries . Thanks to their destocking process of the past year or so , these businesses are under less pressure , and it is likely that demand for ERP in these industries will increase .

SA adopted the rival European digital video broadcast terrestrial ( DVB-T ) standard in 2006 and has run extensive trials using the technology . <p> Industry leaders have been taken aback by government 's announcement last week that it will consider other digital standards for terrestrial broadcasting , saying the move could set back the migration to digital television by years . The migration to digital is expected to free up scarce radio frequency spectrum that can then be used to introduce new channels , offer high-definition television and provide wireless broadband services . <p> Sources told TechCentral earlier this week that the Brazilian government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adopt ISDB-T , is putting pressure on SA to switch away from its commitment to DVB-T . <p> Gerhard Petrick , a representative at the Southern African Digital Broadcasting Association , an industry body , says government 's call for a standards debate is " clearly biased against the adopted DVB-T standard and signals that the department of communications has bought into the sales talk of the Japanese and Brazilian lobbyists " . <p> But Mohlala has poured cold water on suggestions that government has already decided to ditch DVB-T in favour of ISDB-T . She says no decisions have been made and this week 's symposium has been called to debate the merits of the different technology standards . She also says there have been no agreements with Brazil related to digital television , despite a recent delegation to that country , led by Mohlala . <p> " I need to put the industry 's concerns at ease . There is no secret agreement and there is no decision to abandon the DVB-T standard , " Mohlala says . <p> She says technology has moved on since 2006 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different options is needed before the country commits itself to a commercial roll-out of digital terrestrial services . DVB-T , she says , has been " found to be somewhat problematic and this is why Europe is now moving to DVB-T2 " . <p> DVB-T2 is an extension of the DVB-T standard . <p> " What we 're saying is , it is time for us to have a discussion about the challenges with the DVB-T standard , the challenges with the DVB-T2 standard , and to consider what ISDB-T provides , and then come up with what is most beneficial for SA from a developmental point of view , " Mohlala says . <p> She says government is keen to adopt the technology that best allows it to provide e-government services , especially to the rural poor . <p> " There is nothing that prevents DVB-T providers from coming to us and making proposals in line with government 's priorities , " Mohlala says . <p> " If there are manufacturers that are willing to bring forward proposals that meet our developmental needs , which include job creation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard , it is incumbent on us as government to listen , " she says . " We must n't choose technology just for the sake of technology . We need to ensure it meets our developmental agenda and that 's why we are saying , let 's hear which technology best aligns itself to this agenda . " <p> Mohlala admits that if the country were to adopt a different standard , it would require buy-in from all the countries in the Southern African Development Community ( SADC ) . The SADC countries have to agree on technologies and standards to ensure frequency harmonisation so that there is n't cross-border interference in the airwaves . <p> Mohlala says she has already engaged personally with her peers in other SADC countries . " I spoke to them personally , and they welcomed the reopening of the discussions , " she says .

Of course , we all now are familiar some of his better-known brands -- Oudemeester and Richelieu ( in liquor ) and Stuyvesant , Lexington and Rothmans ( tobacco ) . <p> But one of his earliest trademarks was the well-known " Van Rijn " mark consisting of the yellow packet and then a picture , or portrait of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and a palette in the other . <p> Of interest is the fact that he first registered the Van Rijn trademark not for cigarettes , but for brandy .

But the important thing for him and his group was to become the owner of so many well-known trademarks .

But two years later Sibeko and his business partner , Desire Thomas , had lost the business because , Sibeko said , he did not have the energy to battle Pick n Pay any more . <p> The retail industry is a competitive , cut-throat business .

Pick n Pay denies these claims and says that , apart from a handful of franchisees who were not suited to the business , the programme has been a major success . <p> But Sibeko said that from the beginning Pick n Pay was not upfront with franchisees about the state of the Score stores . Sales were in deep decline , Score 's market share was shrinking and poor hygiene and disrepair was endemic . <p> Other franchisees who had similar difficulties with Pick n Pay did not want to go on the record , as they said they had been asked to sign confidentiality agreements . The company also denies this . <p> According to Sibeko , Kliptown Pick n Pay 's troubles began as soon as the store opened . As part of the deal , the partners had to invest a minimum of R600 000 .

That left the store in debt to Pick n Pay and with ongoing cash-flow difficulties , from which it never managed to extricate itself . <p> As part of the initial store outlay , corporate staff were sent in to order the first month 's stock on behalf of the franchisees . Sibeko said that these employees , who did not work for the franchise , ordered inappropriately for the Kliptown market . Expensive jams and oils , better suited to places like Sandton , filled the stores ' shelves . <p> In addition , a great deal of out-of-range , expired and damaged stock was ordered for the store 's opening .

Sibeko said they did not fight this because they wanted nothing more to do with Pick n Pay . <p> The other franchisees of former Score stores experienced similar problems . Equipment -- from fridges and ovens to extractor fans -- failed a few weeks after store openings , and goods ordered on their behalf , or goods they were expected to order , were wholly inappropriate for their customers . <p> " It 's terrible when you invest your life savings into something and you walk away with nothing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different story .

@@1578240 <h> Business <h> Low-key reaction to MTN BEE deal <p> The formerly disadvantaged will be able to pick up shares at an 80% discount . <p> Given the 80% discount at which shares will be offered to ordinary black people who can come up with as little as R2 000 to invest , I would have thought that MTN 's latest BEE deal would have attracted more press comment . <p> Perhaps it is because the scheme will actually kick off only at the end of August -- the prospectus has not yet been issued and some details have to be finalised . Or perhaps BEE public offerings are no longer novel , but reaction definitely seemed to be muted . <p> In the past some white South Africans have complained of being discriminated against in not being eligible for such deals . In any case , at more than R8-billion , the MTN Zakhele scheme , as it will be known , is a timely reminder that big deals are not yet quite extinct . This is not the first BEE scheme to offer shares at a discount , but it is the biggest discount yet . <p> The Vodacom retail scheme sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Asonge scheme , which also involved MTN shares but was an initiative of the National Empowerment Fund , offered a 20% discount . <p> The way the Zakhele scheme works is that if you are an African , coloured or Indian South African , or South African-born Chinese person , you will pay R20 for a share that on Friday last week was going for around R118 . This includes black companies , trusts , broad-based ownership schemes and groups such as stokvels . <p> And you will be getting a share , moreover , in a homegrown multinational that has carved out a place for itself in the world telecommunications market and with a consistent profit record . No transaction is without risk , including such examples of people 's capitalism , and I would never advise one way or another . <p> Past performance is certainly no guarantee of the future , though it may give a strong indication . Those black investors who bought Sasol 's shares at an 11% discount are still waiting for the share to climb back to the R366 discounted level , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A condition of the Zakhele scheme is that you can not sell the share for three years . After three years you can sell to another black person . After six years you can sell to whomever you want to sell to . You are not buying shares directly in MTN , but in a black investment company set up by MTN to hold the shares on your behalf . <p> Lock-ins are common in BEE deals , but the Zakhele scheme has one of the shorter periods . The lock-ins commonly hold for 10 years . The longer the lock-in the greater the potential opportunity cost . You do n't want to lock up too much of your cash -- you might really need that money but not be able to get your hands on it . <p> The official statements do not mention a dividend when discussing the public offer , however these can make all the difference . Special dividends paid off handsomely for those who bought Telkom Khulisa shares . <p> When discussing the shares of the attendant and much smaller employee share ownership scheme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's official statement does explicitly mention dividends . Eligible share ownership plan employees , MTN says , will be entitled to full voting and dividend rights and will be allocated 400 MTN shares each , though this will be scaled back if the value , at implementation , costs more than R50 000 per employee . <p> Shares will be issued to employees directly and they will have to hold them for at least five years . Though the employee share scheme was announced at the same time , it is completely separate and will go ahead even if the BEE deal is scrapped . And it will be if the offer is dramatically undersubscribed . If it raises less than about R425-million , MTN will not go ahead with the scheme . <p> If it raises less than R833-million but more than R425-million , it may decide to go ahead and make up the shortfall so as to sell the shares at a later date to black investors . No maximum has been set for investors at this stage . MTN says allocation will be made from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least number of shares will get priority . <p> Black employees and directors of MTN can apply for the scheme , but will not get preferential treatment . Individual black customers of MTN will get preferential allocation if the shares are oversubscribed , as long as they have been " Rica-ed " . <p> Company again top of the log The MTN Zakhele BEE deal will once again re-establish MTN as the country 's biggest BEE company . This is a title it held for many years , courtesy of the stake held by black management and staff in the company through the Newshelf 664 vehicle . That stake , which had dropped to 13% , was unwound in December 2008 and MTN said it would use some of the shares it bought back from Newshelf for a new BEE transaction . <p> MTN is in the top 10 companies on the JSE by market capitalisation , the current value of all its shares . The company points out the deal will mean that MTN South Africa , the local subsidiary of the MTN Group , has an immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , as the stake that is intended to be transferred to the public in this latest BEE deal is only 4% . That 4% is at the group level . <p> MTN is a diversified company with earnings streams from many regions and countries , including Iran . Though it has its roots in South Africa , this country now contributes only around 23% of MTN 's roughly calculated earnings . Also , the BEE Codes of Good Practice allow a company to subtract what are called " mandated investments " and investments from government and Section 21 companies from its pool of shares before calculating the BEE stake . <p> Mandated investments comprise pension fund and other collective investment entities such as medical aid schemes and unit trusts . A company can exclude up to 40% of its shares in terms of the exclusion principle , and MTN is doing just that . The effect is to boost the BEE shareholding and if you do the sums you do indeed get 29% . MTN points out that other BEE investments take the figure above 29% , but does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funded by a combination of a straight donation by MTN , with financial engineering , such as vendor finance . <p> The cost to MTN is around R2.2- billion in total , or around 1% of its market capitalisation . In addition , setting up the deal and the accompanying employee share scheme cost R162-million . As always , shareholders pay . They seem to be happy to do so , probably regarding it as money well spent to fortify MTN 's position in South Africa . <p> The share price has risen after the announcement of the deal . Whether such broad-based BEE schemes make much difference to the ownership structure of the economy in the medium term is doubtful , because most investors will probably want to sell after six years to benefit from a rise in the price of their shares . Many ordinary , mostly middle-class black people stand to benefit from this redistribution of wealth from shareholders to the public . <p> It will expose many people to the concept of share ownership , as former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher did in the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public loyalty and support , and is good for its reputation in general , as well as enabling compliance with the ownership section of the BEE codes . It has to be asked whether government ownership and BEE requirements have not contributed to less competition . But that is a matter for another column .

Rape is a serious issue in this country especially and it can not become a ( in this instance ) " girl who cried wolf " situation . Does she realise she may now make it easier for people to doubt other girls when they report rapes ? silly girl . And I really had tons of sympathy for her when this story broke . <p> Dr. Zeek - 2010-11-18 15:31 <p> It 's still STATUTORY rape , even if it was consensual . It 's in the interests of society to prosecute statutory rape , consensual or not . <p> Rudi - 2010-11-18 16:03 <p> What if the boys ' friends went to her house and threatened her if she does n't change her story ? I do n't know , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? But I do agree , it 's like the scholar who accused her teacher of indecent behavior a month ago . In the end he was acquitted because of her poor case and the fact that she has done this before but what about the teacher now ? And what about those poor girls ( or boys ! ) who will be too scared in future to open their mouths knowing people will doubt them as just another little brat who could n't get her way and decided to ruin a teacher 's life . <p> Zoolie - 2010-11-18 16:08 <p> Dear Dr Zeek with a . please tell me you are not her boyfriend trying to stand up for her . I for 1 still believe she was raped without consent , but claiming statutory rape isnt gon na work . you can only be held accountable if you are 18 or older having sex with someone below the age of 16 and then you can still argue that the boy isnt old enough to have forced the issue , get your facts straight DR . <p> Emile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statutory rape and not just rape . It does n't matter whether it was consensual or not . My fear is that we are sitting with 14 &amp; 16 year old boys here . What will they become in a year or two . <p> Ryan - 2010-11-18 19:27 <p> Emile .... And why are you only worried about the boys ? ? We have a young girl here , who by all reports , enjoyed what happened . Why is it always the mens fault ? If a girl is up for group sex , why is it the boys who are in trouble ? She is 15 , why isnt she charged with raping the 14 year old boy ? Or can rape only every be male against female ? My family moved to Canada a while ago , and were shocked at the young age of people having sex . Average canadian age to start having sex is around 16 years and 2 months . AVERAGE ! Average american , 15 years and 7 months ... AVERAGE .... These are young boys AND girls . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forced her to charge the boys . And another thing .. if as reported at one point in the video " she enjoyed it " THis probably was not her first time . Especially considering there were 2 boys . Now they are branded as rapists ? More like she needs to learn some morals . <p> DandyLion - 2010-11-19 09:51 <p> @Zoolie Please have your facts straight before you comment as you are clearly making yiourself an idiot . Dr. Zeek is correct in saying that minors under 16 can not consent to sex , even if they are in love . It is against the law and the fact that both the girl and the boys are all underage , they are all held accountable for the actions . In the eyes of the law , she committed stat rape by engaging the boys and the boys committed stat rape by engaging the girl . That 's the law and it should be implemented more strongly , such as in the case of young girls who pop out babies as they please ! <p> missgremlin - 2010-11-19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is NOT statutory rape , it is considered " consentual sex by minors " , still an offence , but not stat rape . <p> LGVS - 2010-11-19 20:22 <p> What is the punishment for statutory rape ? <p> scott - 2010-11-18 14:58 <p> ther you go . <p> djmilano.26 - 2010-11-18 15:02 <p> Just like i said , there was never rape ........ <p> Dr. Zeek - 2010-11-18 15:32 <p> it is still STATUTORY RAPE <p> Zoolie - 2010-11-18 16:08 <p> Dear Dr Zeek with a . please tell me you are not her boyfriend trying to stand up for her .

Obviously these kids have already been exposed to 1 ) filmed sex ; 2 ) drugs 3 ) sex - and the teachers subsequently found the footage funny ? <p> Tammy - 2010-11-18 15:10 <p> I am not convinced that this is the whole story .... perhaps she and her family have been bribed into changing their view on the situation . After all there is video evidence so why would she claim she was raped if in fact she was n't , and then submit footage ? <p> Elizabeth - 2010-11-18 15:35 <p> According to the other girls report who have seen the footage , there is a point where the girl is on top and seeming to enjoy the whole thing .... One mst really wonder what is the truth behind this story . <p> JudithNkwe - 2010-11-18 15:10 <p> This whole matter gets more complex by the day . Has she been threatened ? Why is the video not part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked out of control - either drugged or drunk <p> Afrobella - 2010-11-18 15:22 <p> Maybe the fact that she was also charged with Statutory rape scared her into chaging her story ... really strange . At the end of the day though all three of these kids ' parents need to ask themselves some hard questions . <p> Dr Filemon - 2010-11-18 15:39 <p> what about the perjury charge ? <p> Emile - 2010-11-18 16:22 <p> Not only statutory rape charges , where is the manufacturing and distribution of child pornography charges ? <p> Seja - 2010-11-18 17:08 <p> For those of you who say what about the video ? here is something to think about . On the video the chick was on top hence police have been saying there is no evidence to charge the boys with rape coz we all know when you are drugged you become weak , so how can she be on top doing the act if drugged ? Secondly it has been confirmed no traces of drugs were found in her system . Stop being reactionary and use your thick skulls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are given a drug like Rohypnol you do n't necessarily become weak . You do lose social inhibition particularly if the drug is given simultaneously with alcohol . Not sure what our thick skulls have to do with this ? <p> Chantelle - 2010-11-18 15:15 <p> I feel for her parents .... they must be so gutted that their young child has consented to something like this and then mislead them and the authorities into believeing it was rape . Disgusting <p> ruby ring - 2010-11-30 13:12 <p> @ Chantelle : have you considered that maybe she was exposed to sexual encounters since she was very young ? Maybe by a male family member ? She is not behaving like a 15yr old . I think there is more to it . <p> Collen - 2010-11-18 15:16 <p> First of all , other students were watching - that says a lot . Kids watch too much television nowadays , and often , itedify themselves with Western celebrities whose music videos are full of kak . " Democracy " <p> robertgunning - 2010-11-18 15:38 <p> Placing blame on " western influences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I agree that kids do watch far too much television but parents should be more responsible when it comes to their childrens viewing habits . I 'm not sure what point you are trying to make with the " Democracy " comment . Again , its always easier to blame someone else rather than those that were actually involved . <p> louwhan - 2010-11-19 02:07 <p> I agree . Seems like the fabric of society has become toilet paper . <p> Sluggo - 2010-11-20 05:25 <p> Well said , Collen ! ! ! <p> robertgunning - 2010-11-18 15:22 <p> What about the drugging claim ? Was this also fabricated ? Regardless of which , they all broke the law and should all be charged with statutory rape . <p> greengoblin - 2010-11-18 16:17 <p> if you read the story properly all three WERE charged with Statutory rape . <p> robertgunning - 2010-11-19 12:47 <p> I read the story properly , you had n't read my comment correctly . I was agreeing that they should have all been charged with statutory rape . I was not saying it had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> goyougoodthing - 2010-11-18 15:34 <p> Hold on , she is 15 and 2 of the boys are 14 - so surely she is also guilty of statutory rape ? <p> KyleAssassin - 2010-11-18 15:58 <p> What , ca n't you read , she was also charged - not hard to understand ? <p> greengoblin - 2010-11-18 16:18 <p> must be battling to read because 1 boy was 14 and one was 16 <p> Jacques Schoombie - 2010-11-18 15:37 <p> Now what ? <p> LibranDiva - 2010-11-18 15:39 <p> She must have discovered that it was filmed and then decided to cry rape , maybe maybe not but clearly only they know what really happened that day . <p> Henriette van Eeden - 2010-11-19 11:00 <p> I agree . Lots of fun until everyone has seen it ! If it was rape , she would n't have changed her story . I 'm not a conspiracy theorist - no one convinced her or bribed her to change her story . Probably simply a case of trying to get away from a rape charge by now admitting it was concensual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same effect . But yes - I agree that only they know what really happened and the sad thing about such young boys and girls engaging in these type of activities is that they do n't realise what consequences it might have .... which is why they can not consent according to the law . This whole thing is just so sad to me . <p> gmck21 - 2010-11-19 14:49 <p> same thing happened in durban . a girl was fimled dropping her drawers in the middle of over point city shopping centre a few years ago ...... du n no if she cried rape but i do know it stirred a big pot of trouble <p> VOTED ! - 2010-11-18 15:44 <p> I hope they charge her with defeating the ends of justice and crimin injura <p> Luscious - 2010-11-18 15:48 <p> look , one never knows the full story , she could of been bullied/bribed by the boys 's parents to change her mind . One never knows . Only the 3 involved will know for sure . But yes DeonL , Vroeg ryp , vroeg vrot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust women . They are born liars . My brother was a victim to a crime of this sort and I whitnessed a young girl willingly sleep with two guys at the age of 15 . What I can say is that these women have the ability to just cry and say that they are raped when they are caught . Or if they are not caught , they were just having fun and it 's a secret . Then some punk will have to pay lobola for this same person years later . I 'm sorry but these so-called African traditions are outdated . Tehse women are skelms I tell you . Big time skelms . <p> LK8 - 2010-11-18 19:16 <p> " Never trust women . They are born liars " Wow , sir , that is quite a bold statement to make . Generalisations like that have never gotten anyone anywhere . I agree that it is ridiculous that SOME women use ' rape ' as a false excuse , and it is highly offensive and insensitive to any women ( or men ) who have actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trait of every female out there . Do n't you dare lump me in with those sorts of women . <p> Makutu - 2010-11-18 20:12 <p> I would n't say it applies to every female man . The same way not all men are rapists . <p> walshcraig - 2010-11-19 12:41 <p> @ Makutu - That 's very narrow minded and fighting talk , rather juvenile there young man . <p> LK8 - 2010-11-20 19:22 <p> Well then do n't say things like " Never trust women . They are born liars . " It implies you believe that about ALL women . Either change your attitude , or your choice of words . <p> Honeybabe - 2010-11-18 15:51 <p> She is realy playing with fire ... crazy ppl are walking around her and she says its a consent activity , hmm ? i pray she does n't get raped in real life ! What then ? <p> Soapbox - 2010-11-18 15:52 <p> They should be charged for possession and distributions of child pornography as well . <p> Francois - 2010-11-18 15:56 <p> now let me tell you your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parent that thinks other wise . <p> Well said , Anthony ! The word ' education ' is a beautiful word . It comes from the Latin ' educare ' which means to raise up , to take from the lowest degrees to the highest spheres of knowledge . The object of education is to feed , expand and strengthen the intelligence . It is certainly not to feed young minds with perverted instruction , in the name of tolerance ? The example that our so-called leaders are giving to our youth , is an example of perversity , the effects of which no-one can estimate ! The reign of democracy is the reign of ignorance , corruption and the most barefaced immorality , under the mask of the most refined hypocrisy - far worse than the workings of any previous government this country and its peoples have had to endure . Democracy is the death of our schools ; it is the degradation of our youth under the clever guise of ' human rights ' . It is the reign of tyranny and the loss of liberty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job ' they are being deceived and are poisoning the springs of life in our children . Our children are being offered fables , lies , and husks , with which to appease their hunger . The books which are the most proper to instruct our youth , are marked : ' forbidden ' . They are the victims of an incredible system of moral and intellectual blindness - under the fallacious notion of having them ' educated ' ? All this ' human rights ' business is but an allurement to deceive honest , but too trusting youths . Our young people are being drowned in a sea of desolation . What kind of moral education can a young person receive from a constitution that believes they can live as they please ? Whether we are religious or not , we , each of us , are well aware of the difference between right and wrong . Life is a matter of choice - we have been given conscious minds and with these minds we know the difference between good and evil . Again I say , democracy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2010-11-18 16:02 <p> I believe this story ( that it was consensual ) Kids are starting earlier and earlier with their sexual exploits and experiments . Personally I blame the parents of these kids for improper moral and ethical upbringing . <p> alexander.lombard - 2010-11-18 16:03 <p> In UK that is the age when children start getting pregnant through consentual sex <p> Clare - 2010-11-18 16:03 <p> How much pressure do you think was put on her to make her change her story ? <p> Mr.Glum - 2010-11-18 17:38 <p> @Makutu . Are you speaking from experience or from your cultural point of view ? <p> Melvyn - 2010-11-19 10:17 <p> no pressure was put on her , she was part of the movie so do nt defend her.she was scared her parents will find out about this.she was never raped.what was she doing on top.rapists are always on top to put themselves in . <p> Clare - 2010-11-19 10:42 <p> And if she was drugged as was earlier reported ? <p> Chris - 2010-11-18 16:04 <p> In that case DR ZEEK ..... i 'm guessing that just about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged if i listen to the statistics my wife runs through , which by the way serves a government medical clinic in the Western Cape . <p> Bernd - 2010-11-18 16:05 <p> Its a cultural thing . <p> Makutu - 2010-11-18 16:23 <p> A 10 year old Spanish girl gave birth last week . A 15 year old British girl also gave birth last week . I guess it 's also a cultural thing . Please my man . Let 's not divide each other with such comments . The NP did a good job in dividing us . The ANC is trying to go in the same path , it 's up to you as an individual if you are going to allow that to happen to you also . <p> Jo - 2010-11-18 18:48 <p> I agree with you Makutu - foolishness occurs everywhere .

We all make mistakes in life , some bigger than others . I hope they will get the support and guidance from their parents , families , friends and communities to make right .

" I feel gatvol everytime I look at distorted facts and a whole lot of kak written by our media , especially M&amp;G and News24 . Next time , you useless media jokes , do your homework before giving us such junk stories without facts . I hope you all go to hell sooner than you think . You are even more useless that the ANC itself . You ca n't triangulate around issues . Looks like you just react by writing stories and no RESEARCH .

@@1728235 <h> National <h> Sex or rape ? Something is terribly wrong ! <p> Executive director of Gender Links attempts to explain the difference between sex and rape in South African society . <p> When the story about a Jules High School girl being allegedly raped on the school grounds hit the headlines , I had a flashback to my worst moment as a mother of two daughters , then aged seven and 10 . <p> One afternoon about 16 years ago my two princesses came rushing back from a Johannesburg school in a tizz because two men had been seen prowling around the girls ' ablution block . My girls , with whom I had not yet discussed sex , wanted to know the meaning of rape . I found myself unusually stumped for words . It still pains me that my moment to lead my daughters through the rites of passage should have been stolen from me in this cruel way . <p> On the eve of the Sixteen Days of Activism 2010 , the news is awash with the Jules High School incident , that some call " sex " , others " rape " , and others " alleged rape " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent also in the famous rape trial of President Jacob Zuma two years ago -- is a glaring reminder that something in our society is terribly wrong . <p> In the Jules High School case , we are told that boys drugged a 15-year-old girl , but in the same breath that she consented to sex . In the course of a fortnight , one newspaper ran these three contradictory headlines : " Girl in video was willing " ; then ( after an exclusive interview with the girl ) " I was not in control after taking drink " ; but a week later , " Girl admits to consensual sex . " <p> The girl laid a charge of rape , only to find herself charged with rape through some bizarre twist of the Sexual Offences Act that makes it a crime to have sex with a girl below the age of 16 , but makes her equally guilty if she consents . <p> Options She stands before a magistrate and says she did in fact consent . What would be the consequences if she did not say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jail ( for raping herself ? ) or to face an agonising trial in which the cards are stacked against her ? Even the president of the country got away with saying he did not force a young woman who regarded him as her father to have sex with him when she remains adamant that she said no ! <p> The president 's accuser now lives in exile . The young woman at Jules High School is the subject of a cellphone video being pawned on the Internet . If she is not in physical exile , her soul must be somewhere close to hell . Where the two boys involved ( whom the police did not want to charge so as not to disturb their exams ) will be macho heroes , her reputation will be one of a cheap , low down " slut " . <p> I am not condoning women who have sex and then cry rape . Nor am I condoning under age children having sex , under whatever pretext , on school grounds . What I am saying is that when the line between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these words interchangeably , something is seriously amiss . At the heart of this are the unequal power relations between boys and girls , men and women that result in us not even being able to distinguish what is and is not appropriate behaviour . <p> The internet does not help . Try googling the word " girls " on Google images . You might expect to see pictures of young women going to school , planning their careers , at sports or at play . Instead you will find young women in bikinis , painting their finger nails , or being available for boys ( like in the image adjacent ) . Images of " boys " on the other hand are cool , hunting in packs , playing sport , being successful , and ( proudly ) " bad " ! <p> Gender violence statistics Ahead of November 25 -- International Day of No Violence Against Women -- Gender Links and the Medical Research Council are releasing preliminary findings of a gender violence prevalence survey for Gauteng showing that 51,1% of women in the province have experienced some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit to having perpetrated some form of emotional , physical , sexual or economic abuse over their lifetimes . <p> One in four women in the province has experienced sexual violence in their lifetime . An even greater proportion of men ( 37,4% ) disclosed perpetrating sexual violence . What is chilling about the research is that in almost every case men corroborate what women say even more so than what the women claim . And , giving numbers to a well known fact , the research shows that overall only one in 25 rapes had been reported to the police . <p> Following the public outcry over the decision by the National Prosecution Authority to charge the two boys and girl involved in the Jules High School incident , the three are now likely to be sent on a " diversion " programme . It would be interesting to know what this will consist of . How not to drug a young woman ? Why not to have sex on school grounds ? Or how to treat each other with the respect that a Constitution anchored in equal rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant by mutual respect , perhaps we would be able to identify right away what is sex and what is rape just like we know right from wrong . The obvious battles for gender equality -- like getting a Sexual Offences Act passed -- have been won . What the Jules High School case suggests is that the battle to change attitudes and mindsets has just begun . <p> ( Colleen Lowe Morna is executive director of Gender Links .

It is contained in a bill for the 2011 budget , which includes an appendix listing the world 's top 20 universities as ranked by QS . <p> Birthe R ? nn Hornbech , the integration minister , wrote in the newspaper , Berlingske Tidende : " The qualification requirements are aimed at improving integration and making all immigrants ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where children , owing to their parents ' weak integration , get a bad start and difficulties in getting an education and later supporting themselves in Danish society .

" There will in the new policy be an opportunity for spouse reunion for those who have high qualifications , as for instance a degree from one of the top 20 universities on the international ranking lists .

" And I have great difficulty understanding how people who graduated at the Sorbonne or Heidelberg not included in the top-20 rankings shall not contribute positively to Danish society , " he said . <p> But Karsten Lauritzen , integration spokesman for the Liberal Party , defended the use of university rankings .

Instead you were a real smart guy and so you are alive and uninjured . The first thing I was taught when I studied selfdefence is that your possessions are not important as your life . My mother raised all of us that it is panic which kills . It has saved me so many times , from drowning , from physical attack even from divorce . We will never know what happened on the farm killing of that family and 3 year old - perhaps the murderers only wanted the money and he panicked because he was n't with his wife or vice versa and so these guys killed the one or the other . Fearing confrontation or arrest for murder they then killed the other two . I am not saying that this is what happened or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look down on others and advocate violence as a response to violence are the ones most likely to get your wives/children and self sadistically murdered . One 's first reaction should be to remain calm and clearheaded so that you can survive . Well done to Riaan and Michelle and hopefully you wo n't be too traumatised by this .
