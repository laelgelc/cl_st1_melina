Sinagnanam 's claim after meeting with the visiting French ambassador in Jaffna that France was supporting the proposed US resolution against Sri Lanka is probably an attempt to boost the flagging morale of the extremist Tamil lobby. ? They are apparently losing hope of imposing an external probe on Sri Lanka 's conduct during and after the armed conflict against the internationally designated terrorist movement known as the LTTE , their erstwhile heroes. ? France being a key member of the EU will not make any announcement of a French position without a firm decision of the regional grouping . <p> Sivagnanam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causing difficulties by occupying civilian owned lands is another red herring . He has failed to recognize the valiant efforts of the Army to de-mine the land of LTTE planted landmines and IEDs to make the area safe for IDP resettlement , and other services in building houses , schools , kovils , medical facilities and vast improvements to essential infrastructure . The army has since returned lands occupied during the time of the conflict except for lands in the vicinity of the Palaly base , where previously the LTTE infiltrated to shoot down aircraft on the downward descent to land at the airstrip. ? These lands which were taken over for security reasons over 20 years ago can not be returned for reasons stated . The owners of land have been provided with compensation and given alternate lands for their use . <p> The Minister of Health of NPC , Mr. Sathyalingam 's complaint about the dearth of doctors and Education Minister Gurukularajah 's lament about the shortage of Math and English teachers are not problems restricted to the northern province , but experienced in other regions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ province . The issue of malnutrition affecting the schooling of children is not just confined to the north , but seen in several places including Thantirimale , Kumbuk Oya in outlying areas of Matale district. ? We also have the major problem of Chronic Kidney Disease of multi- factorial causes afflicting about 2.5 million people in the NCP , South , Moneragala area , etc. , where an average of 13 males aged between 30 and 60 are dying each day . What is needed is not a confrontational TNA controlled NPC but a cooperative one that will join with the Centre to find workable solutions with the limited resources available to the nation . <p> Yours sincerely , <p> Mahinda Gunasekera <h> 2 Responses to " TNA claims French support for US Resolution against Sri Lanka " <p> This is a tenuous move by France to join in the cabal of nations to take the moral high ground to accuse Sri Lanka of human rights abuses .

Such veneration is reserved for the likes of Ven . Gangodawila Soma Thero who preached his own anti-dhamma of bigotry and venom . <p> Ven . Ratnajothi Thero took the antithetical path . He did not make a name and a living out of inciting fare and hate . Instead he spent his energies on creating an oasis of harmonious coexistence in an increasingly turbulent sea of ethno-religious fanaticism . Like his Master , he seemed to have preached non-violence and loving-kindness towards all . <p> According to an obituary by Dr. Rifai , " He has been an architect of Muslim and Singhalese friendship association in Hemmathagama . He has been working hard to bridge the gaps between Muslims and Singhalese people .... always calling people to live in peace and communal harmony .

Hemmanthegama Mosque Federation provided lunch to the mourners . <p> " Hemmathagama people have lost one of noble and venerable monks and a friend of Muslim people in our area , " <p> lamented Mr Azhar , principal of Kotegoda School and member of Buddhist-Muslim association in Hemmathagama . <p> When Gangodawila Soma Thero fell victim to the Russian Winter and the manic fringe screamed murder ( by **25;252;TOOLONG , the main enemy of that time ) , the political mainstream opted for opportunistic silence . When the JHU raised its ugly head , the mainstream parties , instead of taking a principled stand against its toxic-politics , sought to benefit from it . <p> Lankan political establishment never stood foursquare against the scourge of Sinhala-Buddhist fanaticism . <p> The Rajapaksas are not making tactical use of Sinhala-Buddhist fanaticism as all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are creating an axiomatic and structural nexus between their dynastic project and the most extremist and virulent strain of Sinhala-Buddhism . Not only have they appropriated Sinhala-Buddhism for their exclusive use ; they are also giving a distinct Rajapaksa flavour to it . <p> A suitable analogy is the mutually sustaining relationship between the Al-Sauds and arguably the most fanatical and primitive Islamic sub-sect - Wahabism . <p> The Al-Sauds of Sri Lanka <p> Buddhism is not a ' religion of the book ' . Sinhala-Buddhism is . Its ' holy book ' is the Mahawamsa . The Mahawamsa misshaped the teachings of the Buddha into a martial faith -- a potent governance-tool for Lanka 's kings . Anagarika Dharmapala transformed Mahawamsa-Buddhism into modern Sinhala-Buddhism , a politically and socially retrogressive creed which equates anti-imperialism and patriotism with abiding hatred of minorities and the rejection of Enlightenment values . <p> Rajapaksa-Buddhism marks a new low-point , in this abysmal trajectory . It seeks to create a new conflation , connecting the Buddha , Buddhism , Sinhalese and the Rajapaksas . The first exposition of this fusion-creed was made at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' . At the tightly choreographed gala , and in the presence of the President and other Rajapaksas , Jackson Anthony , actor turned Rajapaksa-ideologue , created a new genealogy for the Ruling Family .

I felt that this was very meaningful for two reasons .... If Prince Gemunu wants to send a letter to a modern head-of-state , the most suitable amongst our post-independence leaders is the current Commander-in-Chief . Secondly Prince Gemunu has a genealogical right to send a felicitation-message to a Rajapaksa ... requesting him to protect this freedom for the future ...

King Suddodana 's brother was Amithodana ; Amithodana 's child was Pandushakya ; Pandushakya 's daughter was Badrakachchayana ; she came to Lanka to marry King Panduwasdev . Her daughter Unmada Chitra 's son was Pandukabhaya ; his son was Mutasiva ; his son was Devanampiyatissa ; his brother was Mahanaga ; Mahanaga ran away to Ruhuna and built Magampattuwa ; his brother was Yatalatissa ; Yatalatissa 's brother was Gotabhaya ... King Gotabhaya 's son was Kawantissa ; his son was Gemunu . Gemunu takes this genealogical legacy to Giruwapattuwa ....

Mr. Anothony 's history is errant nonsense ; it even contradicts the Mahawamsa . But it should not be dismissed as drivel because this drivel is being sprouted by a leading ideologue of the Ruling Family . <p> The Mahawamsa 's three precepts are Consecrated Island , Chosen Race and Sinless War ; the Rajapaksa ideologues are seeking to add a fourth precept -- Rightful Dynasty . Until 1815 , the two necessary preconditions for Lankan kingship were royalty and Buddhism . That was how Nissankamalla , a scion of India 's Kalinga Dynasty , reigned in Pollonnaruwa and Nayakkara kings ruled the Kandyan Kingdom from 1739 ( including Kirthi Sri Rajasinghe who re-established Higher Ordination ) . <p> Historically a kinship with Family Suddodana was never a condition for Lankan kingship .

There is another Sri Lanka which is possible , as Ven . Ratnajothi Thero 's life and death demonstrate .

@@2422240 <p> Muttiah Muralitharan has also weighed in with praise , paying particular attention to the several months of consistent cricket Sri Lanka had played , in the approach to the WT20 . Since arriving in Bangladesh in late January , Sri Lanka won 15 of their 16 straight limited-overs matches in the country , with the only failure having come against England . <p> " We have been playing brilliantly for the last six months . In fact , we have n't lost for a long time , " Murali told Indian Express . " We beat India and Pakistan -- title contenders in these conditions -- while winning the Asia Cup , carrying our confidence into this tournament . " <p> Murali was also optimistic about Sri Lanka 's future prospects , particularly at global events . " It 's still far away and difficult to predict so early , but I expect Sri Lanka to be a serious force to reckon with despite the World Cup being played in different conditions . Of course , Australia and New Zealand will have the advantage because they 're used to the conditions . " <p> " We had Arjuna Ranatunga and Aravinda de Silva . Then came Sanath Jayasuriya , Romesh Kaluwitharana and Marvan Atapattu . Mahela and Sanga arrived close on their heels . Now it 's time for youngsters to take over . There are many good players and I expect Lahiru Thirimanne and Angelo Mathews to step into their shoes in this format . " <p> Sri Lanka 's first Word Cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga has lauded the team 's World T20 win as a " special team effort " , which bodes well for the future of the team . Sri Lanka 's most successful batsman , Mahela Jayawardene , was not among the top-ten tournament run-scorers , while their most penetrative bowler , Nuwan Kulasekara , finished ninth on the wicket-takers ' list . <p> Ranatunga told Inside Sports that the individuals ' form through the Asia Cup , and Sri Lanka 's experience in Bangladesh conditions had also been significant . " If you look at the tournament , a lot of contributions were made by new players - young players . We should talk about Mahela , and Kumar Sangakkara , as well as Lasith Malinga , who bowled very well , but I feel that every player made a special contribution - not just a minor one . <p> " Normally there are heroes in these tournaments , but what I saw was that young players and seniors were all contributing together . That 's a great sign for the future of Sri Lanka cricket , when these young players are performing at that level . " <p> Those thoughts echo the subtext of tournament XIs released by the ICC and ESPNcricinfo , which feature only Lasith Malinga from the Sri Lanka team . Ranatunga said the campaign had also had four unsung players who made vital contributions . <p> " There are players who had n't shone out , like Kulasekara , Sachithra Senanayake , Kusal Perera and Rangana Herath . Sachithra bowled well throughout the tournament and Kulasekara delivered in difficult moments . <p> " Rangana had n't played throughout the tournament , but from the moment he came , he was taking wickets and keeping the runs down . Kusal took the pressure off Sangakkara , Dilshan and Mahela , and put it on his own shoulders . He played the same role as Sanath Jayasuriya used to play . Sometimes it seemed like he played bad shots , but that 's his style . <p> " The other thing you have to say is that our fielding was extremely good - better than the other teams . " <p> Ranatunga also lavished praise on Dinesh Chandimal 's decision to opt out of the semi-final and final . Chandimal had been in mediocre form in T20 cricket in the past year , and after the team had defeated New Zealand in a match from which he had been banned , Chandimal gave up the captaincy to Lasith Malinga . <p> " Even though he was not in good form , Sri Lanka has done well , and protected their No. 1 ranking , while he was captain , " Ranatunga said . " No one has the right to leave out a captain , and if Chandimal was able to sacrifice his place to protect a winning combination , I think he deserves a lot of praise in this win . It 's a great example to other cricketers . " <p> Ranatunga also said that Jayawardene and Sangakkara had timed their T20 international retirements well . " The cricketers are the ones who know better than anyone , when the right time is to go . In the past we 've seen that T20 is a young man 's game . I 'm sure they 've made the correct decision . " <p> Surprised and sad to see Arjuna not saying anything about Mathews . I respected Arjuna but I have doubts now . Earlier he was pushing Kandamby for captaincy and then he is praising Chandimal .

One united team that ! <p> Sinhaya on April 11 , 2014 , 16:44 GMT <p> @NPNY , fact is that we have too many great youngsters and we have selection headaches . Kusal Perera will pummel the Indian school boy bowling attack into pieces even more brutally than how Sanath Jayasuriya did it . The famous Mumbai massacre in 1997 showed how pathetic is the world 's best bowling attack which comes from nowhere other than India haha . Sanath Jayasuriya mauled the world 's most penetrative bowling attack when he scored 152 not out in Mumbai in 1997 . Indians cant even bat on expressways which is why they got all out for 54 in Sharjah when Sanath Jayasuriya freely scored 189 hahaha . <p> Ishfaq333 on April 11 , 2014 , 15:53 GMT <p> @NPNY : You know I would kill to see an Ind - SL Test series before Sanga and Mahela retire ( We can name the series " Bowler 's Nightmare " ) . And I do n't think any team played " REAL " - which I 'm taking to mean consistent - cricket in this tournament . And about Chandimal , I do n't think he was ever at home in this side . Premature decision to give him the reins . <p> on April 11 , 2014 , 15:19 GMT <p> It is hilarious to see when the sl fans over rating their players . even the u 19 sl team or so called future sl stars went down to a takented afg u 19 team . if it is so then wat wil hapn if they cross with the mighty indian team .. <p> sidanthan on April 11 , 2014 , 14:39 GMT <p> @ Charos ! ! Fully agree with you . We as Sri lankans are proud of our team &amp; well disciplined to bear both wins and looses <p> Charos on April 11 , 2014 , 13:48 GMT <p> Dear SL fans . I watched a video that shows fans set fire on something that labeled ' Sri Lanka ' after the t20 final . Some pelted stones on to roof of a residence of a player who was once their hero . Are you guys crazy to argue with them ? <p> on April 11 , 2014 , 13:43 GMT <p> @NPNY , Sri Lanka never depend on few players like India heavily depend on Koli .... India now has started it 's down trend . ODI world champion could n't reach Final atleast in ASIAN CUP .. and could n't win T20 world cup .. <p> Sinhaya on April 11 , 2014 , 13:27 GMT <p> @NPNY , India has a very bleak future . It is you who need a reality check . We have Kusal Perera who has nearly 10 man of the match awards , Thisara Perera , Kaushal Silva , Sachithra Senanayake , Kithruwan Vithanage , Ashan Priyanjan , Shaminda Eranga ( only bowler in history to take a wicket in all 3 formats in his first over ) , Lakmal , Nuwan Pradeep , Lahiru Thirimanne and of course Angelo Mathews who are all light years better than any so called Indian youngsters who are overrated as usual . <p> NPNY on April 11 , 2014 , 12:57 GMT <p> All SL has got going for them is the T20 lottery , which is far from REAL cricket . They are NEVER going to get ahead of India in the Test and ODI rankings . When Sanga and Mahela are gone , the Indian under 19 team will be able to beat SL in all formats . SL is going down ! <p> Indians-love-flattracks on April 11 , 2014 , 12:05 GMT <p> SL going to dominate cricket for the foreseeable future . <p> tearisle on April 11 , 2014 , 9:47 GMT <p> and let me continue , , , as sri lankans lets not underrate the achievements of our grand old neighbours india . Mahela jayawarene is no doubt a class act but he has just 16 centuries from 412 odi 's and an average of just 33.17 highest score 144 and he has been playing for 17 years . but just look at virat kohli he has 19 centuries already from just 134 matches averaging 52.16 highest score 183 now is that phenomenal or what . Sri lanka are good no doubt we are a well rounded side and are serious contenders for next years title . we will have the fire power by then lakmal , malinga , kula , angelo and thssara and spinners herath , tharindu kaushal ( by the way for your information he is the best spinner in sri lanka at the moment and he can bat as well ) and senanayake. chandimal can play best on fast tracks he has a century at lords while sachin hasn't. thiri has a good score in sydney . we will have the best well- balanced combination by then . I predict a dejavu an encore another final . <p> tearisle on April 11 , 2014 , 9:24 GMT <p> Well as a sri lankan I would like to advise our guys on this forum to restrict themselves when they criticize india and do n't try to compare our achievements to those that india has achieved.India has been playing test cricket for 82 years and most of their cricketers were playing for the england team long before that the likes of the great ranjit singhji and duleep singhji . They have produced cricketing greats such as the three v 's vijay merchant , vijay hazare , vijay manjerekar and then sunil gavaskar , kapil dev , gundappa vishvanath , erapalli prasanna .... just to name a few . <p> cric1965 on April 11 , 2014 , 8:37 GMT <p> Full credit to Dinesh Chandimal for his sacrifice . Country rather than person or IPL . If you are not in good nick do not hang on the team . This is a good lesson to out of form seniors . Once chandimal bat in top order he will polish his batting skills . You have a bright future , chandi . Best of luck for you . <p> @ karthikrby : Both Chandimal &amp; Thirimanna love pace than spin &amp; they proved it in Aus/Eng.Up to now they were not given proper position to settle down , because most of SL senior batters want to bat high up in the order. ( like how Kohli/Rohit/Raina/Pujara batted in the order when **27;575;TOOLONG aroud ) . Do n't worry we got lots of budding talent ( in all 3 departments ) in our development squads under Kaluwitharana &amp; co.But you need to find consistant match winning bowlers to move forward from the current situation. ( if you 're dreaming of 2015 WC ) <p> on April 11 , 2014 , 3:34 GMT <p> @Perera Withanage ! ! Hitting classically or slowly not going to make any impact to the game , It is very unfortunate current Sri Lanken match winner in ODI is not highlighted anywhere , When you compare statistics of Dilshan to Mahela can get a better idea , Mahela 's batting average is 33.17 but Dilshan 's average is 37.67 . There is a huge gap . Mahela has 16 centuries from 412 matches while Dilshan has 17 from just 277 matches .. see the difference .. and in ODI mahela has won 17 player of the match awrads from 412 matches , dilshan has won same amount just from 277 matches .. so who is the real Legend ? ? ? ? Mahela just OVERATED .... Dilshan is highly IMPACT player .. <p> on April 11 , 2014 , 0:35 GMT <p> @ romesh ! ! What are u genius or something to try breaking while worlds point of view and say they are n't best ? ? ? ? Shh .... Just be silent and learn well bout what worlds says bout em ! Hitting hard on ball not gon na make u the best batsmen in the world ! So think twice before post such a comments . <p> Sinhabahu on April 11 , 2014 , 0:25 GMT <p> @ITJOBSUCKS , Thirimanne actually played pretty well in Aus , the standout being a 90-odd at the SCG which I was there to witness . It 's funny that you say that Rohith won the 2008 VB Series for you , is that why he 's been kept in the team despite 8 years of failures after that ? You actually only won the VB finals thanks to your opening fast bowler ( I ca n't remember his name ) who got Gilchrist and the rest of the Aus top order out cheaply . Now I know that you ca n't wait till our greats retire but I can assure you that we 've always produced match-winners from our population of 20 million , unlike India which has no fast bowlers and only Kohli and Dhoni as genuine matchwinners from a population of 1.2 billion haha . <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 18:40 GMT <p> Aravinda , Arjuna , Murali and Sanath are true legends of sl cricket history.Sanga and Mahela just overated . <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 18:27 GMT <p> Sanga and Mahela are highly overated batsman . Mahela is totaly inconsistant batsmsn with bating average around 32 in odi.Actualy in odi Dilshan has done something better than Mahela for Sri Lsnka.Mahela has still scored only 15 odi centuries while dilshan has 17 from minimum matches and also during last odi world cup and 2009 t20 Dilshan has scored most runs for sri lanka and was among best 3 in the world <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 18:05 GMT <p> Sri Lanka is a brilliant cricketing side ... Full of young talent and backed by matured and experienced guys like Sanga and Mahela ... That 's the combination any side would want to have ... I am sure by 2015 World Cup the young talent would bru them selves to take over from the seniors ... Sri Lanka cricket has a bright future with Angelo , Thirimane , and i am sure we will see chandimal getting back to form ... <p> LeoE on April 10 , 2014 , 17:36 GMT <p> The Indian cricket structure is so impressive that each player has been selected from a group of 100 million people . Compare that to Sri Lanka where each player comes from a paltry 2 million population . So to a simple mind , the quality of the Indian team should be so extraordinarily supreme , absolutely invincible , that we need not argue about how good Sri Lanka was in the finals . We should not be losing to even a World Eleven . But we are losing to everyone . We lost even to New Zealand - total population is 4 million . Why ? Because we are simply not churning out talent as we should be . If not for the IPL we would have been in dire straits . We are strong on paper . But horrible on the field . Lets face it . Kohli , Yuvi and MSD scored 19 runs in the last 24 balls against SL in World T 20 final . Can you believe it ? No , it surely could not be true . No , its just a bad dream ! ! So all this talk about how great a side India has , and how SL wins in Asia only etc is meaningless . <p> NPNY on April 10 , 2014 , 17:07 GMT <p> Youngsters ? LOL , which youngster performed well for SL ? After Sanga , Mahela , and Malinga , SL has no match winners . Ranatunga needs a reality check . <p> karthikrby on April 10 , 2014 , 16:50 GMT <p> Thirimanne/chandimal proved in Aus ? ? Really ? ? Candimal played under the shadows of mahela/sanga , thirimanne 's performance was patheic in VB series . <p> Can you tell me one match winning innings by chandimal or thirimanne in Aus just like Virat played at hobart ? Or what ashwin did to you in champs trophy ? SL you are a real good side as of now . My point is , you refuse to accept the fact that sanga/mahela are still the main pillars in your batting unit . You always won matches when either one of them performed . Can you tell me one important match you won with out a 50+ score from either batsmen ? <p> Even in 2011 WC mahela held the innings together and did the job . Imagine a fragile 3 and 4 in form of chandimal and some one else . If SL reduced to 50 for 5 , I am sure angelo will also loose his wicket and you may end up at 100 all out . Right now , I accept the fact that SL is a better side with two greats . But this wo n't last long . <p> At the end of such greats carrier afterall they won a t20 cup . <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 16:08 GMT <p> srilanka should send seafull of thanks to yuvrajsingh and dhoni who helped SL to win easily <p> CricFanatic1996 on April 10 , 2014 , 15:32 GMT <p> Well said Nandan Nadkarni . We all should all get together and support cricketing nations . Congratz SL . <p> Urajapakse on April 10 , 2014 , 14:24 GMT <p> This great man , The best ever captain/cricketer SL has ever produced is the ' one &amp; only person ' who openly praised Dinesh Chandimal- Our official T 20 captain for sacrificing his place on behalf of the country/team . <p> Dinesh , you did the right thing &amp; civilize people who understands the game like Arjuna will always respect you for that . Lasith Malinga did n't have the ' common sense ' at least to call you &amp; accept the cup jointly but JUMPED ON THAT . <p> Had he done so , he could have commanded a better respect ' as a standing captain ' but unfortunately , did n't have the ' morals ' to do so . <p> We all saw what our 1996 world cup winning captain did Immediately after receiving the ' cup ' from former Pakistan Prime minister late Ms. Benazir Butto . <p> He tok no time to thank former Pakistan &amp; Indian skippers in Wasim &amp; Azaar . So that is the GRATITUDE LASITH . Learn at least now . Do not brag too much as If you have win the cup om your own . Learn that from Arjuna . <p> rkks on April 10 , 2014 , 14:23 GMT <p> @Mr.CricketslLion : What an analysis . You can be a cricket coach to any international team . If you are running out of ideas to bash India , then please keep quite . Just do n't comment for the sake of commenting . You think Virat scored all the runs in all the matches . Against SA virat scored 77 , who scored the remaining runs then . In final SL just depended on Sanga and Malinga to win right . It 's not a team effort in final . <p> Mr.CricketslLion on April 10 , 2014 , 13:21 GMT <p> Well Said Ranatunga . India almost depended on Virat in every match during world t20 . But Srilanka team never depended on a single player . Everyone contributed in every single match , that is the team spirit . lets learn it from LIONS . we are still roaring . <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 12:45 GMT <p> Thanx to indian team for making 130 runs 64/10.3 and 57 balls remaining 8 wikets remaining 67 runs scored well played SL <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 12:20 GMT <p> @Ashwin Balaji , it would be very interesting to see how india will recover their recent Major losses at ASIAN CUP and T20 world cup final . <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 11:41 GMT <p> It would be interesting see how SL plays in the WC 2015 . <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 11:19 GMT <p> SL Fans congrats ... Indian brothers lets accept SL team played well on that day and deserved to win . Lets keep to that , there is no need for any bashing its only a game yaar . As Indian Fan I would like to see players like Pujara , Aaron and Umesh Yadav get a chance before the WC2015 , also Amit Mishra is a find and sincerly hope ( but knowing Dhoni it seems implausible ) that Dhoni plays him ahead of Ashwin . <p> sidanthan on April 10 , 2014 , 10:52 GMT <p> Posted by karthikrby : " In slow low pitches you guys are always successful than many other teams . Its not going to be the case with WC 2015 " . Why they are succesful in slow low pitches ? ? If so , wonder why indian batters could n't handle death overs effectively as those conditions are almost similer to the home.Gent'men cricket is a team game , not an individual 's / one department ' ( batting ) game.You need team spirit , proper strategy &amp; all 3 departments to click to win a match.That was lacking in team India in the final . It 's too early to talk about 2015 WC . <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 10:26 GMT <p> Well said Arjuna its the Team work . <p> BounceTrackBULLY on April 10 , 2014 , 10:13 GMT <p> @FlatTRACKBULLY eventhough SL won bothe their world cup in subcontinent , we had to agree that they are the NO1 team in T20 format as per ICC rankings . <p> akil-2011 on April 10 , 2014 , 9:50 GMT <p> In fact it is good Malinga dropped Virat Kholi on 11. otherwise Raina or Dhoni could have whacked . But one thing should say that Indians were too over confident about the final . We Sri Lankan had our well game plan and executed rite on time . Also its pretty bad to see that people are really tarnishing Yuvi 's image . Guys do not forget the service he provided during the other world cups which won by Indians.There is ups and downs always in everyone life . no one can succeed everyday . And also one team has to be loose so other can win . We Sri Lankan had more bad feelings than Indians when we failed 4 times in the finals at a raw but we never criticized our players still wot we done is we encouraged them . So this is the result we gained at last . No doubt India they got really tallented cricketers we can not under estimate them ever . But who play 's well on that particular day for sure they win 's . Sri Lankan they deserve that <p> Unbiased-views on April 10 , 2014 , 8:28 GMT <p> @ roshrosh I know truth is bitter , but i ca n't help bud ... Before replying to my post , just check your countrymen have posted some rubbish without checking facts .... SL has n't achieved anything like what India has ... When Sl beat ENG in ENG by 5-0 , everybody knew that England were re-building their ODI side &amp; really they were struggling .... If i ai n't wrong , KP &amp; flintoff were not part of that ODI side ! ! ! <p> @ tcarlos Do n't post " anything " with out checking facts ! ! ! <p> ksquared on April 10 , 2014 , 8:14 GMT <p> @karthikrby Stop talking about SL cricket because u know absolutely nothing about it . The structures are completely different there are many talented batsmen in SL cricket but they have n't been given the opportunity to perform in the big stage yet . Many SL batsmen have taken time to perform at the international level due to the gap between domestic and international game was the same with Sanga , Sanath , Marvan and many others . BTW the fast bowling talent is much more impressive . On what basis can you say that players that have n't even played international cricket yet are better than Thirimanne/Chandimal ? They played in AUS , SA and ENG and performed well . Your so called attacking batsmen failed miserably in SA and NZ recently so really there is nothing to crow about is there ? ? ? <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 8:13 GMT <p> When consider Mahela and Sanga 's real performance in recent T20 world cup , feel like these Two are struggling very much when batting . Before the final match , Sanga had scored only 19 runs from FIVE matches at the average of 4.75 . Even in Final Though Sanga could make 50 , at the beggining he gave a catch and looked very much struggling . His straight drives ended with fours but over the Keaper 's head.After the victory he looked very much over joyed because from FINAl chance at last he could earn some respect.I think for next ODI Sanga and Mahela should include only on rotating basis to the side . We could see young Chandimal sacrifise his captaincy considering team benefit , so why can not Sanga and mahela ? ? ? <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 8:08 GMT <p> Yes the good thing about this win was that almost everybody contributed at some stage in this tournament . You cant name 1 hero . it was a team effort and that makes it special . youngsters played well . seniors played crucial part in it . <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 7:57 GMT <p> sl has finally won a worldcup final and i am very happy for them as a neutral cricket fan they should cherish it and others should be happy for them . Hard luck for indian fans but they cant win everything and atleast they shouldnt be jealous of sl team and bash them on various sites and media . <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 7:50 GMT <p> pratiksh88 , Cricket is game of both batsman and bowler . India has lots of good batsmen but not good bowler what SL has . <p> karthikrby on April 10 , 2014 , 7:44 GMT <p> Regd , indian team , they are in rebuilding , they did it almost 80% . Yet few tweakings needed . But still , they will be the best side post WC 2015 . I am not seeing them winning WC 2015 due to lack of highly experienced persons like mahela/sanga . Where as SL will be the worst ever SL side post WC 2015 as I am not seeing any young player can take the opposition attack like shikar , rohit , kohli , jadeja , shami , ashwin does . Also we have few exciting youngsters like Sanju Samson , Gurkeerat singh waiting with fire power who are far better than thirimanne/chandimal . Angelo mathews will be the only fire power with SL and he will be tested when SL are with out sanga/mahela . <p> Blackrider , You were in final against Aus , because of Aus mastermind of not letting india in to final . They defeated themselves to let SL into final . You were beaten very badly in the finals . Ca n't you remember ? ? ? <p> SL fans , you are bringing the stats of SL winning outside . When you compare the AUS/SA team played against you and india , you can see against india , they play with full squad fearing about defeat . Whereas SL played with squads with rested big match players and hence they were let off to win here and there . <p> Accepts the fact that apart Asia cup and T20 SL were beaten very very badly by india . What about champions trophy semi final . In Aus vb series , we won 2-1 against SL . We will again get time to thrash you guys . <p> To people who do not accept yuvi factor and glorify their death bowlers , can you explain what happened to your death bowling against england ? In slow low pitches you guys are always successful than many other teams . Its not going to be the case with WC 2015 . <p> tcarlos on April 10 , 2014 , 7:26 GMT <p> @ITJOBSUCKS ur comments are the jokes of the year .. thirmanne got hiss maiden century in australia . we have beaten u many more times out of subcontinent. do nt talk too much . u are beaten all ends up last week in mirpur.sorry folk .. <p> ground-boy on April 10 , 2014 , 7:20 GMT <p> forgot to say , Sri Lanka has a very good neutral select committee . <p> cric1965 on April 10 , 2014 , 7:19 GMT <p> Next year , Dilshan would be 38 years plus . Normally reflexes are diminished with age.His form is reducing now . Will his form back again . Hardly believe . We can see his form in up coming England tour if he plays . Last t20 world cup also he struggled . His strike rate reduced to near 100 . As a opener in t20 , you need higher strike rate . With his current form , he is not suitable to play for next year world cup . His place should give to Thirimanna . You can not win world cup with old horses <p> roshrosh on April 10 , 2014 , 7:11 GMT <p> @ ITJOBSUCKS - Stop watching Neo Cricket channel where they keep repeating the games which India has won ... Your comment shows you have no clue about what Sri Lanka cricket team has achieved .. May be we have not won the world cups more often , but we have been there in almost every final payed since 1999 ... Also we beat England in England 5-0 , Beat Australia in Australia 2-1 ; Won a Asia Cup beating India and Pakistan .... Your victories are for your to cherish ... not to thrash others success ... Calm down bro ... Anyways the tides are slowly turning ... In the last couple of months SL has beaten India a few times already ... Enjoy ... <p> Anushika on April 10 , 2014 , 7:06 GMT <p> Bit sad that Ranatunga did n't mentioned anything about MATHEWS . If anyone give their efforts to check this they will definitely find that Ranatunga have n't praised MATHEWS ever . But still its high time he leave those behind . Ranatunga being a great captain of Sri Lanka should be fair to everyone . In this tournamant MATHEWS also gave his fullest with both Ball &amp; Bat . So he deserves a little credit too . <p> pratiksh88 on April 10 , 2014 , 6:59 GMT <p> Even Srilanka won 1996 world cup in friendly conditions ( Lahore ) .... its a fact that subcontinent team is not perform very well when they play outside subcontinent so its not about India not about Pakistan n even not about Srilanka so do nt discuss on dis topic is better option ..... <p> ground-boy on April 10 , 2014 , 6:57 GMT <p> Focus on next year 50/50 WC . Both Mahela and Sanga must be there in the squad . Select best of the bests considering good performance by then . Selection panel have the right to drop anybody out of form , no matter who he is or which school or club he represents . I do n't think once nominated as captain has executive powers or any special right to force for his inclusion when he is seriously out of form . Voluntary exit is good for the gentlemens game . It is appreciated . Pannel must select the best 11 . Sometimes may be a big gamble . There 's enough time for experiments . Current Bona fide members who fit also for ODIs are : Mathews , Malinga , Nuwan and Kusal . <p> Unbiased-views on April 10 , 2014 , 6:38 GMT <p> @Sarathi Ratnayake At the end of the day , it 's about winning Tournaments not just winning league matches ! ! ! Since 2000 , Ind has Natwest Trophy in ENG , VB series in AUS , WT20 in SA , Champions Trophy in ENG ! ! ! SL has n't won anything outside " subcontinent " ! ! ! <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 6:36 GMT <p> So if sri lanka 's world cup win carries less value since it was played in " friendly conditions " .. then i guess india 's 2011 world cup win at hme caries no value ... <p> Unbiased-views on April 10 , 2014 , 6:32 GMT <p> @Sarathi Ratnayake , BlackRider Karth Get your facts right ! ! ! I remember chandimal scoring few runs in AUS in 2012 , but other than that i do n't remember any SL youngster making an impact in AUS ! ! ! Thirammane failed miserably in AUS ! ! ! Rohit Sharma helped Ind to win VB series in AUS in 2008 esp in Final .... Surely , he ai n't flat track bully ... Gautam &amp; Dhoni have scored quite a lot of runs in AUS in 2008 &amp; 20012 during VB series ! ! ! ! AFAIK , Dhawan &amp; Rahane are yet to play in AUS ! ! ! So , do n't post anything without checking facts ! ! ! <p> pratiksh88 on April 10 , 2014 , 6:31 GMT <p> Bro " Blackrider " : - i respect your feelings and Srilanka is new t20 champion so its ur time to speak .. But if ur talking about state ( Source- espncricinfo , statguru ) so just check this again with filter from 2009 , 50% of matches in that state India had lost after 2009 , when India is building their team again n our ( Sachin , Ganguly , Dravid , Laxman , Sehwag ) all r about to leave cricket , Now its Srilank 's turn to rebuild after mahela n sanga .. ll see in future ur states . bcz ur youngster ( Thiri , K.parera , angi , t.parera ) is not even comparable with our only one man army KOHLI . Last but not d least ur young captain Chandi .. v hv all seen his performance and if d captain is giving up from his side ( Semi n final ) , v ll understand how much confident and talented he is .. Now mark my words SL Cricket will move forward i doubt ...... But indian cricket surely .. with young aggression of Kohli , Jadeja , Rohit , Rahane , ( Unsung C.Pujara , S.Samsang , U.chand ) . Everyone in dis list take Indian cricket move forward . <p> @karthikrby : : It is funny that you only remember Kholi 's innings at hobart from VB series . Guess who was in that final with Australia . It is SL mate . Chandi , Thiri , Angi all the youngsters performed really well not only in Aus but also in SA too . You guys only have a one quality player . He is Virat . All others are flat track bullies . <p> People said we will totter when Ara and Arjuna leave . They left but SL Cricket moved forward . People said we will totter when Sanath , Murali and Vass leave . They left but SL Cricket moved forward . Now people say we will totter when Mahela and Sanga leave . But mark my words SL Cricket will move forward ...... <p> KEEP CALM AND BELIEVE IN LIONS ...... <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 5:33 GMT <p> @karthikrby- Many people , mostly Indians criticize SL cricket by saying SL is only capable of winning matches in friendlier conditions in subcontinent . Here is a comparison of matches played by SRI LANKA and INDIA in AUS , ENG , NZ and SA against AUS , ENG , NZ and SA after 2000 to the present . ( Source- espncricinfo , statguru ) . <p> This shows that SL is way ahead of IND in Australia , Eng , NZ and SA in pace and bounce conditions . True , there are a lot to achieve by Lankans . Some of them are test wins in Aus , IND . For that SL needs more matches in those conditions . 2 or 3 tests for each 5 yrs will not suit . SL needs test matches in overseas just like IND.U will see the difference then . <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 5:32 GMT <p> Disagree to karthikrby 's comments . India not lost the final due to conditions or Yuvi Factor . Lankan bowlers ket the Indians tight . If Kholi was n't there India should have bowled out in less than 70 . You say that lankans not won any tournament away . Ca n't you remember few days before T20 started lankans brushed off the Indians and won the Asia cup . Accept the defeat . Stop throwing stones when a player fails . Tomorrow Yuvi will make a century and Indians will praise him . When youvi or any good batsman fails on the next match yuo throw stones . Hard luck mate . Lear to accept same as the Lankans . " WE LANKANS , ANYTIME-ANYWHERE WIN OR LOOSE , WE BOOZE " in real PARTY STYLE . We do n't leave the feild when we are almost loosing. we stay back until the last ball . <p> karthikrby on April 10 , 2014 , 4:56 GMT <p> Congrats to SL ! But in a t20 any team can beat any one on a given day . Srilankan death bowling vulnerable against england , but it was superb against india which I believe was due to conditions and yuvi factor . Last T20 was won by WI , but they come no where close in winning champions trophy or away test matches . <p> Even , ever choking england have won a T20 once . SL team yet to prove their mettle . They were playing in subcontinent conditions more in recent times which was a huge advantage . Where as other teams like india were playing in SA/AUS conditions . SL youngsters yet to be tested in Aus conditions and their bowling attack may look pathetic in such conditions . Remember kohli innings at hobart . <p> Its not the time for SL to think they achieved greatest height . They have n't won any tournament in away conditions still . Its just a milestone that they have crossed . Also after 2015 WC , sanga/mahela may retire which will leave SL tottering . <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 4:44 GMT <p> yeah ... our next Aravinda is Anjalo .. next mahela is Dinesh chandi .. and .. hope Thiri will get Sangas place .. well done guys .. we need some young big hitting players like thissara to our limited over side .. <p> anver777 on April 10 , 2014 , 3:55 GMT <p> Good comments from Arjuna ........ who changed the entire SL cricket after winning WC 96 ! ! ! ! SL proved the world that , they deserved No#1 spot in World T20 ! ! ! ! <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 3:45 GMT <p> Only way we can see chandimal full flow scoring when sang a and mahela retired from one day international . I am sure those days will be chandimal best days he likes to bat early in the innings since the those place been occupied by the senior .. He proved in Australia . I remember sanjay manjerekar while doing commentary he mentioned this is one more run machine from Asia he was mention about chandimal because of his consistency . God and only he knows what happened to him after that . It 's more like mental advice is better than technical . everyone knows thirimanne and chandimal both have the technic to play international . only temperament was lacking . Some how thirimanne understood what he need to do and now he scoring run at good rate .. I guess sanath have big part to play .. He need to talk to chandimal to be positive on his batting and score runs quickly . <p> MelbourneMiracle on April 10 , 2014 , 3:04 GMT <p> Totally agree with Arjuna however I think he forgot to mention the name that contributed the most in the WC . Angelo Mathews ! He was Sri Lanka 's Man of The Series ! <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 2:41 GMT <p> " No one has the right to leave out a captain , and if Chandimal was able to sacrifice his place to protect a winning combination , I think he deserves a lot of praise in this win . It 's a great example to other cricketers . " chandi is in a role that charisma guy is having to sacrifice for teams win has enlighten n washed off 18 years final winning drought . in the team from the beginning we saw the collective effort from Asia cup they played like HEROs . right player was at right time . only difficult time would be omission of mendis who was first ranked bowler for so long.we have lahiru , ashan , even upul tharanga in full form . let them lake out these key roles in next arena n fully confident chandi is proven more than enough he is the right captain . let him com into form n until that lasith be the captain for T20s. for sure 6 month is more than enough guy to break his shackles . <p> on April 10 , 2014 , 2:24 GMT <p> Hats off to our hero who lead SL through to its d ? but ICC world title in 1996 . He was a master strategist , and a very logical person who thinks on his feet . Really thankful for the article which is very insightful and gave Sri Lankan fans hope with the new blood in our team contributing than depending on old individual pillars . And we salute our two heroes going down , after there tenure of unforgettable service to the country , setting an example let space to the new guys to come and take on the responsibilities rather than holding a position forever and just dump it when you ca n't . And should n't we appreciate our young captain Chandimal for his selfless scarification to step down from captaincy . All these proves a subtle fact , that our players are professional , honest , bold but soft with great human qualities . Believe our neighbour fans should look at the reception SL team had from fans when they came back with runners up trophy 4 times in a raw . You make us all proud as a nation . <p> **28;604;TOOLONG on April 10 , 2014 , 0:35 GMT <p> Common boys ! Its not over .

Heartening but no surprise to see the team from all over the country taking on the world . Bring on the future ! <p> on April 9 , 2014 , 18:25 GMT <p> @ Romesh Perera , please look at 96 stats without misquoting them . 96 was not only about Jayasuriya , Aravinda &amp; Arjuna . Asanka Gurusinghe , Roshan Mahanama &amp; Hashan also played very important roles as did Murali , Vaas &amp; Kumar Dharmasena . If not for the role played by Gurusinghe , we would not have qualified past the first round . In the 3 games we played He scored 87 , 25 &amp; 84 while it was Hashan 's 70 against India which took us over the line . In the QF , Gura was 2nd highest scorer with 45 and also contributed with 65 in the final to Aravinda 's century . In all the matches the trio of Vaas , Murali &amp; KD were instrumental in our wins with top quality bowling performances . So in 96 too it was a total team performance though only few get credit due to peoples short term memories . And Sanga &amp; Mahela may not have contributed with bat but it was these 2 who were the tacticians behind our last 3 victories with their leadership of the youngsters . So you are wrong , we are gon na miss them big time . <p> SriLankanYoungBlood on April 9 , 2014 , 17:59 GMT <p> Even thought not directly relavent to this i congrats SL team to their amazing Victory in T20 final . I saw best T20 death bowling in that match plus Sanga 's superb innings which second only to De Silva 102* in 1996 Final to get the world cup to our mother land . Same as Mahela with very smart batting well supported by Thisara with massive 3 6 'S Relevant to this Sanga and Mahela retirements r very wise and unselfish decisions now it 's time to Dilshan to come to a decision . Dilshan could play another 1 Year but what the team get if he do so ? Dil is struggling allover and not a captaincy material to instruct young captions and currently age of 38 so not a asset to future . He would be simply burden to SL team . <p> Cricthink on April 9 , 2014 , 17:44 GMT <p> Thoughts of one great Captain ! Captain Cool was the title he got and Cool was he . Sanga and Mahela deserved this send off . Their timing was picture perfect . Sanga 's innings was well timed and suited the occasion most . As rightly pointed out by many , this was indeed a Team effort and that 's why we do not find many Sri lankans in the Top 10 Bats or Bowlers . It shows a collective effort that resulted us being T20 World Champs . The retirement of Sanga and Mahela will have an impact in T20 , but when they do call it quits in the 50 Overs and Test , the loss will be felt . Hope the selectors plan on 2015 and beyond . Sanath had done a great job in doing the balancing act , his skills will be tested in the next 18 to 24 months . Thanks boys for the pleasant memories and getting the monkey off your backs . Cheers <p> on April 9 , 2014 , 16:43 GMT <p> Well said Arjuna . It 's very sad only few players getting credit from the Victory . If you look at the entire tournament performance Sanga had scored only 19 runs from FIVE Matches at the Average of 4.75 before the final.Mahela had played only a good single inning but ended with loosing ( 89 ) that match also ( only match SL lost during the tournament ) . So these two players could n't do anything to be selected select Sri Lanka to the FINAl . Everything done by youngsters like Kusal , Tisara , Tirimanna , Rangana , Sachithra , and Mathews . <p> But when we look at 96 statistics it 's purely because of great work by Sanath , Aravinda and Arjuna through out the entire tournament . Sanath did everything till semi final and Aravinda did best semi final and Final and also through out the series . So Sanga and Mahela are totally inconsistent ant not suitable for T20 . Their exixt from T20 will never impact too the Team At all . <p> vihngaDecptan on April 9 , 2014 , 16:29 GMT <p> Some memories , persons are unforgetable forever.But I can say this.Players came players had gone , also players will come players will go.but CRICKET will move forward smoothly with memories of them.It is the life of cricket.Thank you ... <p> cric1965 on April 9 , 2014 , 15:44 GMT <p> In England tour during one day matches Thirimanna and Chandimal should give No 3 and 4 spot to bat .

@@2449239 <h> Farbrace quits as Sri Lanka coach <p> Paul Farbrace , the Sri Lanka coach , has resigned with immediate effect in order to take up a role with the ECB , Sri Lanka Cricket has confirmed . The development came a day after Farbrace returned to Colombo and met with SLC officials to discuss his position , following reports that he had been approached by the ECB to become assistant coach to Peter Moores , the new England coach . <p> Farbrace had been expected to have further meetings with SLC on Tuesday , but had sent in his letter of resignation before the board had had a chance meet him . SLC secretary Nishantha Ranatunga said that although the board regretted his decision to leave the role , they had understood the reasons behind it . <p> Significantly better pay and a desire to work in the country of his birth are believed to be the primary reasons for Farbrace 's early departure from Sri Lanka . After talks on Monday , Ranatunga said Farbrace had been offered an " attractive package " by ECB , the likes of which SLC could not hope to match . The salary SLC had offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Farbrace , who was Yorkshire 's second XI coach at the time , was signed by the board . <p> Farbrace was a little over three months into his two-year contract with SLC . His tenure was marked by off-field upheaval , as much as on-field success . Sri Lanka lost only one out of 18 matches under his watch , winning the World T20 and Asia Cup in that time , but at his time of departure , the players remained locked in a contracts dispute with the board , seven weeks after their previous agreements expired . Mahela Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara also clashed with SLC officials over the announcement of their T20 retirements . Farbrace said , however , his experience in the role had not been soured by off-field events . <p> He had also said he had not applied for the England position , but was approached by the ECB on Thursday , two days before the ECB confirmed Moores as head coach . It is understood Moores had a major say in who he wanted to work with and was strongly in favour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legal repercussions of Farbrace terminating his contract , Ranatunga said . The coach has walked out inside a six-month probationary period , which may mean neither he , nor ECB , are liable to compensate SLC , even though another clause in the contract states Farbrace must give six months ' notice before leaving the role . <p> Sri Lanka 's short-term plans have been landed in some disarray by Farbrace 's departure , as they prepare for a tour of Ireland and England that begins on May 7 . Following that tour , Sri Lanka is set to host no.1 Test side South Africa at home in July , before Pakistan 's expected arrival for another full tour in August . Their plans for the 2015 World Cup will also have been somewhat hampered . <p> An interim appointment is likley for the upcoming tour , with assistant coach Marvan Atapattu the frontrunner to assume the role . Including two other temporary appointments , Atapattu would become the seventh head coach Sri Lanka have had since 2011 . Ranatunga said the board had not yet decided whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Farbace was loaned to Sri Lanka before his contract with Kent expired . We are doing the same thing in return . No hard feelings ! <p> on April 24 , 2014 , 8:10 GMT <p> The ugly truth is locals wo n't be successful as much as an overseas coach because of politics . Politics always plays a key role in Sri Lankan Cricket , a local wo n't be able to cope it . Overseas coach(s) wo n't be affected by politics that much . <p> garawi on April 24 , 2014 , 6:33 GMT <p> SL boys are good under any coach . That they have proved . Farbrace was not instrumental in the T20 win at all . He hardly had any time to settle even . So his leaving is nothing to be worried of . But the question is , when a previous coach 's term was terminated before it ended SLC paid millions as damages . Why is it not reciprocal when a coach resigns before the end of the term ? He should be charged and asked to pay millions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 , 5:09 GMT <p> God sake , Please appoint a ' Local coach ' so that we do not have to go behind this foreign coaches ANYMORE . <p> If SLC rated Farbrace why is he not on a proper contract ? If he is only on 6 months probation he could have been out of work in 3 months time . <p> Grasian on April 23 , 2014 , 12:38 GMT <p> Whilst success as a player has no direct correlation with becoming a successful coach , it is still not clear how a man with a very limited first class career and no track record as an elite coach could be appointed head coach over a formidable test opener with 5000 runs , and a highly skilled test bowler with 350 wickets . Given their inability to cope with the local chaos and language , why on earth would SL Cricket appoint another imported coach . <p> on April 23 , 2014 , 12:08 GMT <p> Glad England have got him I feel bad for any Si Lankan 's that feel slighted by this . Being close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to resist . <p> Sanka on April 23 , 2014 , 11:20 GMT <p> I do n't think we should have let him resign . Should have done an American sports style move . Traded him for money and maybe an up and coming coach . Does anyone else think thats a good strategy ? <p> on April 23 , 2014 , 11:04 GMT <p> I think he has made a big mistake , he is going from a head coach position in a very good team to be an assistant coach in a team that is not doing too well at the moment . When England start loosing more test and ODI 's he surely will get the sack . Who is going to hire him then ? <p> Popstar1234 on April 23 , 2014 , 11:01 GMT <p> Marvan is the Man for the Job ! He is qualified , has been working with the team for a while , so he knows the current set of players well and the juniors coming through the ranks .

We are doing the same thing in return . No hard feelings ! <p> on April 24 , 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be successful as much as an overseas coach because of politics . Politics always plays a key role in Sri Lankan Cricket , a local wo n't be able to cope it . Overseas coach(s) wo n't be affected by politics that much . <p> garawi on April 24 , 2014 , 6:33 GMT <p> SL boys are good under any coach . That they have proved . Farbrace was not instrumental in the T20 win at all . He hardly had any time to settle even . So his leaving is nothing to be worried of . But the question is , when a previous coach 's term was terminated before it ended SLC paid millions as damages . Why is it not reciprocal when a coach resigns before the end of the term ? He should be charged and asked to pay millions for breach of contract . <p> Urajapakse on April 24 , 2014 , 5:09 GMT <p> God sake , Please appoint a ' Local coach ' so that we do not have to go behind this foreign coaches ANYMORE . <p> If SLC rated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If he is only on 6 months probation he could have been out of work in 3 months time . <p> Grasian on April 23 , 2014 , 12:38 GMT <p> Whilst success as a player has no direct correlation with becoming a successful coach , it is still not clear how a man with a very limited first class career and no track record as an elite coach could be appointed head coach over a formidable test opener with 5000 runs , and a highly skilled test bowler with 350 wickets . Given their inability to cope with the local chaos and language , why on earth would SL Cricket appoint another imported coach . <p> on April 23 , 2014 , 12:08 GMT <p> Glad England have got him I feel bad for any Si Lankan 's that feel slighted by this . Being close to home and having fair bit more income would be hard to resist . <p> Sanka on April 23 , 2014 , 11:20 GMT <p> I do n't think we should have let him resign . Should have done an American sports style @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coming coach . Does anyone else think thats a good strategy ? <p> on April 23 , 2014 , 11:04 GMT <p> I think he has made a big mistake , he is going from a head coach position in a very good team to be an assistant coach in a team that is not doing too well at the moment . When England start loosing more test and ODI 's he surely will get the sack . Who is going to hire him then ? <p> Popstar1234 on April 23 , 2014 , 11:01 GMT <p> Marvan is the Man for the Job ! He is qualified , has been working with the team for a while , so he knows the current set of players well and the juniors coming through the ranks . He is a humble man who has proven to be a very good leader .

Well that downtown county ( ? ) , said to be waited for 77 years to break jinx . I would like to see ENG vs SL final in next WC and ENG wait for the maiden ODI-WC win , much less 37 years unlike the county.Both SL and ENG have enjoyed many runner-ups , SL 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. in ODI-WCs . <p> on April 23 , 2014 , 9:36 GMT <p> Chandika Hathurusinghe has been the coach of the Sydney Thunders since last year . Sydney Thunders won only one game out of 10 games under him . They finished last in the BIG Bash League . Do you want Chandika Hathurusinghe as head coach of Sri Lanka ? OMG , No Noway . We all know that he is a Sri Lankan and it should not be a criteria to select a coach for one of the leading cricket nations in the World.We should look into the coach 's credentials . <p> Prabhash1985 on April 23 , 2014 , 9:26 GMT <p> Let 's get on with it . What to do ... ! I think it 's time for SLC to give Mavan Athapattu , the head coach position . <p> on April 23 , 2014 , 9:03 GMT <p> Here is the deal , if you are a coach and dreaming to be a part of a world cup winning team apply now . ( if you are looking to ern more and looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in future you may be the guy we are looking for . Hurry ) <p> on April 23 , 2014 , 8:51 GMT <p> I think it 's time to think about someone like Chandika Hathurusinghe who 's more qualified with experience at overseas . <p> ThirteenthMan on April 23 , 2014 , 8:41 GMT <p> Let us hope , for the sake of England , no one comes up with a better offer . <p> on April 23 , 2014 , 8:22 GMT <p> @TripleCenturian . Do u know what happened at York coach case ? Its said that the SLC discussed the matter with York authorities and they come to an agreement before pulling out PF. here ECB has never discussed the matter with SLC- May be ECB thinks why should they speak to SLC as they r Simply belong to Big3 <p> on April 23 , 2014 , 8:17 GMT <p> You can hire Wasim Akram , Waqar Younis , Brian Lara , Rahul Dravid , Sunil Gavaskar , Javed Miandad , Sachin Tendulkar and all legends together . But you simply ca n't produce players and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who made this reality . Not a single legend produced in last 30 to 40 years from England . Overseas players were helping you a lot but you also do n't want them to play and groom your youngsters . England have biggest cricketing counties across the globe but still they lack in producing quality cricketers . <p> Vees1000 on April 23 , 2014 , 7:50 GMT <p> Hmmm ... so it would seem that being an ASSISTANT Coach position of England is more prestigious than being the HEAD Coach of a world cup winning nation ? ? ? Interesting ! <p> on April 23 , 2014 , 6:42 GMT <p> Ca n't really blame Paul for the decision taken . Nothing wrong in preferring to work in your country of birth and also at a much much higher fee . I feel its slightly unethical though as Sri Lanka is due to tour England next month and Paul is completely aware of our strength , weaknesses etc . However as he is on probation he is legally within his right to leave at any time for any reason . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not put probationary clauses etc . Considering the dirt poor salaries that coaches are offered , naturally when a better offer comes up within the probation period they 'll jump at it . <p> I also do n't think Sri Lanka will benefit by having a local coach . Simply because someone was a good player does n't make them a good coach . And you ca n't compare the skills , knowledge , coaching techniques , expertise etc of foreign coaches with our locals , I believe we 're way behind in these depts . <p> Udendra on April 23 , 2014 , 4:05 GMT <p> In my opinion , Marvan is not a good choice . He was never an aggressive or inventive captain , and the same can be said about his coaching too . <p> on April 23 , 2014 , 4:04 GMT <p> This is the best opportunity for Lanka to use home grown talent to coach the team . Stop becoming a leaning tower towards foreign coaches . Ideal time to give Marvan the opportunity , together with Murali and Vaas . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working the situation SPIN and the match , tour SWOT . Equally has to work on the inner strengths of each players , specially the emerging ones and get them groomed on how to build the strengths , not just physical . <p> on April 23 , 2014 , 3:56 GMT <p> Well done ... Good decision ... We can do without him ... <p> ksquared on April 23 , 2014 , 3:26 GMT <p> Does n't really matter even with Farbrace in the other camp SL will do well this time around players would be better prepared as none of the players are in the IPL except for Malinga and Thisara . I think all the seniors will be desperate to do well specially Sanga . But we might be in for a rude awakening if this contract issue is not resolved I read that SLC is already preparing an alternate team if negotiations fail . Hope SL do n't end up sending a second string side to ENG <p> KrisRam77 on April 23 , 2014 , 3:24 GMT <p> I understand the logic behind Fabrace 's decision to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . But no one can deny ECB 's role here . Clear case of bullying by Big Bro England . The Big 3 of ICC ( India , Australia and England will do more harm to other smaller Cricketing nations than any substantial good ) . <p> Htc-Android on April 23 , 2014 , 3:13 GMT <p> The reason why Local coaches are not considered , because SLC think that their are certain SL players who will get favours from the local coach . Thats why they appoint foreign coaches . <p> Htc-Android on April 23 , 2014 , 3:10 GMT <p> Its not going to be an easy task for Fabrace to coach English team . Sri lanka had great mix of talanted young and Experienced players in their team . Also Sanga and Mahela are very knowledgeable on the field . He also worked with SL players in the past.This actually made Fabrace job easier . But with England he has to build a team that is totally inexperienced . I think Fabrace is good at mentally preparing the side than improving the players skills . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past . Anyways I wont blame Fabrace for this.He has the right to give priority for his motherland . <p> on April 23 , 2014 , 2:37 GMT <p> @ Riyaz Izzedeen. 6 months notice clause superseeds probation period . is n't it ? What Fabrace has achieved more than Mavan or Chandika ? Only he made his name bit popular being SL coach sothat he could catch ECB attention . Anyway he has every right to move anywhere . <p> covadrive on April 23 , 2014 , 2:06 GMT <p> I am just curious what the protocols are with another team/country approaching a manager/coach who is under a contract , regardless of whether it was during the probation period . <p> In North American sports , teams have to get permission to even talk to someone under contract to begin with . Perhaps ICC does not have such rules but it is setting up a bad precedent and that too when ECB being part of this so called " big 3 " in ICC . <p> Whatever it is , it was SLC that put themselves in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no excuse not to compensate players/coaches competitively if you want to be considered among the best . <p> on April 23 , 2014 , 0:57 GMT <p> I have a hunch the approaching SL tour of england is going to be disastrous for england not SL . <p> goldeneye075 on April 23 , 2014 , 0:46 GMT <p> I think it is " Unprofessional " to buy out Paul Fab from sri lanka . Unethical and unprofessional . As the money rich ECB could just buy out coaches from the poorest cricketing boards around like SL . So with the new system intact you can not do much with these 3 big boys now days , the Richer will get more rich and the Poor will be more poorer I guess ! ! ! This is just a sample of things , that we could expect from the BIG 3 . Jayasooriya is a good selector but nothing more than that , he is not coach material and no one has any respect towards him . One of the blunders that he did was giving the captaincy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ! ! <p> on April 23 , 2014 , 0:35 GMT <p> Big loss , but we 'll survive : ) <p> RMCroos on April 23 , 2014 , 0:16 GMT <p> any coach will be happy to serve his own country all what SLC must do now thank him for the short period send him with a smile ! ! ! ! <p> 5fornaught on April 22 , 2014 , 23:34 GMT <p> These foreign coaches are here for the money and to improve their resume , and when something good comes up they leave , PB was just a passenger . All the hard work was done by the cricketers , GF and support staff , they were really dedicated to SL cricket . Lets be patriotic and get a SL who can do the job in equal terms . SLC can save money and put that money into good use rather than getting foreign coaches who only motive is to make money , increase their chances in getting a better deal with other countries and have a good holiday in SL . <p> jj0685 on April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on adversity , this will toughen them up and they will be mentally stronger when they play in England . Hope they thrash England in the upcoming tour . Sri Lanka needs a foreign coach , because a local coach will have to bow down to the political pressure from the SL board etc . How about Dav Whatmore ? <p> on April 22 , 2014 , 20:35 GMT <p> i know he is good for sri lanka but it is board mistake to go behin d , Atapattu is the best that time and now . <p> naudurivsm on April 22 , 2014 , 20:34 GMT <p> The pathetic situation England cricket is in now , they can buy anything and everyone they think that it will help their team . But they forgot the fact that it is the players who do it all whether win or lose matches . However good or bad the coach is , the onus is still on the players to execute and if they are failing it is not the coaches problems . because a coach can teach you the best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capabilities . <p> anuradea on April 22 , 2014 , 20:30 GMT <p> Here 's a taste of what to expect once the BIG 3 is in operation . ECB should have had the courtesy to at least inquire from SLC , if it is ok to to talk to him . This is a absolutely bullish way ECB has conducted itself to show everyone , that " we are from the BIG 3 and we will do exactly as it pleases us " . What unethical way this had been done is beyond anyone and this is not the way civilized organizations do things . Farbrace was lucky to have plucked the fortunes that was created by Ford and SLC should not even think about letting him go . Sri Lanka is is and will always be a winning team our talent pool is so deep any person with goon man management skills will be able to coach . SL 's base is so good , when the players come to the international level , there is harpy any coaching to be done , but only to enhance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a code of conduct for all the boards on poaching in order to stop this happening again . <p> on April 22 , 2014 , 19:47 GMT <p> While Coaches makes a huge difference they cant make a team win a world cup ... Players do that ... If coaches win it then dav whatmore could have made B'desh a world cup winning side ... or Pakistan ... Let 's see whether whether Farbrace could turn around the weak English side ... While money plays a huge role in life , it 's petty to just leave like this when a whole team has kept so much faith on him ... <p> vimal03 on April 22 , 2014 , 19:27 GMT <p> I do n't think Farbrace will make England team better . I will be surprised if he stay with England for a long time . He wasted his chances with a better team just for extra money . He will be facing lot of question when Srilanka tours to England and when England collapse in ICC World cup 2015 . <p> on April 22 , 2014 , 19:23 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't blame Farbrace on his decision after all the surrounding facts highlighted . But If I was in the decision making panel ECB would not have reached him . It is said that cricket is a game of Gentlemen . So this should not only be applicable to players but also to the administrators , specially a member of the world cricket governing body , recently agreed . In my view the founder &amp; the core governor of the game must be an example for others to follow . If Farbrace was the county coach would ECB still offer him ? <p> Why could n't ECB get him on board during flower 's tenure if he is so crucial for EC ? <p> Is it ethical to hunt him less than a month to start the Sri Lankans tour in England ? this is like a general in a battle field is hired by the opposition ! ! ! <p> We , sri lankan do not worry about ECB tactics . ECB with their media will do more tactics off the field just before the series starts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 , 2014 , 18:48 GMT <p> There is no doubt that the ECB have shown it 's class by pulling SL coach prematurely . It has to be discussed at a higher level because it is damaging the ' spirit of the game ' off the field . Nobody can blame Farbrace because he is another man who likes to enjoy more money and more perks than his own dignity . Every Board is trying hard to give the best support to their players by providing the best coaches in the world , facilities and salaries etc . Having all that in the possession I wonder what kind of respect and enjoyment England team has given to the country and its people as a whole . The whole world witnessed it in the Australian tour and in the world T20 recently . It will be a great success if they can win at least one ODI and the T20 against SL in May . <p> TripleCenturian on April 22 , 2014 , 18:20 GMT <p> @seanb . And applying your logic , how come Sri Lanka poached Farbs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ April 22 , 2014 , 17:30 GMT <p> Well , he left . The Sri Lankan team will survive , though ! <p> Although Farbrace did n't get to do much during the Asia Cup and T20 World Cup , he could 've really made a difference this England tour and at the 2015 World Cup , more than just getting the players in the right frame of mind ( which is what he said that he did ) . <p> I think SLC and the Sri Lankan cricket team deserve a LOT of credit for getting Farby a job at home with their national side , with a pay that he probably did n't even dream of a few months ago . <p> Anyway , good luck , Farby ! Meet you in May ; ) <p> About the head coach position for SL , no need to panic as our players can work with Marvan , Vaas and Kalpage - the people who do the actual work - for the time being , at least until the England tour ends . Until then , SLC can find another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! : ) <p> yorkslanka on April 22 , 2014 , 17:22 GMT <p> i have to be honest and say i am disappointed that Farbrace is leaving but i can not blame his as we cant compete with his new salary .. I can see that him being in his own country with his family will make this decision easy for him.good luck to him <p> on April 22 , 2014 , 17:08 GMT <p> I hope he 's worth it . Not sure that the combination of Moores and Farbrace will work . Desperate times for England . <p> Mannix16 on April 22 , 2014 , 16:54 GMT <p> Nothing wrong in a man wanting to become a coach in the country of his birth with better pay . The problem is the timing of his decision . Sri Lanka are just ahead of a HUGE series in England and thus are at a time when they do not need a drastic change in the coaching staff . To compound that issue , their coach is pretty much switching sides to the opposition side . It 's pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general switches to the opposite side ....... He should have waited until after the England Series before changing sides <p> priceless1 on April 22 , 2014 , 16:07 GMT <p> get a feeling this going to be a disastrous tour for the SL , their young guns going to be found out by the English bowlers ( with a little bit of help from their ex coach ) <p> pvwadekar on April 22 , 2014 , 16:01 GMT <p> Too many cooks spoil the broth . Why does a ECB main coach need an assistant coach ? England have an unbelievable backroom staff - batting coach , fast bowling coach , spin bowling coach , main coach and an assistant coach . Just get 6 more coaches to compose a team of " Coaches XI " to play .. they will not be as bad as the current playing XI .. <p> KingOwl on April 22 , 2014 , 15:55 GMT <p> @Herath : Yes , Sanath J could potentially be a good coach . But he has been great as the chief selector and I think he should remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the others do the job . Fielding will be fine and bowling-wise , Vass has a lot of experience in England . Getting temporary batting consultants and the like will be quite useless . Kumar will have played a bit of cricket in Durham and he will be as good as any to give some insights to young players . Let 's not try to portray loss of Farbrace as some sort of a disaster ! SL would have won the T20 WC , with or without Farbrace . Let 's not forget . Sri Lankans thrive on chaos . <p> Bogelking on April 22 , 2014 , 15:26 GMT <p> Feeling really sad of Farbrace departure from Srilanka , to join ECB offering better facilities . I am not criticising his viewpoint of selecting the side that he should coach . But I am worried about the plight of SLC , of how well can they reshape from this predicament . With the 50 over world cup round the corner , and the players gelling well with Farbrace-even though for a short period- will seriously affect them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because the SL players are on a high after a successful period in Bangladesh winning the tour , Asia Cup and the T20 world cup as well . So they could move on from this and concentrate in the future tours abroad as well as in their home to extend their good run . Good luck Sri Lanka. ! ! ! ! ! <p> ramz30380 on April 22 , 2014 , 15:04 GMT <p> SL team has a good combination of youth and exp and can do reasonably well on its own but to see some comments here that say SL are world beaters outside the subcontinent , I must say tht they do nt know their cricket . <p> SL needs a coach who will not be distracted by the local politics , will have a cool head and have a calming influence on the team while understanding the diff of all the off-field issues . But the important part here is tht to have a good coach , u need to pay him well . SL has faltered in tht and were looking out for economical choices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atapattu is a well respectd man but the diff he will face is tht he wont be able to dictate terms to Mahela and Sanga with whom he has played with . A person like Arjuna Ranatunga can do the job as he is an influential figure , understands cricket , commands respect and most importantly SLC wont mess with him ! ! ! <p> SeanB on April 22 , 2014 , 13:50 GMT <p> More money and work in home country - he decided to leave and that is understandable . But how can ECB approach a person contracted with another country ? So far ECB picked players from other country ; now ECB is targeting support staff as well . <p> on April 22 , 2014 , 13:39 GMT <p> All and all Paul will see his side 's lost to SL and he was chosen for the fact we did n't have other for that price not for his potential now it 's up to the SL board seeking a better choice or stick with Marvan , As SL cricket point of view we have n't lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky to have been coaching in a great cricketing nation and specially he was fortunate enough to stay around with champion cricketers who could secure a world cup . Good luck Paul and you will see you lose your coaching team soon . <p> on April 22 , 2014 , 13:39 GMT <p> A big disappointment , but with the success Sri Lanka has made recently , they can easily go on as usual in the future as well , without Fabrace . My bet is with or without Fabrace s/l will win the World cup in 2015 , in 50 overs format . <p> SLMaster on April 22 , 2014 , 13:30 GMT <p> Bring in Roy Dias , Duleep Mendis or Marvan Atapattu . These guys can do good too . <p> muzikatchaikovskogo on April 22 , 2014 , 13:28 GMT <p> Terribly unfortunate , but understandable when you see it from Farbrace 's viewpoint . When he has the option of getting a much better pay , that too working for his home country , why settle for a lower pay working elsewhere , apart from having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 , 2014 , 13:21 GMT <p> I ca n't say I 'm not disappointed but he had to make a choice he 'll be happy with . To be honest , most people would accept the chance to work in their own country for a greater renumeration . I guess , appoint Marvan on an interim basis . I look forward to the day when the team can prosper under a local coach . However , I do n't think that day is now . Sri Lanka still needs a foreign coach to be impartial in the treatment of the players and rise above the political cronyism . <p> Lion96 on April 22 , 2014 , 12:48 GMT <p> I have to say , its really disappointing to hear this news . Im not sure if any board would be willing to offer Farbrace a job after this incident . No one does it for the love of the game anymore , its just money , money money &amp; more money . Thats whats this all about . If I were Farbrace , I would have stuck with SL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commitment to our team . Win or lose , if theres another ( or better ? ) oppourtunity out there , they are gone in seconds . Secondly , what good is contract if you do nt abide by it ? Written agreements , dignity and love for the and professional commitment comes a distant 2nd to Love of the team &amp; sport . I feel bit used , I must say . We win the Asia Cup &amp; WT20 and coaches look to jump ship ? How ironic would it be if SL beats ENG this summer ? ? <p> Herath-UK on April 22 , 2014 , 12:30 GMT <p> Why not Jayasuriya himself becomes the interim coach during the England tour . He is an iconic figure &amp; respected internationally in no uncertain way , has the political clout &amp; above all can demand the players to toe his line . I think if not one of , was the central figure in recent triumphs Sri Lanka have had . He had the courage to pull Malinga &amp; Thisara out from the BBL &amp; am sure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greater good of the team . No outsider however big can make much headway for the England tour &amp; with so many senior experienced figures in the team &amp; with Marvan &amp; Vass as supporting coaches Jayasuriya should be the man for this tour . <p> on April 22 , 2014 , 12:21 GMT <p> Why not ? This happens in many jobs - if there is a better opportunity ( money primarily ) , then people leave . But it is always good to leave on a decent note . For many jobs there are contractual obligations - so leaving is not easy . SL themselves paid money to get Fabrace - so these things happen . SL can do well under any coach . <p> Lord.emsworth on April 22 , 2014 , 12:16 GMT <p> Well , He 's only human . He did what he thought was best . After all he gets to stay in his home country , gets a better financial deal , and is the assis. coach for a country that has the richest history of competitive cricket . As I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 seniors in the current team to be interim coach , see over the situation after the England tour , and then set about securing a foreign coach who will be above local bickering and politics . <p> on April 22 , 2014 , 12:08 GMT <p> Paul Fabrace did admit when Sri Lanka won the Asia cup 2014 that he had nothing to with the success . WC T20 success was one long over due . SL have been in seven ICC finals recently . It is no loss to SL . We have Marvan Athapaththu who should have been given the job in the first place . He has and is doing a great job as the batting coach not to mention Vas as an excellent bowling coach . We do not need anyone from outside of Sri Lanka to coach our boys . Thank you Paul hope you get a change to enjoy success with the England setup too . <p> YsaKaru on April 22 , 2014 , 11:32 GMT <p> as a lankan i 'm disappointing ........ But good luck for Paul Farbrace to future ...... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> First of all this guy did n't win the T20 world cup or the Asia cup in three months .... the SL Cricketers did . It was a just a case of right place , right time for Paul Fabrace . Do you really think he made all the difference in 3 months ? Get real ! This is a team that has been playing very good and consistent cricket for a few years . <p> PF is just one member of the team along with 3 experienced Sri lankan coaches ( whom I must add , understand the ' Sri Lankan ' style of cricket and have great tactical knowledge about the game ) , the captain , vice-captain with the input of other senior players ( i.e. Mahela , Sanga , Angelo ) who would work on strategy and tactics for any given tournament BUT the execution of these tactics can only be done by the 11 men on the field .

There 's clearly a reluctance by the various boards to employ one of their own and its worth briefly examining why this should be the case . First , an expat coach is not open to the accusation of his board , its selectors or the supporters of the nat . side of which he has taken charge , of siding with his own ( province , people , faith , etc . ) . Therefore , he 's likely to be more objective and dispassionate when it comes to treating his charges equally . Secondly , he brings a set of ideas and experience that are from a different cricketing culture - and this is genuinely a major plus because the besetting weakness of subcontinental teams is their inability to perform away from their own geographical locale . Thirdly , as a visitor he does n't have a permanent home in his adopted country &amp; thus he 's relieved of looking after his own property and the family he may have living in it .

@@2646234 the Wreckage Is Already Revealing <p> by Robert Goyer ( July 18 , 2014 , London , Sri Lanka Guardian ) Once investigators find the chemical signature of the device , they will be able to tell with great certainty what kind of explosive caused the damage -- and very likely where that charge was manufactured and by whom . <p> With the crash of another Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 , this one in eastern Ukraine , aviation accident investigators are again asking the same big questions as in any disaster : What happened and why did it happen ? In the case of the disappearance of MH370 this spring , the answer at this point on both counts is that no one knows . This will not be the case with MH17 . We already know a lot about what happened -- if not why . <p> To start with the obvious , we already know where the airplane is . Searchers , many of them local residents , began finding wreckage the bodies of the victims almost immediately after the crash . <p> The location of the wreckage holds easy clues to what happened . It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that a ground to air missile took out MH17 while it was in cruise flight at its assigned altitude , now being reported as 33,000 feet . The evidence we already have corroborates that theory . When an airplane crashes into the ground under power or as the pilots are trying to regain control , the scattering of the wreckage is always very contained , usually within an acre or so . <p> In this case , large parts have already started turning up miles away from each other , and that can only mean one thing : that the airplane broke apart at altitude and its parts descended on the currents of the wind until they impacted the earth . The higher the airplane was when it came apart , the more widely scattered the wreckage will be . We can conclude that MH17 came apart at a very high altitude . And it came apart very violently . I have seen a photograph of the floor structure of the airplane , torn apart at the metal structural ties , capable of withstanding many tens of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ukraine . The section in question weighs likely around 10,000 pounds . It 's not the kid of component that breaks off and flutters away . It was blown apart from the rest of the structure . <p> It is possible for aircraft structures to fail during an explosive depressurization , and that indeed did happen in the early days of jet aviation , most notably with the British built de Havilland Comet jet , which suffered a series of fatal pressure vessel failures due to metal fatigue . The Boeing 777 , however , is a modern and exceptionally strong plane , one that is based on modern computer aided design calculations that take just such events into consideration , making it nearly impossible for one failure to lead the next until the airplane comes apart . That is not what happened here . <p> The only explanations that make any sense given the widely scattered wreckage and the degree to which the airplane came apart are that it was hit by a missile -- the working theory among authorities now -- or that a bomb went off inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be immediately apparent to investigators once they see the wreckage . An explosion leaves an unmistakable fingerprint , telling forensics specialists where the explosive went off and whether that blast originated from inside or outside the aircraft . <p> Then , once they find the chemical signature of the device , they will be able to tell with great certainty what kind of explosive caused the damage and very likely where that charge was manufactured and by whom . <p> The traces of such an explosion will be unmistakable . Investigators will be able to test quickly for certain classes of explosives , but even before that they will likely be able to see the characteristic high-speed pitting of surfaces exposed to the explosive forces . When TWA Flight 800 crashed over Long Island Sound in 1996 , investigators were able to determine that the explosion was the result of a fuel explosion and not an explosive device planted in the plane or a missile fired from below . <p> Investigators looking into what happened to Flight MH17 will be able to make the exact same types of determinations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and not sunken in a body of water -- they will be able to make those determinations very quickly and turn the investigation over to others who are more interested in who did it and tracking them down .

Elimination of subsidies such as food etc . <p> Regulations , laws , standards are all adjusted to enable foreign investors to take over every area that locals held control of . Locals in top positions fall prey to the buy over bargains little realizing that once handed over these profit running entities become foreign owned and run according to their laws . <p> Once the above is achieved , it means the following for the people of a nation <p> Poor countries will have to export to raise money to pay off debts . IMF and World Bank are quick to entice countries into the global market place before they are economically and socially stable and ready . These countries are told to concentrate on cash crops . Resources from poorer regions become even cheaper favouring Western consumers . <p> Governments have to increase exports to keep currencies stable and earn foreign exchange to help pay off debts . <p> Governments have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc this leads to decrease in value of labor , capital flows volatile , countries are asked to peg their currencies to the dollar to keep exchange rate stable and social unrest results then investors pull out their assets/interests and an economic collapse occurs . <p> IMF donors keep exchange rates in their favour which means that poor nations remain poor or may become poorer . <p> World Bank/IMF -- The path to destroying a country <p> Step 1 : Sell off local banks to foreign banks <p> Step 2 : Open capital markets -- create market based pricing ending up with bills that no one can pay . <p> Step 3 : Open up borders to trade -- free marketeering . Coercion trade . This is to enable globalists to fully control all industry in a country . China has a 40% tariff on US and US has a 2% on China -- globalists control China . Walmart does not sell anything American . Walmart has over 700 plants in China . IMF/World Bank wants to destroy economies so it can not produce anything and open borders to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barriers and the orientation of economies to exports thwarts efforts of Third World nations to escape from their <p> dependence on the industrialized nations and to become economically self-sufficient . <p> Step 4 : Install puppet corporate governments . When IMF or World Bank says they would support a transition government they actually mean they will fund a coup d'etat . Hugo Chavez told the IMF to go packing . Chavez declared he would double the taxes on oil corporations which will give money for Venzuela 's social programs -- IMF/World Bank wanted him removed . At the suggestion of the IMF and World Bank , ousted Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak sold public companies to local and foreign investors , while 40 per cent of Egyptians earned US$2 per day . <p> How many countries fell victim ? <p> Examples of privatization <p> Argentina -- IMF and World Bank asked Argentina to sell off their assets and privatizing all public assets .

Enron assets were transferred to a dummy company and Enron was declared bankrupt . The politicians are bribed to privatize anything and everything and to transfer to World Bank or IMF who in turn hand over to their cronies . Citibank grabbed half of Argentina 's banks . Politicians became rich with accounts in Swiss banks . <p> Examples of creating riots <p> IMF and World Bank also help create riots . When a riot takes place the capital runs away from the country enabling IMF to add more conditions and further strangulate a country <p> Examples of creating tensions inside countries : <p> The example of Argentina with high unemployment did not stop IMF from insisting that Argentina cut off unemployment benefits , take away pension funds , cut education budgets . IMF was creating a recession another tactic to demolish a nation . <p> Examples of disasters created by IMF/World Bank <p> Somalia suffers from an inflicted civil war enabling humanitarian intervention and the positioning of 4 US oil giants US oil giants Conoco , Amoco , Chevron and Phillips in a country that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used as excuse to give IMF/World Bank food ' aid ' while destroying the nomadic and commercial livestock but increasing European beef imports to West Africa ( low quality beef sold at half price of locally produced meat ) and farmers find no one is willing to buy their herds . Droughts occur due to oversupply of grain staples under supervision of World Bank and these are systematically destroying the national food agriculture . <p> IMF/World Bank -- Guilt List <p> Both funded with taxpayer money but operates in secrecy . Members of affected communities are not considered to design loan packages . IMF works with central banks and finance ministers to make policies and both entities refuse to allow public scrutiny and independent evaluation of their policy systems . <p> Both guilty of dominating decision making -- voting powers determined by amount of money each country pays to IMF 's quota system ( one dollar -- one vote = more dollars -- more votes ! ) Disproportionate power given to wealthy countries means they push the interests of their banks , their investors , their corporations and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty of creating inequality and environmental destruction <p> Both demand countries cut spending on education and health , basic food and transportation subsidies , devaluation of national currencies to make exports cheaper , privatization of national assets , freezing of wages to repay debt given <p> Both help create increase in poverty and reduce a country 's ability to build itself and allows multinational corporations to exploit workers and environment ( is this the ultimate goal of the IMF and World Bank ? ) ex : IMF loan package to Argentina was tied to cuts in doctors/teachers salaries and decrease in social security payments ( the public knows of these only after the deals are signed ) <p> Both help create ' elites ' in developing nations who are willing and subservient to First World elites because they serve to personally and commercially gain . <p> Both guilty of forcing developing nations to prioritize export production over development of diversified economies . 80% of malnourished children are from countries that were forced to shift from food production for local consumption to production of export crops destined for West . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidies to export industries . Public assets like forestland , utilities such as phone , water , electricity are sold off to foreign investors at rock bottom prices .

US corporation Early Rice sells 50% of rice consumed by Haiti . <p> Both guilty of advising countries to attract foreign investors by weakening their labor laws , eliminating collective bargaining laws and suppressing wages . Ex : IMF allows corporations to fire at whim and calls it ' labor flexibility ' . Haiti was told to remove statute that mandated increases in minimum wage . Even the US ordinary citizens are affected by IMF/World beause because they cant compete with cheap exploited foreign labor .

Insistence on cocoa exports by Ivory Coast has resulted in 2/3 of the country 's forests been ruined . <p> Both guilty of favouring the rich -- bailing out rich bankers . Pushing countries to deregulate financial systems , removing regulations to draw foreign investors has caused chaos because capital invested as short-term puts countries at the whim of financial speculators . Mexico peso crisis in 1995 resulted in IMF and US entering to prop up interest and exchange rates , bailing out Wall Street Bankers with tax payers money . During the bailout of Asian countries IMF insisted that governments assume the bad debts of private banks forcing the public to pay the costs thus taking away resources for social programs . <p> The World Bank &amp; IMF are owned and controlled by N M Rothschild and 30-40 of the wealthiest people in the world . <p> Global Oligarchy <p> If the world 's central banks are under the control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Citigroup and Wells Fargo and these in turn own the world 's 4 largest oil companies Exxon Mobil , Royal Dutch/Shell , BP and Chevron Texaco alongside Deutsch Bank , BNP , Barclays and European elites and these 4 banks are the top 10 stock holders of virtually every Fortune 500 companies what if the stockholders of these banks are the same ? <p> What if the 43,060 transnational corporations are controlled by 1318 companies and the same handful of people giving them disproportionate power over the global economy ? <p> What if these 1318 companies collectively own through their shares the world 's largest blue chip and manufacturing firms ? <p> What if these 1318 companies broken down further led to 147 companies who between them held 40% of the total wealth of the world ? <p> If the World Bank and IMF requires nations to sign secret agreements agreeing to sell off assets like water , electricity , gas etc and those signing on behalf of nations are agreeing to take economic steps that would devastate nations -- what would it mean to these nations ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians of nations and agree to pay billions of dollars to Swiss Bank accounts so that they would agree to transfer a countries fixed assets -- what would it mean to these nations ? <p> What would happen if the governments or rather the politicians who do not agree are cut-off from international borrowing as punishment or plan for the overthrow of government ? <p> No government can last when its populations are declining into poverty , it is when that looks to be happening that they reach out for the hand of their saviors who are invariably the very people that caused the fall -- Somalia is an example that developing nations should keep in mind .

And it is only natural and appropriate that the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and liberal constitutional lawyer who holds the reins of power should be concerned only with how to carry out such actions more efficaciously . <p> A closer look establishes these conclusions quite firmly . <p> The article opens by citing US operations " from Angola to Nicaragua to Cuba . " Let us add a little of what is omitted . <p> In Angola , the US joined South Africa in providing the crucial support for Jonas Savimbi 's terrorist UNITA army , and continued to do so after Savimbi had been roundly defeated in a carefully monitored free election and even after South Africa had withdrawn support from this " monster whose lust for power had brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of British Ambassador to Angola Marrack Goulding , seconded by the CIA station chief in neighboring Kinshasa who warned that " it was n't a good idea " to support the monster " because of the extent of Savimbi 's crimes . He was terribly brutal . " <p> Despite extensive and murderous US-backed terrorist operations in Angola , Cuban forces drove South African aggressors out of the country , compelled them to leave illegally occupied Namibia , and opened the way for the Angolan election in which , after his defeat , Savimbi " dismissed entirely the views of nearly 800 foreign elections observers here that the balloting ... was generally free and fair " ( New York Times ) , and continued the terrorist war with US support . <p> Cuban achievements in the liberation of Africa and ending of Apartheid were hailed by Nelson Mandela when he was finally released from prison . Among his first acts was to declare that " During all my years in prison , Cuba was an inspiration and Fidel Castro a tower of strength ... Cuban victories destroyed the myth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses of South Africa ... a turning point for the liberation of our continent -- and of my people -- from the scourge of apartheid . ... What other country can point to a record of greater selflessness than Cuba has displayed in its relations to Africa ? " <p> The terrorist commander Henry Kissinger , in contrast , was " apoplectic " over the insubordination of the " pipsqueak " Castro who should be " smashed , " as reported by William Leogrande and Peter Kornbluh in their book Back Channel to Cuba , relying on recently declassified documents . <p> Turning to Nicaragua , we need not tarry on Reagan 's terrorist war , which continued well after the International Court of Justice ordered Washington to cease its " illegal use of force " -- that is , international terrorism -- and pay substantial reparations , and after a resolution of the UN Security Council that called on all states ( meaning the US ) to observe international law -- vetoed by Washington . <p> It should be acknowledged , however , that Reagan 's terrorist war against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bush -- was not as destructive as the state terrorism he backed enthusiastically in El Salvador and Guatemala . Nicaragua had the advantage of having an army to confront the US-run terrorist forces , while in the neighboring states the terrorists assaulting the population were the security forces armed and trained by Washington . <p> In a few weeks we will be commemorating the Grand Finale of Washington 's terrorist wars in Latin America : the murder of six leading Latin American intellectuals , Jesuit priests , by an elite terrorist unit of the Salvadoran army , the Atlacatl Battalion , armed and trained by Washington , acting on the explicit orders of the High Command , and with a long record of massacres of the usual victims . <p> This shocking crime on November 16 , 1989 , at the Jesuit University in San Salvador was the coda to the enormous plague of terror that spread over the continent after John F. Kennedy changed the mission of the Latin American military from " hemispheric defense " -- an outdated relic of World War II -- to " internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The aftermath is described succinctly by Charles Maechling , who led US counterinsurgency and internal defense planning from 1961 to 1966 . He described Kennedy 's 1962 decision as a shift from toleration " of the rapacity and cruelty of the Latin American military " to " direct complicity " in their crimes , to US support for " the methods of Heinrich Himmler 's extermination squads . " <p> All forgotten , not the " right kind of facts . " <p> In Cuba , Washington 's terror operations were launched in full fury by President Kennedy to punish Cubans for defeating the US-run Bay of Pigs invasion . As described by historian Piero Gleijeses , JFK " asked his brother , Attorney General Robert Kennedy , to lead the top-level interagency group that oversaw Operation Mongoose , a program of paramilitary operations , economic warfare , and sabotage he launched in late 1961 to visit the ' terrors of the earth ' on Fidel Castro and , more prosaically , to topple him . " <p> The phrase " terrors of the earth " is quoted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biography of Robert Kennedy , who was assigned responsibility for conducting the terrorist war . RFK informed the CIA that the Cuban problem carries " the top priority in the United States Government -- all else is secondary -- no time , no effort , or manpower is to be spared " in the effort to overthrow the Castro regime , and to bring " the terrors of the earth " to Cuba . <p> The terrorist war launched by the Kennedy brothers was no small affair . It involved 400 Americans , 2,000 Cubans , a private navy of fast boats , and a $50 million annual budget , run in part by a Miami CIA station functioning in violation of the Neutrality Act and , presumably , the law banning CIA operations in the United States . Operations included bombing of hotels and industrial installations , sinking of fishing boats , poisoning of crops and livestock , contamination of sugar exports , etc . Some of these operations were not specifically authorized by the CIA but carried out by the terrorist forces it funded and supported , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The Mongoose terrorist operations were run by General Edward Lansdale , who had ample experience in US-run terrorist operations in the Philippines and Vietnam . His timetable for Operation Mongoose called for " open revolt and overthrow of the Communist regime " in October 1962 , which , for " final success will require decisive U.S. military intervention " after terrorism and subversion had laid the basis . <p> October 1962 is , of course , a very significant moment in modern history . It was in that month that Nikita Khrushchev sent missiles to Cuba , setting off the missile crisis that came ominously close to terminal nuclear war . Scholarship now recognizes that Khrushchev was in part motivated by the huge US preponderance in force after Kennedy had responded to his calls for reduction in offensive weapons by radically increasing the US advantage , and in part by concern over a possible US invasion of Cuba . Years later , Kennedy 's Defense Secretary Robert McNamara recognized that Cuba and Russia were justified in fearing an attack . " If I were in Cuban or Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " McNamara observed at a major international conference on the missile crisis on the 40th anniversary . <p> The highly regarded policy analyst Raymond Garthoff , who had many years of direct experience in US intelligence , reports that in the weeks before the October crisis erupted , a Cuban terrorist group operating from Florida with US government authorization carried out " a daring speedboat strafing attack on a Cuban seaside hotel near Havana where Soviet military technicians were known to congregate , killing a score of Russians and Cubans . " And shortly after , he continues , the terrorist forces attacked British and Cuban cargo ships and again raided Cuba , among other actions that were stepped up in early October . At a tense moment of the still-unresolved missile crisis , on November 8 , a terrorist team dispatched from the United States blew up a Cuban industrial facility after the Mongoose operations had been officially suspended . Fidel Castro alleged that 400 workers had been killed in this operation , guided by " photographs taken by spying planes . " Attempts to assassinate Castro and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were escalated again in later years . <p> There has been some notice of one rather minor part of the terror war , the many attempts to assassinate Castro , generally dismissed as childish CIA shenanigans . Apart from that , none of what happened has elicited much interest or commentary . The first serious English-language inquiry into the impact on Cubans was published in 2010 by Canadian researcher Keith Bolender , in his Voices From The Other Side : An Oral History Of Terrorism Against Cuba , a very valuable study largely ignored . <p> The three examples highlighted in the New York Times report of US terrorism are only the tip of the iceberg . Nevertheless , it is useful to have this prominent acknowledgment of Washington 's dedication to murderous and destructive terror operations and of the insignificance of all of this to the political class , which accepts it as normal and proper that the US should be a terrorist superpower , immune to law and civilized norms . <p> Oddly , the world may not agree .
