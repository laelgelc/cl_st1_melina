@@114236 <p> To celebrate the 50 year milestone of the James Bond film franchise , legendary singer Shirley Bassey was invited to perform " Goldfinger " at the 2013 Academy Awards . Shirley Bassey is credited with some of the most recognizable and identifiable theme songs attributed to the Bond films : " Diamonds are Forever " , " Moonraker , " and " Goldfinger . " These theme songs have become classics and will forever be associated with James Bond . <p> At the recently concluded 85th Academy Awards , the 76-year old Welsh singer gave a most amazing and riveting performance of " Goldfinger " that was met with an equally deserved standing ovation . Her advanced age did n't affect her performance because it obviously shows that she has gone to great lengths to take care of her voice and to preserve those " powerful pipes . " <p> To have Shirley Bassey perform one of the all-time great theme songs of any Hollywood movie -- and not only of the James Bond film franchise -- was indeed appropriate and befitting for such a prestigious event like the Academy Awards . It also felt a little surreal to actually see her perform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time I was n't sure who sang them but I , however , immediately knew when I would hear those songs , it was from James Bond movies . Her performance that night was certainly a definite treat for anyone lucky enough to have been in attendance at the Academy Awards and for televiewers like myself who never got to see her perform at the peak of her career . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Shirley Bassey 's voice sounded whole and the intonation was still there . Clearly , she was even a better performer back then in the prime of her career . Imagine that ? But when you are speaking from the standpoint of this time and with the backdrop of the kind of singers we have now , honestly , compared to a lot of the other younger singers who also performed that night , her number was the best . <p> If she was that good at 76-years old , what more when she was younger ? It really got me interested to do a little digging and researching to see the differences between her performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous performances of that song in the past decades . <p> I found them to be practically the same . In my opinion , a lot of singers who were present that night were taking mental notes and keenly observing the performance of Shirley Bassey . The fact is that she performed better than all of them did . <p> Sometimes , it really does n't matter how old you are and whether you are up there in age already . There are a few things that you ca n't gain/acquire without years -- and what more decades -- spent in a profession . These are the experience , knowledge , and finesse that Shirley Bassey displayed that night . <p> I bet not a few people thought she did n't have it anymore or that she did n't have the " lung power " to belt out those high notes . However , when she did her signature rising crescendo at the end of her performance of " Goldfinger " , that impressive showing silenced the critics and wow'ed the audience on hand . <p> It was the icing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed why Shirley Bassey 's voice has become so synonymous with the James Bond films . People still remember those theme songs she sang . That is proof of the impact these songs have made in popular culture -- that to this very day -- these songs are still remembered fondly . That night Shirley Bassey looked like a real winner to me.

Rappler comes from the root words " rap " ( to discuss ) + " ripple " ( to make waves ) . <h> Is PH ready for liftoff ? <p> MANILA , Philippines - Decades since the space race between the United States and the Soviet Union began , humans have come a long way in exploring and harnessing space . <p> The Curiosity has landed on Mars ; several space probes are whizzing past planets on their way out of the solar system ; and dozens upon dozens of satellites are currently orbiting our planet , facilitating faster communications , monitoring our weather , and doing much more . <p> Countries around the world are joining the race to tap space science and technology , and many consider it as a top priority in their research and development . Filipinos , however , feel that the country is left on the sidelines as our neighbors launch satellites and engage in various space-related projects . <p> This begs the question : does the Philippines need its own space program ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of , that has rockets being launched , or sending people to the moon , " said Dr Alfredo Mahar Lagmay , head of the National Operational Assessment of Hazards ( NOAH ) . <p> Space science is n't just about sending vehicles , probes , or people to space . Around the world , various countries have established space agencies and programs that do a variety of work , from astronomy to disasters , from telecommunications to education . <p> Closer to home , Southeast Asian countries such as Indonesia , Thailand , Malaysia , and even tiny Singapore have their own programs , with work ranging from meteorological research , to remote imaging and sensing . <p> The Philippines is n't really " behind " in this field ; we currently have a handful of programs and agencies involved in space science , research , and technology . <p> These include the state weather bureau PAGASA , which handles astronomical science ; the National Mapping &amp; Resource Information Agency ( NAMRIA ) ; and even the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council ( NDRRMC ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the functions of a space agency are scattered across the government bureaucracy , so the problem is there is no clear , definite plan or agenda for the Philippines as a whole , " said Dr Rogel Mari Sese , an astrophysicist at the University of the Philippines in Los Ba ? os . <p> A single , inclusive program or agency would help unite these and streamline projects , than to simply invest in the existing ones . <p> " There are existing government and private agencies , whose resources can be pooled or consolidated through a congressional action , " according to Dr Bernardo Soriano , former chief of the Atmospheric , Geophysical and Space Sciences Branch of the PAGASA .. <p> Last December , a bill was filed in the House of Representatives that seeks to establish the country 's own space program - House Bill 6725 , or the Philippine Space Act of 2012 ( see full text below ) , filed by Agham Partylist Rep. Angelo Palmones . <p> Earlier efforts to have one agency for space science have fizzled due to various reasons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 , when Soriano submitted an Astronomy Road Map to the PAGASA . It did not prosper because it was not a priority area for the agency then , he said . <p> It would be " utilitarian , practical and suited for a developing nation , " said Dr Custer Deocaris , a DOST Balik Scientist , a professor of astrobiology at Rizal Technological University , and one of the proponents of HB 6725 . <p> Starting them young <p> If the country does decide to have a unified and institutionalized space program , two questions will inevitably follow : Can we afford it ? And will we be able to sustain it ? <p> The Philippines only has a handful of scientists , engineers and technocrats who understand space science . To ensure that there will be people who will run the program , the country should have a strong training/re-training system for local scientists , and find a way to encourage Filipino scientists based abroad to go back home . <p> " A lot of Filipino scientists who abroad are waiting for change to happen . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Rappler . <p> The best way to have a corps of competent scientists and engineers , however , is to start early - and this means investments in science , technology , engineering , and mathematics education . <p> Science education in all levels - from elementary to post-graduate - should be strengthened to encourage more students to take up science and engineering careers . Starting them young is key , both Sese and Palmones said . <p> Various major universities already have existing research in space-related subjects such as astrophysics , and the country recently had its very first Astronomy program , based at the Rizal Technological University . These should be developed to become at par with other established programs around the world , and investments in facilities and human capital will be needed . <p> " Unless we start developing the youth 's interest in science and mathematics , then it wo n't change , " the Agham Partylist representative said . <p> To have a sustainable space program , education is key , says Sese . RAPPLER/KD Suarez <p> " It has to be sustainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency or space program , is to train the people , to educate the people who will be part of these units , " Sese said . <p> If established , the program or agency could initially focus on disaster science and telecommunications , both urgently needed in the country , suggested Soriano . <p> " The space agency can design and develop several low-altitude remote sensing and communications satellites for natural hazards/risk monitoring and disaster management activities , " he said . <p> Ideally , the agency should be up and running in 3 to 5 years from establishment , but both Palmones and Sese said a realistic timeline would be at least 10 years , taking into account training people , organizing the bureaucracy , and streamlining plans . <p> Public , private support <p> House Bill 6725 calls for at least P500 million to put up the agency , but operating it would certainly need more than that - and the private sector will have a role to play . <p> It calls for public-private partnerships to help fund the program . " PPP will make possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country 's essential space infrastructure , " said Deocaris . <p> But in the long run , he said , the agency will be " self-sustaining and revenue-generating . " <p> Industries who rely on space technology , such as broadcasters and telecommunications companies , will stand to reap the benefits of a space program , said Palmones , so he sees their involvement crucial . <p> " We have to bring them in , and make them stakeholders of this , " he said . <p> Lagmay , however , thinks that the initiative should really come from the top levels of government . <p> " Just like in any program , like Project NOAH , the command must come from the top . It must come from the top . There must be a policy in that direction to support having a space agency , to support using all these advanced science and technology ... for pushing for developmental gains , " he said . <p> The latest push for a space program has hit a snag : HB 6725 was filed as Congress drew to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to re-file the bill in the next Congress , and find support for it among lawmakers , both at the House and the Senate . <p> He said Agham is already working with the Congressional Commission on Science , Technology and Engineering ( COMSTE ) , so that the measure will be included in the priority bills of the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council ( LEDAC ) . <p> " Medyo matagal ang development nito . We have to start somewhere -- and we have to start now , " he said . " It will be a product of hard work : it is hard , but it will work . " <p> ( Development will take some time . We have to start somewhere -- and we have to start now . ) <p> Skeptics will shrug off the idea of a Filipino space program as a pipe dream - should n't the government focus instead on more important things , such as poverty alleviation ? <p> " You might think that cost be used for poverty alleviation projects , but in itself , its a poverty alleviation project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered a waste of money , should not be considered as a cost , but should be considered as an investment , because in the long run , its the tools that we need for development , for progress , " said Lagmay . <p> " When we reduce significant yearly losses due to disasters , the amount that should have been lost will contribute to the creation of more wealth for our country , " added Soriano . <p> Inevitable part of PH 's future <p> Even if a bill establishing the agency is n't passed now , a space program or agency will be an inevitable part of the country 's future . <p> " We 're actually moving in that direction . We 're trying to pursue the use of such technologies for our benefit , " Lagmay said . " It 's the way to go also , because our neighbors in the region have space agencies - not necessarily sending people to the moon , but they are using space technology , which is a big part of what constitutes a space agency . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOAH , the command must come from the top . It must come from the top . There must be a policy in that direction to support having a space agency , to support using all these advanced science and technology ... for pushing for developmental gains , " said Lagmay . <p> A Filipino space program will be hard work , says Palmones : " It will be hard , but it will work .

It is now enriching uranium to a level only a step away from weapons-grade . <p> The United States and its allies worry about the plutonium reactor at Arak , southwest of Tehran . U.S. envoy Joseph Macmanus told a recent meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency -- the U.N . nuclear watchdog -- that the reactor is " of increasing concern " as its startup date approaches . Israel , which has taken a lead in criticizing Iran 's nuclear program , is even more concerned . <p> During a visit by President Barack Obama this week , Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was expected to push for a U.S. commitment not to let Iran develop nuclear arms .

Read on . <p> Given how many players have taken their share of the spotlight this past conference , it 's little surprise that fans are clamoring for Gilas Pilipinas coach Chot Reyes to consider adding players to the relatively modest national pool . <p> Context : <p> * Most of the other national pools in FIBA Asia have at least 20 players listed . Jordan 's current pool has 20 ( with a new naturalized player in the pipeline ) , ditto with Japan , while South Korea and China each has 24 . Iran , I believe , has close to 30 ! <p> * The Gilas pool , which started with 17 players , has dwindled to 15 mainly because of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonny Thoss has been present in practices , but he has n't participated and he will miss the Lithuania training camp to boot . And if reports are true , he has been ruled out of the FIBA Asia due to team commitments . <p> * Several PBA players did well in the PBA Selection 's exhibition games against Gilas and the Shanghai Sharks , while some have accounted for themselves really well in the recent Commissioner 's Cup playoffs . In particular , KG Canaleta , Arwind Santos , Calvin Abueva and JVee Casio have shone brightly . <p> * Marcus Douthit is now 33 years old . This may well be his last tour of duty in the FIBA Asia tournament . Given his age and the expected wear and tear , it 's not a stretch if he gets a new injury as Gilas prepares for the Big Dance . I feel it prudent for the team to lobby for a backup naturalized player . Some strong candidates could be Denzel Bowles , Mike Dunigan or even Eric Dawson . <p> The big question , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially given the fact that Gilas already has a cadet pool in place ? <p> Now , despite the depth of that set of players , the truth is a lot of other guys who are good enough to be in the national pool are n't there , especially once-a-generation talents like Kiefer Ravena and Ray Parks , or future bigs like Isaac Holstein , Ian Sangalang , and even Raymond Almazan . <p> Photo by PBA Images/Nuki Sabio . <p> My take is even if these guys have no shot of making the final cut , at least bringing them to practices or scrimmages will help them improve and be exposed to the international brand of play . This is the reason many of the top teams in the continent like Iran , China , and South Korea have at least a sprinkling of really young talent in their own pools . <p> Right off the bat , Iran has Behnam Yakhchali and Mohammad Jamshidi , China has Wang Zhelin and Guo Ailun , while SoKor has Lee Jong-Hyun and Kim Jong-Kyu ( and a LOT MORE ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries ' respective pro leagues or still playing in college . <p> The strange thing is we actually have a similar system in place .

And since the superhero 's leap from page to screen , audiences have generally anticipated whether the adaptations , especially the theatrical ones , would do justice to the man of justice . <p> In other words , just as everyone wants Superman to succeed despite the odds , you 'd likewise want every Superman director to succeed in bringing the comic book hero to big screen life . The catch is , given the diversity of audiences , such success can be relative . <p> The latest case in point is the 2013 movie about the dude in the blue tights and red cape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a bane ? An initial viewing of the 144-minute movie suggests that " Man of Steel " helmer Zack Snyder made his latest , Warner Bros . Pictures-sanctioned caper into a big film with a little of everything . <p> KNEELING OPTIONAL . The ever angry-eyed Michael Shannon as the new General Zod is a compelling cinematic descendant of Terence ' Kneel before Zod ' Stamp <p> Being an origin movie , it ca n't help but bear elements of the costumed hero 's silver-screen debut , 1978 's " Superman : The Movie " -- from baby Kal-El 's ( and would-be Superman 's ) exit from his dying home planet Krypton to his entry into and growth as Clark Kent in his adaptive planet Earth ; from many of the expected supporting characters to even a few not-so-subtle , modern-day product placements . <p> Yet , as scripted by David S. Goyer -- based on a story by Goyer and his " Dark Knight " cohort-director Christopher Nolan -- " Man of Steel " also took pains to steer clear of the familiar traits of its predecessors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story points ( e.g. , Krypton 's explosion is now a cautionary tale for us dwellers of Planet Climate Change ) . <p> Snyder and company also made sure that their new millennium Supes has none of the silliness and datedness of that otherwise superb ' 78 classic or 1980 's exhilarating " Superman II . " Instead , they 've accentuated the drama of quieter moments and ratcheted the action of the brawny sequences . And thanks to computer-generated imagery ( CGI ) , there are also visual , if unoriginal , innovations galore , including a portable , floating contraption that Kryptonians can talk to ( like an advanced Siri ) and a " genesis chamber " where infant , capsule-confined Kryptonians ' future professions get predetermined ( reminiscent of the fields of humans in " The Matrix " ) . <p> As with many a recent superhero flick or a Nolan-involving venture , " Man of Steel 's " general tone is one of earnestness and seriousness , buoyed by a sense of realism that makes the imagined proceedings even more vivid , plausible . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the birth of Kal-El , labor pains and all , and down the line with much of the young Clark Kent scenes and even with the toned-down Superman moments . <p> But Snyder appears to have had a bigger aim : all-encompassing , segmented entertainment . One moment , " Man of Steel " means to please parents , then it 's the teens ' turn , then it 's for the comic-book/superhero devotees -- all in the spirit of mirroring how Superman is everyone 's hero and can be counted on to carry the weight of all types of Earth people . <p> The film is also crammed with countless details and talking points -- such as the casting coup for the lead roles and the fleeting " Lexcorp " detail during the climax -- that part of the filmmakers ' plan must have been to incite weeklong discussions among friends or family , if not to instigate clarifying repeat viewings . <p> Yet on top of all that , for better or ill , Snyder , in his apparent mission of coming up with the Superman movie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to have had an even bigger , 4D ( not just 3D ) scheme : He wants viewers to feel what it 's like to be the invincible big guy himself . <p> To wit : the camera work , credited chiefly to cinematographer Amir Mokri , utilizes sudden zoom-ins to the hilt , as if to mimic for us Superman 's super vision . There 's the thunderous ( yet ultimately unmemorable ) musical score by Hans Zimmer , which seems to depict for us the hero 's super hearing . There are also the special effects showing upside down and sideways angles , and that Superman 's propensity for hyperspeed flight , to further show what it 's like to have his wingless capacity to fly . <p> In other words , " Man of Steel " is just as pumped-up as its chief protagonist , to a noticeable fault . Even the narrative structure is adrenalized , eschewing linear storytelling by bouncing from the present to the flashbacks of the hero 's past and back ( not necessarily a bad thing , admittedly , since memories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even in the quieter , hushed scenes , the camera is never still , perennially in handheld mode as if to perpetually generate false tension . <p> But perhaps " Man of Steel 's " biggest woe is that , in providing one " Whoa " moment after another , Snyder and cohorts opted to rely heavily on CGI , contemporary Hollywood 's equivalent of steroids . <p> Some 80% of the entire movie must have had digital effects of varying sorts and amounts , and some of it helps . Yet for the most part , it 's just overkill , especially during the battle sequences involving wanton destruction of buildings and other infrastructure and in the inevitable brawl between Superman and the movie 's chief villain , his fellow Krypton-born General Zod . In these largely interminable scenes , the movie ends up being unsympathetic , impersonal , making the film 's more genuine , intimate moments come off as mere afterthoughts . <p> That 's too bad since , minus its surplus of fakery , " Man of Steel " has several shining moments of ingenuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ al . managed to show that , while Kryptonians may be superior in many ways to Earthlings , human beings are far from being passive , helpless weaklings . It also boasts of the long-publicized , unique sight of Superman arrested and handcuffed . <p> Also nifty is the concept of illustrating how overwhelming Superman 's ( and Zod 's ) super vision can be if uncontrolled . And the scenes featuring Kevin Costner and/or Diane Lane as Kal-El 's adoptive parents are particularly affecting , such as that **41;1177;TOOLONG dialogue involving Lane and a " You are my son " moment by Costner that feels like an advanced Father 's Day gift to all the world 's dads . <p> Such moments of unadorned realness , however , are rather few in what is a heavily , deliberately kinetic motion picture . <p> Here is a trailer for ' Man of Steel ' : <p> All told , is " Man of Steel " worth the bother ? <p> It is certainly not a complete letdown and does not lack entertainment value . <p> But I suspect many would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in other handlers ' hands ( here 's looking at you , Sam Raimi ) , or with less of unreal CGI and more of a human touch . -Rappler.com <p> ' Man of Steel ' , rated PG by the MTRCB , is now showing across the Philippines in regular 2D and 3D theaters as well as a 3D release in IMAX theaters . <h> Would you like to share your vote ? <p> Welcome to Rappler , a social news network where stories inspire community engagement and digitally fuelled actions for social change .

Cesar Apolinario in the ' Dance of the Steel Bars ' shoot in Cebu <p> Apolinario deserves praise for timing his film with " Man of Steel , " thus risking its obscurity before that icon of cultural imperialism from the planet Krypton . And " Steel Bars " was handicapped not only by Superman 's omnipresence in the theaters but also by the fact that not all SM cinemas showed this movie , as SM 's corporate empire should be obliged to . <p> At SM Megamall , the crowds that had gathered outside its cinemas might have evoked the fiesta spirit of the Manila Film Festival during its heyday in 1960s downtown Manila -- a captivating milieu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joaquin and Pete Lacaba dutifully recorded in their reportage on Pinoy pop culture and that would be recreated later on by the cinema of Wong Kar-Wai . <p> But inside Cinema 6 , which showed Apolinario 's film , one is confronted by the chilling reality -- because it was cold in this sparsely occupied theater -- that time has turned over to its current tide , that nostalgia is denial of the present , and that the crowd one saw outside the Megamall theaters was actually queuing for " Man of Steel . " <p> Watch the ' Dance of the Steel Bars ' trailer here : <p> This is the same Megamall that screened Fellini 's " 8 ? " and Hitchcock 's " Rear Window " to SRO crowds in the late ' 80s . We 're talking about cinema relics as they were re-shown 30-plus years ago . <p> Apolinario 's second feature can be regarded as an affirmation of heritage , that of Philippine cinema . Beholding the film 's exposition of life in the Cebu Provincial Detention and Rehabilitation Center , one is reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory -- wherein the outsider holds his individuality and his dignity amid the dehumanizing confines of prison , and its extension that is Philippine society . <p> Yet for all its filth and insidious atmosphere of violence , there is nothing in this picture that is as harrowing as the prison life one sees in Mario O'Hara 's " Bulaklak sa City Jail , " or in the grueling finale of Marilou Diaz Abaya 's " Alyas Baby Tsina . " <p> The solitary confinement endured , in one interlude , by Dingdong Dantes , Patrick Bergin and Joey Paras could have echoed the grimy horror of such detention as portrayed in " Baby Tsina , " to which its heroine ( Vilma Santos ) responds with a quiet , defiant fortitude -- yet another striking facet of her long career with its comprehensive portrayal of the modern Filipina . <p> MANDO .

Here , he plays an American ( going by his accent ) serving his sentence for a falsely accused crime . It 's an earnest performance yet also rather too relaxed , as if one were watching Hunter Thompson on a vacation in our penal system . <p> This viewer , at least , would have also wished that Bergin had been allowed instead to play the Irishman that he really is , considering the natural affinity with the Filipino people among the few Irish ( mostly from the Catholic clergy ) who have made the Philippines their home , even mastering the language of their adopted community . <p> The aura of menace that one gleans from Bergin 's finest work in Hollywood is missing in this film , or rather assumed instead by Dantes -- who , like Piolo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christopher de Leon School of Acting , especially de Leon 's impeccable work during the ' 70s and ' 80s . <p> Watch behind the scenes clips and interviews with the cast here : <p> The complexity of a good heart impeded by stupid human impulses is plain to see in Dantes ' role , as a man sent to prison for literally bashing a gay admirer , conflicted by the machismo " values " of his father and the feminine nurturing of his mother from whom he developed his terpsichorean talent . What a problematic material , this part -- yet it 's made somehow believable by Dantes , and by the visual scheme of the movie itself . <p> That montage of Dantes ' childhood to his tortured adulthood , for one , is truly worthy of the Jarlego family of film editors . The graffiti surrounding Bergin 's cell is another visual masterpiece , so expressive that one suspects it was really rendered by an artist . So are the prison courtyard scenes , which are lively to the point of recalling " Bagets , " Maryo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davao ( as the reformist warden ) in shades evokes Gangnam Style . The hip-hop score is a sound painting by itself . <p> Then there 's Dantes ' tango number with Jon Paras ( the flamboyant gay in this prison ) , which is a rom-com moment in an otherwise earnest film and the closest approximate to Dantes endeavoring a gay role . <p> These facets I single out , not to deride them at all , but to amplify the critic 's role , his extended participation in the creative process . For as a critic writes his appreciation , he is actually carrying on the creative life of an art work , this film in particular . <p> Criticism should never be guided by fault-finding but should function primarily as another department of the work in question . In the spirit of Shaw , all creative expression is valid , as any critic will find , who can also act , or make a movie or write a poem or play the violin . I play the piano a little , by the way . What I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all told -- until Gwendolyn Garcia 's sudden-as-to-be-grand entrance , and in one stroke reforming Cebu 's prison system by her mere presence . <p> One can take the standard view that this film becomes a disaster at this point , as it slides into sly propaganda , evidently to acknowledge the Cebu governor 's hospitality to this project . <p> Yet one can also take the more enlightened appreciation , again , that the film properly ends at this point .

After all , how do you retell the tale of the Kryptonian immigrant without drawing unfair but unavoidable comparisons to Christopher Reeve 's definitive portrayal in Richard Donner 's 1978 blockbuster ? <p> Russell Crowe and Kevin Costner are movie icons in their own right -- but , in the eyes of those who 've seen Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman effortlessly chew up the scenery in those early " Superman " flicks , it would be difficult to measure up to expectations built around those celebrated actors ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ template of the superhero movie has been set up by Marvel 's inventive movie-making machinery : By casting fine actors like Robert Downey Jr. , Chris Evans and Mark Ruffalo in cleverly concocted " origins " stories , Marvel has turned erstwhile second-tier characters like Iron Man and Captain America into formidable box-office sensations . Their unique combination of winking camp and substance are a perfect antidote for the doom and gloom of the current world order . <p> At the opposite end of the spectrum is Christopher Nolan , who ingeniously turned Batman 's tale into a " relatable " Shakespearean saga . But , the success of The Dark Knight franchise is harder to duplicate -- especially because it is n't in Clark Kent 's nature to constantly brood about the woes of the world . He usually irons out psychic kinks with a smile -- the way Christopher Reeve waved and smiled after saving a helpless kitten on a tree . <p> Following the implosion of Krypton , " Man of Steel " hews close to the story of Kal-El aka Clark Kent after his parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , send him to earth -- where he 's raised by Jonathan and Martha Kent , portrayed by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane , who are both outstanding in their roles . <p> To keep their only son safe from intrusive and probing humans , Jonathan compels Clark to keep his real identity -- and emerging powers -- secret , even if it means getting bullied by his peers . <p> After Clark saves a busload of drowning schoolmates , Jonathan reprimands his son for " exposing " himself to scrutiny . He reasons , " People are afraid of what they do n't understand . " But , even as a child , Clark knows what 's right and wrong : " So , do I just let them die ? " <p> Blueprint <p> Meanwhile , General Zod ( Michael Shannon ) and his genetically conditioned soldiers escape Krypton 's Phantom Zone and go after Jor-El 's son , who holds the blueprint for the new world they intend to build on the blue planet , at the expense of its powerless inhabitants ! <p> With bullies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder why there 's little for Clark to smile about . This is also what drives the " serious " tone of the movie -- an existentialist ploy that later explains why Superman is instantly drawn to Lois Lane ( Amy Adams ) and her line of work . <p> The stubborn reporter from The Daily Planet inspires Clark to lighten up and smile , especially after his mano-a-mano with Zod reduces a good portion of Smallville and Metropolis to rubble . Much of " Man of Steel 's " humor is dished out only after Superman finally comes to grips with his reason for being . <p> If you crave for the easy chuckles and cheeky asides that pepper " Iron Man " and " The Avengers , " you wo n't find them in " Man of Steel . " -- But , if you want a film that takes its protagonist 's woes seriously without ramming them down viewers ' throats ( as the underrated " Superman Returns " did ) , this is the movie to see ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Photo by Rappler <p> MANILA , Philippines -- If Gary Granada only knew how , he would have taken up arms instead of singing songs . <p> Then his many small-scale masterworks like " Bahay , " " Kanluran " and the more recent , also poignant and resonant " Minsa'y Isang Bansa " would have been sorely missing in the rich repertoire of Filipino music . <p> These songs capture the contemporary Filipino experience in their gritty reality alongside the specter of our country 's lost classical heritage . Because Granada 's songs are modern incarnations of the harana and the kundiman . <p> As an artist and activist , Granada was led at last , in his soul-searching artistic process , towards the path of music . This was and remains his contribution to the earnest struggle of his countrymen 's empowerment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal for everybody , " the singer-songwriter told Rappler 's Maria Ressa on #TalkThursday last June 13 .

" <p> His internal process , or the revolution he fought in his heart and mind , convinced him of the vital role of each fellowman in our collective struggle to better our lives . <p> " Even if you 're not as strong , even if you 're not as fit as the others , you are entitled to some sufficient provision to actually have a meaningful and productive life .

Rizal was guided by this insight , as were Amado Hernandez and many others in the long and continuing narrative of the Philippine arts . <p> Progressive folk <p> Indeed , Granada 's songs mirror the prevailing social reality that ordinary Filipinos have known for generations . <p> " Bahay , " which has become something of a standard in progressive folk , is ostensibly about a house in a dumping site , but serves as an eloquent commentary on the white elephants that have become our country 's institutions . <p> " It 's not that you see a lot of people in despair , but you see our institutions really not helping out , " he explained . " It begs the question : Why ? What is it with your society that your institutions can not quite respond to it in an adequate and meaningful way ? It 's because the society is set up in such a way that the control of resources is not in the hands of these social institutions , but of a few families and individuals . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see that .

" <p> Nationalism <p> Explaining his song " Kanluran , " Granada offers his understanding of nationalism and independence . <p> " I think we need to get beyond our nominal concept of nationalism . Nationalism is not about national identity . Nationalism is important because it is a basis for actually establishing social justice ....

He made his mark in the financial world , and was later appointed dean of the UP College of Business Administration ( CBA ) . He transformed that college into a highly regarded component of UP . <p> But Marcos had other designs .

( Recently , the Marcos offshore wealth was estimated at $5-10 billion , with 6.3 metric tons of gold . ) <p> Where was Virata during this period ? He was a servile technocrat : secretary of finance , prime minister , and chief negotiator for loans from international multilateral financial institutions . This gave him special access to all government financial and banking institutions and big-business transactions and negotiations , and perhaps also to security and military matters .

But let 's look under the hood of this virtuous man after whom the UP CBA has been named . <p> Beneath the appearance was probably a deeper motive ( i.e. , extreme protectiveness of his reputation ) .

I believe this can not be achieved by simply revising or amending Rule 1 , Section 32 , of the Revised Rules on Evidence , requiring that the " examination of witnesses presented in a trial or hearing shall be in open court xxx and the answer shall be given orally . " Efforts toward this end must be exercised with great caution , lest we sacrifice due process for haste . <p> Litigations do not end in trial , but in their resolution . Fast-tracking trials do not necessarily result in fast-tracking their resolutions .

But , why should I ? <p> I boycotted the May 13 election because I could no longer take part in the perpetuation of sham democracy . I never voted in barangay elections for similar reason but I 'm not going to discuss that here . <p> I had never missed voting in a national or midterm elections since I registered in 1946 . In the 1930s , even when I was too young to vote , I had been an interested observer of elections . The electoral system then was " crude " compared to that of today . Then violence , cheating and other forms of irregularities and corruptions were real news ; today , they are regular features , much more so it seems with computerization -- so much perfected as an art and abetted by the rule of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sham democracy to continue voting ? <p> Suffrage <p> The only qualifications for suffrage or the right to vote are Filipino citizenship , age and residence . Unless " otherwisedisqualified by law , " all Filipinos possessing those three qualifications are qualified to vote . Disqualifications are very rare . This has come to be after electoral reforms during 78 years since 1935 . <p> Under the 1935 Constitution , suffrage was limited to 21-year-old male citizens . This had been so in elections under the American rule before 1935 . Very macho democracy ! However , a provision in the Constitution called for a plebiscite in 1937 to " extend the right of suffrage to women " should " not less than three hundred thousand women possessing the necessary qualifications " vote " YES . " No problem , suffrage granted ! <p> Much later , the voting age was lowered to 18 . The 1987 Constitution provided absentee voting to allow Filipinos working abroad to vote through the Philippine consulates . <p> As explicitly provided in the 1972 and 1987 Constitutions -- " No literacy , property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of suffrage " -- the illiterates and physically disabled were allowed to vote . Until a specific law was enacted , the Commission on Elections devised a system to secure " the secrecy and sanctity of the vote " for the disabled and illiterates enabling them to vote assisted by the Board of Election Inspectors or by assistors of their own choice or appointed by the BEI . <p> On February 15 , 2013 , President Benigno Simeon C. Aquino III signed RA 10366 mandating the Commission on Elections to " design systems and procedures that will enable persons with disabilities and senior citizens to register and vote by themselves " in time for the May 13 election . Also a first under Aquino III , inmates voted last May 13 despite the temporary disenfranchisement of persons convicted of crimes . Commission on Elections Resolution No. 9371 specifies five categories of inmates or detainees still " entitled to vote . " <p> The Philippines must be among the democratic countries extending the broadest right of suffrage to its citizens . This is genuine -- not sham -- democracy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has nothing to do with suffrage . <p> Sham Party System <p> On putting the Philippines under martial law , President Ferdinand E. Marcos formed the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan ( KBL or Movement of New Society ) as the martial law regime 's political arm . This effectively killed the two-party system with a third-party alternative even if the existing political parties were not decreed abolished . <p> Most in the Nacionalista Party -- Marcos being the party titular head -- joined the KBL . And so did the Liberal Party members who gladly accepted Marcos ' invitation . Those who defied Marcos either fled the country , went underground , lay low or were detained . However , in the three national elections held during the 14-year dictatorship , regional and national parties -- including the skeletal resurrection of the NP and LP -- were allowed to oppose the KBL to show the world that democracy was robust , not dead . <p> Regional and new national parties fielded candidates for the Batasan Pambansa ( National Assembly ) election in 1978 . The token NP fielded a token candidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ KBL and President Marcos in the January 16 , 1981 presidential election . Winning by16 million votes , Marcos " lifted " martial law on the following day . In the February 7 , 1986 snap presidential election , eight political parties and groups coalesced into the UNIDO ( United Nationalist Democratic Organization ) to field Corazon C. Aquino against Marcos and the KBL . <p> Marcos nurtured sham democratic elections as democratic mask of his dictatorship . But in a different fashion the sham ingenuously continued after Marcos . <p> Multi-Party System <p> The 1987 Constitution did not revive the two-party system . Instead , it wrote the final death sentence of the two-party system by enshrining the multi-party system together with the party-list system . Ironically , the two are good features of electoral democracy ; but abused , they have become tools of sham election in the name of democracy . <p> In the Philippine two-party system , there were two major parties and one or two third minor parties that really did not matter much in the electorate 's choices of candidates . Both the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they had party platforms embodying their principles and program of government . All candidates , chosen in party conventions or caucuses , subscribed to the party platforms as the parties were committed to make them win . <p> As it has come out to be , in the Philippine multi-party system , any political leader -- or anyone pretending to political leadership ? -- can form a party as the vehicle of his or her political ambition -- particularly , presidential . Some of the parties have national directorate but no provincial chapters . Others are without any proper organization . In this case , the party dies when the organizer quits politics or none in his or her family can carry on the party . <p> In the Philippine multi-party system thrive sham political parties ; the system has become a tool of sham democratic election . <p> Coalition System <p> Countries with parliamentary form of government have multi-party system . It usually happens that in a general election , no party wins a majority . To form a government , the party with the biggest plurality invites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its personality . At any time , any of the parties can leave the coalition . Should the coalition break up and the prime minister fails to form a new government , a new election is called . In any case , the coalition happens after the election . <p> In countries with popularly elected presidents under a multi-party system , if in the first election no candidate gets the 50 percent plus majority in the first election , a run-off election or second balloting is held between the two leading candidates . In this way , the president has the mandate of the majority ; his government represents the majority . <p> A prime tenet of democracy is the majority rules . This must be true of either the parliamentary or presidential form of government . <p> The 1987 Constitution does not provide for run-off election . A Philippine president can win by mere plurality ( President Fidel V. Ramos , the first president elected in 1992 under the 1987 Constitution , won with 5,342,621 votes or by a 23.58 percent plurality and his party won 14 seats in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of seats in the Congress . Should such happen , the president -- as Ramos did -- would use his or her vast powers to have a coalition formed in the Congress led by his party in order to secure for his or her government legislative support . <p> All other presidents after Ramos did the same . Through the coalition , the presidents ' parties eventually became dominant parties . This post-election coalition is driven by the parties ' common motive to remain in and with power at all cost . Demanded by political necessity , this is not the type of coalition to be deplored . <p> What then is that type ? <p> The practice now in the Philippines is for so-called political parties to coalesce for the election . Evidently , the purpose is not to win a majority mandate for the coalition to have a government by the majority , of the majority , for the majority . As an ad hoc political " party " principally formed to win , the coalition breaks up becoming a non-entity after the election . The winning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respective parties espousing their individual interests -- even joining rival blocs . <p> This pre-election coalition is not for the establishment a " government of the people , by the people , for the people " but a government of the powerful , by the powerful , for the powerful at the sacrifice of the people -- those in power will always invoke the people as the reason for their being in power . Call that democratic election ? <p> The state of the country is the proof of the curse of sham democratic elections . <p> Constitution Trivialized <p> The 1987 Constitution provides as a state policy ( Article II , Section 26 ) : " The State shall guarantee equal access to opportunities to public service , and prohibit political dynasty as may be defined by law . " Elective positions are means of public service and should not be monopolized in perpetuity by powerful families and clans . <p> To complement this provision , the 1987 Constitution limits elective local officials and members of the House of Representatives to three three-year consecutive terms ; the members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms ; and the President to one six-year term without reelection . <p> While the merits of these provisions are debatable , their laudable objectives to enhance democracy are not to be trivialized . Yet , instead of enacting enabling laws to promote the laudable objectives , the powers in Congress never passed the required anti-dynasty law and interpreted the term limits to perpetuate their hold to power . <p> There have been anti-dynasty bills filed . But the Congress has always been dominated by members of political dynasties . According to a survey ( See : Wikipedia ) , in the 14th Congress ( 2007 to 2010 ) , " more that 75% of the lawmakers are members of the old political families " or political dynasties . And , new political dynasties have emerged . The members of the Congress are not fools to enact a law against their vested interests . <p> If the intention of the Constitution were to be adhered to , the term limits should mean " three three-year consecutive terms only " or " two six-year consecutive terms only " . But " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the latter meaning , a politician can occupy a position -- example , of the mayor -- for life as long as after each segment of three consecutive terms he or she skips one election and , after that , runs again for a new segment .

Members of the same family or clan are elected in different positions -- say , the husband as governor and the wife as representative to the Congress .

But the opposite had emerged : a government of the powerful few , by the powerful few and for the powerful few . The ruling powers trumpet to the world the opposition votes as proof of democratic elections in the Philippines . They suit laws to their interests and foist government as according to law . <p> The Corazon C.

But the Supreme Court ruled against orders of the Commission disqualifying some party lists and shortening time limits of election propaganda in the national televisions . <p> Adoring electorate : A significant majority -- if not most -- of Filipino voters are fans of popular candidates or blind , fanatical followers of political dynasties taking much pride in identifying themselves with their idols -- easy to please , easy to entertain , their hopes everrenewed by ever repeated false promises , short in memory .

@@362230 <h> A PROUD SUPPORTER OF : <h> Monday , July 1 , 2013 <p> Ethiopian Airlines is making some last minute changes to its previously announced Asian expansion by dropping its services to Manila and Ho Chi Minh in favour of a route to Singapore . <p> Ethiopian Airlines was set to begin a service between Addis Ababa and Manila via Hong Kong on July 2 , 2013 using a Boeing 767-300ER aircraft . Although no official reason was given for the scheduling adjustment , it is quite likely that the decision was due to the lack of fifth freedom rights between Hong Kong and the Philippines . <p> Image Source : Ethiopian Airlines <p> Fifth freedom rights enable a foreign carrier to pick up passengers in another country and then carry them onwards to a third country . Singapore and Thailand have been successful in attracting many African carriers as the airlines are permitted to carry passengers from their hubs in Africa to additional points in Asia while picking up passengers along the way in Singapore or Bangkok . For example , Egypt Air is able to fly from Cairo to Bangkok where they drop off and pick up new passengers who continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airways all offer daily flights to Bangkok that continue onto other destinations in Asia . <p> But such an agreement does not exist between Hong Kong and the Philippines . This means that if Ethiopian Airlines was to travel from Addis Ababa to Manila via Hong Kong , the airline would drop off passengers in Hong Kong but would not be able to pick up passengers in Hong Kong bound for Manila or vice versa . Such a scenario is perplexing as it could mean financial suicide for the airline . In an interview with the Centre for Aviation , the CEO of Ethiopian Airlines stated that the airline was hoping to eventually secure pick up rights between Hong Kong and Manila . <p> The airline previously stated that it was committed to launching the routes without fifth freedom rights enabling it to only carry passengers that originate in Africa . But Manila is simply too challenging a market to sustain without fifth freedom rights . It is certainly too small to sustain non-stop services which is likely why Ethiopian opted for a route via Hong Kong . But clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to pull the plug on the route . Ethiopian Airlines would have been the first African carrier to serve Manila . <p> Ethiopian Airlines certainly has no illusions about the obstacles that it must overcome in order to successfully operate flights between the Philippines and Africa . The market is already highly competitive and largely controlled by Middle East carriers which have a strong presence in Manila . But Ethiopian Airlines is not giving up yet . <p> In an interview with Shanghai Daily News , Esayas Woldemariam , the Chief Commercial Officer of Ethiopian Airlines , stated that following the launch of the carrier 's route to Singapore in September , the airline is going to expand to Ho Chi Minh in Vietnam and Manila in the Philippines . This clearly shows that the carrier has not given up on the Philippine market .

@@380231 <p> Recent weeks have seen a dramatic explosion in social discontent among major emerging markets across the world , from Turkey , to Brazil , and now post-revolutionary Egypt . While autocratic governments seem to have dug in amid continuing uncertainty in the global economy , staving off popular dissatisfaction with a sophisticated mixture of intimidation , co-optation , and repression , democratically-elected governments in the developing world are revealing their vulnerability in coping with an economic downturn that is fueling spontaneous demonstrations , captivating the global media and rattling investors . <p> Egypt , reeling from a chaotic post-revolutionary politics , saw the downfall of its first democratically-elected president , after up to 17 million people took to the streets and demanded for a new government . The depth of frustration among protesters ran deep , so much so that they suddenly turned to the military as their savior -- the very same institution that held on to power for 18 months into the 2011 revolution , and was accused of heavy-handed crackdown on large-scale pro-democracy demonstrators in the iconic Tahrir Square and beyond . In Turkey , after a decade of democratic consolidation under the leadership of the Justice and Development Party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destruction of the venerable Gezi Park turned into a sustained stream of spontaneous demonstrations against Prime Minister Erdogan and his coterie . Shortly after , Brazil , amid much fanfare over hosting the much-anticipated Confederations Cup , saw a record number of people staging biggest demonstrations in almost 20 years , demanding for government accountability and basic services . <p> While calls for political pluralism and participative democracy colored historic protests across these three major emerging economies , notwithstanding the unique characteristics of each state , a more careful look reveals a more fundamental triggering element : an abrupt economic downturn , on the back of years of robust growth , which , more broadly , evinced the lack of inclusive development . <p> As Asia 's top growing economy in the first quarter of 2013 , and poised to register an impressive 7 percent growth this year , the Aquino administration proudly basks in the apparent success of its reforms , anchored by good governance initiatives and a conservative monetary-fiscal policy . With latest data on employment , hunger , and poverty showing little improvement , the government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record of considerably wealthier emerging markets such as Turkey and Brazil , it should also equally avoid their pitfalls . Precisely for this reason the Aquino administration should move from ' good governance ' to the next phase of reform : inclusive growth backed by industrial revival . And the current depreciation of peso and slight improvement in manufacturing could help . <p> A Tale of Concentrated Growth <p> After years of above-average growth rates coupled with record-high investment inflow into Egypt , especially during the twilight years of the Mubarak regime , up to 40% of the population lived below the poverty line , with a combination of food insecurity exacerbating rising inequality between the privileged pro-regime clique and the working masses . The 2011 revolution , and the ensuing chaos that saw protesters first battling the military junta then the Muslim Brotherhood , just exacerbated Egypt 's structural economic imbalances . In the absence of a dramatic turnabout in the country 's economic paradigm , there was little reason for systemic improvement . In the end , even the poor and working class Egyptians joined the protests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of autocratic governance and exclusionary politics by the secular opposition . <p> Yet , it was the earlier protests in Turkey that proved to be even more shocking . Under Erdogan 's decade-long watch , the country saw its economy quadrupling in size , with average per capita rates more than tripling . The moderate Islamist AKP oversaw the transformation of Turkey from the " Sick Man of Europe " into the world 's newest wunderkind . Most encouragingly , Erdogan was also able to force the perennially politicized military back to the barracks , establishing civilian supremacy -- a cornerstone of modern democracy . Cashing in on its electoral prowess , the AKP pressed for a successful referendum , which saw crucial constitutional reforms on the road to European Union ( EU ) membership . No wonder , Erdogan 's party came to garner up to 50% of the votes in the latest parliamentary elections . Abroad , Erdogan became one of the world 's most influential leaders , turning Turkey into a regional powerhouse and an international powerbroker . However , as AKP consolidated its political control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the opposition parties to the journalists and ultra-secular circles , and more overtly pushed for a conservative agenda . Yet , the AKP managed to silence its detractors as long as the economy did well . This year , however , saw a dramatic slow-down in the country 's economy , dropping from a break-neck GDP growth rate of 9% in 2010-11 to just about 2.2% in 2012 . It is far from certain whether Ankara could meet its 4 percent growth target this year . <p> Despite a decade of robust growth and Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) boom , Turkey has one of the highest rates of youth unemployment and inequality among OECD countries , while struggling to move towards high-value-added manufacturing . A strong reliance on imports of technology , intermediate-goods , and services also meant that the government had to constantly manipulate interest rates in order to attract enough ' hot money ' to cover a deteriorating trade deficit . When the government resorted to a dismissive and heavy-handed response to quell peaceful demonstrations against the demolition of the Gezi Park in Istanbul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The political message was clear : Erdogen has to accommodate the other half of Turkey that did n't vote for him lest he undermines AKP 's historic electoral dominance . In economic terms , an investment-dependent Turkey is warily watching how the markets are responding to the recent upsurge in political opposition . <p> While Turkey had a humbling moment of self-reflection , Brazil woke up to its own winter of discontent , ironically just as the country prepares to host the world 's biggest sporting events in succession . After two decades of economic recovery and sustained growth , Brazil emerged as one of the leading rising economies , along China , India , and Russia . As a result , the country saw a dramatic boom in consumption , imports , and its Nouveau riche class . Despite the relative expansion of the middle classes , and successful anti-poverty program targeting indigent sectors , Brazil remains to be one of the world 's most unequal states . Weak infrastructure , gang activity , and deforestation remain to be a large concern . Moreover , a decade-long boom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' of countries such as Brazil , which have come to rely on agribusiness and offshore drilling to shore up their coffers . The commodity boom has , in turn , led to an over appreciation in the currency , hurting the manufacturing sector , which provided large-scale and well-paying jobs , and experienced impressive growth in recent times . <p> So , not all Brazilians were impressed with the economy , anxiously watching billions of dollars poured into new stadiums to impress the world , while public infrastructure is in tatters , growth is dismal , and the cost of living is skyrocketing . The heavy-handed response of the police ---purportedly to maintain ' rule of law ' under the watchful gaze of international investors and media -- to peaceful demonstrations against bus and subway fare hikes precipitated a national outcry for government accountability and better basic services . In the end , President Dilma Rousseff - eying a re-election bid and a clear differentiation from Erdogan - caved in , promising necessary reforms to address the popular grievances . <p> Aquino Reforms 2.0 <p> With less than three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- widely lauded as one of the most successful democratic leaders in recent years -- has limited opportunity to address long-term structural challenges in need of resolution . Yet , bureaucratic inertia aside , the Aquino administration still holds sufficient leverage to contemplate heterodox economic thinking , which could lay down the foundation of structural re-balancing in the medium- to long-term . <p> As leading economists and experts have consistently mentioned , including the world 's top development institutions such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank , in absence of a rebalancing towards manufacturing and agricultural development , the Philippines ' pattern of growth will continue to fall short of adequately tackling double-digit underemployment and poverty rates . While expressed plans of ramping up the Conditional Cash Transfer ( CCT ) program -- an ingenious targeted subsidy for improving the health and education of indigent communities -- could make a dent , it is increasingly clear that the current policy paradigm at best fosters macroeconomic stability without balanced development on the ground , and at worst is vulnerable to systemic shocks on the regional and global economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders such as Erdogan could n't prevent the outpouring of discontent that has roiled Turkish markets and put into question the country 's long-term growth trajectory . From Turkey to Brazil , a narrow focus on macroeconomic stability and booming ( low-value-added or/and commodity ) exports prevented the state from more aggressively addressing industrial upgrading and equitable growth . The explosion in spontaneous protests should serve as a sobering reminder for rising economies such as the Philippines to avoid the mistakes of their more successful and prominent peers if they wish to move towards democratic deepening and full-fledged developed country status in the coming decades .

@@392240 <p> IN 2007 , an Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) study identified four critical constraints that had kept the Philippine economy from growing as fast as those of most of its Asian neighbors : ( 1 ) tight government finances , ( 2 ) inadequate infrastructure ( particularly in electricity and transport ) , ( 3 ) weak investor confidence due to governance concerns ( particularly on corruption and political instability ) , and ( 4 ) market failures leading to a small and narrow industrial base . While our neighbors ' economies had seen decades of dynamic growth , our own economy had consistently trailed behind . As such , between 1960 and 2006 , the average income ( GDP per capita ) in the Philippines barely doubled , while that in Singapore grew more than 12 times , in Thailand nearly eight times , in Malaysia nearly six times , and in Indonesia more than five times . <p> Times have since changed , and our economy 's growth now outpaces the rest of Asia as of the first quarter of this year .

For as long as the operation of public facilities is barred from foreign majority participation , there will be a narrow field of PPP participants , and it will be confined to the same familiar small group of large domestic players -- the same players already dominating our economy and reaping the lion 's share of its benefits .

@@506235 <p> There is a current drive to collect one million signatures to convince government , particularly the Metro Manila Development Authority , to scuttle plans to centralize bus terminal operations in the metropolis , specifically the one located at the Uniwide Coastal Mall meant for buses coming from Cavite and environs . <p> In reaction , MMDA Chair Francis Tolentino acknowledged that while the protesters , grouped under the new consumer group Coalition of Filipino Consumers , " can exercise their right to express their grievances , " he also wanted to know whether they could " offer us viable alternatives . " <p> Well , actually , there was a viable alternative previously . In 1993 , the then MMDA chair , Bayani Fernando , established an Organized Bus Route ( OBR ) terminal for northbound buses on Roxas Boulevard near Baclaran church . Commuters , according to reports , preferred this arrangement as it allowed them to conveniently transfer to jeepneys or city buses to bring them into the city . Apparently , too , it seemed to work , as the Baclaran terminal was dismantled only in 2010 , when Tolentino took over the MMDA . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> TV news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some weeks ago was a testament to the confusion attending the transfer of passengers between provincial buses and city transport . Commuters were one in their complaints , especially since the first few days of the " experiment " were marked by bad weather , with passengers hogging roadsides and scrambling for rides even if it meant taking a " round trip . " They also sounded off on their delayed trips , since public transportation like buses and jeepneys could not enter the terminal as fast as the number of passengers accumulated , as well as , of course , the added expense of an additional ride to reach their destinations . <p> How could the MMDA not have anticipated the confusion and the sheer number of passengers waiting for rides ? I asked myself . After all , Tolentino had been sounding off about the terminal weeks before , and surely , he had enough time to conduct time-and-motion studies before inviting pandemonium at the Coastal Mall . <p> * * * <p> But the problem seems rooted in something more than just lack of preparations or faulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mall as a terminal . <p> It arises from a policy decision of the MMDA itself , which in its laudable intent to reduce vehicular traffic on congested Edsa , seems to have focused on the wrong , or least guilty , targets . <p> Observers note that if the purpose of the Interim Southwest Integrated Provincial Transport Terminal ( the official , rather long name of the Coastal Mall hub ) is to decongest Edsa , why target ( first ) the provincial buses from Cavite ? These hardly use Edsa , while those that make the trip to Lawton ( usually carrying students who attend institutions in the University Belt ) take Roxas Boulevard , Quirino Avenue , then Taft Avenue . <p> A briefer provided by critics of the scheme acknowledges that while " the concept of an Integrated Bus Terminal is a good idea , " the implementation was faulty . And these critics trace the " fault " first of all to the flawed contract between the MMDA and Uniwide , which is just a tenant on the property which is owned by Manila Bay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * <p> Uniwide has not even been a tenant of good standing . Since 1995 , after an aggressive campaign to get MBDC to grant it permission to build on site , it has been defaulting on its rental payments . <p> But last October , the Court of Appeals ruled in MBDC 's favor in its ejection case filed against Uniwide , directing Uniwide to pay rental arrears of P256 million , real estate taxes , and other pertinent fees and compensation . Why Tolentino chose to sign a contract with Uniwide despite its legal troubles and questionable ownership of the mall , remains a mystery . <p> Not so mysterious is why Uniwide is fighting to keep " custody " of the terminal , despite the many complaints aired . One explanation is that the facility has become a " cash cow " for Uniwide . While , true to Tolentino 's assertion , provincial buses are not charged any toll to enter the Coastal Mall , all other vehicles , including public city buses and PUVs , are charged P20 upon exit . <p> The sum of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the P40 plus that some malls charge for parking .

But why is Uniwide allowed to collect toll fees when it was the MMDA ( and thus , the people 's money ) that was used to develop the terminal ? <p> * * * <p> The latest TV news broadcast about the Coastal Mall is how the MMDA has " prettified " the place , building a playground , among other facilities .

Many of us like to lament how too many Filipino businessmen seem content with imitating and copying others ' successful businesses , rather than creating and pursuing new business ideas . Our history of an import-substituting industrial policy derives from this attitude , and has led us to a tradition of protectionism whose continuing vestiges still slow us down today in the face of the impending Asean Economic Community . Risk-taking and innovation are not something one learns from books , but are fostered through the approach and manner by which education is delivered by our schools and teachers . <p> Most of us now recognize that our educational system is the first place we should look in seeking the key to inclusive economic development . As we constantly strive to improve the way we educate our children , it is well worth remembering that our objective is to create a new generation of Filipinos who will not merely be earners of incomes , but creators of wealth . @

Should n't we say it 's also with the legislature and executive and we will do our part in correcting it ? " <p> Chief Justice Maria Lourdes Sereno provides the background to this question : " We are sensitive to the fact that we are not politicians . There are political solutions . We have to know whether it 's time to step in . " <p> The respondents to the case represented by the Office of the Solicitor General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature resolve the pork issue , stating that : " ... judicial solution may inadvertently limit a more progressive solution . " <p> The SC decision on the PDAF is the High Court 's challenge to the political branches of the government . The necessity for a judicial action speaks of the failure of the executive and the legislature in providing a political solution that will decisively solve the pork crisis . <p> The SC decision will surely spawn many opinions and actions , one of which hopefully is that of political society finally shaping up as a response to the SC 's implicit challenge to the political society on its decision on PDAF . <p> Pork is now prohibited <p> The SC ruling does not only abolish PDAF , it prohibits pork . It deems illegal any form of congressional intervention in the " post-enactment stages of the budget execution . " <p> The ruling opted to further define the limits and bounds of how the executive and the legislature should relate in the budget process . Congress ' power is limited to its power over the purse exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the budget is being deliberated in Congress ) and its oversight powers , which broadly means its power to check whether the laws , including the budget law , are executed properly . <p> With this decision , the system of checks-and-balance is expected to be restored . With Congress now out of the picture of budget implementation , it can perform its oversight power more effectively and credibly . This can be argued as the strengthening of Congress . <p> Meanwhile , the budget authorization stage can now become a real battleground where the dynamics of specific needs of congressional districts and the national priorities will come into play . Legislators will have to engage the executive here and argue that their proposed items in the budget ( supposedly in accordance to their constituencies ' needs ) are consistent with the national development plan and must therefore be prioritized . This becomes a good opportunity for the executive to convince the legislators of the merits of its priority legislative agenda . <p> This decision of the SC on this account can be appreciated as supportive of the strengthening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the fact that they are not well-defined . Many of the institutions are not operationally defined as to how they should be used and applied given the country 's political context . This arguably makes the institutions easily thwarted to the advantage and use of the powerful . <p> Replacing pork <p> With the prohibition of pork , the main system that facilitates the relationship between the executive and the legislature is now gone . This relationship is key in development planning and governance . <p> Both the executive and the legislature know the need for them to cooperate and work out something more substantive in order to fill the gap left behind by the pork system . The executive will have to get Congress to pass the legislative measures critical to the country 's development targets and commitments . Congress , on the other hand , can not remain non-functional all the time , especially now with many eyes looking at how legislators will cope up without their pork . <p> The main gap in a pork-less Congress is the mechanism which facilitates the relationship between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performing their law-making functions . <p> There are now several emerging solutions to fill this gap . <p> One is the strengthening of the Legislative-Executive Development Advisory Council ( LEDAC ) . The LEDAC serves as a venue for the executive and the legislature to coordinate on the legislative measures that must be prioritized . Through the LEDAC , the executive informs the legislature of the critical bills that will support the country 's development plan and the legislators would have an idea which bills would be most crucial . <p> The other is the strengthening of political parties and the development of a party system . <p> Proponents of this argue that the reason the pork barrel system exists is because the Philippines has an underdeveloped or mal-developed party system . Instead of the parties facilitating the relationship between the executive and the legislature on the basis of issues and programs , the parties are being used as a machinery to distribute pork as a way to perpetuate patronage . Without real parties providing varied programmatic options , there is no mechanism by which legislators are informed , educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sponsor and support . <p> A party reform bill currently filed in Congress is expected to support the strengthening of parties and the development of a party system . It sets minimum standards on how genuine political parties should function , providing subsidy for the performance of these functions . It also prohibits political turncoatism , which aims to support the maturity of the electoral exercise . <p> A new Congress <p> With the pork out of the picture , legislators will now be forced to focus on performing their main mandate of law-making , oversight and deliberation , if pressure on them will be sustained to such an extent that they will heed . <p> One obvious pressure on legislators , particularly those who want to be re-elected , is still the need to respond to the demand of their respective constituency . Now , they will have to find a way to be responsive to their constituency within the bounds of their main mandate , having no pork to rely on . <p> It is most crucial to correct the misconception that legislators will not be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their law-making mandate to work around with . <p> Congress has power over the purse . The budget is a law . Legislators can argue during the budget authorization stage why the needs of their constituencies must be prioritized in the budget . This will enable legislators to respond to their constituents ' needs , while taking into account the development thrust of the government and the need of the rest of the country . <p> Finally , if pork is not resurrected in any form ( thus turning Congress into mainly a law-making body ) , future congressional elections will likely attract those with capacity for law-making , for research and monitoring ( to perform oversight ) and for debate and public discourse . This will drastically change the composition of Congress and could give birth to a new legislature resulting in a different dynamics in legislative-making and executive-legislative relationship . <p> A revolutionary first step <p> Those who understand the role played by pork in Philippine politics will know how significant is the decision of the Supreme Court on PDAF . But those who understand the flaws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document can easily be undermined by powerful forces , who will be affected by what that piece of document contains . <p> Pork has been the main source of patronage in the country that perpetuates the rule of political monopolies . The forces that rely on pork for their power will not take the changes that are about to happen sitting down . If not through direct confrontation , there will be other means through which the old order will fight for survival . <p> The SC decision is a tool that can pave the way for real changes in governance and politics in the country . But it is not in any way sufficient to realize the changes that the broad anti-pork advocacy wants to see . <p> The broad anti-pork advocacy , after all , wants to see integrity back in the political system , for the culture of transparency and accountability to be nurtured and sustained at all levels of governance , and for public office truly becoming a public trust . The broad anti-pork advocacy aims to end patronage politics , which perpetuates disempowerment and dependency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Hence , while the SC decision on the PDAF is a victory that the anti-pork advocates can claim and celebrate about , it should also be appreciated as the start of even bigger fights ahead that can truly spell the difference in the lives of ordinary Filipinos . <h> Would you like to share your vote ? <p> Welcome to Rappler , a social news network where stories inspire community engagement and digitally fuelled actions for social change .

@@676238 <p> MANILA , Philippines -- The Bureau of Internal Revenue said on Wednesday , it took into account the taxes paid by boxing icon Manny Pacquiao to the US government , but in the end , it still calculated a remaining tax liability of P2.2 billion . <p> The BIR said the P2.2 billion in tax liabilities covering 2008 and 2009 stemmed partly from Pacquiao 's failure to present proper documentation of his tax payments to the Internal Revenue Service ( IRS ) of the United States . <p> Ortiz said that for 2008 , Pacquiao 's gross income was estimated at P1.5 billion . The amount took into account earnings from his fights abroad , his share in income from " pay-per-view " cable services that aired his fights , and his endorsements of various brands . <p> According to the Tax Code , the lawyer said , a Filipino earning an income ought to pay an income tax of 32 percent . <p> Based on the estimated amount of Pacquiao 's gross income for 2008 and on the 32-percent income tax rate , Ortiz said , the boxer was obligated to pay P340 million in income tax to the BIR on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We took into account what he reported as his payment to the IRS . But still , he has unpaid obligations to the BIR , " Ortiz said . <p> The fact that Pacquiao failed to pay the P340 million in income tax liability only made things worse for him because of the surcharges and interests on unpaid tax liabilities , the lawyer said . <p> The lawyer said the BIR imposed a 50-percent surcharge , or P170 million , on Pacquiao 's basic income tax liability . <p> Also , the BIR imposed a cumulative interest of P250 million for the four years that the boxer failed to pay the income tax liability . <p> Under the Tax Code , the lawyer explained , the BIR might impose a 50-percent surcharge if a tax-deficiency case involved fraud . Ortiz said that in the tax deficiency case of Pacquiao , the BIR believed Pacquiao committed fraud when he deliberately withheld some of his earnings from the BIR . <p> But in cases where there is no fraud involved , a tax deficiency case is slapped a surcharge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states that the BIR shall impose an interest of 20-percent per annum on unpaid tax obligations . <p> The lawyer said that on top of his income tax liabilities -- the basic income tax due , plus surcharge and interest -- Pacquiao also had an unpaid value added tax of P4.3 million . <p> The amount of VAT liability also includes surcharge and interest , the lawyer said . <p> For 2009 , the lawyer said , Pacquiao 's estimated gross income was higher at about P2 billion . <p> Based on this , the lawyer said , the BIR has been running after P688 million in basic income tax liability . <p> For 2009 , Ortiz said , Pacquiao did not report any income tax payment to the US government . As such , the lawyer said , the BIR had nothing to deduct from the income tax liability . <p> Again , Ortiz said , the BIR imposed surcharge and interest to the unpaid income tax obligation . The surcharge amounted to P344 million , while the cumulative interest for the three years that the liability remained unpaid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer said Pacquiao again did not pay VAT in 2009 . The unpaid VAT liability , including surcharge and interest , was P26.7 million . <p> Thus , Pacquiao 's total unpaid tax liabilities for 2009 -- including the basic income tax plus the surcharges and interest -- stood at P1.4 billion . <p> The combined unpaid tax liabilities of Pacquiao for 2008 and 2009 , therefore , is nearly P2.2 billion .

@@2024231 <p> Welcome to Rappler , a social news network where stories inspire community engagement and digitally fuelled actions for social change . Rappler comes from the root words " rap " ( to discuss ) + " ripple " ( to make waves ) . <p> Movies have a unique way of making you feel a childlike wonder . Everything in film is larger than life , from the special effects of explosions to the equally wondrous special effect of wooden thespians suddenly being able to cry on demand . The new Movie and Television Review and Classification Board ( MTRCB ) infomercial though dispenses with wonder and just treats the viewer like a child . It made me feel dirty to even think of watching a PG-13 film , let alone an R-18 flick . <p> The infomercial is a pastiche of censor beloved tropes designed to evoke a longing for a halcyon era of innocence and family . Numerous signs build a web whose overarching message is that any responsible , law abiding , intelligent and moral adult would not watch any film other than those rated GP . Those who do should feel ashamed . Shame is key here as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immoral one ( watching a movie leads to the degradation of the family ) . <p> The infomercial <p> We begin with a carefully crafted setting of carnivalesque music composed of upbeat horns and piano . It evokes clowns and days with family ( ie. childhood ) . A little girl holds a red balloon as a family walks arm in arm to the theater entrance . Bare bulbs light up movie posters , again reminiscent of the billboards of old carnivals which had posters of strong man acts and other oddities lit up in the same way . ( This is a neat trick , a seeming glorification of movies actually portrays them as spectacles of freaks . ) <p> Our actors typify the family we all love to imagine : <p> Neat : the son is dressed in suspenders , all the girls wear dresses . <p> Polite : This politeness takes on the form of deference to authority . Each child proposes to see a different movie but turns to their parents to validate their choice . <p> In turn the parents turn to the embodiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady , to approve their viewing fare . <p> Together : The family is predominantly shot as one unit , in a line , each member inextricably linked to each other . Even in shots where one member is apart , when choosing a movie which is inappropriate for their age , the rest of the family can be seen in the background standing together ; almost as if they stand in judgment of the inappropriate choice . <p> Steering the family to the only right and proper movie to watch ( that rated GP ) are the infomercial 's authority figures . First there is the male guard , immaculately dressed in a white uniform . The guard , without prompting as he is ever diligent , sets the tone with a prohibition , " Excuse me , hindi kayo pwede manood niyan , " ( Excuse me . You can not watch that. ) as he informs the son that he is too young to watch the movie the boy has chosen . ( The guy playing this guard can win a FAMAS just for smugness . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand at picking a movie . She in turn is rebuffed by the equally diligent ticket lady who informs father and daughter that the chosen film is R-16 . The daughter pleads that she is above 16 , to which the lady just replies with an unbelieving raise of her eyebrows . <p> The father would like to watch an R-18 movie " sana " but does not press his choice . The mother would seem to have the final say as everyone looks to her to decide . She herself though , interestingly , has no choice of her own . Movies , the ostensible reason why everyone is there , are rendered unimportant . What is important is family , as the mother succinctly edicts , " Pamilya tayo and sabay sabay tayo manonood . " ( We are a family . We watch movies together . ) <p> Who cares what movie , as long as we 're together . One wonders then why they could n't have just been together at home . <p> She stands in front of the whole family as she lectures them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little child will lead them . <p> Two adults , teenagers and a househelp are held to the lowest common denominator of choice , the movie appropriate for the child who carries a balloon to a movie house . And they celebrate this forbearance of what they wanted , of not watching movies they are technically allowed to see , by embracing the youngest daughter . <p> The message <p> As a piece of cinema , the MTRCB infomercial delivers a subtle message . The government not only censors what we can see but we ourselves should voluntarily self censor . Amongst all the family members only the son is under age for the movie he has chosen . Yet all of them happily agree to watch the GP movie . <p> Here is the ultimate internalization of the panopticon as suggested by Foucault . Authority figures are no longer needed as we police ourselves . Adult movies with adult themes are rendered inappropriate for adult minds . <p> There is no outright prohibition imposed on the adults or teenagers from viewing the movies they are allowed to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice and opinion of a child . Moreover , their abdication of adult thought is celebrated as proper and good . The voluntary conformity of the other members of the family is what is most troubling about this infomercial which strives very hard to be cute and innocuous . <p> In a country where many people ca n't afford to buy lunch , let alone purchase a few hours diversion in a modern cave sitting in front of a very large screen ; who cares what they show before movies ? We should care because eliminating the poverty of the body begins with eliminating the poverty of the mind . <p> No one benefits from censorship , no matter how subtly it is branded . Sex , violence , profanity , irreverence , wit ; what good can viewing these bring ? Anyone who asks that question has never watched A Clockwork Orange or read or seen a Shakespeare play . The world is messy , gloriously topsy turvy . To reflect on it , to think long and deep about things both trivial and profound , we must acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one benefits from being told what to think . Being nudged to inhibit curiosity or appreciation of art ( whether it be film or literature , painting or dance ) is a proposition for intellectual retardation . As the philosopher Peter Singer puts it , " From time to time , outstanding thinkers will emerge who are troubled by the boundaries that custom places on their reasoning , for it is in the nature of reasoning that it dislikes notices saying ' off limits . ' Reasoning is inherently expansionist . " We do n't need to be exceptional thinkers to be curious , to want to know , to want to think for ourselves . <p> On censorship <p> It 's easy to say that censorship is for our societal good . For example , I 'm sure when the MTRCB initially banned the showing of Schindler 's List in the country years ago it was more beneficial to the nation that we not be exposed to a few naked bodies ( as if we did n't see real naked children playing by the highways in our cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holocaust . <p> More recently , there was an uproar among Filipino Catholics when the Da Vinci Code movie was shown . Some priests urged their congregations not to watch it . Others said to go ahead and see it as a test of faith . <p> We have become so intellectually timid that watching an entertaining fiction can create an uproar ; can be described as a crucible of belief . St. Peter had himself crucified upside down because he did not think himself worthy of being killed in the same position as Christ . Compared to that watching a movie can be considered a test of faith ? <p> Many people , organizations and governments will tell you what to watch , what to listen , what to read , what to think . The MTRCB infomercial just does it in a sugary sweet manner with smiles and proddings , with arms around the shoulder and the assurance of Big Brother that everything is all right . <p> This may be appropriate for children but the infomercial would have even adults reduced to an infantile state . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things and think on our own . <p> The infomercial does get one thing right though ; the actress playing the older daughter is cute . And I mean that in a PG-13 way , not in an R-18 sense . Not that thinking of someone in an R-18 fashion is wrong . That 's the benefit of being a rational adult . There are no illicit or illegal thoughts . Where even freedom of speech is limited , the freedom of the mind is boundless . <p> No one , least of all yourself , should constrict your intellectual exploration . Just because movies can make you feel like a child this does not mean that they should make you think like a child as well . -- Rappler.com <p> ( Disclosure : Current MTRCB Chair Atty Eugenio Villareal was the author 's thesis advisor in law school .

Randy related how he decided not to run against Arroyo for a congressional seat so as not to irrevocably compromise his position as a commentator and academic by entering politics . Jerson shared how he hacked his dead pet bayawak ( monitor lizard ) and used the blood to paint , impressing the late fine arts professor Roberto Chabet .

Jaypee , the youngest , is a Cultural Center of the Philippines 13 Artists awardee who paints Antipolo 's denizens in extremely thick strokes .

" Banal na Aso " depicts a dog in heat in a priest 's cassock , with the brain surrounded by naked women .

@@2032237 <h> Why Is China Feared ? Resurgence , Pride and Uncertainty <p> Recently , I asked the Philippines ' Foreign Secretary Albert Del Rosario about his opinion on China 's newly-announced Air Defense Identification Zone ( ADIZ ) in East China Sea , which covers territories claimed by both South Korea and Japan , and whether he sees it as a reflection of a more assertive China under the Xi Jinping administration . <p> As a veteran diplomat , he was very cautious in his response , constantly re-affirming the Philippines ' adherence to prevailing regional and international principles as well as its opposition to any coercive acquisition of disputed territories . But beneath those carefully worded statements , he could n't conceal his misgivings about China 's inexorable rise as an Asian powerhouse . Earlier , in a media interview , Del Rosario went as far as characterizing the ADIZ as a " threat that China will control the air space in the East China Sea " , in effect transforming an entire air zone into " China 's domestic air space . " Del Rosario saw China 's new regulation as an infringement on civil aviation that " compromises the national security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a country , which has n't been directly affected by the Chinese ADIZ in East China Sea . <p> But what explains Del Rosario 's fiery statements has to do something with Southeast Asian anxieties over the Chinese Defense Ministry 's earlier announcement that it will " establish other air defense identification zones at an appropriate time after completing preparations . " And of course , keep in mind that China has threatened to " adopt defensive emergency measures to respond to aircraft that do not cooperate in the identification or refuse to follow the instructions " . <p> For South China Sea claimant states such as the Philippines and Vietnam , which have been locked in an intense territorial jostling with China in recent years , it is perhaps just a matter of time before another ADIZ is extended to the Spratly and Paracel islands , allowing China to dominate the southern flank of the Western Pacific . While Japan and South Korea have the military wherewithal to challenge China 's ADIZ , as eloquently exemplified in recent weeks , the same ca n't be said of Southeast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vis- ? -vis Beijing . <p> Ahead of the Japan-ASEAN summit in Tokyo , other Southeast Asian countries have also joined the growing chorus of disquietude over China 's behavior . Japan and the 10 members of the ASEAN have drafted a joint statement , expressing their concern over any " threat " to international civilian aviation , reaffirming the common positions of Southeast Asian nations and Japan on " maritime security , " and their commitment to preserving " freedom of navigation " in international waters . In effect , China has managed to antagonize the whole region by implementing what it sees as an established international practice , since India , Japan , Pakistan , Norway , the United Kingdom and the U.S. happen to have their own air identification zones . <p> The Post-Deng China <p> All the talk over China 's revisionism and unilateralist approach to territorial conflicts , however , tends to overlook the fact that China has hardly invaded any country since the end of Cold War , and has had a millennium of imperial history based on a benign tributary system rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerged as the top trading partner of almost all East Asian economies , with the notable exception of the Philippines , while providing multi-billion investment and trade deals to poorer countries across the region .

Deng 's constantly called for pragmatism and a low-profile foreign policy , memorably stating " hide your strength , bide your time . " He saw the world as Darwinian struggle for survival and power , lamenting , " development is the only hard truth ... and if we do not develop , then we will be bullied .

" For Chellaney , China has been implementing a stealthy approach , which allows it to " construct a dispute , initiate a jurisdictional claim through periodic incursions , and then increase the frequency and duration of such intrusions , thereby establishing a military presence or pressuring a rival to cut a deal on China 's terms .

The ADIZ , analysts maintain , represents a new chapter in China 's evolving strategy of making it increasingly costly and dangerous for Japan to maintain its territorial gains since the 1898 Sino-Japanese war . <p> Resurgence and Reform <p> In order to understand why China is willing to take such risks in regional affairs one also needs understand the shift in the domestic political landscape . The country is undergoing a period of ideological self-transformation , with communism giving way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism ( 1905 ) , the German sociologist , Max Weber eloquently described how the advent of capitalism -- accompanied by an explosion in consumerism , individual self-belief , and secular politics -- will eventually undermine its religious roots , giving birth to a new society characterized by rationalization , atomistic interaction , and hedonistic pursuits . In a quite similar vein , the explosion of capitalist instincts in China has gradually undermined the tenets of Mao era communism , paving the way for a " market society " , along Karl Polanyi 's ideas in The Great Transformation ( 1944 ) , where material prosperity , productivity , and prices displace principles of solidarity and redistribution . <p> But in order to avoid the fate of Western capitalist states , where capitalism prefaced the emergence of parliamentary democracy and political apathy , the Chinese leadership has skillfully shaped and re-channeled a resurgence in Chinese nationalism , with hundreds of millions of middle-class citizens demanding not only more accountability at home , but also the return of China to its pre-eminent historical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , the Chinese leadership is now locked in a double-edged dialectic , whereby its legitimacy is largely determined by how it projects nationalist sentiments onto the broader neighborhood : The leadership has to strike a difficult balance between maintaining domestic legitimacy by asserting itself internationally , on one hand , and preventing outright confrontation with major trading partners that have been central to the country 's economic success , on the other . <p> After three decades of relentless growth based on cheap labor , investment overdrive , and exports , the new Chinese leadership , under Xi Jingping and Li Keqiang , is carefully re-orienting the economy towards domestic consumption , high-end manufacturing , and liberalized property and capital markets . And such difficult transition process is expected to ( a ) meet stiff opposition from domestic interest groups and ( b ) carry risks of instability in the medium- to long-run . <p> Thus , China 's recent assertiveness abroad should perhaps be seen through the prism of how a new Chinese leadership is willing to sacrifice foreign relations in a calculated manner to create enough domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whether this is a sustainable strategy is another question . The fact that Japan is yet to come clean on its historical atrocities against China has added legitimacy to a more confrontational approach , while the U.S. ' highly touted " pivot to Asia " is seen as a thinly-veiled attempt at containing China . Yet , fears of a powerful China is deepening across the region , unifying a whole host of neighbors in opposition to what they perceive as territorial expansionism .

@@2062232 <h> Co-branding possible in PBA <p> MANILA , Philippines - The PBA is n't closing its doors on the possibility of co-branding but will insist on a participation of at least 33 percent in the ownership of a participating partner by the main franchise holder . <p> A league source said the other day there are several groups interested to join the PBA particularly as the league is just a year away from celebrating its 40th anniversary and coming off a record-breaking season . The blueprint is to expand to one or two or three more teams within the next three years . <p> While expansion is a priority in PBA chairman Ramon Segismundo 's agenda , the league wo n't rush it . The PBA has maintained its core of 10 franchises since 2000 . The league opened with nine teams in 1975 , namely , Royal Tru-Orange ( the San Miguel Corp . group ) , Tanduay , CFC Presto , Crispa , Toyota , U-Tex , Mariwasa , 7-Up and Concepcion Carrier . The membership dwindled to six in 1985 before rebuilding to eight in 1990 to nine in 1999 and finally , to 10 at the beginning of the millennium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , including the Philippine team , Emtex Brazil and Ramrod Australia in 1977 , Nicholas Stoodley and Adidas France in 1980 and Nicholas Stoodley South Korea in 1982 . The only commercial bank to own a PBA franchise was the Filipinas Manufacturers Bank or Filmanbank which played two seasons then was acquired by Pilipinas Bank , later taken over by Prudential Bank and eventually by Bank of the Philippine Islands . Soft drink brands Coca-Cola , Pepsi-Cola , 7-Up and Pop Cola also had teams . Fans are awaiting the return of a bank and a soft drink brand to the PBA fold . <p> A source said at least three PBA D-League teams are considering to upgrade and enter the PBA . One PBA D-League team owner is studying the possibility of partnering with another group to pursue the co-branding approach . " One brand could be used for two conferences and another brand for the third , " he said . " It will depend on whether our sales can justify the budget . I 'm informed that the budget for a PBA team is anywhere between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each team from revenues is about P30 to P40 Million so the balance has to be absorbed by the franchise as an advertising expense which is justifiable only by projected sales . " <p> The PBA will allow co-branding only if the brands are jointly owned . It will not permit a franchise holder to use brands where the owner has no equity . " The only way the PBA will sanction co-branding is if the franchise owner has at least a 33 percent stake in the partner company that owns the other brand , " said a PBA source . " Otherwise , it 's not possible . " <p> Dean 's Corner ( Article MRec ) , pagematch : 1 , sectionmatch : 1 <p> Last season , the PBA generated ticket sales of about P200 Million which broke the previous year 's mark of P114 Million .

The basketball boom -- triggered by Gilas ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NBA preseason game in Manila and the visits of NBA stars like LeBron James , Kobe Bryant and Derrick Rose -- was also cited as a contributing factor . <p> A milestone in the PBA 's history was the record attendance of 23,436 that packed the Smart Araneta Coliseum for Game 3 of the Commissioner 's Cup finals between Alaska and Barangay Ginebra last season . That erased the previous mark of 23,108 that witnessed Game 7 of the 2008 Fiesta Cup finals between Barangay Ginebra and Air 21 . The season was marked by several crowds of over 20,000 as the PBA enjoyed a resurgence of interest reflected in higher TV ratings , more media mileage and a growing nationwide audience covering a wide range of age groups . The PBA 's outreach program went beyond provincial sorties and took the roadshow abroad to OFWs . <p> It will take a majority vote from the PBA Board of Governors to approve the entry of a new franchise holder .

There are costs involved in both approaches so an interested party has the option to decide which route to take depending on his available resources .

We also know of one group that has a large nationwide presence studying the possibility of joining but probably wo n't make a decision until two or three years . Two of the three PBA D-League teams inquiring about joining are looking at their sales to justify the investment . The third team has the resources to join but is still evaluating the impact of its participation . " <p> Another league source said the time to join is next year when the PBA celebrates its 40th anniversary . " That 's a major landmark , " the source said .
