The question was asked in the context of the ANC 's deployment committee , - <p> By Rebecca Davis <p> " Not as far as I am aware , " Ramaphosa responded , before clarifying a few moments later : " I do recall once where judicial vacancies were mentioned and it was just in passing ... it never resulted or descended into saying this candidate would be good . " <p> The clear impression Ramaphosa gave to the Zondo Commission , and South Africa at large , was that assessing candidates for judicial vacancies fell beyond the remit of the ANC 's deployment committee . Yet , as the now-public deployment committee minutes show , this was untrue . On at least one occasion during the limited period covered by the minutes -- 22 March 2019 -- the committee is shown discussing and recommending candidates for upcoming judicial posts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the former chairperson of the ANC 's cadre deployment committee , may have made an untruthful statement to Judge Zondo during his testimony in front of the State Capture Commission , " DA MP Leon Schreiber , who pushed for the public release of the minutes , told DM168 . <p> " Now that we have obtained the ANC 's cadre deployment minutes , we see clearly that the deployment committee does in fact ' descend into saying this candidate would be a good one ' . In fact , the cadre deployment committee explicitly recommends the names of particular judges it wants deployed . " <p> But Ramaphosa 's misrepresentation is just one of multiple untruths conveyed by ANC leaders -- all under oath -- while defending the party 's cadre deployment policy , a DM168 investigation suggests . <p> A court affidavit in the name of ANC deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte , dated 23 July 2021 , swears that the deployment committee " generally " does not get involved in appointments " for independent institutions ( including the judiciary ) " . <p> Yet the minutes record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over appointments for at least two other " independent institutions " : the South African Human Rights Commission and the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural , Religious and Linguistic Communities . These are both Chapter 9 bodies , whose independence is enshrined in the Constitution . <p> Duarte 's affidavit , which was submitted in response to the DA 's application to have the minutes released , also states definitively that the committee does " not get involved in the appointment of ambassadors " . <p> Ambassadorial vacancies are in fact discussed on 3 December 2018 ; in the same meeting , one of the resolutions is to " work on foreign deployments " . On 8 March 2019 , " Cde Supra " presumably former North West premier Mahumapelo is described as being " available for international deployment " . <p> Moreover , Ramaphosa told the Zondo Commission on 12 August 2021 that ambassadorial appointments are indeed within the scope of the committee . <p> Duarte further states in her court papers : " I must stress that the deployment committee does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a position by a Cabinet minister are not eligible . " <p> This is again explicitly contradicted by Ramaphosa 's testimony to the Zondo Commission . The President made a point of noting , in fact , that for Cabinet ministers to get lists approved by the deployment committee is " not an easy process " , saying : " I know of ministers who have been there three times or more just to get a list recommended . " <p> This reality is also reflected by the minutes . Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula 's nominations for the Cross-Border Road Transport Agency are recorded as being rejected by the committee on 30 November 2020 because of " issues raised with regard to processes being followed and the candidates and the make-up of the board " . <p> Former ANC secretary-general and current Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe , appearing before the State Capture probe two days after Ramaphosa , stated : " The committee takes a mere interest only in those vacancies which it considers strategic and which could advance the development agenda with the state , such for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims similarly that the committee " gets involved in the civil service i.e. the top leadership , at director-general level " . <p> In fact , the minutes show that the committee routinely considers vacancies below director-general level : on at least three occasions recorded by the minutes , the body deliberates over deputy director-general positions . <p> The mystery of the missing minutes <p> It is clear that the ANC is unhappy about the release of the deployment committee minutes . The party has refused to comment on their content , and when DM168 contacted ANC spokespeople for comment last week , we received a call from ANC legal adviser Krish Naidoo informing us that the minutes had been released in error . <p> Although the DA had made two separate legal attempts to obtain the minutes -- via a Paia ( Promotion of Access to Information Act ) application and ongoing litigation -- neither of these had yet met with success when the Zondo Commission was found to have quietly released the minutes on its website as part of a bundle of documentation relating to the testimony of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Naidoo to the Zondo Commission dated 6 August 2021 , which states that the ANC wishes the commission to treat the minutes with " the requisite degree of confidentiality " . Naidoo specifies that the ANC is submitting the minutes " for information purposes only " and not as " part of the information which the Commission is at liberty to publish " . <p> Although the Zondo Commission had asked for minutes of the deployment committee for the entire period of State Capture , it was informed by ANC lawyers that minutes from 2012 to 2018 were unavailable . The only minutes supplied cover the period from May 2018 to 2020 . <p> When questioned about this at the commission , Ramaphosa claimed that minutes had not been taken during the period when he was chairing the committee -- or , at least , he could not recall ever going through minutes . This he attributed to the ANC 's " rather unfortunate record-keeping processes " . <p> Commission evidence leader Paul Pretorius responded that this seemed " implausible " , given that the party in fact had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck to his guns , but the notion remains that it seems impossibly convenient for both the ANC and the President that no record was kept of any deployment committee meetings during the Zuma years where Ramaphosa oversaw the committee . <p> Further undermining the claim that previous minutes simply were not kept is the fact that the first set of minutes released , for 11 May 2018 , start by adopting the minutes of the last meeting . <p> The role of the deployment committee in State Capture <p> The reason the ANC might wish to conceal the minutes of the deployment committee meetings held during the Zuma administration is not hard to see . With the committee 's existence already receiving a public hammering , particularly from the DA , hard evidence that it directly contributed to State Capture by recommending compromised individuals to key state roles would likely make its continuation untenable . <p> But there is already some proof that this is indeed what happened . An affidavit fragment contained within the bundle of documentation linked to Ramaphosa 's testimony released by the Zondo Commission states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointments to the boards of SOEs state-owned enterprises must also be approved by the African National Congress Deployment Committee ... The 2015 Denel board was no exception . " <p> This is particularly significant because Judge Raymond Zondo , in his first report , has already identified the boards of SOEs as being among the key enablers of State Capture . <p> Ramaphosa was asked by Zondo whether it would be " fair " to assume that " when it came to board members and chairpersons of important SOEs such as Transnet , Eskom , Denel , SAA , as well as their CEOs " , their appointment would have gone through the deployment committee of the ANC . <p> After some equivocation , Ramaphosa responded : " The expectation would be yes . " <p> In his report , Zondo would go on to conclude that the collapse of once-thriving SOEs was at least partly linked to the fact that " most , if not all , of these entities were led by Chief Executive Officers and Boards of Directors who would have been approved by the ruling party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee is designed to do and why <p> Numerous ANC figures have explained that the deployment committee was originally set up as a necessity when the party came into government and was confronted with an all-white civil service . The committee was intended to ensure that the civil service was racially transformed and also , to quote a Zondo Commission affidavit submitted by Mantashe , " to ensure that bureaucratic sabotage by reactionary forces , intent on undermining the democratic order , would be minimised " . <p> There is little disagreement that a policy of cadre deployment was indeed necessary under those circumstances . In recent years , however , the question of whether the committee 's function is still necessary -- or even lawful -- has come under increasing scrutiny . <p> This is the case even within the ANC itself . Current Finance Minister Enoch Godongwana told Newzroom Afrika in 2021 that the ostensible objectives of the committee , in terms of racially transforming the civil service , had undoubtedly already been achieved . <p> " Is there a necessity to continue doing the policy of cadre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate we should be engaged in . " <p> Former public enterprises minister Barbara Hogan has made no secret of her scepticism about the committee , telling the Zondo Commission in 2018 : " How can just a handful of people possibly have the institutional knowledge and resources to pronounce on suitable candidates for every senior position in government and the private sector ? " <p> The publication of the committee 's minutes has added fuel to the debate . The DA has already called for an investigation into every public service position filled by the committee . <p> " The minutes confirm that the real powers of appointment are not located in the state , but are instead outsourced to a subcommittee of a political party . Appointment decisions are therefore predictably made in the best interests of the party , rather than of the country , " Schreiber said in a statement this week .

Concurrently , I was also presenting a radio program of Sauti ya Watoto that aimed at advocating children 's rights and responsibilities .

Like : what was the most vulnerable moment of your life , your career ? <p> At 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then promoted to Director of Finance and Administration . Three months later I had a top leadership role . I did not have enough experience and required exposure for the role . It felt like I had dropped into a deep sea . Rising to the occasion and serve the role accordingly was the only option I had . Immediately I enrolled myself for a Master 's degree as the foundation process of seeking knowledge needed for the role . I also took part in different leadership programmes both within and outside the country . With the combination of the knowledge and my personal given skills , I managed to successfully perform exceptionally . I operated in this position for more than six years , then I started my organization last year . <p> What is your leadership style ?

I am a Mandela Washington Fellow class of 2021 , Gratitude Network Fellow class of 2020 , the Young Emerging Leaders Project class of 2019 , Perennial Leadership Fellow class of 2019 , and Cordes Fellow class of 2018 . <p> I highly encourage those who aspire to become leaders to utilize such opportunities . After I attended those leadership programmes , I realized the need to have leadership programmes tailored to empower young girls in high schools and universities to help them test their potential and realize themselves as the next generation of leaders and therefore designed the Niongoze Fellowship Programme under Doyenne Organization . <p> What do you think is causing the lack of diversity in top leaderships ? Why are women not rising to the top ? <p> Leadership has no gender . Unfortunately , leadership roles are socially constructed to best-fit men . This society 's gender role beliefs - and how women 's roles are perceived - contributed to the factors such as low confidence and self-esteem , uneven access to formal education and opportunities , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to achieve . This ideology plays a vital role in bridging gender disparity in leadership roles . Women do not trust themselves to take the roles ; and men do not believe in women 's capacity to lead . So , eventually , lack diversity in top leadership . I commend Mwananchi Communications for this initiative , as it gives women a platform to showcase their potential and inspire the young generation of women in our country . <p> What can women do to take these matters into their hands - and change the situation ? <p> Women need to strive to have both quantity and quality women leaders . We need to seek knowledge and qualify ourselves through acquiring education and leadership skills ; this will give us the required qualifications to bring change . <p> What do you think is the best strategy to sustain women empowerment initiatives to last for posterity ? <p> I think what we are doing at Doyenne Organization is the best approach to sustain women empowerment initiatives , especially in leadership , because we are nurturing leadership talents at a young age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's programmes are designed for scale , and can be used and adapted in either educational institutions or organizations within and outside the country as a tool for developing later generations of female leaders . <p> How did you develop this leadership confidence - and voice ? <p> Everything I am today as a leader is the product of a collection of everything I have exrienced in my life . <p> This includes the people I have met , the places I have been , and the things I have learned . It is a gradual process that comes from the determination of wanting to become a better version of myself every day . <p> Can you tell us more about self-care , and how do you accomplish it as a leader ? <p> As a leader I know that I can not serve from an empty vaseself-care is as important as the cause and people I serve . Therefore , I ensure to have self-practice that keeps me mindful and grounded .

" <p> He commended TCAA for its frequent engagement with stakeholders to discuss challenges that the later were grappling with and chart way forward . <p> Tanzania Airports Authority ( TAA ) director general Mussa Mbura attributed the industry 's good performance to the continual efforts by states to implement the World Health Organisation ( WHO ) and International Civil Aviation Organisation ( Icao ) recommendations . <p> The recommendations that include elimination of travel restrictions by many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Covid-19 pandemic , acts as a triggering factor towards the ongoing traffic recovery . <p> He also linked the positive performance with recovery on trade and tourism economic activities . <p> Tourism , which accounts for over 17 percent of the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) , saw the number of international visitors drop to 620,867 in 2020 from 1.5 million in 2019 . But , from 2021 to date things have been improving for the better as the country is experiencing a flow of tourists in the country , thanks to extensive marketing of the country 's tourist attractions . <p> " Our latest analysis of the aviation sector performance reveals clear signs of a strong recovery in the aviation sector , a trend buoyed by increasing airline confidence due to relaxation of Covid-19 restriction measures , " Mr Mbura told The Citizen . <p> " These recovery indicators are highly encouraging , " stressed Mr Njawa , noting further : " This is a positive development that the industry needs to maintain .
