@@96894237 <h> ( Viewpoint ) Hong Kong Courts Need Move On From Dino Age <p> Published in 2021 , the ' Fourteenth National Five-Year Plan ' indicated that Hong Kong was to be developed as ' Centre of International Legal and Dispute Resolution Service ' in the Asia-Pacific Region . The Plan not only served its function as to help Hong Kong to better understand its relationship with Mainland by outlining policy benefits , but more importantly , it should be regarded as a mission bestowed upon Hong Kong . In his address at the meeting celebrating the 25th anniversary of Hong Kong 's return to the motherland , President Xi stressed that ' The central government fully supports Hong Kong in its effort to maintain its distinctive status and edges ... to maintain the common law ' . <p> In spite of that , even if the HKSAR Government and Department of Justice are to comply with the Plan , with the aim of further developing Hong Kong into a ' Centre of International Legal and Dispute Resolution Service ' , the Judiciary in Hong Kong lacks motivation with low efficiency on development . <p> Taking the example of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Final Report on Civil Justice Reform suggested in proposal 79 that ' Steps should be taken to develop the Court 's existing computerised system to enable it to facilitate any reforms by being able to accommodate not merely administrative support , but also to perform case-flow management , resource allocation and management statistic functions ' . <p> It was not until after the outbreak of Covid pandemic in 2020 , that the Hong Kong Judiciary made the ' e-Lodgement Platform ' available , in addition to the one-way ' no-reply ' email accounts , and permitted temporarily the use of remote hearings . Only a very limited number of cases benefited from the aforementioned adjustments . <p> Development of e-Services of the Hong Kong Courts have been slow-moving , which led to a near collapse of the Judicial System in Hong Kong during the outbreak of the Covid Pandemic . In 2020 , 18% of all court cases were severely delayed and impacted . In the midst of the fifth wave in April 2022 , the problem was exacerbated as the Courts went further to announce they would no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to the receiving and delivering of electronic documents , and rejected the use of email correspondences , all of which led to turmoil in the judicial system . During the same period , the use of electronic documents had been adopted by various arbitration organisations in Hong Kong without causing any problems . As commonly known , arbitration is to be kept strictly confidential . We are yet to hear any problems relating to confidentiality arising from the use of electronic documents and systems even in the aftermath of the fifth wave . Is there any legitimate basis as to why the Courts in Hong Kong , which are supposed to act in an open and transparent manner , to find the use of electronic documents problematic ? <p> The neighbouring countries , including Singapore , Dubai and Mainland , have led progressive reforms on the digitalisation of their Court systems , leaving Hong Kong far behind . Singapore pioneered in adopting the electronic filing system as early as 2000s . In Mainland , online remote hearings have long been materialised and widely adopted . They went further as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into record reports , these records would then be handed over to both parties of prosecution and defence for confirmation purposes at the end of the same day . The use of such digital devices and technologies in the courts significantly shortened the time needed to process legal documents and correspondences . <p> Another longstanding problem is lack of judges in Hong Kong . Justice delayed is justice denied - the excessively long waiting time for court hearing to be scheduled after filing a claim , the delay in giving judgement , the low efficiency of prosecution , all exacerbated the problem . According to the Hong Kong Judiciary Annual Reports in the past years , it has indicated that the average waiting time for a civil hearing is over 90 up to 180 days . The average waiting time for a criminal hearing to be scheduled in the High Court is 383 days . Lawyers also pointed out that for some cases , judgements were only handed down one to three years after the hearings were completed . <p> According to the ' 2020 Benchmark Study on the Earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of barristers and senior counsels were willing to serve in the Judiciary of Hong Kong . Earnings of district judge and magistrate were 7% and 19% , respectively , higher than that of those working as barrister with the equivalent years of practice . Two questions were at stake here : for those barristers wished to have become judges , and judges received comparatively more attractive earnings , why is it the case that the Judiciary suffered from lack of judges for such a long period of time ? Should there be investigative research into the matters ? <p> As a practising lawyer for more than thirty years , I find the situation astonishing and concerning - for we pride ourselves over the rule of law in Hong Kong , because we have impartial , just and fair procedures in the Courts . The lack of judges and prosecutors might lead to irreparable damage to rule of law , but these problems are not without solutions . <p> In December 2022 , together with the legal industry , I conducted a questionnaire on ' Most Concerned Topics Surrounding Development of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court Hearing to be Scheduled ' and ' Expediting Digitalisation of Courts ' , were rated as the most concerned legal topics by 56% and 48% of lawyers respectively . <p> Do we attribute the problems to the lack of money , or inefficiency of decision makers ? I stand firmly in believing the HKSAR Government , with their best endeavours , support fully in upholding rule of law in Hong Kong . I have been reassured by the Financial Secretary , Mr Paul Chan , that the HKSAR Government would always make available funds needed for the Judiciary upon requests . For the Judiciary remains one of the most important branch of the government , financial constraint should , and would be , always out of the equation . <p> Hong Kong Courts need to move on from Dino Age . We should act promptly , having evaluated the current legal system in Hong Kong , to complete the mission as prescribed in the Fourteenth National Five-Year Plan handed down by the Central Government in a competent manner , and to fully develop Hong Kong as the ' Centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asia-Pacific Region , and a world renowned legal service centre providing unparalleled and exceptional legal services .

@@96935234 <h> Thailand draft paves way for foreign land ownership <p> China 's property market witnessed overall decline in 2022 , with real estate investment shrinking in a bottoming market . Increasing opportunities along the Belt and Road Initiative are consequently directing the attention of Chinese property developers to Southeast Asia , where Thailand is favoured as one of the most attractive destinations for foreign investors . <p> However , since Thai law strictly restricts foreign ownership of land in principle , acquiring land ownership has been a key hurdle to investing in real estate . <p> But on 25 October 2022 , the Thai cabinet approved a draft ministerial regulation that , for the first time , allows foreigners to purchase land in Thailand as individuals , giving them direct ownership of land . Although the draft has yet to be officially implemented , it signals Thailand 's intention to green-light foreign ownership of land , opening up new investment channels for Chinese property developers . <p> Based on the draft , the authors analyse the main ways that Chinese property developers can acquire land ownership in Thailand . <h> OWNERSHIP AS INDIVIDUALS <p> The draft allows foreigners who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rai ( 1,600 square metres ) of land in Thailand as individuals . <p> Investor eligibility requirements .

Target land should be located in Bangkok , Pattaya city , a municipal area ( Khet Thetsaban ) , or a designated residential area , under the city planning act . The area must be situated outside any designated military safety zone . <p> Requirements on amount and term of historical investments . Foreign investors should hold long-term resident ( LTR ) visas and have invested at least THB40 million ( USD1.2 million ) in Thailand in the form of government bonds , real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) , infrastructure bonds , or investment in companies eligible for investment promotion incentives at least three years before applying to buy land . <p> Clearly , the draft is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese property developers , it is still necessary to examine " suitable candidates " and related arising risks . <p> Importantly , the draft has not yet been officially implemented , and detailed rules are still in the process of formulation . However , eligibility requirements for investors and restrictions on historical investment will likely change in the future . <p> Since the stability of this policy remains to be seen , it is suggested that Chinese property developers keep abreast of latest policy developments to ensure early planning for investment . <h> EXEMPTION FROM RESTRICTIONS <p> Foreign investors obtaining approval of the Board of Investment Promotion ( BOI ) or the Industrial Estate Authority of Thailand ( IEAT ) can circumvent general restrictions under Thai law to directly acquire land ownership . <p> BOI Approval . Under Thailand 's Investment Promotion Act and the Act Promulgating the Land Code , the BOI can approve foreign investors to acquire ownership of land to carry out BOI promotion projects , but it shall not be used for any other purposes . <p> IEAT Approval .

However , upon termination of industrial activities , or within three years after transfer of the relevant project , the land owned by the foreign investor shall be returned to the IEAT or transferred to a qualified transferee . <p> From a practical point of view , to obtain approval from the BOI and IEAT , foreign investors usually need to make commitments to post-investment matters , such as minimum capital requirements and technology transfer plans , in addition to meeting mandatory requirements of Thai law . <p> Therefore , it is suggested that before making investment decisions , Chinese property developers should communicate with the BOI and IEAT , confirm whether the proposed investment projects are eligible for exemption from land ownership restrictions , and understand the project adaptability requirements and attitude of the competent authorities so as to establish , improve and effectively implement an investment plan that meets BOI and IEAT requirements . <h> JVs TO OWN LAND <p> Chinese property developers may take a " roundabout way " to own land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Thai partner and acquiring land ownership in the name of the JV , thereby owning land indirectly . <p> The foreign investor 's shareholding in the JV shall not exceed 49% , and the number of foreign shareholders in the JV shall not be more than half of the total . <p> It is worth noting that the Act Promulgating the Land Code prohibits foreign investors from owning Thai land through a nominee , which means the above-mentioned Thai partner shall be a beneficial owner of the JV , and the Chinese investor shall not hold shares in the JV through a nominee . <p> Any violation will be subject to three years ' imprisonment and/or a fine of THB100,000 to THB1 million , with a daily maximum fine of THB10,000 to THB50,000 during the violation period . <p> In this way , although the Thai party has a majority stake in the JV , the Chinese property developer can consider establishing restrictive contracts within the company and reasonably planning the internal governance structure , maximising rights and interests of the Chinese party for de-facto control over the JV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , the draft provides a new approach to investing in real estate in Thailand .

@@96935235 <h> Compensation for breaching ' hukou ' employment period <p> In China 's job market , many employers seek to attract and retain talent by assisting recruits to obtain local " hukou " , the official household registration that formally identifies an individual as a resident of the area . As hukou is closely tied to a person 's education , job and housing prospects , its derived benefits are especially enticing in cities like Beijing . <p> To retain talent and dissuade new recruits from leaving as soon as hukou is obtained , employers often insist on a hukou-related employment service period , with a default penalty for breaching it . <p> This article takes Beijing as a prime example and analyses how courts approach disputes arising from employees breaching the service period agreement after receiving their assisted hukou . <h> HUKOU SERVICE PERIOD <p> Service period refers to a timeframe of continual labour relationship agreed between the employer and employee with special binding effects on the employee as a result of special benefits . Article 22 of the Labour Contract Law states : " Where an employer pays special training expenses for the special technical training of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his employees to specify their service time period . " <p> Does this provision technically rule out service periods established over special treatment other than technical training , such as hukou ? Courts in Beijing do not necessarily think so . Considering the provision an authorising norm , they believe it entitles employers to decide whether to set a service period after technical training , but does not restrict such training as the only valid premise of a service period . <p> No small number of employers set service periods with new employees on providing housing or hukou . From the perspective of social effect , arbitrary invalidation of all service periods other than those related to technical training would destabilise other labour relationships and violate the principle of fairness . <p> Therefore , employers should consider applicable requirements under article 22 of the Labour Contract Law when determining rights and obligations on both sides after providing special treatment equal in weight to technical training . <p> In addition , according to the Minutes of the Seminar Held by the Beijing High People 's Court and Beijing Arbitration Committee Concerning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employer requires payment of default penalty based on its agreement on service period and default penalty with the employee after assisting the employee with local household registration , such a requirement should not be supported . However , if the employee has verifiably violated the principle of good faith and caused damages to the employer , he/she should make compensation . " <p> Clearly , on one hand Beijing courts do not support hukou-related default penalties based on restrictions over penalty under article 25 of the Labour Contract Law . But by not negating the validity of hukou service periods , they nevertheless leave the door open for employers to claim monetary compensation for sustained damages . <h> DEFINING COMPENSATION <p> The consensus among Beijing courts and arbitral tribunals is that where the employer has helped its recruited employee obtain local hukou , with a service period agreed , if the employee caused damages to the employer by breaching the principle of good faith , he/she should compensate . <p> For example , in Kang Jie v Anxin Property &amp; Casualty Insurance ( 2021 ) , the Second Intermediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kang , the employee , was a scarce resource and form of special treatment that Anxin , the employer , was under no legal obligation to provide . <p> On a voluntary basis , Kang entered into a supplementary agreement with Anxin , agreeing to the five-year service period . Kang 's premature departure was not only a breach of good faith , but would also inevitably cause company losses of hukou quota , time , manpower and capital , as well as negatively affect its internal management and staff stability . Accordingly , Kang was held liable for her breach of contract . <p> Based on judgments researched by the authors , where employers are unable to provide evidence of sustained damages , courts determine a compensation amount based on the principles of fairness and good faith . Comparisons may be made between actual length of service and period originally committed , and remuneration of the hukou-obtaining employee compared to employees of similar seniority and qualifications without hukou assistance . Loss of talent and the amount of agreed default penalty or service pay are also used as references @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for losses -- including recruitment costs , training expenses , costs incurred for hukouregistration , direct economic losses and other indirect losses -- courts tend to base their decision on the relevancy of the employee 's departure to such losses , as well as probative value of the evidence . <p> Comparing verdicts of Beijing courts before the pandemic , it can be seen that the amount of supported default penalty for breaching the hukouservice period is rising , with a recent case compensating RMB300,000 ( USD44,300 ) .

@@98986239 <h> Fundamental rights and internet gatekeepers -- A new dawn <p> Technology is acting as a disruptor across all spheres : social , economic , and legal . Constitutional rights jurisprudence has not been untouched by industrial revolution 4.0 . Recent decisions of constitutional courts , worldwide , have arisen from or related to rapid technological developments and their impact on fundamental rights . <p> The Constitution of India has dynamically evolved , and it now recognises fundamental rights , including the right to privacy , marriage , and access to the internet . With emerging technology , Indian courts are compelled to either mould existing constitutional principles to new scenarios or replace the obsolete older doctrine with evolving ones . <p> Traditionally , courts have enforced constitutional rights vertically only against state actors . However , with a shift from laissez faire to welfare governance models , countries have recognised the horizontal effect and are enforcing constitutional rights even against non-state actors , thus , ensuring adequate protection of fundamental rights . Countries with newer constitutions like South Africa , directly recognise the horizontal effect in the Bill of Rights and prohibit unfair discrimination by individuals . Others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , and Germany have adopted an indirect horizontal effect through judicial decision-making or legislation . <p> In India , fundamental rights violation by non-state actors is addressed through certain constitutional provisions or indirectly through legislation and judicial precedents . Direct horizontal enforcement is provided in the constitution , under articles 15(2) , access to public places ; 17 , untouchability ; 23 , forced labour , and 24 , employment of children . These provisions aim to fulfil the constitutional promise of maintaining socio-economic equality . However , the increase in public-private interface and the significant impact of non-state actors on fundamental rights , particularly on the freedoms under article 19 , and right to life and personal liberty under article 21 , have widened the scope of horizontal enforcement . <p> In enforcing horizontal rights , courts have awarded damages and passed orders against : non-state entities violating the right to a clean environment ; private airlines discriminating against disabled passengers ; private colleges discharging public educational functions . It has directed private employers to protect women 's fundamental rights in the workplace ; and obligated doctors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasoning behind these decisions is that private players perform public duties or discharge statutory functions which affect citizens ' rights , and hence , such non-state actors should be held to the same standards as public entities performing such functions . <p> A close reading of part III of the constitution reveals peculiar distinctions , possibly retained deliberately by the constitution framers . While certain rights provide for directives against the state alone , others , such as articles 15(2) ( a ) and ( b ) , 17 , 20(2) , 21 , 23 , 24 , 29(2) are conferred on persons/ citizens , without merely being enforceable against the state . Violation of any other fundamental right , not listed above , leaves individuals to pursue common law remedies against non-state entities . <p> The above position changed when the Supreme Court in Justice KS Puttaswamy ( Retd ) v Union Of India expanded the horizontal effect by placing a duty on both state and non-state actors to protect the right to privacy . The court recognised that the state must , through legislation , protect the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Supreme Court in Kaushal Kishore v State of Uttar Pradesh held that articles 19 and 21 are enforceable against persons other than the state and its agencies . The decision recognises the reality where state monopoly is being replaced by private players such as intermediaries and internet service providers , thereby , requiring a paradigm shift in part III enforcement against private actors . The judgment also calls for creating a legal framework that defines constitutional torts , breaches of which would be remedied by courts . <p> In the age of the internet , private players often infringe rights including , privacy , speech , trade , and business . Therefore , if fundamental rights are unenforceable against internet gatekeepers , these rights will be compromised . Dominant technology giants deal in data , impact free speech , control market accessibility , and the right to trade .

Amid a slow but steady recovery , many countries worldwide have been facing a food and energy crisis exacerbated by the Russia-Ukraine conflict . Profoundly affected by the economic turmoil followed by political uncertainty , investors have been urged to review and refine their investment strategies and countries to invest in . <p> In the meantime , Japanese multinationals , among the world 's largest investors , are still struggling against the economic crisis triggered by the pandemic , with FDI outflows virtually halving by 49% to USD116 billion in 2020 from USD227 billion in 2019 , contributing to FDI stocks of USD1.98 trillion in 2021 , according to the report . <p> FDI inflows to Japan also remain low compared to most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flows declined by 30% to USD10.7 billion in 2020 , reaching USD24.65 billion in 2021 .

In 2020 , the government issued an action plan concerning business and human rights requiring business enterprises and associations to protect and respect the international human rights regime . The government also issued the Guidelines on Respecting Human Rights in Responsible Supply Chains in 2022 . <p> Japanese multinationals , while focused on investments in various jurisdictions , are gradually becoming aware of the considerable influence of their investments on human rights .

" asks Tim Hamlett . <p> This is intended , according to " sources " , to turn Hong Kong into a higher education hub . Another hub ? Are we getting a bit hub-happy ? <p> University students at the Chinese University of Hong Kong , on August , 31 , 2023 . Photo : Kyle Lam/HKFP . <p> The move will raise the share of non-locals in the student body to 40 per cent , or from the current 15,000 to -- presumably -- something in the region of 30,000 . To put it another way of the 15,000 University Grants Committee ( UGC ) -funded bachelor 's degree places available each year the number reserved for non-locals will increase from 3,000 to 6,000 . <p> The announcement came with some painfully obvious efforts to spin it in a nice way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , would not be affected because " non-locals enrol through non-JUPAS avenues " . This is nonsense . The way in which local students will be affected has nothing to do with the admissions system . They will be affected because 3,000 places which were previously available to them will be offered instead to other people . <p> Universities , said " sources " would be encouraged to recruit students from Southeast Asian countries and " regions participating in the Belt and Road initiative to avoid the non-local quota being monopolised by mainland students " . <p> Belt and Road Initiative . Photo : GovHK . <p> At the moment three quarters of the " non-locals " admitted are from the mainland . <p> This is likely to continue to be the case . Local universities now have lots of experience of recruiting students for " self-funded " ( or as they say in the outside world , profit-making ) post-graduate courses . The mainland market has many advantages . <p> The main one is that it is big . Advertise in a few publications , put up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " higher education fairs " in big cities , and you are contacting a very large number of potential customers . <p> Other markets are small , further away , have few people rich enough to contemplate sending their children to Hong Kong for four years -- even if we are covering tuition -- and need to be addressed in different local languages . <p> So mainlanders it will be . This is not a complaint . During my teaching years I encountered three waves of mainlanders and they were all generally nice kids in different ways . <p> Students at the University of Hong Kong . File photo : Kyle Lam/HKFP . <p> We started with a few carefully picked individuals on lavish scholarships . They were selected with great care and although some mainland academics said rather snootily that , of course , they would n't send their very best students to Hong Kong , detecting academic promise in 17-year-olds is not an exact science and these students were excellent . <p> They were often the most successful student in their classes and went on to win prizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were the offspring of parents who could afford it . They were a pleasant enough bunch but a lot of them seemed to have come to Hong Kong primarily for the shopping . The result was unexpected . My local students had been quite happy to see mainlanders hogging the academic limelight and seemed to regard them respectfully as interesting , but with a deficient sense of work-life balance . <p> The third wave was the intake to our local version of the taught master 's degree . They were an educated bunch obviously . A degree was a requirement . Many of them seemed to have been very lucky in their English examinations though . <p> Hong Kong Baptist University . Photo : GovHK . <p> One year I was lucky enough to have a Norwegian student who spoke fluent Putonghua and reported to me after the first class that the mainlanders had been horrified at how difficult my accent was . There is nothing wrong with my accent . I was a paid broadcaster for many years . I can only conclude that this is what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that many of the new non-locals will be mainlanders is not the main problem . Clearly 3,000 places disappearing from JUPAS Joint University Programmes Admissions System would make it harder for locals to get places . If the places are not taken from the JUPAS system , then universities are going to have to cater for a larger population . <p> Two legislative members offered comforting thoughts . Chow Man-kong ( education ) who works at the Education University , thought the quota should go up to 50 per cent , adding that many lecture halls were big enough to accommodate a few more students . Prof Chow had not been reading the small print . If the quota goes up but the student population does not there is no need for larger lecture halls . <p> Lingnan Universality professor Lau Chi-pong said the influx would not hinder local students ' search for dormitories as " these non-locals would have to settle their accommodation before coming here and Hong Kong 's public transport system is well developed . " But he added incoherently " no matter how far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of their accommodation . " <p> Clearly some people , possibly including the chief executive , have not sorted out the details yet . Will the increased quota require a decreased quota for locals ? If not , will the universities be provided with more money ? UGC courses are massively subsidised . Do we really want to spend oodles of money on educating other people 's children ? Will the non-local students have priority for student dormitories , upon arrival or for the whole course ? <p> Above all is there a market for this ? Prof Chow suggested that the government should set up a centralised student recruiting agency , which suggests a certain lack of confidence . This would " target top students and those from the middle class " . An interesting notion . Does Prof Chow 's university , one wonders , prefer students from the middle class ? And is that even legal ? <p> The problem which nobody dares to mention , of course , is that the attractions of Hong Kong as a high education destination for mainlanders have wilted somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects like history , politics and journalism in ways which simply could not be found in mainland universities .

They mark the first administrative-level regulatory framework for the private fund industry . <p> Article 3(3) of the regulations states : " Private fund managers that manage and use private fund assets , private fund custodians that take custody of private fund assets , and private fund service institutions that provide private fund services , shall comply with the provisions of laws and administrative regulations , devote themselves to their duties , and fulfil their obligations of honesty , trustworthiness , prudence , and diligence . " <p> This article explores the disclosure and diligence obligations in cases where private funds employ an indirect investment approach . It draws insights from the regulations and relevant legal cases . <h> Prone to disputes <p> In transactional practice , investors and managers in private funds commonly establish their investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They provide limited details on the path to achieving the investments . <p> This approach allows fund managers to design various transaction structures to navigate real-world obstacles when deploying capital . Frequently , there are multiple layers of transactions before achieving the desired ownership structure in the target company . This general approach affords fund managers greater flexibility for selecting investment strategies to meet their objectives . <p> However , even sophisticated private fund investors frequently struggle to accurately perceive or fully grasp the intricacies of these relatively complex investment structures . In cases where a fund 's performance falls short and anticipated returns remain unrealised , investors may argue that the manager failed to meet its disclosure and diligence obligations , seeking compensation for the loss or even seeking to terminate the contract . <h> Obliged to disclose <p> Article 11 of the regulations stipulates that private fund managers are obligated to provide investors with information on fund management activities as agreed in the fund contract . <p> Regarding the question of whether it is necessary to disclose the underlying transaction structure of indirect investments , current judicial practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund contract does not explicitly outline the matters that require disclosure , the information does not significantly impact investors ' legitimate rights and interests . Therefore , this information does not need to be extensively disclosed . <p> For instance , in Xu Linzhen v Shenzhen Superstar Dragon Venture Capital Fund Management Partnership and The Bank of Shanghai Beijing branch , the court pointed out that the fund 's investment status primarily revolved around whether the actual use of the fund 's assets aligned with the contractual agreements about investment direction , investment scope and specific projects . <p> This mainly refers to the investment direction of the raised funds and the investment amounts . It does not encompass the specifics of the underlying transaction structure , nor does it delve into the precise operations of the fund unless the fund contract imposes a mandatory obligation for detailed disclosure or involves a " material matter that could impact the interests of the fund 's principals " . <p> Furthermore , a mere breach of information disclosure obligations by the manager does not automatically translate into liability for compensation . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causal link between a manager 's breach of disclosure obligation and their losses . <p> Consequently , most courts tend to attribute investors ' losses to the inherent risks of their investments , which are not directly connected to disclosure obligation . They rule that the manager does not need to bear the responsibility of compensation . <h> Duty of diligence <p> Chinese judicial practice widely recognises that the foundational relationship between an investor and a manager is fiduciary in nature . The regulations designate the Trust Law as the upper-tier law and specify that private fund assets remain distinct from those of the manager . Grounded in the principles of the Trust Law , managers should enjoy greater freedom in determining how to employ these entrusted assets . In judicial practice , when managers employ indirect investment strategies through multi-tier transactions that do not substantially affect the applicant , and they ultimately invest in predefined targets , courts are generally hesitant to conclude that a manager has breached the terms of the fund agreement . <p> For instance , in the case of Shanghai Duomi Private Fund Management v @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dispute between the investor and the manager regarding the appropriateness of the investment scope boiled down to the distinction between direct and indirect investments . <p> The critical factor in assessing the reasonableness of the investment approach was whether it aligned with the agreed-upon investment scope . Consequently , the court considered the manager 's investment approach was reasonable . <p> Furthermore , the court noted that factors such as the suspension and subsequent significant price fluctuations in company stock trading had led to a concentration of liquidity risk . As a result , the losses incurred were not causally linked to the manager 's investment strategy . <p> When investors claim a manager has breached its diligence duty , they often seek damages and contract termination to recover their entire principal investment and exit the fund . <p> In judicial practice , courts tend to adopt a cautious approach towards terminating fund contracts in consideration of preserving the overall integrity of the fund 's assets . Typically , courts will rule that the conditions for fundamental breach are not met and , therefore , the fund contract can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it becomes evident that a court will only order the termination of a contract when the manager 's fundraising , investment or management activities significantly deviate from the agreement or legal provisions , leading to a complete failure of the investor 's investment objectives without jeopardising the overall integrity of the private fund 's assets .

@@103354236 <h> Rulings on claim for partial rescission of a contract <p> As a special form of commercial contract termination , partial rescission is a legal tool to protect the legitimate rights and interests of parties while ensuring stability of the transaction , providing a flexible solution for the contract to achieve the legal consequences of termination of some of the contractual rights and obligations . <p> However , the application of partial rescission is not without limitations , and leads to many commercial contract disputes . In this article , the author discusses limitations of the application of partial release , and how the court decides relevant requests . <p> Articles 631 to 633 and article 729 of the Civil Code are generally considered as the direct legal basis of applying partial rescission . These provisions specify the main applicable circumstances for partial rescission as follows : a contract may be partially rescinded due to non-compliance of any ancillary component of the subject matter , or non-compliance of one of the items constituting the subject matter ; or when the seller delivers the subject matter in instalments . If the instalments can not realise the contract purpose , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to these provisions , the primary condition for determining whether a contract can be partially rescinded is to assess whether part of the subject matter -- or the performance of rights and obligations -- deviates from the agreed terms , resulting in partial inability to achieve the purpose of the contract . <p> In contrast , under article 563 of the Civil Code , regarding " contract rescission " , the key factor in determining whether a contract can be partially rescinded lies in assessing whether the contract can be performed in a divisible manner , and whether the remedies for breach can be separated . <p> " Divisibility of contract performance " refers to the ability to divide the contractual object and perform the contractual obligations in a divisible manner . <p> Article 51 of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods recognises the divisibility of sales contract performance . In reality , it is important to differentiate between " contracts that can be performed divisibly " and " contracts under which the subject matter is delivered in instalments " . If the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the multiple deliveries shall be regarded as a whole . <p> Besides , for a continuously performed contract , the period of obligations ' performance is severable . For example , when a lease contract can not be performed anymore , what has been irreversibly performed in the past carries corresponding consideration , while the unfulfilled part may be terminated . <h> Restrictive conditions <p> The application of partial rescission shall also consider the " proportionality of the remedies for breach of contract " , which means in compliance with the principle of proportionality , and is more beneficial to maintain transaction stability . <p> This is relevant to the restrictive conditions , i.e. partial rescission shall not : damage the main content of the contract ; lead to the failure to achieve the main purpose of the contract ; or cause serious imbalance between the rights and obligations of the parties . <p> This claim was overruled on the grounds that , " if the part of the contract to be rescinded constitutes the main content of the contract , or this partial rescission will frustrate the main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties ' rights and obligations and thus damage the legitimate rights and interests of the other party , such part can not be rescinded individually . Similar claims can not be supported . " <p> Article 470 of the Civil Code clearly defines the main contents of a contract . Therefore , the SPC held that partial rescission involving main contents may cause the entire rights and obligations under the contract to be unable to be performed , or the purpose of the contract completely unable to be achieved . Therefore , no request for partial rescission breaking the restrictive conditions shall be supported . <h> Judicial practice <p> In real cases , a claim for partial rescission of a contract is not only commonly made in divisible sales contracts , but also in other contracts concerning special subject matter , such as equity transfer contracts . <p> Disputes may easily arise as to rescinding part of the terms or rights and obligations . Consequently , the judiciaries would prudently apply this legal system and focus on examining the restrictive conditions . <p> For example , in disputes over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescinding part of the contract concerning a certain building or piece of land due to construction delay , project quality or other problems . <p> The judicial authorities generally consider the following three aspects for this kind of claim . First , the primary applying condition , the precondition for partial rescission , is the agreed obligations objectively can not be performed , thus the corresponding purpose can not be achieved . <p> Second , the key applying condition , namely the divisibility of the contract 's performance ; it is vital to assess whether the problematic part of the project can be separately constructed , settled or delivered , and whether there is no sequence relationship with other parts in terms of construction process . <p> Finally , the restrictive condition ; the judicial authorities would first consider the proportionality principle , measuring whether the problematic part owns special economic value , and whether partial rescission may significantly affect one party 's receivable profits and cause new loss . <p> Additionally , such rescission shall not damage the main content of the contract , or cause serious imbalance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if a party or third party has already fulfilled the main obligations , the claim for partial rescission , which impairs transaction stability , is generally not supported . <h> JOIN OUR FORUM <p> China Business Law Journal welcomes your responses to articles that appear in the Dispute Digest section .

These specific acts are significantly different from the equity before contribution deadlines that enjoy interest within the period but which is not yet contributed . <p> The third draft makes a clear distinction regarding shareholders ' liability between transfers of equity before contribution deadlines and defective contributions , and establishes two completely different sets of equity transfer rules . It avoids confusing application of civil and commercial law mindsets due to errors in the basis of claims . <p> The third draft specifies that in the case of equity transfer before contribution deadlines , the contribution liability shall be borne by the transferee , and the transferor shall bear supplementary liability to the extent of the transferee 's insufficient contribution . <p> The third draft delivers a heavy blow to acts of evading capital contribution liabilities and corporate debts through equity transfers , reflecting the value proposition of protecting transaction security and stabilising corporate governance structure . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies in recent years that prioritise financial and economic stability . <h> Transfer to third parties <p> Under the existing Company Law , the consent of other shareholders is required for the equity transfer of a limited liability company to a third party . <p> Referring to article 18 of Judicial Interpretation No.4 of the Company Law on equity transfer of a limited liability company under the same conditions , the third draft changes the provision that equity transfers of a limited liability company shall be subject to the consent of other shareholders to the obligation of the transferor to notify other shareholders in writing . <p> The written notice shall set out the transfer quantity , price , payment method and period , and safeguard other shareholders ' priority to purchase the shares . <p> In judicial practice , some companies impose disguised restrictions or prohibitions on the rights of shareholders , especially small and medium ones , to freely transfer their shares by free agreement in articles of association . <p> The third draft deletes the clause that equity transfer to a third party requires the consent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice , allowing free equity transfer of limited liability companies to safeguard their capital-joining nature and reserving a pathway for small and medium shareholders to withdraw through equity transfer . This is of practical significance in activating market economic activities and distinctly embodies the legislative idea to resolve existing problems in the trial . <h> Equity changes in effect <p> The third draft stipulates the procedures and effective time of equity changes , clarifies the obligation of the transferor shareholder to notify other shareholders and the right to request the company to change equity registration , and grants the transferor and transferee the right to seek judicial remedies . <p> Based on the provisions of article 32 of the current Company Law on the list of shareholders , the third draft specifies that the effective time of equity change shall be the time when the shareholders are registered in the list . <p> Existing judicial practice treats the change in equity ownership as a special kind of sale , applying the rules for sale contracts of movable assets in the Civil Code . Applying a civil law mindset to resolve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the time point for shareholders to acquire equity , and has led to an increase in equity transfer costs due to ambiguous equity ownership . <p> The third draft introduces the theory of corporate intervention to clarify the importance of the company in equity transfers and , on this basis , clarifies that the time point at which a shareholder acquires the equity is the time when his or her name is recorded in the shareholders ' list . This amendment aims to stabilise the corporate governance structure , which conforms to the human-joining nature of corporations and is a must to maintain market stability . <p> Jenny Gu is a senior partner at Brightstone Lawyers .

@@104198240 <h> Reciprocal arrangement on mainland , HK judgments <p> With continual progress in developing the Greater Bay Area vision and increasing number of arbitration and civil and commercial litigation cases involving mainland China and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region ( HKSAR ) , several mutual agreements have been signed to facilitate judicial convergence . <p> The author of this article compares and analyses major similarities and differences in the enforcement of such judgments between the two jurisdictions . <h> Legal basis <p> Among mutual recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards and judgments , the main agreements are : <p> Arbitration.The Arrangement for the Mutual Enforcement of Arbitral Awards between the mainland and the HKSAR and its Supplemental Arrangement ; and <p> Litigation . The Arrangement on Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters by the Courts of the mainland and the HKSAR pursuant to the Choice of Court Agreements between Parties Concerned ( the 2008 Judgment Arrangement , repealed ) , and the Arrangement on Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters by the Courts of the mainland and the HKSAR ( the 2019 Judgment Arrangement ) . <h> Enforceable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kong Arbitration Ordinance or the Arbitration Law of China , compared with provisions of the arbitration arrangement , the supplemental arbitration arrangement removes the restriction that mainland awards must be made by specific arbitral institutions , and lifts the limit on arbitration venue , further expanding the scope of institutions that may enforce arbitral awards . <p> It also incorporates ad hoc arbitrations and awards made in places other than Hong Kong and the mainland -- but under the Hong Kong Arbitration Ordinance or the Arbitration Law of China -- into the scope of enforcement . <p> Litigation.Civil and commercial cases under the laws of the mainland and the HKSAR , excluding specific cases such as succession , estate administration and distribution , and certain IP cases . <p> Comparison . Compared with the 2008 judgment arrangement , the 2019 version cancels the requirement to expressly agree in writing that the mainland or Hong Kong court has sole jurisdiction , and the enforcement includes criminal proceedings with an incidental civil litigation case and certain IP damages . <p> New arrangements for mutual legal assistance concerning arbitration and judgments in civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison , arbitration has a wider scope of application concerning contractual disputes . <p> Combined with the Arbitration Law of China ( Draft ) , which is currently under revision , mainland arbitration is likely to further engage in emerging areas such as international investment and sports arbitration , covering all " contractual disputes and other property right disputes between natural persons , legal persons and other organisations " in principle . <p> Tort disputes are often settled by court judgment only due to the lack of consent to arbitration . The highlights of the 2019 judgment arrangement are inclusion of the enforcement of most tort cases , and dual enforcement of judgments on criminal proceedings with an incidental civil litigation case . <h> Enforceable circumstances <p> Arbitration.The applicant may apply for enforcement to the court at the respondent 's domicile or the property 's location .

If the respondent has a domicile or enforceable property in both the mainland and the HKSAR , the applicant may apply to courts in the two places separately for enforcement . <p> Comparison . Separate enforcement of arbitral awards does not depend on prior knowledge of clues to the respondent 's enforceable property , but only on the existence of a domicile in both places , which is more conducive to in-depth investigation of clues to the respondent 's hidden property . <p> As for the enforcement of judgments , the applicant can apply to the court of his or her own domicile for the enforcement of Hong Kong awards , which is more convenient . <h> Non-enforcement <p> Arbitration . This mainly reviews due process of the arbitration procedure and excludes enforcement of content exceeding arbitral authority . <p> Litigation.The main emphasis is that the trial court 's jurisdiction over litigations needs to comply with due process under article 11 of the 2019 judgment arrangement , and must not conflict with a prior decision or judgment . <p> Comparison.In terms of the conditions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservations of rights based on fundamental legal principles and public interest and policies . <p> In the recent case of Song Lihua v Lee Chee Hon ( 2023 ) , such reservation has once again drawn the attention of the legal community .

This is a prominent manifestation of the differentiation of laws within the Greater Bay Area , which should be brought to the attention of the mainland arbitration community . <p> Comparatively , there are fewer cases of non-enforcement for arbitration between the mainland and Hong Kong , and it rarely involves a review of the merits of the case .

Vandana Chatlani explores just what tech is hot <p> Never enough hours in the day or staff for the job ? Legal technology promises to fill these gaps . But what works and why ? What , amongst the plethora of offerings , will be the one that makes the difference to your business ? As always , technology providers are working to develop the tools they hope will become indispensable to legal professionals . They entice law firms to buy their software if " being wrong is not an option " , promising that lawyers can " retrieve key information in a matter of minutes " and harness " powerful administrative software " to " manage their workflow process efficiently " . <p> Law firms have fitted technology to the entire spectrum of legal services . So , here is their wisdom on what works , from Indonesia to Japan , and India eastwards . <p> " Our firm has subscribed to quite a number of legal technologies ... to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispute resolution , " says David Cheng , a partner at Winston &amp; Strawn in Hong Kong . <p> Gaurav Bhalla , a partner at Ahlawat &amp; Associates in New Delhi , says technology is integral to his firm . " Legaltech has played a crucial role by streamlining processes , improving efficiency , enhancing client services , and helping lawyers stay competitive . " <p> Docketing and document management systems have helped LexOrbis organise , store and retrieve data and documents . The system prevents the loss of critical information and saves valuable time that can be better spent on legal work . <p> Vu Thi Thu Ha , director and managing partner at ATS Law Firm in Hanoi , says : " It is imperative for law firms in particular and the legal profession as a whole to adapt to the current trend of utilising technology .

" The key challenge for firms is to ensure that their process for selecting , implementing and evolving their technology is truly aligned with client needs and client expectations . " <p> Pravin Anand , the managing partner of Anand and Anand in New Delhi , calls the tech evolution a time of disruption . " Disruption is where innovation lies , " he says , adding that in India and beyond , " newer business models -- such as edtech , agritech , AI and the metaverse -- call for the legal industry to take off the baggage of the old and embrace the new " . <p> Anand says he believes that all law firm services -- apart from the qualitative aspects of people management , the crafting of legal strategies , and negotiations with counterparties -- should be handled using legaltech . " This decade will see lawyers turning into coders , or working very closely with coders , to come up with tech systems and designs to serve the unique needs of a particular project or client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the region have subscribed to local and global legal databases for research . It is no surprise that this area receives the greatest investment and focus , given the complexity of laws , regulations , policies and legal precedents lawyers are sifting through daily . <p> Chloe Lee Jung-Myung , a partner at Lee &amp; Ko in Seoul , cites certain websites that have been helpful to her , particularly for legal research . These include : South Korean online legal information and education provider LawnB.com ; the Korean Law Information Centre , law.go.kr ; and legal data search service Lbox.kr , which allows users to search over 1.7 million court rulings . " I can check the latest laws and regulations as well as court precedents and legal theses , which help with thorough legal reviews , " she says . <p> As of December 2022 , more than one third of domestic lawyers in South Korea were using Lbox , according to Korea Tech Desk .

Legal databases are widely used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and help prepare for both contentious and non-contentious matters . <p> Khong Siong Sie , a partner at Jason Teoh &amp; Partners in Kuala Lumpur , relies on : Lexis Advance Malaysia and CLJ Legal Network for legal research and precedents ; Lex Scout to search for lawsuits and judgments in Peninsular Malaysia ; Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka for its dictionary and translation ; and CoreMatter for cloud-based legal practice management and its integrated accounting and billing system . Daily use of these tools has improved the firm 's efficiency and accuracy . <p> " Part of the annual budget is to invest in legaltech , " says Khong . <p> Dhaka-based Fazal Munif , a senior associate at Shafique and Associates , puts his trust in court databases to keep track of ongoing applications and cases before the Supreme Court of Bangladesh .

" We would rather use a third party that provides high-quality and efficient services rather than developing legaltech ourselves . " <p> Jonathan Tan , an associate director at Helmsman in Singapore , says his firm benefits from software such as CoreMatter for practice management and billing , NetDocs for documents synced with CoreMatter , and Lexis as a legal search engine .

" Each firm will have its needs , dictated by the market in which they 're operating and their clientele , so it is not necessary to enter into panic mode and invest indiscriminately . " <p> Others are mindful of the costs and are prepared to survey existing options before leaping to create their own software . " I do n't see any law firm , however big , having sufficient funds to create its own all-encompassing bespoke legaltech , " says Voon Keat Lai , managing partner of MB Kemp in Hong Kong . " All firms will probably have to subscribe to a range of legaltech from specialist companies .

But others remain on the fence , unnerved by privacy and data protection concerns , costs , training requirements and a culture change that is necessary to properly embrace and institutionalise new technology . <p> For Mayank Arya , founder and COO at Ashwathh Legal in New Delhi , " overcoming organisational inertia and change management struggles " is paramount . " For legacy law firms and some attorneys , especially senior partners , adopting legaltech can be seen as undermining their status or role , " he says . " There may be cultural resistance and lack of understanding of technology . " <p> Rich Lin , a partner at LCS &amp; Partners in Taipei , highlights issues that lawyers must contend with when engaging with legaltech , including : data privacy and security ; liability for IP infringement ; the reliability and accuracy of results generated by AI ; and an over-reliance on legaltech leading to a loss of client rapport and inadequate training for new associates . <p> Luky Walalangi , the managing partner of Walalangi &amp; Partners in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyers may lose some of their critical reasoning if they rely too heavily on AI tools . " Our capability to write and independently analyse an issue would deteriorate with too much dependence on legaltech , such as AI , " he reasons . " Lawyers must be assigned to do certain things on their own to help them continuously sharpen their writing and analytical skills . " <p> The question of cost is also a cause for resistance to legaltech . " Cutting-edge legaltech today still remains expensive , " notes Sudhir Ravindran , CEO of Altacit Global in Chennai . Ravindran predicts a greater uptake by firms once the tech becomes cheaper and more accessible . <p> " Adopting legaltech solutions can involve costs related to purchasing , implementing and training users on new technologies , " says Edward Liu , a partner at Haiwen &amp; Partners in Hong Kong . " It may require initial investment , ongoing maintenance and potential disruptions to existing workflows . " He suggests evaluating cost-effectiveness and suitability as a means of mitigating these challenges , as well as phased implementation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hesitant to invest in tech solutions because of the effort required to incorporate new software into existing systems . For boutique firms that often have a smaller bandwidth to handle HR , management and operational matters , ironing out such compatibility issues can seem a gargantuan task . <p> " For smaller law firms , the initial investment in legaltech tools and training can be significant , and integration with existing systems and workflows can be complex , " says Singh , at LexOrbis . <p> Maria Sagrado , managing partner at Makarim &amp; Taira S in Jakarta , uses Prohukum for accounting and to manage lawyers ' timesheets . " We have not used legal tools or tech for our work , " she says . " We only use apps more to support our internal management . " <p> Despite this , she believes familiarity with these tools is vital as their usage increases . " Otherwise , we will be left behind and probably our legal fees will be affected by those using this technology , " she says . <p> Agung Santoso , a partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses Prohukum and Hukumonline alongside Microsoft Teams and Zoom , says he is not reluctant to use various tech solutions , as long as they are closely supervised by lawyers . He also remains cautious about investing heavily in legaltech . " Better wait and see , rather than become the pioneer and thus undergo a process of trial and error , " he says . <p> Another point of worry regards AI . Opinions are divided , with some law firms turning to AI software to assist with legal research , drafting and case analysis to simplify legalese , customise legal documents , scan and analyse large volumes of legal data , automate contract drafting and provide predictive analytics . <p> But not all lawyers are convinced of AI 's merits . Some are sceptical of its use and believe that further tinkering and advancement is needed to improve its dependability . While acknowledging AI 's extraordinary capacity for big data analysis , Shang Dongning , Foshan-based director of legal management at Midea Real Estate Group , is less than confident in its ability to go much further . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laws to each unique scenario , where even the tiniest details can lead to wildly different conclusions , " he says . <p> " ChatGPT , on the other hand , relies solely on data analysis and filtering to perceive and respond to everything , lacking the in-depth reasoning and thinking behind legal theories . " <p> Kritika Krishnamurthy , the founding partner at AK &amp; Partners in New Delhi , says AI has yet to contribute to legal research positively . In her view , experienced professionals are still relying on reading the law and coming to their own interpretations . <p> " We are wary of AI throwing wrong answers at junior associates who come to us with ready-baked shallow research , " she says . " We have experimented with AI in-house and found the present version not useable , except for short tasks like coming up with more interesting titles to articles . " <p> In addition , many emphasise the importance of ensuring AI systems are used responsibly and ethically . <p> " AI has a significant role , however the challenge is its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief digital officer at Khaitan &amp; Co in Gurugram . " For example , using ChatGPT is easy but it is vital to ensure that we do not compromise client data or get carried away by results . We must have checks and balances in place . " <h> Future focus <p> The adoption of legaltech also depends on developers ' abilities to assist with user-friendliness and interoperability . This is mainly because it is tricky to find one platform that can serve all of a law firm 's needs . As a result , firms often use a mix of legaltech solutions and tools , and each of these has its own way of organising data . This complicates how information across platforms is integrated . <p> Lawyers also call for developers to consider local realities when designing tech tools . " Legaltech needs to be adaptive to the needs to each country , " says Ashraful Hadi , a partner at Alliance Laws in Dhaka . " One size does not fit all . " <p> In the Vietnamese context , for example , while lawyers can use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the software can not read Vietnamese , notes DNA Vietnam 's Lieu Dang . <p> The situation is similar in Thailand . " Although legaltech should ideally lessen the time lawyers spend on any particular work , we found it is not the case , " says Sujittra Vesvarut , the marketing and professional development manager at Thanathip &amp; Partners Legal Counsellors in Bangkok . " Thai language is not supported and lawyers still need to review and verify the product , which sometimes is even more time-consuming than to produce the entire draft legal documents by themselves in the first place . " <p> Developers may also profit from consultations with legal professionals to tailor tech solutions appropriately . Susan Munro , a registered foreign lawyer at K&amp;L Gates in Hong Kong , would like to see more accuracy and nuance from legaltech providers . " Persons who design programs generally have no understanding of law , " she observes . <p> While acknowledging that legal databases in China are improving by the day , Zhang Xiaotong , Beijing-based legal manager at Sinopec Capital , calls for stronger statistical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differ , he wants to see a database capable of telling him how many courts went with opinion A , and how many with opinion B. <p> Toshifumi Onuki , a partner at TMI Associates in Tokyo , hopes to see AI-related services that help draft patents or come up with best ways to respond to official actions . <p> Li Yanhong , Shenzhen-based legal director at Towngas Energy Investment , is on the lookout for AI-enabled legaltech to " analyse possible judgment results of cases , based on the database and precedents , and provide reference opinions for litigators to formulate strategies " . <p> Beyond serving the immediate requirements of law firms , legaltech also has the potential to serve a wider purpose and population in improving the function and efficiency of legal systems worldwide . <p> " Legaltech should focus on improving access to justice by making legal services more affordable and accessible to underserved populations , " says Rashi Suri , the managing partner of Upscale Legal in New Delhi . <h> Staying relevant <p> Law firms that do n't stay ahead of the tech curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by their clients . In-house lawyers are increasingly leaning on legaltech to curb spending on external counsel . Those in fields such as tech , e-commerce and the thriving startup ecosystem are more likely to partner lawyers and firms that can show their tech savviness . <p> " Clients are increasingly looking for more efficient and cost-effective legal services , " says Suhas Tuljapurkar , the founder and director of Legasis in Mumbai . " Law firms that can leverage legaltech to provide faster and more accurate services may be more attractive to clients . " <p> At the same time , many lawyers remain steadfast in their view that technology can offer clients only so much . <p> While law firms may see fewer requests for tasks that can be automated and streamlined such as document review , contract analysis , or legal research , the demand for specialised legal advice could rise , says Liu . <p> " The role of lawyers in providing strategic counsel , advocacy , negotiation and complex legal work remains critical and is less likely to be fully replaced by legaltech . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Delhi , says AI is unlikely in the near future to replace the highly skilled and value-added services that IP lawyers provide , such as patent drafting , prosecution , opposition , appeal and infringement matters . <p> " While legaltech is advancing at a fairly rapid pace , it is not capable of replacing human legal expertise , especially in relation to complex issues which require nuanced attention , " agrees Vartika Malhotra , the CEO of TMT Law Practice in New Delhi . <p> Lawyers have the upper hand when it comes to the application of various laws , strategic or lateral thinking and interpretations , understanding legal loopholes , and negotiating , managing and guiding clients , she says . <h> CHINA LEADS WAY IN LEGALTECH <p> A plethora of legal tools is gaining favour across the legal community in China , which seems to have the jump on many jurisdictions with its rapid pickup and adoption of legaltech . <p> Long Jintao , a senior partner at Yingke Law Firm in Guangzhou , recommends Fatianshi ( legal angel ) for its massive collection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fatianshi helped us significantly reduce both costs and repetitive labour , allowing paralegals to quickly gain a footing in the profession and make rapid improvements , " he says . <p> Daphne Dai , the Shanghai-based vice president and APAC general counsel at Garrett Advancing Motion , says her team introduced Coupa to their global supplier management system , which has since proved helpful . It streamlines processes by automatically generating a list of pending matters , the approval process of various contracts , integrating electronic signature modules , and arranging automated signing and archiving of approvals . <p> In confrontational cases , timely and proper securing of evidence can make the ultimate difference . Rights protection apps Zhenxiang Quzheng ( truth evidence collection ) and Quanli Weishi ( rights defender ) stood out for enabling lawyers to take photos and video/audio recordings to use as evidence in court . <p> When engaging with international trade partners , Huang Huina , general manager of legal and risk management at China Power International Holding in Beijing , uses MemberCheck for sanctions screening .

Zhang Yaxing , a Beijing-based partner at Han Kun Law Offices , cites Dida as his tool to synchronise schedules and to-do lists across multiple platforms .
