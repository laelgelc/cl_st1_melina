Though , true as it may , I had a very hard time believing the story upon hearing it . I could n't , for the life in me , understand why certain people could be so inconsiderate . We all know , of course , how complicated relationships could be . Then again , we humans beings are complicated creatures , would n't you say ? We definitely have our ways if you ask me . Anyway , back to the story before I forget . Well , according to the story , Ofori , who lives in Germany , met his ex wife , Becky , at a friend 's party . The friend , in question , was Becky 's senior brother , Asare . Actually , it was Asare , who brought Becky to Germany in the early nineties.The story has it that Becky , for some unknown reason , displayed a disinterest in Ghanaian men . Mind you , this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ghanaian men , who were interested in her , gave up on her . <p> Undoubtedly , they ( the Ghanaian men ) believed that she was destined for a White-man . However , not once was she seen with a White-man . As the story goes , Becky associated herself with White women , especially the masculine kind . Of course , the Ghanaian community in Dusseldorf , Germany began to whisper . Becky 's sexual preference was brought in dispute . She was called a lesbian behind her back . Asare was told by a friend what others were saying about his sister . So , in an effort to find the truth , Asare confronted his little sister . According to the friend , Becky did n't tell her senior brother the truth . " As a matter of fact , she denied everything , " said the friend on the radio . " Becky told her brother that they ( the Ghanaian men ) were calling her a lesbian because she refuses to date them . " " Becky 's brother , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , the lesbian accusation , from then on , became nothing but a rumor . " " So , it , more or less , died right there and then . " <p> " The Ghanaian community , on the other hand , continued talking until her marriage to Ofori . Which , by the way , took us all by surprise . " " You see , nobody expected it from her . " The marriage between Ofori and Becky started off rosy . At least , so it appeared to the outside world . The newly wed couple attended church on a regular basis . Becky traded her old female friends for motherhood . In comparison to the past , Becky seemed reborn . However , little did her husband know that his wife was leading a double life . One day , Ofori returned early from work to find his wife in the arms of another woman . Both of them were working it . Their two young daughters were still at school . For Ofori , this meant the end of his ten-year marriage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Right now , he and Becky are entangled in a bitter custody over their two daughters . Becky and her White girlfriend want full custody over the children . Ofori , on the other hand , wants to prevent it from happening . He believes that two lesbians are n't fit to raise children , let alone his own . <p> So , dear reader , after reading this story--my question to you is ; should the two lesbians be given full custody over the two daughters , or should Ofori fight them till the end ? Better yet , what situation should be deemed most appropriate for these two children ? As of the moment , the girls are living with their lesbian mother , Becky .

@@1789235 <h> Volta University -- Review Content <p> The Government is commended for the conception of the establishment of two new universities in both the Brong Ahafo Region - University of Energy and Natural Resources - and Volta Region -- University of Health and Allied Sciences . Their implementation would complete the distribution of public universities in all the ten administrative regions of Ghana . While these institutions would equip their graduates with the requisite academic and professional background , it is being questioned if the one in the Volta Region is not going to be more of the same . A review of the existing public tertiary institutions , especially the universities , shows that each of them was established to meet human resources development in specific areas . Thus the University of Ghana , Legon ( Legon ) , is for the Liberal Arts and Science , Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology , Kumasi ( KNUST ) is for the Applied Sciences and Technology . University of Cape Coast ( CapeVars ) was set up specifically to train teachers for the second cycle institutions , a function which has since been taken over by the University of Education , Winneba ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly Ajumako . The University of Development Studies ( UDS ) in Tamale brought a new concept of university education in Ghana while the University of Mines and Technology focused on the mining sector . Perhaps it is along this line of thought that the government has penciled health and allied sciences for the Volta Region . Incidentally , it is for this same reason that the objection for this particular university is being raised . Legon has College of Health Sciences which has among others School for Allied Health Sciences . KNUST also has College of Health Sciences with a Faculty of Allied Health Sciences . CapeVars has School of Medical Sciences whose " aim is to produce doctors and allied health professionals to supplement the efforts of the three existing Medical Schools in the country " . UDS , Kintampo-Brong Ahafo is earmarked to house the Allied Health Sciences . If well resourced these four universities are capable of developing the requisite manpower needs in the industry for the country . It is therefore not all that important to establish a whole new university specifically for that industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manpower needs of Ghana before deciding on the establishment of a university . One had expected that the various private universities that have sprung up throughout the country would provide some diversification in our human resources development . They have rather compounded matters . What one observes are duplications , combinations , variations and complexities of the same thing in one industry -- business . Almost all public and private tertiary institutions in the country offer some form of business studies . This probably may be one major reason behind the unprecedented growth of graduate unemployment in the country . The system has not developed to the level that it can absorb graduates from all the institutions . It is being argued that there are already a number of public institutions that are graduating personnel in the health and allied sciences while so many tertiary institutions offer various courses in business administration that any attempt to open a new university for these two areas would be an exercise in duplicity . Volta Region should have a university that is unique in the country , industry specific , challenging the potentials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the system needs them . It is the position of this write up that a university that is not in the country and therefore should be established in the Volta Region is one for the Criminal Justice system -- Volta University of Criminal Justice ( VUCJ ) . Let Ghanaians study Forensic Science ( Criminalistics , Toxicology , and Molecular Biology ) , Forensic Psychology , Police Science , Fire Science , Fire and Emergency Services , Criminal Justice Administration and Planning , Deviant Behavior and Social Control , Computer Information Systems in Criminal Justice and Public Administration , Crime Scene Investigation ( CSI ) and a host of others . There are so many universities , colleges , schools and institutes in Ghana offering courses from Archeology to Zoology . Among them only one offers courses in Criminal Justice -- Premier Institute of Law Enforcement Management and Administration located in Accra- but even this one only offers certification course in Police Science . The institute does not offer courses that are comprehensive in content that can be passed on as graduating professionals for the industry . Among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courses in Forensic Science at the graduate level . As Ghana develops it would be faced with situations that require both academic and professional knowledge to respond to some challenges that would be encountered in the process . When the house of former President Rawlings caught fire in February 2010 , one observed with dismay a glaring professional incompetence and ignoramus display of basic knowledge in the field by both Fire Service and Police personnel on duty- a crime scene was turned into durbar grounds . Soon after the fire sympathizers from all walks of life had access to the place thus compromising the scene for any effective forensic investigation to take place . It was no coincidence that the investigation could not come up with conclusive evidence as to the cause of the fire . The very first action was to declare the area a crime scene and the perimeters condoned off for crime scene investigators ( CSI ) to come in to do their job . The point being made is that our investigative strategies need to be re-tuned to meet the challenges of the day With the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be trooping to Ghana to do " business " . Career criminals with knowledge in forensic science , accounting , ballistic finger printing , insurance fraud and a host of others would make Ghana their country of choice , duping na ? ve investors and causing unnecessary harm to the populace . Ghana should be proactive and be prepared by training personnel to counter such activities . This would be some of the tasks that graduates from Volta University of Criminal Justice would be called upon to handle . With the establishment of UEW the Ghana Education Service ( GES ) now recruits graduate teachers for basic education schools , something that no one thought of in the immediate past . The Ghana Armed Forces Command and Staff College has been upgraded with affiliation to Legon and now offers graduate courses - Masters Degree . " The law faculty at the University of Ghana has decided to make law a second degree course " All these are changes being made to meet demands of the times . It is high time law enforcement agencies in Ghana recruited graduates with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this case graduates from Volta University of Criminal Justice would serve as the employment source for the Police Service , Prison Service , Fire Department , Immigration and others . The decision to establish a university in the Volta Region is basically to satisfy political promise but VUCJ would complement the political reasoning and make the Volta Region extremely important than envisaged . VUCJ would bring a new level of professional judicial education into the country that would be attractive to the core of Ghanaian students who otherwise would have to take courses they had no choice but because they had been offered to them . From primary through high schools Ghanaian children would clamor to attend VUCJ for their professional education and eventual training into the judicial system just as was and is in the case of Legon and KNUST . It would also serve to curtail the perception that only persons with connections to decision making gain employment into the various branches of Ghana 's law enforcement system since only the top performing graduates would be selected . Ghana is developing very fast and therefore its human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more responsive to its needs . The judicial system is functioning well but the civil aspect of the criminal justice system needs to be developed to make the system very effective and continue to attract the best in the system . The establishment of a university in the criminal justice system located in the Volta Region would be a step in the right direction . 
@@1789236 <h> Ghana And Its Upper-Class Dictatorship <p> Ghana , as a country , pride herself for being a democratic country . The country has an electoral system , which allows her citizens to cast their votes every now and then . Also , the country is governed by certain principles , which are embedded in the nation 's constitution . The constitution embodies , as you all know , the totality of the powers of the government by the governed . Therefore , we could safely say that the government of Ghana is of the people , by the people , and for the people , right ? Well , let 's see . Democracy is derived from the Greek " popular government . " The Greek word " d ? mos " means people . Kr ? tos , on the other hand , means rule . In other words , democracy means the rule of the people . That said , when you and I behold the masses in a democratic country , what do we see ? We see groups and classes separations of people . You have your upper-class , middle-class , and low class . All these classes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law . However , none of these classes are qualified to rule except for one particular class--namely , the upper class . <p> Why the upper-class ? you ask . Well , it 's because , those in the upper-class control the wealth , they have most of the monies . Unfortunately , those who have the monies control those who do n't . It 's that simple . Those in the upper-class , mind you , make the rules . The rest , sadly , have no choice but to obey . By the way , control means ; restriction , lack of freedom , ruler-ship over someone or something . Unquestionably , both the middle and the low class are being ruled and controlled by those in the upper-class . In essence , there is no such thing as freedom for these two classes of people . Those in the upper-class , you see , dictate their lives . Therefore , the question is ; why do we still continue to vote for democracy , which simply stands for upper-class rule only ? Evidentially , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the upper-class , in fact , are in the minority . Ironically , they are the ones dictating to the majority . This , as a result , of their wealth--which is symbolic to power . Now , mix the power of money with upper-class rule , and the end result would be upper-class dictatorship . The true definition of democracy in all its hypocrisy . The power of the haves over the have-nots . A pyramidal structure on which a tiny few sit comfortably at the top , whilst the majority are made to surf deep below in uncertainty and fear . <p> Now , what about social communism ? <p> The definition of socialism is founded on two fundamental maxims . First , Thomas Jefferson 's : " All men are created equal . " Secondly , Karl Marx 's : " From each according to his ability , to each according to his needs . " In essence , socialism seeks to realize some sort of equity and fairness in all the various aspects of society . Though , the question is ; is this quest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessing a heart and a mind , all men could be considered equal . However , they are far from being the same . It 's this in-sameness , which makes it nearly impossible to satisfy all men equally . A country which practices social communism often plans and controls all the various aspects of its economy . Means of producing and distributing goods are owned collectively or by a centralized government . <p> Of course , this leaves absolutely no room for outsiders to invest . This form of domestication , needless to say , does make a social communist economy less dependent on external market forces . Thus , less vulnerable to their influences--which , of course , is a positive thing . On the negative side , though , a social communist government controls the prices of all commodities and wages . Meaning , people in social communist countries could be considered deprived of one particular right . The right to be rich or not to be rich . Simply because ; commodity price control in correlation with salary control by a government equals to anti-capitalism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be posing is ; is it possible for us to live well together without exploiting each other ?

@@1791240 <h> 10 exclusive ways to make your partner love you more . <p> Love , they say is endless . So says the Holy bible too but have ever wondered that this same love could fade ? To think that love can kill is also another debate . That is why we need basic tips to spice up our love relationships . <p> The following are 10 tips to make your partner love you more . <p> 1. *change communication pattern* : Some partners always quarrel about little issues that should not generate in such , but it does because of the way issues are confronted . For instance , asking to go out with a partner may not be said properly and a fuss is made out of it . <p> A good communication pattern will go like " darling , can we go out today , I feel like outing " ? Whiles a bad one will go like " take me out today , I feel like outing " . <p> In the same way , sexual communication is also important . The approach used to request for sex from partners also can cause more harm than good . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill a person 's libido . On the other hand , a notice could be given earlier to prepare one 's mind and just before the act , a signal could follow . <p> Again , preparing the bed with clean sheet and straightening nicely is also a good way to communicate sex to your partner . <p> 2. *Smell fresh always* : Strong scent from the mouth , from the armpit , from the genital areas could affect the love of a partner . <p> These put people off and would n't want to be close to their partners . The old paste could be changed , the roll-on could also be change for a good scented ones . <p> If in any case a partner thinks , " oh , If you love me , you should learn to appreciate however I am , if u do n't then it means u do n't love me " , your partner will leave you . Some behavioral patterns also have to change . If you used to bath or brush the teeth once a day , try twice a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary* : saying sorry heals wounds . Sorry can make an extremely furious person calm down . If you do n't believe me , try it now and see the difference that make . It wo n't cost a thing to say , " Baby , am sorry , it was n't intentional " or " I did n't mean to offend you , am sorry " when one does something wrong . <p> If you do n't say sorry and someone says it outside , your partner wo n't come back . I remember offending my partner but did n't want to say sorry because I believed it was not my fault . It generated into a heated argument which nearly broke our relationship . A simple sorry revived the relationship . <p> *4 . Be fashionable : * A change in ones wardrobe matters . If your old clothes are still what you wear , it might push your partner aside . Whatever happened to fashion ? <p> There are a lot of new styles invoke , grab the chance and save your relationship . Fashion , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' or being ' nude ' but following the right trend of fashion that you think your partner loves . <p> When one fails to appear nice before a partner , he/she will find someone else attractive and that is not healthy for a relationship . <p> *5 . Be humble* : Humility does not mean ' total submission ' . I say total submission to mean that you do n't have to succumb totally because one partner is the ' breadwinner ' or ' abusive ' . <p> Grant respect the best way you can and also Say ' please ' when you have to so that a lasting relationship could be built . <p> *6 . Be serviceable* : Being serviceable in all areas matter most in ever relationship . <p> Running errands for your partner is such a romantic feeling . It should n't be a bother at all . In the same way when it has to do with lovemaking , it is a service which should be offered to each other with love. * * <p> *7 . Avoid too many friends* : As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Too many friend means that there may be bad nuts among them . Be careful of the friends you make and bring home , they can cause you heartbreak . It is said that if a friend comes to pick your partner out and stay late in the night before coming home , then watch out for that friend . The same friends may also give you both good and bad advice . Choose the few good ones but wise up . <p> 8. *Give gifts* : Learn to shower gifts on your partner to make him/her feel that you care . <p> Little gifts are very important and it could be given not just on birthdays , christmas and anniversaries but any given time . Do this just to surprise your partner . I love surprises and I know you do too . Even if you do n't , those little gifts wo n't hurt . <p> *9 . Show gratitude* : Learn to appreciate and recognize the value or significance of something your partner does for you . It is often said that , the greatest attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't appreciate what someone does , you ca n't be grateful for it too . Showing gratitude relieves your partner from guessing whether you like a gift or not . <p> *10 . Use pet names* : Special names like darling , sweetheart , babe , honey , sugar , dear , etc. , help spice up relationships . They bring about fondness , build intimacy and help remind you of who your partner is to you . Even if one party is angry at the other , mentioning the name alone brings the feeling of " oh my gosh , he just called me babe " , or " oh my gosh , she called me honey " . <p> Your relationship will not be the same after going through this . However , if there are any questions bothering you , please leave a comment and Maya- exclusive will respond . Chao.
