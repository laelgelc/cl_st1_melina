Monetary policy is generally defined as the process by which the monetary authority ( ideally central bank ) of a country controls the supply of money , targeting a rate of interest for the purpose of promoting economic growth and stability . The official objective of the monetary policy is to maintain stable growth and low unemployment . Monetary policy is either expansionary or contractionary where the expansionary policy increases the total money supply in the economy more rapidly than usual . On the contrary contractionary policy shrinks the money supply than usual with the aim to control the inflation . <p> The current monetary policy targets to contain inflation and maintain growth momentum . Actually inflation should not be the main objective of the monetary policy of a third world country like Bangladesh . As the country is in a growing mode , some inflation may be there , but the authority must keep inflation within a limited range . On the growing mode , the economy demands higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must create demand in the market which ultimately induces the manufacturing activities .

Obviously the Bangladesh Bank will help the government policy , but it should be visible in their activities . What we have seen is that the private sector credit growth remains the same as the previous MPS ( first half of 2013-14 ) . According to the MPS , the ceiling for private sector credit growth of 16.5 per cent has been kept well in line with economic growth targets . Credit growth , including foreign borrowing , was at the rate of 13.6 per cent and this may induce the central bank to keep the same rate as in the previous MPS . Except the foreign borrowing the private sector credit growth stood only 11.7 per cent . This may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atmosphere and political stability should be ensured to achieve the set growth target . Though the economy deserves more feeding by money circulation , the Bangladesh Bank sets target just to keep the economy to growing as usual . On the other hand , the growth rate for government borrowing has been fixed at 22.9 per cent . Government borrowing may shrink the private borrowing . But if the government uses the money in productive sector , it may create positive impact to the economy . Moreover , in the MPS the Bangladesh Bank governor also revealed that the reserves increased to $18 billion , which is really a good sign for Bangladesh economy . However , expert opinion is that the Bangladesh Bank should find the way to utilise the reserves properly rather to keep it as comfort . We hope we shall find the impact in the next budget as well as next the MPS.

@@4630230 <h> Coordinated response for control of STIs is lacking <p> Sexually transmitted infections ( STIs ) , including HIV , are known to be primarily transmitted through sexual route which has created a major impact on sexual and reproductive health worldwide . They are caused by viruses , bacteria or parasitic microorganisms that are transmitted through sexual activity with an infected partner . Although some of the STIs are curable but others still do not have any effective preventive or therapeutics available such as human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) , human papillomavirus ( HPV ) , and herpes simplex virus ( HSV ) . The recently concluded International Conference on " Emerging Frontiers and Challenges in Management and Control of STIs and HIV " organized by National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health ( NIRRH ) , Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) and MGM Institute of Health Sciences , and held in Mumbai , provided an interactive forum to researchers , public health providers and policy makers for addressing issues related to mode , mechanism and management of STIs including HPV , HSV , syphilis , gonorrhoea , chancroid , trichomoniasis and HIV . It dwelt on development of efficacious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with STIs . <p> STIs are the oldest health problem on planet earth . Globally , STIs and their complications rank in the top five disease categories for which adults and adolescent seek health care . Worldwide 1 million persons acquire some STI every day . The economic burden of STIs in US alone in 2010 was $17 billion . Moreover , STI prevention is also the key to HIV prevention , as STI enhances risk of acquiring HIV by 8-10 times . Treatment of STI reduces HIV infection transmission by 42% . <p> The pattern of STIs in different parts of the world , including India , has shown a change . Bacterial infections like chancroid , gonorrhoea and syphilis are on the decline but viral infections like HSV and HPV are increasingly difficult to control and are on the rise . Transmission of viral STI may occur while the infected partner is asymptotic . Curable bacterial STIs have now been taken over by incurable viral ones . Viral STIs are persistent , recurrent , and difficult to diagnose and treat , and have a high morbidity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public health programme started in India way back in 1946 . But even today an estimated 30 million STIs and Reproductive Tract Infections ( RTIs ) episodes occur annually in the country based on a prevalence of 6% of reproductively active population . Out of these 14 million seek treatment from the government sector and 16 million from the private sector . STI rates in urban and rural areas are almost similar . <p> Dr Atmaram H Bandivdekar , a Senior Scientist at the National Institute for Research in Reproductive Health ( NIRRH ) , ICMR , and Organizing Secretary of this Conference , lamented that STIs , including HIV , affect not only adults but adolescents and children also . While speaking to CNS , Dr Bandivdekar stressed upon the importance of basic clinical research and hoped that presentations made at the conference would be helpful in revising and redesigning the strategy for prevention and control of STIs in the country . He said that it is important to create more awareness about STIs in the general public . At the same time , the government and other agencies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labs , its fruits reach the public and the public should be in a position to receive them . <p> Dr Bandivdekar said that STIs , including HIV , can be transmitted through the paternal route and not just from mother to child . He told that , " One route of STI transmission could be from father to child also . We came across one such case at JJ Hospital , Mumbai where the viral sequence of an infant born with HIV matched that of his father , while mother was HIV negative at the time of delivery . This could be through the spermatozoa -- the sperm which carries the HIV virus . But there is need for further testing for this and we have to probe further . " <p> Dr Balaiah Donta , a senior scientist at NIRRH , stressed upon the need for a robust surveillance system for STIs in India . He told CNS that , " We only have hospital based studies on STIs . There should be community based studies and the entire population should be screened for STIs and RTIs ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is done we will not get the true prevalence data of STIs which is so important to design effective control and management strategies . " <p> " Another obstacle in proper management of STIs is the absence of health seeking behaviour in the general public , especially women . They seek treatment only when they have a major problem which hampers their daily routine . This carelessness prevents them from taking timely preventive steps . Prevention is better than cure . For example Pap smear test will diagnose not only STIs and RTIs but also help in indicating cervical cancer . If detected in early stages cervical cancer can be cured . But most women with cervical cancer see a doctor very late when it has already reached the incurable stage , and there is no chance of saving their life . We have to cultivate health seeking behaviour in women by encouraging them through their husbands . Husbands also need to be screened and treated ; else women may get re infected . Community based screening for STIs will require a lot of sustained efforts and the government will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . " <p> Dr Nomita Chandhiok , Deputy Director General at Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR ) , told Citizen News Service ( CNS ) that , " Perhaps due to syndromic management incidence of bacterial STIs like syphilis , gonorrhoea , and chlamydia is coming down . But viral STIs like HPV , HSV and HIV are of concern . Out of these , HIV is the worst due to its devastating consequences . But for India the biggest challenge is to deal with HPV , as to some extent we have been able to contain the HIV epidemic . A large number of women are dying of cervical cancer for want of a good screening programme for HPV , as long standing HPV can lead to cervical cancer over a long period of time . But if treated early cervical cancer can be avoided . Also we should not be complacent about the STIs which are for the moment under control . So one needs to be alert all the time , continue focusing on STIs and HIV and keep women 's needs in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in focus . " <p> " Women 's groups should advocate more for barrier methods like the female condom ( FC ) , which , unlike hormonal contraceptives , are devoid of side effects .

Female oriented Multipurpose Preventive Technologies ( MPTs ) will empower women and are a better option as very often they can not negotiate with men to use them . " <p> The main challenges in controlling and treating STIs are partnering with the private sector ; mainstreaming HIV/STI response ; poor referral linkages between sexual and reproductive health components ; and reaching the most at risk population . As Dr Chander P Puri , former Director of NIRRH and Pro-Vice Chancellor ( Research ) , MGM Institute of Health Sciences , remarked -- it is not easy to curtail STIs in India .

Chevron data , presented to Petrobangla recently , warns of production declines as early as 2018 . <p> Government 's decision to allow US oil company Chevron to extract 1,200 million cubic feet of gas per day ( mmcfd ) from the Bibiyana gas field starting in January 2015 follows a certain political and business logic . But experts warn that such a high rate of extraction could kill the gas field , or at the least maim it badly . <p> " It is a combined effort to make a significant difference to help solve the energy crisis in Bangladesh , " the Prime Minister 's Energy Adviser Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project . <p> The government 's desire to parlay the massive rate of gas extraction at Bibiyana into the generation of power reveals how crucial the sector is in terms of electoral politics , and how eagerly the government wants to win public confidence by claiming a success in the sector . <p> Ministers have also said the extra gas would go to propping up flagging enterprises like the country 's defunct fertiliser factories . <p> Chevron , meanwhile , will be able to maximally exploit the resources at Bibiyana and turn a handsome profit . <p> But according to the production sharing contract ( PSC ) , a company should not produce more than 7.5% of the proven and probable reserve of gas in a year . As we will show , from January 2015 Chevron will be producing at a rate of 10.4% . <p> Given that the remaining reserve is 4.2 trillion cubic feet ( tcf ) , annual production should not be more than 315 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) , which translates into a daily production rate of 863 mmcfd . <p> At present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nearly 1,000 mmcfd . In January 2015 , the company has announced that it will produce 1,200 mmcfd . <p> That means that Chevron is planning to produce 39% more than it should according to the PSC . <p> According to the PSC , a gas field is considered to have a 25-year lifespan . Since production started in March 2007 , Bibiyana gas field is expected to be viable until 2032 . But Chevron , in a recent presentation to Petrobangla , said production from Bibiyana would start to decline after 2018 . Why then is the company be willing to produce gas at a rate that will almost certainly hasten the gas field 's demise ? <p> After all , Chevron , if it extracted the proven reserve at a more leisured pace , would not only make a good return on its investment but would also be able to take advantage of a five-year extension built into its contract to prolong its business here . <p> " If the gas runs out before Chevron 's contract expires or if over extraction impedes production or shuts it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ijaz Hossain , professor at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology ( Buet ) , asked . <p> Over production <p> According to the Bangladesh Economic Review 2014 , the initial reserve of gas at Bibiyana was 7.4 tcf , of which 5.7 tcf was proven and recoverable . This is bigger than the last assessed figure of the country 's oldest producing field , Titas , the reserves of which are currently being reassessed . <p> At the beginning of 2014 , the remaining reserve amount at Bibiyana gas field was 4.2 tcf . <p> Bibiyana is now the largest producing gas field of the country , currently producing about 40% of Bangladesh 's total domestic natural gas supply . <p> Chevron 's bid to extract 1,200 mmcfd starting in January 2015 will exceed the maximum extraction limit by 337 mmcfd . <p> The geological structure of the gas field is at risk of irrevocable decimation because of the aggressive extraction policy agreed to between the government and Chevron , experts say . <p> Experts say excessive extraction of gas can destroy a gas field , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Ijaz said : " The expected gas production could not be achieved at the Bakhrabad and Sangu gas fields because of over extraction . Over extraction is a danger to gas fields . " <p> The Bakhrabad gas field used to produce 250 mmcfd , but that rate has plummeted to a mere 36 mmcfd . <p> Sangu once produced more than 150 mmcfd ; it has now been shut down . <p> The Bibiyana expansion project undertaken by Chevron has drilled 14 new wells at Bibiyana over the last three years . <p> The company has built two new gas processing trains and an enhanced liquids recovery unit that will produce an additional 4,000 barrels per day of condensate . <p> Ijaz said : " Experience clearly teaches us that over extraction is bad for gas fields . Petrobangla should seriously keep this in mind .

As a nation , are we aware of our own responsibilities ? Are we prepared to make the sacrifices needed , in order for Bangladesh to shine amongst other nations ? <p> This train of thought is occasioned by the fact that the capsised vessel was carrying furnace oil , to be supplied to a power plant project near Gopalganj . Although the Shela river is meant to be off-limits to vessels carrying supplies such as furnace oil , the closing down of the usual route from Khulna to Gopalganj , due to massive siltation , has caused the authorities to permit this in the last three years . <p> The smirk the shipping minister has allowed himself all week probably owes to his knowledge of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of investment in the sector . But the Sundarbans ' value is incalculable . A statement like that is often hyperbolic , but in this case , it is not . The sooner the authorities , and indeed all stakeholders , realise that , the better . <p> It is n't just a matter of the odd commercial vessel capsising , of which this latest one was the third this year . Just in general as well , the forest has suffered from a history of neglect . <p> I understand that in Nepal , their armed forces are helping conserve wildlife in their protected areas . Our Sundarbans are ruled by pirates and poachers . We need to protect the Sundarbans , and the whole nation is left looking at the prime minister now to take the lead and show that we are earnest about doing that . <p> The surest way may well be to declare the forest a safe zone , and put it under the defence ministry that is usually looked after by the premier .
