Several were the hopes you raised during the campaign for this position , and we at the Agro Mindset Organisation working with the vision of building Africa 's next green revolution , look forward to working with you to use the agricultural sector to create employment opportunities for the teeming unemployed youth of our country , wrestle the millions of poor rural based citizens of our very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our nation food secure . <p> Mr. President , this correspondence to you at this particular point in time would not have been necessary if the cyclical political rhetoric that have been churned out by political leaders over the years during campaigning periods to prioritize the agricultural sector and make Ghana the food basket of Africa had been backed with action . Unfortunately , every four years , when the treks across deprived communities in a plea for votes have come to an end and the political campaign offices have been closed down to business , our politicians return to Accra , forgetful of virtually everything that has been said , and watch on as the activities of lobbyists and special interest groups out crowd the cry of the rural farmers and the promises of a better day that were made by the politicians on the campaign trail . <p> The critical role of the agricultural sector to the development of our country is an assertion we appear to have under emphasized for far too long . Agriculture is the backbone of the economy , employing about 60 percent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector to Ghana 's Gross Domestic Product , but it is now beginning to appear the spine has been sucked out of the backbone without us noticing . <p> The government which you led during its climaxing months and hitherto was second in command has a lot to boast of , in terms of helping improve the agricultural sector over the last four years . The Youth-In-Agriculture Programme your administration rolled out has helped the nation cut down on the unemployment situation in the country , quantities of produced food crops including maize and rice grown has multiplied , and huge gains were made in further improving upon the amount of cash crops like cocoa harvested annually . Thumbs up to you and your agricultural generals for a good job done . <p> But in our view , these huge leaps in the performance of the agricultural sector would not be meaningful if the small holder farmers in the rural areas engaged in small scale agriculture , owning farm sizes less than 3 acres , and struggling to make optimum outputs from their investments are not targeted with similarly enthusiastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Ghana , exemplified by the fact that they are old and weak men and women , with little or no education , unskilled or lowly skilled , unaware of modern trends in the agricultural sector , who take farming as a way of life , hence hardly attach the needed diligence required for successful farming operations , and are under performing , breaking their backs to till the land and feed a nation . <p> Mr. President , as you take the reins of governance for the next four years , we would encourage you to refocus attention on implementing targeted policies that would help these poor , rural based farmers improve upon production , expand their farm sizes and get higher up the economic ladder which will restore hope to the upcoming generation . The rural poor are the people who deserve the support even more , because they have shown that they are fully committed to the art and science of growing food , and they would be able to make even more meaningful impact if given adequate support . <p> Mr. President , you do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and report back to you on what can be done for these farmers so they can catapult the efforts at making our nation food secure into a higher gear , it all comes back to the same old challenges and the very age old ideas that have been espoused over their years ; Access to credit facilities to expand and modernize operations , availability of improved and subsidized seeds and inputs , construction of irrigational facilities , closer agricultural extension services , training in entrepreneurship and literacy , facilitation of the establishment of cooperative societies to give them a stronger voice , among others . Leadership would just have to walk the talk as far as these ideas are concerned and make them available to the rural farmers , and then , we would get there . <p> Mr. President , majority of our citizens live in rural areas and , mainly , they depend on agriculture for their livelihoods . Agriculture thus remains vital for sustainable development , poverty reduction and food security . Prioritizing agricultural development , with some focus on the poor farmers would yield significant , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunger ; increasing incomes and reducing poverty ; advancing the human development agenda in health and education ; and reversing environmental damage . Integrating Ghana 's farms into value chains does not only promise to provide new sources for agricultural products , but will also enable smallholders to purchase better inputs and raise investment levels and inclusive agribusiness practices will create business growth opportunities for smallholders . <p> Mr. President , as indicated earlier , we would want to commend your just ended administration for the policies that have been rolled out to encourage more young people to venture into agricultural production , particularly through the Youth in Agriculture Programme . Despite the fact that agriculture is likely to remain a key sector for young people in much of Ghana , it has an image problem . The Ghanaian society generally has a negative perception of agriculture ; which is detrimental to the sustainability of the sector , hence a need for appropriate and timely intervention in order to cause the youth to believe in the vast prospects of the sector and to ensure that the agricultural sector becomes more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to develop more of such policies to motivate young people to go into agriculture to sustain the sector and , at the same time solve the problem of youth unemployment . <p> Finally , we would want to give one advice to you on the team you would be assembling to help you run the country over the next four years because we know that the quality and kind of leadership at all levels of our governance structure would be crucial in delivering on the task at hand , particularly in the agricultural sector . We would encourage you to endeavour to ensure that those you appoint to the helm of affairs at the Agric Ministry , from the minister to the deputies and other key political appointments are persons who have practical backgrounds in the sector and have a fair understanding of agricultural production in Ghana . Political-will , good governance and wise policies are key to helping write a better Ghana agric story as politicians serve as a key important variable in agricultural production , next to erratic weather . That , we think is the only way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sector . <p> In the words of US President Barack Obama at a Symposium on agriculture and Global Food Security last year which was attended by our late President John Mills ; " history teaches us that one of the most effective ways to pull people and entire nations out of poverty is to invest in their agriculture . " And that is exactly what we would encourage your administration to do .

@@1855231 @ @ single spine become NDC 's albatross ? <p> In 2010 , the NDC government of the late Prof John Atta-Mills began the implementation of a new salary structure for public sector workers . The " Single Spine Salary Structure " ( SSSS ) , replaced the then Ghana Universal Salary Structure ( GUSS ) , which was considered complicated and unfair . The SSSS was to be implemented over five years ( 2010 to 2014 ) . Soon after the implementation began , ministers and NDC communicators or propagandists were boasting that their government has doubled or tripled public sector salaries . In fact , that was one of the government 's main achievements and a major campaign tool for the 2012 presidential election . Strangely , soon after the elections , these same people ( from the President to his ministers ) have changed their tune and crying foul that SSSS is strangling the economy . In this article , I want to discuss the short sightedness of the NDC government regarding the implementation of the SSSS . <p> The objectives of the SSSS was to address salary disparities , distortions and restore equity in the pay structure by placing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs of equal value range receive the same pay range in order to minimize industrial relation tensions in Ghana . A task that in my view was almost impossible to achieve since it appeared to be too rigid a structure . SSSS had twenty five pay levels compared with the twenty-two under GUSS . This alone should have warned the government that SSSS was after all , not that single but complex , relative to the old GUSS . <p> According to World Bank 's Policy Research Working Paper 5150 entitled " Estimated Fiscal Costs of Implementing Ghana 's Single Spine Pay Reform " , in 2008 , the public sector wage bill ( estimated to be between Ghc1.7 and 1.9 billion ) consumed about 57 percent of total government revenue . Three years into the implementation , Ghanaians are being told that the wage bill has risen to Ghc9 billion in 2012 and soon to reach Ghc11 billion by December 2013 . According to the government , the public sector wage bill constitutes over 70 percent of government total revenue ( see " Ghana 's wage bill to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The government figures represent an increase of between 429 percent and 479 percent by the end of 2013 ( based on 2008 figures ) . <p> Ghana has a population of about 25 million and total public sector workforce of about 600,000 representing 2.4 percent of the total population . How could a country spend 70 percent of her total annual revenue on the wages of just 2.4 percent of the population , though a reasonable proportion of the 2.4 percent are in critical areas such as health and education ? Is this not madness ? How did Ghana end up in this mess ? <p> I suppose no one has any idea how the government might have got its figures woefully wrong . For example , each of the SSSS 25 pay levels has three salary points of minimum , medium and maximum . The lowest pay level has a minimum monthly salary of Ghc900 to a maximum of Ghc1,190 and the top pay level with a minimum mohttp : **33;0;TOOLONG ? page.paperReportKey=# nthly salary of Ghc19,000 to Ghc21,400 . From these , one would have expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 600,000 public sector workforce would be put on each of the 25 pay levels and at what point , during the five year implementation period ; and estimated the total cost for each year . <p> The next task was for the government to have asked and answered the questions : how will these be paid for ? That is , from what sources ( affordability ) or has the state got the capacity to generate sufficient revenue to pay considering all projected annual costs and expected total revenue for each of the four years ? Such forecasts would have also answered the question of sustainability , short , medium and long terms . <p> It is obvious from what the President and his ministers are now saying that , this simple due diligence was not carried out or if undertaken , their numbers did not add up . One would not have needed a Mathematical or Economic wizard to have made reliable projections . I also suspect that in a country where records are unreliable and with a public sector labour force bloated by ghost names , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , some of the current challenges would not have be a surprise to government as Ghanaians are being made to believe . <p> Though the SSSS is supposedly single , in reality , it bears no resemblance to the word single in whatever shape or form . This is because SSSS did not incorporate other remunerations paid to certain categories of public sector workers such allowances , commissions and market premiums that were to be negotiated separately by each group of professionals . This meant that the government at the time of implementation could not tell how much the SSSS would cost the state . No doubt the inability of the government and labour unions to agree on the levels of allowances , commissions and the market premiums which have been the source of industrial unrests in Ghana since the implementation of the SSSS . <p> Another factor that has contributed to SSSS 's total bill running-out-of-control is that Ghana has high allowances and commissions , especially , for senior public sector staff . These include provision of free accommodation , utility services , free transport fuelled and maintained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ driver/s , etc . Some even have tax free salaries as was revealed at the Public Accounts Committee hearings ( see " Exposed : Former Ghana Investment Promotion Center ( GIPC ) boss never paid tax " , Ghanaweb , October 18 , 2013 ) . These allowances and commissions also rise at a faster rate than actual basic salaries , are often tax free and the bulk of them go to senior staff of what is known as " Subvented Agencies " ( SAs ) . These are public agencies who receive annual subvention from public finance such as VRA , GIPC and others whose Boards and management have the freedom to award to themselves fat salaries and allowances . Records indicate that in 2008 , 82 percent of total allowances and commissions paid to public sector employees went to staff of SAs though they constituted only 19 percent of the overall public sector workforce ; yet consumed 35 percent of total public sector wage bill . <p> The shocking aspect of the SSSS policy implementation is the lack of reciprocal contract of increased productivity between government and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubling and tripling public sector wages , none is able to say that public sector productivity has gone up , let alone the percentage increment . In fact , my estimation is that productivity per head in the public sector has gone down because total public sector workforce has gone up , especially with the creation of more districts . In other words , workers have got more to do less . <p> It is no secret that the government implemented the SSSS without a clue on how much the policy would cost the state and how it would pay for it . In fact , the President admitted this in June when he addressed a seminar at Chatham House in London . In an answer to a question , the President said that the software used in implementing SSSS did not allow them to know the total cost of the policy . This was shocking , to say the least , if not negligent or abrogation of duty . <p> Another surprising aspect of SSSS is , did the ministers and party propagandists who were boasting and claiming credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy without a corresponding increase in productivity could fuel higher inflation as well as starve other sectors of the economy of critical investment ? It 's amazing that Ghana 's inflation has not spiralled out of control with such high public sector wage bill even if productivity remained constant . That could be the reason why some Economists do not trust the inflation figures , though other sectors of the economy ( mining/oil ) are doing well . <p> Form the above , it appears Ghana is led by a bunch of novices who boast of doubling and tripling public sector wages ( instead of higher standards of living ) in one year only to turn 180 degrees the following year to complain about the same policy . Do they think Ghana 's economy was a magician or money grows on trees ? The SSSS is unsustainable in its current form and shape and it will eventually bankrupt Ghana , if it has not already done so . What is the alternative , if any ? <p> I believe the President has started something but it 's cosmetic , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ministers to pay their utility bills is in the right direction but on its own , it 's a drop in the ocean . It must immediately be extended to all other areas such as accommodation , transports etc and must include all public sector workers who receive such benefits ( see " Mahama orders ministers , government officials to use prepaid meters " , Ghanaweb , October 17 , 2013 ) . The real answer lies in urgent reduction of the public sector workforce and the wage bill . Charity begins at home so the President must reduce the executive staff ( both ministers and presidential staff ) as well as the level of remunerations and allowances . The Legislature must follow the austerity measures with cuts in their salaries and allowances . <p> The civil service and other public bodies and agencies are overstaffed . First , the government must start with weeding out the ghost names and punish beneficiaries . This should be done in conjunction with a moratorium on all public sector recruitment . Those who retire , resign or are sacked must not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghana , public sector redundancy should not be taken off the table . Pay reduction is also an option that should be considered . That should be done by freezing the annual cost of living increment until the wage is within manageable levels or the rate of annual increase must be drastically reduced . Last but not the least , government must as a matter of urgency reduce the leaks through bribery in tax revenue collection that go into the pockets of workers who are paid to collect and the public who are to pay the taxes . <p> It is not clear if the NDC government rushed into implementing the SSSS without doing their home work , did not understand the implications on state finances or they knew exactly what they doing , but chose to cut their noses to spite their faces for political expediency . Whether they were naive , careless , ignorant or damn incompetent , they inherited or adopted baby , nursed it into a toddler monster that is out of control and has become an albatross around the nation 's neck . The earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Otherwise , NDC 's mess will choke the economy with catastrophic consequences for Ghana . SSS was either badly designed or poorly implemented or both .

He called for an increase of the NHIA levy , road fund levy and 20 percent of communication service tax assigned to health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he believes would be prudent to accrue some levies . <p> Social Sector <p> Dr Steve Manteaw , Campaign Co-ordinator of the Integrated Social Development Centre ( ISODEC ) , has urged government to seal the loopholes in the Petroleum Income Tax Law which cost government US$70 million in the non-payment of Capital Gains Tax . <p> Dr Manteaw also called on government to eliminate corruption in procurement practices and raise taxes on alcohol which would increase government 's revenue base to meet demands for increased budgetary expenditure allocations to essential services delivery agencies . <p> This he believes would efficiently deliver on their mandate of promoting and enforcing economic , social and cultural rights , and advancing the cause of the vulnerable in society , particularly women , children and the disabled . <p> Emphasizing on Dr. Manteaw 's point , Mrs. Philomena Johnson , Coordinator of the Institute for Fiscal Policy ( IPF ) called on government to improve budget expenditure allocations to sub-sectors of Social Sector Ministries to reduce their numerous challenges . <p> She pointed out to essential services sectors namely ; Education , Health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Protection , including poverty reduction interventions sub-sectors which are highly under resourced leading to their poor performances according to a research conducted by IPF this year . <p> Mrs. Johnson called on the Parliamentary Committee for these five sectors and the Finance Standing Committee of Parliament to request the Ministry of Finance and the cited Social Sector Ministries to review the approach used in budgeted expenditure Allocations , first to the Sectors from the Total Ministries Department and Agency ( MDA ) budgeted allocations and secondly from the Sectors ' Budgeted expenditures to their key sub-sectors during the 2014 Budget discussions . <p> Government Response <p> After a cabinet meeting to review the national budget proposals for presentation to Parliament , Mr. Mahama Ayariga , the Minister of Information and Media Relations said the budget would , among other things , cater for job creation , skills development and the maximization of efficiency in the economy . <p> He hinted that the budget would also include the transition of the Ghanaian economy from lower middle income to the middle income level , attributing the over running of last year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coming out with the budget before negotiating for salaries and wages was not helping and that is why President John Dramani Mahama earlier this year called for salary negotiations before reading of the budget " , he added . <p> He also blamed the situation on domestic borrowing which resulted in higher interest rates , giving the assurance that government would subsequently go in for international loans which attracted comparatively lower interest rates . <p> He noted that because Ghana had attained a lower middle-income status , it was no longer getting grants to finance therefore government was now strengthening its efforts towards executing projects through public-private partnership ( PPP ) . <p> Mr. Mahama Ayariga said the 2014 budget would shift from Activity Based Budgeting ( ABB ) to a Programme Based Budgeting ( PBB ) , which would require spending to be tied to the delivery of specific projects . <p> Parliament <p> A call by the Minority of parliament for the postponement of the presentation of the 2014 Budget was refused by the Speaker of Parliament , Edward Doe Adjaho .

@@1855237 <h> Corruption In Ghana-2001-2008 <p> The NPP administration with Mr. J.A . Kufour as the then President of Ghana by default anyway was rather a kleptocracy whose organized thieving was measurable through an institutional packaging order , the international whistle blower WikiLeaks had said in Part 21 of 22 . <p> The revelation is that under President Kufuor 's property grabbing regime , 10 government institutions were the pacesetters in the loot of the Public Purse . According to WikiLeaks , the 10 most corrupt institutions under the Kufour regime were ; 1 . The Police 2 . Ministry of Education , Oh ! Yes , the notorious Ghana Education Service came under they Radar of the erstwhile PNDC government in 1985 where officials of that Ministry Stole Billions of Ghana cedis and shared among themselves . <p> 3 . The Customs Exercise and Preventive Service ( CEPS ) 4 . The Judiciary . 5 . The Civil Service , Yes , if you doubt it , you just glance through the Auditor General 's report and you will see the billions of cedis looted by Kufour 's ministers and other appointees with impunity 6 . The Ghana Health Service where Doctors and Nurses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not rich and you dare fall sick and report at the hospital , your next home would be the mortuary . 7 . The Electricity Company of Ghana ( ECG ) -- where they would constantly switch off electricity for weeks and when the fact bills comes , they will never be any reduction for the three weeks that power went off- it is always the same huge bills . 8 . Ghana Politicians , No , I am a politician since the PNDC era to date 2013 , but I have never been CITED for corruption and the only highest office I once occupied was a Board Member of the Ghana National Fire Services from 1998 to 2001 when we were removed en block and replaced by Kufuor 's NPP men and my allowance of over GH ? 30.00 remained there to date . I was appointed by His Excellency Flt . J.J Rawlings . According to the 2005 cable leaked from the American Embassy in Ghana , the rest of the 10 most corrupt institutions under Ex-Prez Kufuor were ( 9 ) The internal Revenue Service and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have established that Ex-President Kufuor himself was the King Pin of the wide spread corruption that was legalized in Ghana between 2001 -2008 since his administration had sidelined the late Vice President Aliu Mahama and replaced him with his brother-in-law Mr. J.H. Mensah who was appointed a Senior Minister . It was revealed that Mr. J.A . Mensah used the HIPC Benefit funds to sponsor the then ruling party 's patronage net works when President Kufuor set him over the funds to the spite of the late Aliu Mahama . President Kufour 's Chief of Staff , Mr. Kwado Mpiani is also revealed by earlier troves of Wiki Leaks to have been in the thick of a STATE LANDS LOOTING BRIGADE that evolved at the Osu Castle , the then Seat of government . It was the same Kwadwo Mpiani together with Charles Wereko Brobbey who were both in the dock of a Presidential Commission that looked into allegations of financial impropriety at the Ghana@50 Celebration and were both INDICTED , yet the two are still moving as free people because President Mills made the big mistake of investigating them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is also a matter on record that the late President Mills Stated that he wo n't INHERIT ANYBODY ELSE 'S ENEMIES and nobody knew why he once made that statement . In his life time , he heard no evil , he saw no evil and did no evil , so the massive corruption and looting that took place in Ghana for 8 years under Kufour 's NPP government had been swept under the carpet by a Presidential Commission set up by the late President Mills , so NPP members must be the last people to blame President Mahama of Corruption after taking the country to ransom for 8 good months . <p> According to the WikiLeaks , the Judiciary under Kufuor whose latter head was state lands theft beneficiary , Mrs. Georgina Theodora Wood was so corrupt that a Supreme Court Judge had to complain bitterly to the US Embassy officials . The Supreme Court Chief Justice Kingsley Acquah admitted to Ambassador Yates in her farewell call that judicial corruption is " A BIG TERRIBLE PROBLEM " He noted that the Police recently discovered a judicial clerk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judicial Council charged two High Court judges with stealing GH ? 115MILLION ( $13,000 ) deposited as fines.WikiLeak added . it went on to state that Theodora Georgina Wood who is still the current Chief Justice has managed to hold down her position in spite of glaring evidence that there are question marks on her integrity . In the education sector , WikiLeaks revealed that under Kufour , it together with the Health sector had the greatest mis allocation of funds . The Assistant Director of the serious Fraud Office , A Tetteh Mensah told Poloff that the Ministries of Health and Education had the greatest mis allocation of funds in the GOG . WikiLeaks quoted . We will not allow anybody to sweep the facts under the carpet . According to the leaked cable , the mis-allocations mainly happened because schools and clinics that were paid for from government budget allocations ended up NEVER BEING Built . The money just ended up in some peoples pocket all in the name of property owing democracy . That is J.A . Kufour , the so called Gentle Giant for you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steal with impunity from the Health and Education Ministries was the massive insertion of Ghost Names in their payrolls . <p> In 2001 the Minister of Finance reported that ghost names on public payroll alone cost the state an estimated $33 million that was 300 billion Ghana cedis in financial losses annually , the leak revealed . In a Ghana Integrity Initiative that was conducted in the era of the Kufour regime , the Ministry of Education was perceived as the second most corrupt government entity in Ghana . That institution had been a corruption ridden organization since the PNDC era in 1985 to date , so the government must look at that important Ministry and the GES WITH EAGLE Eyes , otherwise , our FUTURE LEADERS being trained by that Ministry would face a bleak future . ON September 2nd 2011 , the Police revealed that 22,000 dollars ( GH ? 200,000,00 ) million cedis had been embezzled by an employee of the Ghana Education Service in the Upper East Region . WikiLeaks stated again , in October 2005 , Media reports exposed that the Ministry of Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books without seeking the required prior approval from the Public Procurement Board . A BIG SHAKE UP IN THE GES like the PNDC did in 1985 will remove the rot from the Ministry of Education which had been a GOLDMINE for PEN ROBBERS and ORGANISED CROOKS who are worse than ARMED ROBBERS WIELDING GUNS on the High Ways . I also suggest that the government should set aside the Presidential Commission Report that was presented to the late Prez . Mills and hand the suspected NPP officials over to the Police C.I.D , BNI , EOCO and other Security Agencies to enable them squeeze the suspect to vomit the loot for the past 8 years under J. A. Kufuor . <p> It is a matter on record that former President J. A Kufuor made it clear to Ghanaians that HE WILL NEVER PUNISH OFFENDING MINISTERS IN ORDER TO DESTROY THE NPP . With this open endorsement of verbal vituperation , breeds the practice and ON and ON , we all match with it . In a discussion on Metro T.V. Good Evening Ghana , Ex . Pres. Kufuor described his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even questioned the host to show evidence of a single corrupt act in his government from 2001-2008 . As for me , I do not blame such a tall liar like J.A . Kufuor because if our late President Mills had not issued a Presidential FIAT by , telling NDC members to " Let It Be " - we would have exposed all these Political criminals in the NPP led by Mr. J.A . Kufuor for Ghanaians to see . On that programme , Mr. Kufuor defended his blood soaked regime with stout elegance and rather saw ALMOST EVERYTHING WRONG WITH THE National Democratic Congress ( NDC ) which he made several attempts to destroy in the past eight years but failed . Mr. Kufuor never spared a thought to even identify a single good thing in the previous NDC administration which he never wanted to see in government again . <p> It will be recalled that Nana Akufo Addo did not congratulate the late President Mills after he lost the 2008 elections to Mills , and this could be seen as demonstrating lack of fairness and respect for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as he or she determines to win , then he or she is UNFIT FOR ANY RACE . Though defeat is very painful , which some times leads to irrational temper tantrums especially among high profile personalities , politicians must have the nerve to tame such monstrous emotions to breed peace . <p> WATCH THESE DEVELOPMENTS <p> In January 2001 Mr. J.A . Kufour was sworn in as President of the Republic of Ghana he increased petrol price by 100% . No one coughed in Ghana . In AUGUST 2002 , the NPP increased electricity tariff by 85% . No one coughed again in Ghana and the T.U.C saw it all as NORMAL . The first tariff increase by the NPP government was in March 2001 where there was an increase of 104% . The T.U.C , G.M.A. and the so called civil society groups in Ghana all saw that as NORMAL . Then again , in 2004 , the NPP increased petrol price by another 100% and the GPRTU never called any press conference , while the TUC and GMA all remained silent . Therefore if all these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all come out boldly to let the innocent workers know their true stand in National Affairs for they are more political than claiming to be neutral . This is very shameful . Let them clear the air , once and for all since Prez Mahama will leave The Flagstaff House in 2021 period . <p> 1 . President Mahama instituted the Special Task Force to monitor and report revenue collected and expose malpractices at the various posts in the country in April 2013 . These are all stringent measures put in place by the NDC government to fight corrupt practices among public officials and the various institutions in the public sector . The President needs commendation and not condemnation , so I say Aluta Continua ! <p> 2 . The Right To Information Bill ( RTI ) aimed at ensuring easy access to information was sent to Parliament by the cabinet and has passed through its first reading stage in Parliament on November 12th 2013 . <p> In 2002 , the NPP government drafted the first RTI BILL to operationalize the constitutional right to information under Article 21(1) of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Parliament because the NPP hate transparency and had legalized corruption for the 8 years that Kufour was President of Ghana by default from 2001 0 2008 . <p> The 1992 Constitution says that every Ghanaian citizen has the right to know how the government is functioning and because President Mahama is very honest , Patriotic and transparent , that is the reason why he sent the RT1 BILL to parliament to the annoyance of the violent prone NPP.Is anybody listening ?
