@@1993231 <p> Vodacom has changed the minimum billing increment or " unitisation " for data , but claims the change will not negatively affect its customers . <p> The mobile operator on Friday confirmed the move , saying it increased the minimum session volume from 1KB to 10KB on in-bundle data depletion and 5KB on out-of-bundle usage . <p> In other words , the operator will charge for data in 10KB and 5KB increments , even if customers happen to use less than that in a session . <p> Unitisation is the smallest amount that is rated and billed on the network and typically is calculated as a function of the smallest chargeable financial value , or 1c . <p> Earlier this year , Cell C made headlines when it increased its billing increment to 25KB . At the time , Cell C said the move would increase billing efficiencies . <p> Vodacom tells TechCentral the increase was needed because of increased load experienced by its backend rating and billing systems . <p> In an e-mailed statement , Vodacom has provided more insight into the changes . <p> What is unitisation ? This is the smallest amount that is rated and billed and typically is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1c . For a tariff plan such as MyMeg 0 , 1c translates to 5KB units ( at R2/MB ) . Therefore , a subscriber will be billed 1c for any usage up to 5KB . <p> Usage of 7KB ( for example ) would be billed as 2c , and so on . If the customer has an out-of-bundle rate of R1/MB , then it 's already unitised in 10KB increments ( 10KB at R1/MB equals 1c ) . If the customer has an out-of-bundle rate of 50c/MB , then the customer already is unitised in 20KB increments . <p> If a subscriber used 1MB , the charge would be R1 , and if the usage was 1MB plus 2KB , the charge would be R1,01 . For other price plans , a standard of 1KB was used , still rounded up to 1c where applicable . <p> Why was the change necessary ? It was required due to the increased load experienced by the Vodacom backend rating and billing systems due to a number of factors : <p> -- Increase in active data users -- Vodacom now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month . <p> -- Increase in data usage as a function of much richer content and modern devices ' ability to consume large amounts of high-capacity services . <p> -- Increases in network speed -- average throughput has gone up from &lt;100KB/s when this was put into place to &gt;5MB/s today . <p> -- Consistency across plans -- a single allocation and calculation method allows simpler and more reliable billing and rating systems to be implemented as well as better reporting , capacity planning , etc . <p> Basically , more users are using more data at a higher rate and this results in a direct increase of billing record volume and rate according to the product of the three relevant parameters : <p> -- Billing record volume = number of users x data volumes <p> -- Billing record rate = number of users x data speed <p> If we take a historical base of 1m users doing 50MB at up to 500KB/s , it translates to : <p> -- Billing record volume = 50bn records per month <p> -- Billing record rate = potential peak rate of 62,5m records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15m users doing 250MB at up to 5MB/s , it translates to : <p> -- Billing record volume = 3,75 trillion records per month <p> -- Billing record rate = potential peak rate of 9,4bn records per second <p> From the above , it is clear if we kept the unitisation at 1KB , the systems would not cope , especially with the big drive to deploy LTE across the country . <p> The decision was thus made to increase to 10KB , resulting in a system load increase factor of between 10 and 20 . While this is still substantial , it was felt it was practical and manageable . <p> Will Vodacom subscribers be affected negatively ? Careful consideration was given to how this will impact subscribers , if at all . The core factors that could influence a subscriber include : <p> -- Number of PDP ( packet data protocol ) sessions created by a device on the network . Here we looked at how often a typical data device creates a session on the network and what factors influence this process . <p> -- The duration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today and is thus not a factor . <p> -- The amount of data transferred in a session . The bigger the volume of data in one session , the less the impact of rounding up to 10KB ( instead of 1KB or 5KB in the case of the MyMeg 0 plan ) . <p> As the notes below explain , modern devices establish a PDP session once the phone boots up and will not normally tear it down in normal operation . Furthermore with the high data consumption seen today , the " rounding up " constitutes a very small percentage increase . <p> For example , if a session had a volume of 1,0035MB ( 1MB + 3,5KB ) , the rounding up changed from 1,004MB to 1,010MB . This is an increase 0,5% in usage but , most importantly , at a rate of 20c/MB , for example , the charge in both cases is 21c . <h> Share this article <p> Well I can see Vodacom tried to justify it as much as possible . What I would have appreciated is a slight reduction in price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is also unfortunate that Vodacom 's internal servers and network ca n't be upgraded to cope with the increased demand . <p> Kevin Rheeder <p> As if the data isnt expensive enough . Only reason why I stay with Vodacom is because they are the only service provider that had LTE in my area . Other than that , I think their service and services are horrid . <p> The Emperor has no clothes ... <p> Very low end feature phones using low usage apps like Mxit will definitely see an increase in their data bills . These are the users who can least afford it . <p> Jannie Hanekom <p> Unless cell phone networks work completely different from how almost every volume-based data metering system works ( report on session closure and fixed interim intervals ) , there 's no direct correlation between data volumes and billing records , so the ridiculous bit of math in the article is hogwash . Having said that , the only way you 'd be impacted by this if you 're like my mother-in-law who used to forcibly end her data session @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would save her money . All that did was to force a billing entry , rounding up to the closest billing increment . I 'd disagree that those with low usage would be impacted significantly . Unless they do as my mother-in-law did . <p> The Emperor has no clothes ... <p> A lot of people used to end their data sessions to preserve battery life . <p> I 've not done that myself , but theory and a fair amount of Google evidence suggests that doing so was about as effective at saving battery life as it was at saving money if the data session was idle to begin with . <p> V.O.I.C.E <p> Agree , Vodacom , MTN , Cell C , Hellkom , they only interested in one thing and it 's not us ! <p> Richard Davies <p> Agreed about your opinion on the Vodacom side of it -it 's still one ' transaction ' whether it is . They are logging the usage of the device , not the 1kb . If that was the case , they should round it down rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your phone will do this itself -- going in and out of wifi-hotspots ... <p> Looked like around 5% overhead for me back in June -- when Cell-C moved from 1kb to 25kb .

In this case , it 's about men wanting to own women 's bodies for their own pleasure . <p> It 's not a joke . Undermining women is not a joke . Reducing women to images on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reducing the " nobody asks my rapist what he was wearing " movement into a farce . <p> Taylor does not own those women on his shirt , unlike Kim K , who owns her own body and can decide what the hell to do with it . You can not equate the two . Women who walk around in mini-skirts ( which do n't objectify anyone ) on a body ( which they own ) can not be equated to a man wearing a shirt covered in images of sexualised women ( who he does not own ) . What you are saying by equating the two is that because women are allowed to do what they will with themselves and their bodies , men are allowed to do what they want to women . <p> This issue has become so sensationalised that men are claiming that women are oppressing their freedom of expression . Huh ? Excuse me ? Are those thoughts actually spilling from your brain ? Do you expect women to be sorry that we inconvenienced your freedom in order to protect ourselves ? Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sexuality into our own hands ? Do you expect us to grovel before an inconsiderate man just because he landed a satellite on a comet ? <p> Do we really have to take you by the hand and lovingly show you how everything about patriarchy is wrong and then watch you tap dance all over our progresses ? I do n't think so . <p> Some have asked whether a female scientist would have been trashed for wearing a shirt that " objectified " men . Sorry ? Objectifying men implies that women have power over them . It implies that there is equality . It implies that , societally and politically , women can actually objectify men . No , we ca n't . Because a " hot " man on a T-shirt ALWAYS implies reverence of masculinity , the strong and the powerful . " Hot " women on a shirt ALWAYS implies sexual pleasure and ownership . <p> It 's something that men -- and even feminist men -- do n't seem to understand . We can not lay back and make feminism comfortable for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's your paradigm that is doing the oppressing . <p> You can not claim to understand what it feels like to be " raped " by another 's gaze due to what you 're wearing . You 're never judged in that way . Even male rape victims are never asked what they were wearing . <p> Taylor was not objectified by what he was wearing . Not even by the backlash . He objectified women by what he was wearing . And that is an undeniable truth . <p> And landing a satellite on a comet is cool , but it does n't excuse Taylor from being accountable for his actions . And just because there are worse things out there , it does n't make what he did right . Taylor has since apologised for wearing it , and I wholeheartedly accept his apology . People do stupid things all the time , and it was big of him to apologise . He just should have never done it in the first place . It 's just unfortunate that his grand achievement , however badass , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but as tacky and garish as his shirt was , you ( and a gazillion " feminists " who have jumped all over this ) are creating something out of nothing here . Your outrage needs a vehicle , and anything will do . In the process , you do more damage to gender equality than good , because your indignant outcry over trivial nonsense ends up seeing real feminists painted with the same brush ( and dismissed as " shrill " ) . <p> As for the bit about women not being able to objectify men -- this is , of course , just made-up waffle . Unless you believe that every woman who ever views pornography or ogles some hunk is simply " revering the masculine , strong and powerful " as opposed to dabbling in a little sexual pleasure ( which is apparently all that men are capable of ) . <p> I understand and agree with the need to fix our broken gender problem because it is destructive . But that 's not what you 're doing here . You 're just having yourself a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Um , I 'd argue that the female friend of Taylor 's who designed the shirt and gave it to him owns the bodies since she conceived them . The shirt is art . Bad art and perhaps not work-appropriate , but still art . It is not pornography . Today 's feminist fanatics remind of the Nationalist Party of the 1980s -- busybodying , puritanical petty fascists with no sense of joy or freedom . Bunch of harpies . <p> Esme Weatherwax <p> Sums up my thoughts exactly : I Do n't Care If You Think His Shirt is Sexist , He Landed a Spacecraft on a Comet . #shirtstorm : http : //t.co/hZV8TZbLCM " <p> Cyril <p> Censorship rules ok ! ! ! <p> Mariette Pepler-Harcombe <p> I 'm sorry Nikita , but as a woman ( and a Humanist ) I 'm totally opposed to the philosophies of feminism . I have a problem with your article ( and that of general feminist opinion on this poor guy 's shirt ) on 3 points : 1 ) Displaying images of scantily clad women on your shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexuality , or that you in some way feel that men are superior to women . I 'm confused why the use of the female image by men is always seen in a negative light . Why ca n't it be seen in a positive light ? The way some people like wearing animals on their shirt ... Does that now symbolize the human race 's ownership of the animal kingdom ? No , it does not ! 2 ) I do n't agree with the backlash of certain " menists " , who equate the reaction from feminists with rape . That 's taking it a bit too far . But they do have a point when saying that men should have the same freedom when it comes to the selection of clothing than women . Ever heard of the phrase " equal rights and big corn bites " . What goes for women should go for men . 3 ) " Some have asked whether a female scientist would have been trashed for wearing a shirt that " objectified " men . Sorry ? Objectifying men implies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equality . It implies that , societally and politically , women can actually objectify men . No , we ca n't . Because a " hot " man on a T-shirt ALWAYS implies reverence of masculinity , the strong and the powerful . " Hot " women on a shirt ALWAYS implies sexual pleasure and ownership . " Why ca n't a hot woman on a shirt be seen as a celebration of beauty , sexuality and sensuality ? Why does it always have to be about power relationships ? <p> Corn ? van Diemen <p> Congratulations on a thought provoking article . I read it with great interest and for the sake of being objective I would like ask some questions . <p> As I understood your main point of discussion was that women can not ( and should not ) be owned , either by their sexuality or their choices . It is their choice and their choice alone . In South Africa that has a particular connotation due to the deplorably high crime rate of violence against women . On all these points I feel we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that of your view Dr Matt Taylor . <p> The shirt is ugly to the point of being an eyesore but it was his right to wear it , although it was a bad choice in the fashion sense only . He did not put it on thinking , " By doing this I own women " he was wearing a shirt that he liked and a friend gave him and did not think further . Ascribing a thought pattern to what the shirt signifies and what he meant by it is a dangerous rabbit hole that can sink to the point where grey should be all we wear as we can just as easily encode colours with meaning subscribe to the oppression of others . Questions like ; who made the shirt ? Which shop sold it ? Which workers where oppressed in Asia to make it ? Then become the order of the day . When looking at who made the shirt , does this person then become the villain for producing it and is she a self-gender sexist then ? <p> By vilifying a man that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to bad fashion choices I feel is pushing it . Wearing a shirt that a fashion designer friend gave him is not the biggest crime as we can clearly see fashion is not his forte . It was not a slogan that read " I bathe in the tears of men " ( as the journalist who started this furrow ) or him stating that " I am glad that no women could do this " , he merely made a bad choice . By brow beating an individual who 's biggest mistake was a horrible shirt rather than focusing on a ) core issues that surround **29;204;TOOLONG against women and b ) the actual achievements of Dr Taylor and what previous history this man has in relation to " sexism " , seems as conducive as blaming the rabbit for Alice 's fall down the rabbit whole . Although there is a parallel that can be drawn due to shared proximity , coincidence is not causation . <p> I hope for everyone sake that we can focus on the root cause for problems that perpetuates violence and oppression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of the future of the human race , rather than flogging a dead horse about the shirt he was wearing . <p> rufust <p> A questionable shirt worn by a British scientist in a control room in Germany , working on a probe that was launched from French Guiana ? Clearly a matter of considerable concern in South Africa ... I think that given the benefit of hindsight he would n't have worn the shirt that a friend of his had hand-made and given to him for his birthday , or worn something over the top of it . Incidentally the friend who made the shirt was very proud of the fact that he 'd worn the shirt that she had made on his big day ( she 's the wife of his tattooist ) and was outright horrified by the twitter reaction . Seriously though , if you 're having to look more than a continent away to find offence , and the best you can find is a shirt then everything else must be pretty much OK . <p> RSA.MommaCyndi <p> As a woman and a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The ASTRONOMICALLY photoshopped Kardashian behind is far more damaging to females than a bunch of weapon toting , drawings on a shirt . At least his shirt was honest enough to show that they were drawings and not distorting a human body into something that would not be able to physically exist . Those drawings are not going to keep dirty old men happy in the bathroom -- that behind is . That shirt is not going to make young girls think that they are inferior -- that behind is . <p> Men can be , and are , objectified . The only difference is that they think it is a good thing . Men do n't go to gym for the six pack and the belt of adonis for fun , they go because women drool over them ... i.e. women objectify them .

He is n't a rapist or a threat to womankind ! Give the guy a break . <p> Chris Chrizzle Stevens <p> Feminism , as a philosophy , is meant to be an all inclusive doctrine of non-exclusion . However , with the recent burst of popularity thanks to Ms.Watson 's appearance at the UN , the true value of feminism has been displaced by a preoccupation of feminine angst . Firstly , as a student of both philosophy and popular culture , I can safely say that Kim is the furthest thing from a feminist as she not only benefits from the patriarchal capitalist paradigm , but further I forces the discourse of patriarchy by willingly objectifying herself to do so . <p> Secondly , the double standards of radical feminism are rife in this exchange . By ONLY vindicating Kim 's expression of " feminine sexuality " ( and I use the term in the most narrow-minded context I can muster ) , the fascist agenda of feminism completely overlooks and marginalized any consideration for Matt Taylor 's sexuality . Does his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But as always , the man-bashing radical feminists do not look beyond the surface when a man is involved . Why is he not allowed to express his ( I assume hetrosexual ) sexual identity by wearing a shirt whilst women so readily objectify both themselves and men without as much as a second thought . Perhaps then the new agenda of the feminist philosophy is to oppress men 's sexuality and impose upon them a fascist uniform of non-representation of their own sexuality whilst women are allowed to run free and do what they want . <p> Double standards much ? <p> Alan Kennedy <p> Oh , puh-leez <p> Eric Mader <p> If we reduce it to its basic premises , the argument you make here , Nikita , runs as follows : <p> 1 ) Since men in our society " own " women , men 's attention to women 's beauty or sexuality is always an attempt to further consolidate this ownership and is thus always a matter of objectification . <p> 2 ) Since , on the other hand , women in our society do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexuality ca n't be objectification , but is rather a kind of worship of male power and beauty . <p> Really I do n't know what is more striking about this argument : the sheer obviousness of the double-standard or the fact that so many so-called feminists still try to make such obviously flawed arguments . <p> First , I want to ask you : Who made you ( or your feminist sisters ) an authority capable of speaking on what is happening in men 's heads when they look at women ?

@@2220233 to say about the 2013 matric results . I know that unions speak on behalf of the teachers , but I thought that I could add my voice as an ordinary history teacher . I do not represent a variety of teachers or stakeholders ; I speak on behalf of myself and the standards I believe we should try to foster and maintain . <p> My school usually achieves an excellent matric average for our history learners and this year was no different : 67 learners wrote the exams and the average was 78% . Twenty-nine learners got distinctions and a further 30 achieved above 70% . So , really , our department should be flushed with joy and success . <p> And yet , I 'm not doing a victory dance . <p> To be fair , we try our best . We train learners well , challenge them and create our own resources . But surely there is something awry if our average is that high ? It certainly was n't that high during their schooling career . Indeed , if their average had been so high , I 'm sure questions would have been asked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not a matric teacher but I did teach our 2013 matrics in Grades 10 and 11 and have a pretty good idea of their strengths , which is why I am suspicious of their final results . I do n't deny that learners can make a huge leap between Grade 11 and 12 if they put their minds to it , but how likely is it that virtually all our history learners made this leap at the same time ? <p> So why is our average so high ? I 'm certain that our learners worked hard ( although dedication does not necessarily equal excellence ) , but I think that we need to question the standard that has been set as acceptable for history , as well as the quality of the markers themselves . <p> Unlike the sciences , the humanities provide a greater scope for a relative standard regarding correct answers . Markers need to compare learners ' answers to gauge a specific standard . It is also trickier to interpret the memo , which calls for discretion when marking a learner 's script . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's history candidates , our learners came across as very erudite , which would explain their high average . Their marks probably reflect where they are in relation to their peers . In comparison to many other learners , I suppose their answers did seem detailed and in depth . <p> Unfortunately , I think this proves how low the standards are as well as the low expectations we have of the learners in South Africa . What our history department teaches our learners as basics appear to be viewed as refined skills by national standards . We need to have more faith that when we raise our expectations , we will raise the overall standard of teaching and learning . <p> Apart from questioning the quality of acceptable answers , I also wonder whether the markers embody what history as a subject strives to achieve . I wonder whether the structure of the answers and the language our learners used impressed the markers or whether they actually scrutinised the content and arguments .

I 'm tearing my hair out because education specialists , politicians and NGOs are all adding their voices but , apart from the unions , the voices of individual teachers , those in the know , are muted . <p> As far as history is concerned , what appears to be accepted as answers brings the worth of a distinction into question .

@@2220234 <p> Around a third of the entire world 's PC software is counterfeit , according to latest figures from the International Data Corporation ( IDC ) , and in Africa , piracy rates range from around 50% in Mauritius to over 90% in Zimbabwe . <p> Despite these provocative statistics , many people remain unaware of the danger of counterfeit software . But from large corporations to startups , the public sector to consumers , no one is immune to the pitfalls of using unlicensed software -- as the effects trickle in to the entire economy . Education is critical to informing citizens of the risks , and governments and the private sector have a key role to play in informing consumers and introducing effective legislation to curb piracy . <p> " Our research is unequivocal : Inherent dangers lurk for consumers and businesses that take a chance on counterfeit software , " said John Gantz , chief researcher at IDC . " Some people choose counterfeit to save money , but this ' ride-along ' malware ends up putting a financial and emotional strain on both the enterprise and casual computer users alike . " <p> The security risk <p> One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security . Pirated software , whether bought as physical media from vendors or kiosks , downloaded off non-reputable websites , or obtained through cracks in the distribution channel , makes it easier for viruses , malware , and Trojans to take root in the operating system . Across Africa , the rapidly improving broadband availability means more PCs downloading software off the internet . This makes it harder for people to be sure if what they are downloading is genuine and many do n't even know that they are exposing themselves to a number of risks if they download pirated software . <p> According to a study commissioned by Microsoft and conducted by the IDC earlier this year , the chances of infection by unexpected malware are one in three for consumers using pirated software and three in 10 for businesses . More critical , warns the Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) , is the threat of malware-induced cyber-attacks .

These spread through shared connections to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crippling economies and endangering intellectual property . <p> Piracy costs more <p> As a result of malware induced infections , our research shows that consumers around the world will collectively spend 1.5 billion hours and $22 billion identifying , repairing and recovering from the impact of malware , while global enterprises will spend $114 billion to deal with the impact of malware-induced cyber-attacks . This makes software piracy a global , and a national priority -- as ultimately , it affects a society at every level . <p> The impact on innovation <p> A country where counterfeit is rampant deters Foreign Direct Investment ( FDI ) and not only does this mean a loss of capital inflow , it leads to a considerable loss of intellectual capital . Piracy discourages innovation and entrepreneurship well beyond the IT industry -- artists , doctors , film makers , musicians , and businesses are deterred from investing resources in new products , ideas and market development that significantly contribute to the economy and produce capital outflows . <p> What can government and IT companies do ? <p> Research by the Business Software Alliance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ software is a symptom of a legal system that is ill equipped to effectively protect intellectual property rights . Protecting the law of copyright needs an effective enforcement mechanism -- creating the legislation is often the easier part , and it is with enforcement where the real problem lies . <p> At Microsoft , we believe there is a joint responsibility between vendors and the government to identify and address gaps in the local software protection ecosystem to ensure that they are able to achieve their national agenda priorities . A great example where partnerships of this nature have worked well is in Mauritius . In 1997 , the Government of Mauritius introduced the Copyright Act which protects intellectual property rights . This piece of legislation is key for a number of industries such as software , textile , music , cinema , and pharmaceuticals where innovation and creativity is a critical success factor . The introduction of this law has led to a number of multinationals entering the Mauritian market and has contributed significantly to driving a healthy business ecosystem . <p> The results are substantiated by annual studies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the study , the software piracy rate in Mauritius was 90% in 1994 and 78% in 1998 respectively .

Aside from logistical issues , there 's a good reason why the ANC would have been opposed to allowing expats a provincial vote : in the 2009 elections , when only already registered South Africans were allowed to vote , the DA won the vast majority of votes cast overseas . It 's doubtful that things will look any different this time around . By REBECCA DAVIS . <p> Last year the Electoral Amendment Bill was passed , giving South Africans living abroad the right for the first time to register to vote in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1998 Electoral Act onwards granted the right to vote overseas only to South African government officials , sports teams who happened to be competing internationally , and South Africans on business or holiday trips . This changed before the 2009 elections after being challenged by the Freedom Front Plus in court , with the result that South Africans who were already registered to vote back at home were allowed to cast their ballot in a foreign country in that year . <p> The 2009 turnout , however , was insignificant . London saw the highest number of South Africans queue to make their mark at the High Commission , with 7,472 votes cast . Australia and Dubai followed , with 1 , 235 votes and 900 votes cast respectively , and a few hundred more in New Zealand , the Netherlands and Ireland . Isolated votes were cast in places as far afield as Trinidad and Tobago . A total of 9,857 votes were counted . <p> The DA wiped the floor with the competition , taking home 7,581 votes . COPE followed , with a meagre 918 votes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rake in 670 . <p> Of course , this outcome is n't remotely surprising if you take into account the stereotype of the disenchanted white ? migr ? , as offensively reductive as that might be . It 's unclear just how many South Africans there are living overseas at the moment , but the popular conception is that the majority are white . Two years ago Politicsweb tried to do the maths . On the basis of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development ( OECD ) data , the website estimated that as of 2010 , there were around 580,000 people born in South Africa living in 18 countries including the UK , Australia , New Zealand , Canada and the US . The lion 's share were in the UK ( 227,000 ) , followed by Australia ( 155,690 ) . <p> We should n't put too much faith in those figures , because they 're likely to be unreliable . We also do n't know what percentage of those South African-borns are eligible to vote in terms of age . Still , if you consider that 500,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Independent Democrats , the UDM and the FF Plus combined , it 's clear that the overseas vote is potentially worth something . <p> The DA definitely knows this . The DA Abroad is a slick , well-run operation headed up by one Nigel Bruce , former Financial Mail and Business Day editor ( and former DA MP ) . According to their website , the DA Abroad has branches on five continents , although the most active appears to be in London . <p> DA Abroad Media Liaison Francine Higham , based in London , told the Daily Maverick on Thursday that the organisation currently has two campaigns running to encourage South Africans overseas to register to vote . One is non-partisan -- the ' Vote Home ' campaign -- and the other is a global campaign which " has a stronger focus on DA messaging and which will be run via our official regional networks in the UK and across Europe , Asia , Africa , the Middle East and the USA &amp; Canada , " says Higham . <p> " In 2009 over 85% of South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation allowing South Africans to vote abroad being passed very late ahead of the elections , voter turnout was very poor , " Higham explained .

@@2252240 <h> Sherlock season 3 returns to SA screens <h> Related Links <p> Cape Town - The much anticipated season 3 of Sherlock starring Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman returns to South African screens this Friday . <p> BBC Entertainment will be bringing Sherlock Season 3 to South African audiences hot off the heels of the United Kingdom transmission . <p> The question on everyone 's lips is finally answered as Sherlock returns in three brand new action-packed adventures . The game is on for Sherlock and John in The Empty Hearse , The Sign of Three and finally , His Last Vow . <p> In an exclusive interview with BBC Entertainment , co-creator Steven Moffat dishes on the new series . <p> Q : How did you manage to keep the manner in which Sherlock faked his own death at the end of the last series secret ? A : You just do n't tell anyone ! You also rely on a lot of goodwill . I think it 's really important to keep it secret . It 's terribly unexciting if you read the secret in the papers . What 's exciting is to see how we do tell you at the beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret . We 're not being grumpy about it . We are simply trying to make the show more fun to watch . People have been speculating wildly for the last 18 months . But I can assure you that the reunion is worth the wait . <p> Q : What are the ramifications when Sherlock returns " from the dead " ? A : He thinks things will be exactly as he left them . But inevitably there is a certain amount of fallout from him reappearing out of the blue . There have to be major repercussions . It 's not as easy as Sherlock would like it to be . People have been hurt . What viewers love are the scenes between Sherlock and John . The show is entirely about their relationship with a bit of detection thrown in . It 's a story about a detective , rather than a detective story . Detection is low down on the list . <p> Q : Is Sherlock different in this third series ? A : Yes . That 's what we did to him last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very much a child in the first series . In the second series , he encountered love and loss and fear and that shaped him . Now we simply move him closer to the Sherlock you 're more used to seeing . So in this series , he has a more suave veneer . As the stories progress , he becomes more charming , funnier , more apparently human , but still with spiky moments of terrifying psycho-ness . The frustrating thing with a character like this is that if he never learns anything , he does n't seem very clever . So he has to get better at dealing with people . <p> Q : Why did you go for a modern setting ? A : I would argue that our interpretation is very , very close to the original . It 's only updating it . It 's quite surprising to go back to the original and imagine how modern those stories must have seemed in The Strand magazine compared to the rest of Victorian literature . Sherlock was 800 times faster than anything else in Victorian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back then . He was an imperiously , militantly modern man who talked about science and microscopes and all sorts of new-fangled things like that . But as the years have passed , a layer of dust has fallen on it . He was living in what to him was the modern world , but to us is a sepia-tinted photograph . By moving him back to where he really belongs , which is the same city as you and me , we 've made a version of Sherlock Holmes which seems as modern to our audience as it wasto the original readers of The Strand magazine . <p> Q : What difference does Watson 's marriage to Mary ( played by Martin Freeman 's real-life partner Amanda Abbington ) make to his relationship with Sherlock ? A : The first thing to say is that Amanda is a fantastic presence on set . She changes the dynamic in a very interesting way . In the past , Mary has been treated as an interloper and is always portrayed as cross about things . But in this version , Holmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that Watson has moved out . These two men are well off and clearly would n't choose to live together forever . So now Watson is always coming round to see Holmes -- and thinking , " God knows what I 'll find ! " Mary is very tolerant . She says to her husband , " Now go off and have fun . " It 's almost as if she is quite glad to get him out from under her feet . He asks , " May I ? " , and she replies , " Oh , go on then ! " <p> Q : Finally , why do you think these stories have endured so well ? A : Conan Doyle 's genius was to bring together two of the most unlikely friends who together form a whole . We join them at the beginning , which is just the right moment . John has lost his mojo , and Sherlock is on the verge of becoming a psycho . The story is about the slow humanisation of Sherlock . He often says to John , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it very sincerely because John has changed his life . By starting very early in their friendship , we can explore that . Their friendship is not already set in stone . They are not twomiddle-aged men sitting around in the drawing room smoking their pipes !

@@2257240 <p> There 's an online land grab of the sort not seen since the dot-com bubble taking place in the global instant messaging ( IM ) market . WhatsApp Messenger , WeChat ( partly owned by South Africa 's Naspers ) , Hangouts , Skype and BlackBerry Messenger ( BBM ) , along with several smaller players , are in a race to control the future of communication and social interaction on smartphones . <p> The stakes are enormous . Whoever is victorious -- assuming there is one victor -- will own the feature on smartphones with which hundreds of millions around the world spend significant time interacting . Within a few years , the IM user base will be in the billions . The opportunity is vast and the growth rates are nothing short of astounding . <p> Just this week , WhatsApp , the world 's largest mobile IM platform , said it now has more than 430m active users , more than doubling the 200m users it had just nine months ago . Its users now send 50bn messages a day , up from 20bn in April 2013 . <p> Put that into context : media behemoth Comcast , the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of 2012 . And consumers , especially youngsters , spend hours every day with their faces buried in WhatsApp . The monetisation opportunities are vast . Yet few IM vendors appear in a rush to profit big ( and least not yet ) while the land grab continues . <p> WhatsApp , for example , has long threatened to charge a nominal subscription fee of $1/year -- potentially netting it at least $430m/year based on its current active subscriber base -- but it has appeared reluctant to charge even such a basic fee to most users , especially those in emerging markets where people do n't necessarily have easy access to online payment mechanisms . <p> Another reason could be that WhatsApp has some serious competition breathing down its neck , particularly from WeChat ( known as Weixin in China ) , which is owned by Tencent , the fast-growing Internet sensation in which Naspers holds roughly a one-third stake . Tencent 's performance , along with a weak rand , has lit a rocket under Naspers 's share price , which has more than doubled in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IM app used mainly on PCs . QQ had an astonishing 818m active users at the end of June last year . The mobile-focused WeChat has more than 236m active users . More people in China use IM than use Internet search engines . <p> Tencent is actively pushing WeChat into markets across the world . In Africa , it 's working with Naspers to grow the product in South Africa and Nigeria , and soon in Ghana , Kenya and other markets . <p> Brett Loubser , who heads up WeChat Africa , says that unlike WhatsApp , the WeChat app will always be free to use . However , Tencent is already profiting from its users by selling content like casual games or in-game content as well " emoticon " sets -- smiley faces , and so on -- for a few bucks a pop . <p> Brands could also be charged in future to offer their own channels through the WeChat service . In China , the platform is already used by consumers to find deals in shopping malls and to buy airline tickets . Tencent has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . <p> Though WhatsApp and WeChat look like the two platforms most likely to come to dominate the global IM market , there are many other players nipping at their heels . There 's the cross-platform Skype , which is popularly used for IM by its users . And Google is pushing its Hangouts service , which began life as a PC-based chat program , as an integrated chat service on Android . It recently began incorporating Hangouts with SMS on Android phones in the hope of driving up consumer interest . <p> BlackBerry remains a bit of a dark horse with BBM , though it may have come to the party too late by opening the platform to iPhone and Android users only recently . Its value proposition relative to its bigger rivals is also not clear . <p> There are raft of smaller -- but not insignificant -- players such as Japan 's Line and Korea 's KakaoTalk , both of which are popular in Southeast Asia , and even South Africa 's Mxit , though its user base is small compared to the big regional and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is anyone 's guess .

@@2276236 <h> Related News <p> Starbound has been a huge success , there is no doubt about it . It has passed one million copies sold and become an instant phenomenon . But this is n't the only game published by Chucklefish , and one of their new creations looks extraordinary . <p> Developed by ConcernedApe , Stardew Valley is a country-life RPG in the style of old-school Harvest Moon . The graphics and interface are very similar to early Harvest Moon , and made me very nostalgic . However , it 's not just about planting crops and wooing women in this game -- it has multiplayer . <p> Stardew Valley will have support for up to 4-player co-op online and over LAN . There are no plans for a split-screen co-op yet . <p> So , I can spend my time looking after the animals while a friend goes and chops down trees so that another friend can till our fields ? That 's really pretty cool . The game will feature over 80 achievements , and allows players to farm , learn skills , go mining , engage with their community , go spelunking , woo women , do archaeology , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices will matter -- depending on what you do , the valley can be a small-town paradise , or fall to the greedy and powerful Joja Corporation . <p> Just check out the adorable trailer showing off all the features -- this is a game that I need in my life ASAP . <p> We do n't have a release date for this game yet , but it 's starting to look pretty polished and well put together . Let 's hope that we can get our green thumbs on it soon . Thus far , it 's only planned to release on PC , although Mac and Linux should also be getting releases down the line . <p> Wielding my lasso of truth , I am the combination of nerd passion and grammar nazi . I delve into all things awesome and geek-tastic . I believe people should stop defining themselves and just enjoy playing games , so let 's get on with it !

There were many words , but very little sense . It seems Nenzani does n't quite comprehend exactly how much power now sits in the hands of the " big three " . By ANTOINETTE MULLER . <p> If South Africa were in desperate search of the best spinner to run out for them in the Test against Australia , they need to look no further than CSA president Chris Nenzani . He could give Mac Maharaj a run for his money . With the Position Paper drafted by the ECB , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landscape will change very soon , and on Tuesday Nenzani tried his best to explain why , after so much fuss , CSA changed their vote . <p> At first , Cricket South Africa were vehemently opposed to it all . But , like everyone , they had a price . Their price , as it turns out , was surprisingly cheap . Despite Pakistan and Sri Lanka kicking their heels and abstaining from the vote , CSA decided it would be best to think about themselves . Nenzani denied that the PCB and SLC were allies of CSA . Funny , that . When CSA were backstabbed by a prickly BCCI last year and their tour was severely truncated , Pakistan stepped in to send a team to their shores to try to make up some of the losses many of the grounds and the fans would experience . Surely that counts for something ? <p> Apparently not . It 's all about " strategic partnerships " and , apparently , the more money those strategic partners make , the better . For that kind of thinking , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cricket in South Africa to survive , it needs to make a chunk of money . Lose money and it has a ripple effect on everything from staff at top level to development . Following their losses from the Indian tour , South Africa had to withdraw three staff members from the party for the Under-19 World Cup . Amongst those losses was a bowling coach . When financial losses strike , they strike hard , and the ripple effect they could have could be severe . There is nothing wrong with looking after your own financial interests in a cut-throat economy , but Nenzani seemingly does n't realise just how much power has been handed over to the unholy trinity of the ECB , CA and the BCCI . <p> Within those three power-hungry organisations exists a number of people who struggle to even manage their own affairs , never mind that of world cricket . The ECB were the board who got into bed with now convicted fraudster Allen Stanford and Giles Clarke faced absolutely no consequences .

No , instead it looked like a group of chimps dressed up in tutus trying to play out " Simon Says " . CA are the men behind the ' homeworkgate ' scandal which saw Mickey Arthur sacked and threatening to sue the board for unfair dismissal . As for the BCCI and Srinivasan , the less said about them , the better . <p> Those are the people who will now run world cricket . Yes , the ICC , which pretends to be the sport 's governing body , will still hold the final say , but how many important decisions will actually reach board level ? <p> In his press conference , Nenzani repeatedly insisted that part of the plan was that , with these new proposals , CSA would be able to " shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the newly formed ExCo and the revamped Financial and Commercial affairs committee will still hold the power of the big three . The ECB , CA and the BCCI will be joined by two other members from other boards , with CSA most likely getting a seat at one of those . But when the three boards are in cahoots for their self-interest , what are the chances that important decisions - decisions which impact the global game - will actually be passed ? Power essentially sits with those two committees now , and they will vote on what recommendations should be put forward to the ICC board . Chances are , if an idea does n't benefit them massively , it will get thrown and voted out . The magnitude of power that has been handed over to a small pocket of people in a global game is deeply concerning . <p> Furthermore , Nenzani insists that there were no deals cut to swing CSA 's vote and the decision was made purely on the improved position paper which includes CSA in the Test fund which they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insists that there has been no formal or informal approach made for South Africa to host the IPL and there has been no discussion about South Africa potentially hosting ICC events in the next cycle .

What that means is anyone 's guess . Should these negotiations be a success , CSA will score , because the agreements will be contractually binding and , should anyone decide to go back on their tour agreements , they can be taken to court to make up the money lost . That 's a solid deal for all involved , but it 's possibly one of the only good things to come from the new deal . <p> " Nothing is perfect " has been the most common response form CSA 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's almost certain that there was a solution more perfect than meekly surrendering power to small group , especially after making such a big huff and puff about it in the first place .

It 's a nice extra feature to have , but it 's not the killer app that should make you dash out and buy this drive over competing ones as how much you can back up to your account depends on how much space Dropbox has given you , which is nowhere near the 2TB capacity of the Slim .

@@2323231 <h> Dropbox , privacy and business : what the new T&amp;Cs reveal <p> We 've made a lot of changes to Dropbox since we last updated our Terms of Service , Privacy Policy , and online Dropbox for Business Agreements . So today , we 're starting to email users to let you know about some updates to these policies . The updates will be effective on March 24 , 2014 . <p> There are no big surprises , for the most part . The most significant change to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy is probably how the documents are worded . The language is streamlined , easier to understand and the documents are structured to make more sense to non-lawyers . The revised terms introduce a more information dispute resolution mechanism along with an arbitration process which you will have about a month from 24th March to opt-out of using an online form ( if you do this , you basically revert to court as your dispute resolution mechanism ) . <p> Trust has been essential since Snowden changed our understanding of how governments monitor us and Dropbox 's updates are clearly designed to alleviate our concerns about storing data with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't change the fact that Dropbox may decrypt your data if required to do so . Its Security Overview includes this reminder in the context of legal compliance and law enforcement : <p> As set forth in our privacy policy , and in compliance with United States law , Dropbox cooperates with United States law enforcement when it receives valid legal process , which may require Dropbox to provide the contents of your private Dropbox . In these cases , Dropbox will remove Dropbox 's encryption from the files before providing them to law enforcement . <p> Of course you could address this by adding your own encryption locally which would , in turn , affect the service 's usability . It is a trade off you may be comfortable with , though . <p> Advert <p> Dropbox 's updates also deal with its Dropbox for Business service and the Terms of Service have a small section dealing with this ( the core terms and conditions governing Dropbox 's business offering are in its Business Agreement which , unlike the consumer facing Terms of Service and Privacy Policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dropbox for Business <p> Email address .

In particular , you may find your account blocked until you transition it to a Dropbox for Business account or unless you associate your account with a personal email address . <p> Many people use business email addresses for personal email and as their usernames for their social services . This is a really bad idea , largely because you do n't have much control over those accounts and because they are business email accounts , your employer can usually access your emails . If your employer has access to your emails and your email account is the primary email address associated with your Facebook , Twitter or other profiles , your employer potentially has access to those profiles too .

It uses pretty strong encryption and other security measures but these can be circumvented by law enforcement bodies and , if you happen to use a business email address as your Dropbox username , possibly even your employer .

@@2334237 <h> Midnight in the garden of Telkom &amp; ISPs <p> I write this to serve as documentation of a struggle I have been having with broadband lately and to serve as a critique of the current status of broadband in this country . <p> Before I begin , let me give you some background into my current situation . <p> My first forays into home ADSL was with Telkom as my ISP . Here , I was on the ' do broadband 4mb uncapped ' package . My router synched at 10mb and I enjoyed download speeds at around a 450KB/s on average . All was well with the world . <p> Three months into our partnership , it seemed the honeymoon was over , however . My p2p downloads had started to top out at 35 -- 40KB/ps . I gave them the benefit of the doubt , thinking that they were struggling with network congestion . <p> This continued for another 2 months , albeit with small intermittent periods of glorious 500KB/ps . I knew that they were throttling me because my router was always synching at 10mb , regardless of the p2p speeds I was getting . A funny incident came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online , who proceeded to insure me that my p2p was not being throttled . I explained to him that if that was not the case , how was it possible for me to stream video at HD from youtube ... yet not get more than 40KB/s on any p2p/torrent download ? You would need at least a 4mb line to stream HD fluently . Needless to say , stuttering and excuses followed . <p> I continued this struggle until a friend suggested I move both ISP and ADSL line control to Afrihost , the much touted and no 1 rated ISP in the country . They had a 4mb business package which was apparently unshaped , uncapped and unthrottled . Here again , the first 2 months was a fairy tale of digital bliss . Good speed , great service from their side and all queries I had were speedily tended to by a friendly agent . <p> And then the wheels came off . <p> For about the last month , I have been struggling to get an internet connection . The first week , my router inexplicably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had an internet connection . I was online with them querying this speed drop , but the usual speedy and friendly service disappeared and was replaced by the more common ' information blackout ' . Then it got even worse . For the last 3 weeks I have been unable to even connect to the internet , even though my router shows it is synching at 1mb and the ADSL and internet lights are on . <p> When they finally did get back to me , they told me it was a router problem and that I should test this with another working router on the same line . Fair enough , I did this and the result was the same . I took some pics of both routers synching and the line stats and sent them the results , thinking that they would get a tech out or at least try to assist a ' premium ' business account user . Nothing . <p> After more than 3 weeks of no or intermittent internet , and having proven that the problem is not on my side , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of plan or info . <p> Afterwards , when a buddy of mine complained about the same thing ( only getting 1mb ) I gave it a bit of thought . Why would they want to control your ADSL line ? Maybe they are collectively screwing us over . How often do you check your line synch rate on router ? How many people actually know where to check this ? Having someone pay for a 4mb line and then synching their router at 1mb to save on data costs would work nicely for them . <p> On the odd occasion where they get caught out doing this , they can just shrug their shoulders and say ' oops ' . <p> Who is checking that the consumer , once again , is n't being ripped a new one ?

@@2334240 <p> As election politics moves into a state of frenzy , the elite consensus that has held together our body politic will at last be challenged from what , at first glance , looks like the left . <p> It is now well known that , for our democracy to emerge in 1994 , a deal had to be stitched up behind the scenes between ? economic and political elites . The ANC was given political power as long as it did not disturb the economic " fundamentals " ; that is , the fundamental interests of the ? economic elite . <p> So , the **25;536;TOOLONG complex , based on the banks and fossil-fuel industries , remained intact , and massive amounts of capital were allowed to flee the country . In exchange , we got affirmative action in the public sector , and the black economic enrichment of an elite few . <p> The working class got some protection , but with enough loopholes for greater informalisation of work . The poor received often substandard reconstruction and development programme houses and , eventually , meagre social grants to keep them beholden to the state . <p> The ideological discourse of the ANC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( NDR ) in effect bound all this together . When the poor became impatient , the mythical , ostensibly more radical " second phase " of the NDR was invoked , but it was once again talk left but walk right . Meanwhile , looting of the state , patronage and government collapse , particularly at provincial and local level , continued apace . <p> And so did profit maximisation , environmental degradation and obscene wealth accumulation by the economic elite , who had never had it so good . Whitey Basson , the chief executive of Shoprite Checkers , reportedly " earned " R627-million in 2011 . But media attention is on the black elite , so Basson is hardly noticed . The global system sanctifies such enrichment as the fruit of ? economic progress . <p> What does it mean to be socialist ? Then along comes Julius Malema and the Economic Freedom Fighters ( EFF ) , threatening to blow the elite consensus out of the water . But is the EFF 's brand of militarist economic nationalism a left alternative , or a heady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Its election manifesto contains much that leftists could support , such as public transport , minimum wages , free education , a national health service , land redistribution , reduced government wastage , jail time for corruption , public officials using public services , and increased social grants . But its economic nationalism seems more authoritarian-statist than democratic-socialist , and harks back to failed 20th-century experiments . <p> Last week , Dinga Sikwebu , the education officer of the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa ( Numsa ) , offered a very different vision to that of the EFF . Addressing the overflowing book launch of Marxisms in the 21st Century at the University of the Witwatersrand , Sikwebu reminded his audience that to be socialist means to embrace democracy in all its dimensions , and that begins with how people conduct themselves as leaders , and how they make decisions within their own organisations . <p> It also means defending the rights of those some people disagree with , such as those of the Democratic Alliance ( DA ) to march peacefully . <p> Sikwebu startled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issuing a statement to that effect before the DA march . Although it was not agreed to in the end , it introduced the principle that , if such rights are not vigorously defended , the working class could find it is denied them too . <p> ' Movement for socialism ' At its special congress in December , Numsa , the largest affiliate of the Congress of South African Trade Unions ( Cosatu ) , decided to leave the tripartite alliance with the ruling ANC and the South African Communist Party ( SACP ) , opening a new chapter in the history of working-class politics in South Africa . <p> Numsa will work towards building a broad united front of organisations and groups " against neoliberal policies " and will explore the ? establishment of a " movement for socialism " that could eventually become a ? political party . <p> The move follows the Marikana massacre of mineworkers in August 2012 , the ANC government 's adoption of the essentially neoliberal National Development Plan , and the suspension of Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi , a firm Numsa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cosatu further , and brings to the fore the issue of workers ' control of the unions and of broader society . <p> These issues crystallise around the increased social distance of union leaders from members , and the debate on " nationalisation " of the commanding heights of the economy , including Numsa 's very specific and imaginative proposals regarding a " socially owned " renewable-energy sector that empowers communities rather than a state bureaucracy or a few private firms . <p> Though Numsa seems to share a " Marxist-Leninist " outlook with the EFF , it views the EFF with suspicion , particularly given that Malema , its " commander-in-chief " , can not explain how he got his wealth . Numsa also believes the EFF lacks democratic credentials . Are these true democratic leftists or aspirant elites using left rhetoric to ride into power on the backs of the youth and the poor ? The EFF and its youth constituency can not be ignored , but Numsa is cautious . <p> Yet Numsa is still embedded in a Marxist-Leninist ideological discourse derived from the SACP .

" <p> This stands in stark contrast to the SACP 's Marxist-Leninism , which has infected the labour movement and the EFF : the mechanical dogma that has robbed Marxism of its critical vitality . The SACP , throughout its history , followed the Soviet Union , which , under Stalin , emptied socialism of its democratic essence . Statism , as the sociologist Erik Olin Wright argues in Real Utopias , was mistaken for socialism . The Soviet Union disempowered the working class and ordinary citizens by placing full authority in the hands of an unaccountable state bureaucracy and ruling party . <p> With the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the publication of Joe Slovo 's Has Socialism Failed ? in 1990 , the SACP began to shed some of this baggage . Yet it has reasserted itself recently , in both the SACP and , at first glance , the EFF . <p> Numsa has to decide how it relates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much smaller Workers and Socialist Party , also embedded in a 20th-century Marxist-Leninism , and the more flexible eco-Marxism in the Democratic Left Front . <p> There is a vast difference between traditional Marxist-Leninist socialist struggles and a new form of 21st-century eco-socialist struggle . The former is state centric , and facilitated by a hierarchical political party , whereas the latter is society centric , and facilitated by mass participatory democracy . <p> ' Be the change you want to see ' A social focus entails a mobilised civil society to keep elected representatives accountable and maximum participatory democracy at all levels of social life . This participatory-democratic socialist vision resonated in the United Democratic Front during the 1980s , conceptualising working-class politics in the broadest terms , including the struggle for economic democracy and citizens ' control in the political and social spheres . <p> Such a democracy , combined with a global , expansive eco-socialist vision ( including insights from indigenous knowledge ) , would be sensitive to both social and ecological sustainability . <p> Following the Gandhian principle of " be the change you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing on the outcome . This is a long-term battle that is already taking shape in groupings such as the World Social Forum and in places such as Bolivia and Kerala , India . Even the Buddhist country Bhutan , and its notion of a gross national happiness index , has potential resonance with eco-Marxism . <p> In the wake of a global crisis that has delegitimised the certainties of neoliberal economics , there is a growing awareness of the need to find alternatives to disaster capitalism . <p> According to Bolivian president Evo Morales : " It is nothing new to live well . It is simply a matter of recovering the life of our forbears and putting an end to the kind of thinking that encourages individualistic egoism and the thirst for luxury . Living well is not living better at the expense of others . We need to build a communitarian socialism in harmony with Mother Earth . "

@@2393239 <h> Rayman Legends <p> Rayman Legends was released on PlayStation 3 , Xbox 360 and Wii U in September 2013 , and recently on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One . Following on from Rayman Origins with its fast-paced 2D multiplayer hand-drawn action , Legends is not quite as fresh but still a top-notch option for local multiplayer or singleplayer platforming . <p> What You Need to Know <p> This PS4 version is almost identical to the Xbox 360 version Tom reviewed in September last year . I 'm going to focus on the differences and provide a quick summary of likes and dislikes . <p> What 's New ? <p> Load times were non-existent in my downloaded version of Rayman Legends . Words can not describe how refreshing this is . I recently played Donkey Kong Country : Tropical Freeze ( read that review here ) and while I did n't mind the load times then I can now see just how much more enjoyable it could have been without them . In Legends you jump into a painting and ' Bam ! ' You 're in the level ! <p> The PS4 's DualShock 4 's touchpad is put to use in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game , which works well and it 's a nice ( if superfluous ) touch . A few extra outfits for Rayman are also included for this PS4 release . <p> What 's the Same ? <p> Pretty much everything else is the same as Rayman Legends on the Xbox 360 or PS3 ) . <p> You 'll Enjoy Rayman Legends If You Liked ... <p> ... Rayman Origins . Legends continues from Origins with enhanced visuals and more variety in gameplay . <p> ... Donkey Kong Country : Tropical Freeze -- DK is much more difficult and its puzzle pieces are arguably more difficult to find than Rayman 's Teensies , but the series are quite similar at heart . Which you enjoy more probably depends on preference . <p> What I Liked <p> - 5 . ) The striking cel-shaded UbiArt-powered graphics and animations continue to be unique among games and almost worth the purchase price in themselves . <p> - 4 . ) Replaying old Origins levels with the upgraded engine of Legends put a smile on my face . It also showed just how much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bunch of segments linked together by doors ( like they were in Origins ) . <p> - 3 . ) Having all abilities available from the start meant jumping straight into the action instead of a slow ramp-up . <p> - 2 . ) Music levels , where your jumps and actions are timed to a music track played in the background -- timing your jumps and slides to the riffs feels so right ( although it 's missing something without another player timing the gongs to the beat too ) . <p> - 1 . ) Load times are ridiculously short , to the point of being non-existent . <p> Favourite Moment <p> The speed levels are still my favourite part of these new Rayman games , despite the amount of restarts and cursing they involve ! <p> What I Did n't Like <p> - 3 . ) Rayman still suffers from being a little one-dimensional -- there is a very specific way to complete a level without any room for exploration . <p> - 2 . ) The music levels are unsatisfying in singleplayer compared to my experience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ See what I liked above , though : The music levels are still a great addition . <p> - 1 . ) The Murphy mechanics are annoying , frankly . With a second player and the Wii U 's touchpad they would be great ( as they were in the demo on the Wii U ) , but as it is they feel like they were designed with another system in mind and not adjusted enough for this one . They work , but can be frustrating because of the lack of precision in controlling things . They also remind me that the best platform for playing this game is still the Wii U -- it does n't benefit very much from the extra power of the PS4 . <p> Least Favourite Moment <p> I did n't like the overarching collection mechanic . As you collect Teensies you unlock levels , characters , enemies in a gallery and so on . This does n't have the punch and intrinsic reward of the overworld segments in games like the recent Donkey Kong Country or Super Mario games . <p> Rayman Legends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge modes that were available before are available in the PS4 version -- daily challenges and weekly challenges as well as extreme versions of each . <p> As you play levels in Legends you also unlock improved versions of Rayman Origins levels , which means the game packs a reasonable amount of content . <p> The Bottom Line <p> Here comes the new Legends , same as the old Legends , but with shorter loading times .

The decant is a result of heavy recent rains which elevated the water table and effected the decant . Thirty-million-litres of AMD has decanted from two points in March alone . Picture : Michel Bega <h> Acid mine drainage ( AMD ) is spilling out to the surface in the West Rand at a rate of around 30 million litres per month , leaving decimated ecosystems in its wake and posing critical danger to the future drinking water supply nationally -- if left unchecked . <p> " This water is essentially diluted sulphuric acid , high in sulphates with a pH of two . Anything below a pH of five will dissolve uranium , " Mintails Mogale Gold general manager of operations Jan Jacobs told a media tour at the long abandoned 18 Winze ventilation shaft , visible from the company 's Mogale Gold processing plant near Krugersdorp . <p> Jaws dropped at the sheer volume of water gushing out of the shaft -- preceded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what was later identified as high sulphate levels in the water . <p> The discharge point for treated acid mine drainage flows into a retaining dam , 27 March 2014 , which feeds to a depository dam at Mintails Mogale Gold near Krugersdorp . Picture : Michel Bega <p> While decant -- the formation of acids in exposed underground water -- has happened largely uncontrolled in the area since 2002 , the conversion of a nearby high-density sludge plant to a pumping station had stopped the surface decant for 17 months , Jacobs said . <p> The station is managed by the Trans Caledon Tunnel Authority and capable of pumping , treating and discharging 27 million litres of AMD per day . But recent heavy rains had increased the discharge rate to 30 million litres per day , rendering the pumping station 's capacity insufficient to stop three million litres of essentially metal-laden water from flooding the environment . <p> The AMD flows untreated to the headwaters of the nearby Tweelopiespruit , which flows through the Krugersdorp Nature Reserve , before joining other tributaries leading to the Vaal Barrage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead , " he said . " While some plant species seem to flourish , you wo n't find fish or frogs there . " <p> Mintails chief financial officer Eddie Milne said the discharge rate was unlikely to slow naturally , necessitating the need to upgrade capacity of the TCTA 's pumping station . <p> " We have around 35 megalitres excess capacity on our mine 's pumping and treatment facilities and have offered the use of it to government at cost price . This would bring total capacity to around 70 megalitres per day to stop the decant -- but an agreement is still pending , " said Milne . <p> The Lancaster Dam is seen , 27 March 2014 , in the Krugersdorp area .

Depending on the world region , 50% to 90% of all local bees have disappeared , and this epidemic is still spreading from beehive to beehive -- all over the planet . Everywhere , the same scenario is repeated : billions of bees leave their hives , never to return . No bodies are found in the immediate surroundings , and no visible predators can be located .

@@2417234 away <p> Cape Town - You do n't own a gyrocopter -- you have a deep and meaningful relationship with it . And it 's a damn good investment . <p> What was once considered an activity only practised by " those on the fringes of aviation lunacy " ( an aviation journo in the 1990s when referring to gyro pilots ) has grown to probably the fastest-growing sector of sport aviation . Gyro pilots are still crazy , but this time absolutely crazy about their gyroplanes which turn their dreams of reaching for the skies into reality . If only you could ask former Royal Air Force Wing Commander Ken Wallis , the engineer extraordinaire who built and flew Little Nellie in the James Bond Movie You only Live Twice . At the age of 95 , this nonagenarian was still trying to beat the gyro air speed record ... <p> Gyroplanes , or more commonly gyrocopters , had a rather unmerited bad rep initially . At best , they were " quirky " . Thanks to modern technology the design has stayed the same but refinement , engine capabilities and composite material have made it a far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken its rightful place in mainstream aviation . <p> Butch Brown , the sole importer in sub-Saharan Africa for the Italian manufactured Magni brand , says : " At first gyros were not readily accepted and considered dangerous . This perception changed with time as people started understanding what the modern sport gyro was all about . They are very safe flying machines when flown within their envelope by competent pilots . " <p> Gyros are predominantly bought by recreational pilots and our climate is perfect for open cockpit flying , he says . They are not just boys ' toys though -- they are used commercially for dispersing sterilised coddling moths ( really ) into crops as they can fly low enough over the fields . <p> The gyrocopter is a hybrid between a fixed wing plane and helicopter and officially called a gyroplane . Considered one of the safest forms of aviation , it can not stall or spin like an aeroplane or microlite aircraft when flying at low airspeeds and requires a significantly smaller area to land in . The obvious question is how and why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firma . <p> So briefly : The gyro is in a permanent state of autorotation , which means the workload to fly and land it is much reduced compared to a helicopter . The gyrocopter 's engine is not connected to the rotors ; instead , the airflow passing through the rotors keeps them turning , so there is no slowing down of the rotors even if the engine fails . <p> Add the great all-round visibility , the relatively low cost of operation and the ease of flying these incredible machines and it 's obvious why more and more pilots are converting to gyrocopters and wannabe aerial junkies are taking up this sport . <p> For between R820 000 and R1.2-million a pop you can buy yourself a new Magni , the Rolls-Royce of gyroplanes . To take off you need a national pilot 's licence , which involves theoretical instruction and 30 to 40 hours of flying . The good news is that for R1 000 of unleaded petrol you can travel 400km to 500km . <p> The Magni M22 Voyager has side compartments for luggage . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land like a parachutist -- in pilot talk , a zero forward roll landing . Which means that technically you can land almost anywhere -- legally you need permission . Insurance wo n't pay if you pop into a wine estate for the afternoon and crash during take-off or landing . Which is unlikely , because another great advantage gyros have over other aircraft is their inability to stall , or put more bluntly , fall out of the sky . <p> In the unlikely event of an engine problem , the auto-rotating rotor blades become your parachute . Pilot Jean Tresfon says the machine will " float to the ground like a sycamore seed " . A helicopter will take a lot more effort to get on the ground safely . Gyros can do 90 percent of what helicopters can do , have fewer moving parts ( a good thing ) , and are easier on the pocket . <p> So what 's it like to fly ? Tucked into the open Magni M16 tandem-trainer gyrocopter , helmeted and goggled , one feels like the hero in the novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in order to experience actually flying ) you are the rear gunner , so to speak . Initially alarmingly , the joystick between your knees moves around as if some airborne poltergeist is at work , but the distraction is soon forgotten . A " Romeo Delta Lima , rolling 02 ... " later and it 's a short take-off before the sky is the playground . <p> Once at altitude an unexpected and rather welcome temperature inversion ensured that despite it being a winters ' day , it was pleasantly warm during the two-hour flight . There can be few more magnificent routes than round the Cape Peninsula in a car . From the air it is superlative . The Atlantic coast 's magnificent mansions shrink to insignificance and you are smoothly at one with the mountain , sea and sky . <p> Thanks to their permanently auto-rotating blades , gyrocopters are legendary in handling turbulence -- the rotor acting like a massive gyroscope . You do n't get tossed about . <p> Proof is in the pudding and when we flew over Constantiaberg and practically high-fived a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the turbulence on the lee side of the mountain did make our Little Nellie have a bit of a wobble . It produced a combination of delightful adrenaline and stomach-stopping fear . <p> At a cruising speed of 110-155km/h and a maximum of 200km/h the gyro can be a leisurely aerial meander . From Blouberg to Stellenbosch we had a close look at the surfers in huge swell at Outer Kom , hovered above a mother southern right whale and her calf in False Bay , and executed a missile-like touch landing in a fantasy of yellow canolas in Stellenbosch . <p> A short stint at the controls was surprisingly simple -- move the joystick left or right ( and back a little as it dips if you turn ) and it 's that simple . Playing with the controls like an excited child meant the gyro swayed back to the airport like an intoxicated pedestrian , but Tresfon had it all under control and took over for the effortless landing at the airfield . <p> After tenderly wiping down the gyro , Tresfon posts on Facebook : " Awesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scarborough , then over Red Hill to Simon 's Town , followed the False Bay coastline all the way to the Strand before finally returning home via Durbanville . Massive swells along the Atlantic seaboard , Dungeons and Sunset firing , also huge at Outer Kom . Crayfish factory with giant sets rolling -- with David Lehr and Kathy Malherbe. "

@@2425240 <h> Related News <p> Whenever someone mentions the word Free-to-play , or F2P for short , it usually sends a cold shiver down my spine . The F2P market is filled with atrocious pay-to-win and wait-to-play models that honestly make me wonder how these abominations thrive in the gaming eco system . While conceptually sound , most companies use this model to bleed gamers dry by tapping into that part of the brain that convinces us to buy ' just one more ' premium item . <p> We 're forced to wait a certain amount of time for our lives to regenerate if we failed to complete a level . If we want simple items in a game , we have to dish out real money to buy them . Hell , I 've even played RPGs where the most basic of healing items cost a dollar or 10 rand ( The price of a loaf of bread in South Africa ) . So when I go into a F2P game , you will have to forgive me if I 'm a bit apprehensive . Destiny of Spirits is Sony 's first expedition on the Vita into the world of F2P . Does this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but bug bites and rashes or does it hold some ancient treasure that 's just waiting to be discovered ? Let 's find out . <p> You take on the role of a Spirit Master , one who has the power to controls spirits . There exists a dimension parallel to ours where these spirits reside . As always us destructive humans are unknowingly causing disruption and chaos . You see , all our negativity , jealousy and just generally all our bad habits and emotions are being channelled into this dimension which are corrupting the once pure resident spirits . So next time you decide to get angry at a waiter for bringing your caf ? mocha latte five minutes late , just remember that you 're destroying the homes of innocent spirits . It is then up to you , with the help of pure spirits to bring order back to their world . There is nothing deep about the story really ; it serves as nothing more than a gateway into the game 's mechanics . <p> This is a creature collection type of game in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pok ? mon . You summon spirits to fight for you in battle with each spirit belonging to a particular element . Each element has strengths and weakness with regards to the next . For example , if a spirit that belongs to the element of water attacks another belonging to the element of fire , the attacking spirit will do more damage in battle . So it then becomes important to have a very well balanced party consisting of the different elemental types . Spirits can also then be fused together to level up and become stronger . <p> You can take up to 6 spirits into battle but only three will be present on the battlefield with the others are in reserve in the event that a spirit is defeated . Being a social game you can also rent spirits from other players from across the globe to aid you in battle . Battles are turn-based with an ATB bar of sorts present . For those that do n't know what an ATB bar is , it was a mechanic introduced in Final fantasy 4 ( The actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a character can only attack once a bar is filled up . There is no real input from the player as your spirits attack on their own , you can , however , choose who they attack . The only time there is any real input is when you want to activate a skill . <p> Each spirit has 2 types of skills . One is passive skills that are only activated if that spirit is chosen as the party leader , and it usually adds some sort of buff to your team such as increased speed or attack power . The other type of skills is used in battle . There is a another bar that is constantly filling up , and when it reaches a certain point you may activate one of your party member 's skills , ranging from attack to support . Battles are fun , if not a bit monotonous after long sessions . <p> There are three main types of currency in this game . Spirit Points which are gained primarily after battle and is used to rent spirits or when you fuse them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are used when you summon new spirits to your party . The summoning process is a bit unique though . There are three different versions of this game depending on where you reside in the world . It 's split up into Asia , Europe and America with each region having its own set of unique spirits . You can summon these spirits if you travel to that region ( in real life ) , but that is obviously not plausible , have you ever heard anyone saying they 're just going to take a late afternoon stroll to Asia ? This is where the game tries to be social by allowing you to rent spirits from other players or by gifting each other . It 's a neat lil mechanic that gives reason to be social with gamers from all over the world . <p> The last form of currency is obviously the game 's premium item which is called Destiny Orbs and they 're used to summon advanced spirits , instantly heal dead spirits etc . These items can be purchased on PSN and I 've seen packages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hefty amount of Orbs . So you can play the entirety of the game without ever being forced to use real money if you have a little bit of patience . These items are also given on some days as you receive login bonuses for checking in each day . <p> While I ca n't criticize the game for having mechanics that will give you the urge to buy these items as it is an F2P game after all , but I have to commend them for not pushing it too far . I 've played games before where if you die in the later stages of the game , your wait-gate which started out as 5 minutes per death ended up being 8 hours before the next live is given . While these inherent inner-workings of F2P games are annoying , Destiny of Spirits never felt obnoxious , and I could still enjoy the game without spending a single dime . <p> There are a few features which I did n't cover too comprehensively such as how you get into battle , different types of battles and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this game is worthy of your time , in short bursts . <h> In this article <h> Join the Conversation <p> Rince <p> I swear Umar would n't give an RPG lower than good even if A Chocobo kicked him between the legs *Gets on said Chocobo and flees* <p> Umar 's Sin <p> Roflol ....

@@2472231 <p> A broad package of solutions will probably be needed to boost the country 's power utility , according to Eskom 's senior general manager , Caroline Henry . <p> She said talks with the government about a long-term , sustainable solution to shore up Eskom 's balance sheet were wide ranging and not limited to a cash injection . <p> Henry was speaking after Eskom 's financial director Tsholofelo Molefe was quoted last week in Business Day as saying the embattled company needed a R50-billion crutch from the government to stave off cash flow difficulties . <p> She was adamant that Eskom 's cash flow is stable , which is in line with a media statement issued by Eskom last week saying it has sufficient liquid assets to meet its needs . <p> Henry said that " recapitalising Eskom in some manner or form " is at issue . <p> She said the government could allow Eskom to pursue other avenues that would " give us equity on the balance sheet " , such as bringing partners into the business or allowing the company to issue preference shares . <p> Sale of a portionPrivate-sector commentators have previously called for the sale of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shareholders , other than the government , to refinance the company or introduce greater operational efficiency . <p> The national treasury did not appear to rule out this option this week , saying : " The proceeds from the sale of a portion of Eskom 's existing assets would generate proceeds that could be retained by the company to strengthen its balance sheet . Strategic partners in specific projects could also bring technical expertise to enhance the operation and management of these assets . " <p> But treasury reiterated " government has no scope to give Eskom cash " because of its expenditure ceiling . The National Energy Regulator of South Africa 's ( Nersa ) tariff decision of 8% last year left Eskom with a R225-billion funding gap over the five-year multiyear price determination ( MYPD ) period . <p> This is compounded by a R40-billion gap from disappointing electricity sales and the running of expensive peaking power plants to keep the lights on . Eskom said in its interim results that the costs to run these plants increased by 231% . <p> Anton Eberhard , a professor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said that at the heart of Eskom 's woes is its new-build programme . <p> " Nersa 's tariff cut certainly took Eskom out of its comfort zone . If Eskom was not in the middle of a large capital expenditure and debt-servicing phase , it could probably have managed the next few years , " he said . <p> " But now its balance sheet is stressed and Medupi is hugely over-budget and more than three years late . Interest during construction is escalating and Medupi is not yet earning revenue . " <p> Other issuesHe said there are other issues such as the deteriorating performance of Eskom 's existing coal fleet , its inability to supply new demand and generate revenue , and its reliance on expensive peaking plants because it had not built enough new generation capacity in time . <p> Eberhard is against the state borrowing more to aid Eskom , saying the state has more pressing needs and its own fiscal and debt stresses . <p> " Eskom should be able to finance its needs through tariffs plus debt , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearing account ( RCA ) to deal with unexpected but prudent expenditure , this will not be enough , he said . The RCA allows for the recovery of funds prudently incurred during an MYPD period . <p> He said : " In the end consumers will pay because they do n't have a choice of alternative suppliers . If there was competition in electricity supply and there were more private generators , then private investors would bear the cost of overruns , not consumers . " <p> Eskom denied that it is looking to reopen the most recent tariff application to request an increase . <p> Current cost overruns on its peaking plant would be recovered through the MYPD3 RCA process , it said . <p> BorrowedEskom has borrowed only R122-billion against the government 's R350-billion in guarantees . <p> Potentially increasing these guarantees has been touted as a way to further support Eskom . <p> But , Henry said , although useful , the guarantees have to be treated as a safety net , because they have an impact on cash flow when these loans eventually have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to manage the shortfall in its revenues , including through internal efficiencies , deferrals and a cessation of activities , but this will not reduce its commitments to the new-build programme , Henry said . <p> Eskom said the current focus is on improving its balance sheet to ensure that it maintains an investment-grade credit rating . <p> Adrian Saville , the chief investment officer of Cannon Asset Managers , said the government has the space to assist Eskom.

@@2472236 <p> On one level , the exquisitely crafted Arctic Summer is the story of how EM Forster came to write A Passage to India .

" He has been to public school in England ... He thinks he 's one of us , but of course he never will be . " <p> This " casual vileness " , upsetting to Forster , echoes Ronny Heaslop 's assessment of Aziz in A Passage to India : " Aziz was exquisitely dressed , from tiepin to spats , but he had forgotten his back collar-stud , and there you have the Indian all over .

Cavafy , portrayed as a fussy , erratic egoist , reads his poems to Forster . " In each of them , a visit was paid to the ancient world , either through history or mythology . And in each of them the lost past was reclaimed , brought back -- through an image or a sentiment or a longing -- to the present .

In Galgut 's narrative of how the narrative of A Passage to India came into being , Forster 's emotions are rendered exactly the same ( or at least that is the fiction ) -- but they mean something very different to a 21st-century reader . <p> Here , of course , the telling of the gradual evolution of Forster 's homosexuality reminds us both of how far we have come and , regrettably , of how little things have changed . Galgut conveys beautifully the trauma and tedium of being a homosexual , or " a minorite " to use Forster 's terminology , in early 20th-century English culture . <p> Arctic Summer ( the title comes from the novel Forster began in 1909 but never finished ) is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , and it cleverly muses on that at the same time as acting it out on a sometimes parallel track .

They wanted to give my sister and I a new beginning . They did n't know where they would end up , but they knew they needed to leave . <p> My mother was born in Omsk , the frozen Siberian city where Fyodor Dostoyevsky spent several miserable years . My father grew up in an industrial town on the outskirts of Moscow , living in a glorified commune where families shared a small kitchen and toilets . They met while studying in the capital , where they sculpted their careers and started our family . <p> Despite the suffocating grip of communism - a political and social experiment which brought untold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds wide open . They took us to art galleries and forced us to sit through ballets , introduced us to authors and musicians who were banned by the government and taught us , in their own way , to see through state propaganda and brainless nationalism . They taught us not be hypnotised by a flag . <p> When the iron walls around the Soviet Union fell , my parents packed our bags . They took a massive gamble , denouncing their citizenship and heading for unknown lands . When they looked out of the window of the airplane as it descended over Johannesburg , they were seeing South Africa for the very first time . They had no relatives or friends here , no jobs and could barely speak English . They were adventurers on their grandest and most terrifying adventure . <p> My parents sacrificed a great deal . They survived a grueling immigration . They clawed their way up from a tiny flat on the 18th floor of a Hillbrow high riser to a middle-class life on the West Rand . One of the prizes they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about our lives . <p> My sister became an amazing artist , living mostly off the grid and getting stuck into various forms of activism . She covered her skin in tattoos , dyed her hair an electric red and found new ways to express herself . She never joined a punk band , but I 'm pretty sure that had she still been living in Russia , she would face a very real danger of being harassed for some of her work and opinions , along with the kind of information she disseminates . Here , in South Africa , she is free to explore her creativity and consciousness , from illustrating anarchist newspapers to feeding the poor in her local park . <p> A few years behind her , I finished my schooling in Johannesburg , oblivious to the violence which engulfed the country in the early 1990s . I was too young to be politically awake , and was far too preoccupied by carving my name into school desks or hanging out at the local shopping mall . Later , I stumbled into journalism , which proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents had passed on the adventure gene to me so media was a natural fit . I also had a lifelong passion for writing and a growing love of literature . In journalism , I found a way to blend all of these life components into a paying day job . Luckily , I had also managed to escape the brutal Russian army . <p> Because of the immigration , I found myself in a privileged position as a reporter . Since my parents had to give up their Russian citizenships , I was completely invested in South Africa . It is my home . My ID book shows my nationality as South African . But I was also removed from the past , having arrived in 1991 , as the Apartheid monster bled out . <p> I learned about the country 's painful history both through literature and through my work . My assignments took me to Alexandra , Diepsloot , Zandspruit , Kya Sands and Soweto . I also worked in Sandton , Hyde Park and Sandhurst . <p> I would interview the first African in space the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reporting on how a 76-year-old man ( mistaken for a foreigner ) was dragged out of his room and beaten to death with steel pipes during the xenophobic mayhem of 2008 . I covered elections , trials , protests , disasters and corruption scandals . I investigated senior politicians and was called a " troublemaker " . <p> Being a journalist in South Africa proved to be like riding a fierce rollercoaster which never stops . It rockets you to great heights , showing you the beauty of a country which delivered the closest to a miracle an atheist like me will ever experience ... and then plummets you to the depth of despair . <p> I will never forget the feeling of watching how the Marikana miners were mowed down . I will always remember how angry I got when blind busker Goodman Nono was beaten and dragged away by the police . I recall the frustration of watching my lights go out when Eskom was forced to load shed the nation . And most recently , I can still feel the fury swirling in my chest when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain away how a quarter of a billion rand was spent on his private " township " . ( Do any of us actually comprehend how much R250-million is for a single individual ? ) <p> The feeling of riding a rollercoaster comes from a deep love for this land . It 's like a fiery romance where emotions are amplified . I remember how , coming off a long shift during which we broke news of Nelson Mandela 's death , I wept in my car and could n't fight the tears at a Spar supermarket , which had placed a small photograph of Madiba at the front door . Mandela was , and remains , a symbol of this country 's magnificence . <p> As I continued to report on South Africa , I also began laying down roots .

Some of the things I witnessed will haunt me forever , others will inspire me for the rest of my life . <p> For all these reasons - from everything I have experienced and reported on - seeing even the slightest wound , to South Africa 's democracy , is a painful , personal and emotional experience . Unfortunately , despite the amazing gains of the past twenty years , I have had to watch many new wounds being inflicted by Zuma and his administration . <p> I keep thinking about the sacrifices my parents made to bring me to a country where the media is remarkably free , at least for now . In Russia , journalists like Anna Politkovskaya are assassinated for challenging the state . Others are hurled in prison . There is widespread censorship and the propaganda - around Ukraine , for example - infests even educated minds .

Our democracy is far from perfect , but it exists , protected by the most wonderful Constitution in the world . <p> The wind that blows now is not of change , at least not this time around , but of poor governance , corruption , a lack of accountability and ever-increasing state secrecy .

@@2477232 <h> Riding the data wave -- and staying afloat in a sea of info <p> It is a given that the evolution of the grand enabler -- telecommunications -- from the first round-the-world telephone conversation in 1935 to an era less than 100 years later in which we receive e-mail , internet , TV and radio on myriad different devices , has applied major pressure on marketers . <p> Importantly , it shattered the communication model first mooted in 1949 and which underpinned the marketing industry 's behaviour for decades . <p> In terms of this model , the flow of communication was linear , from marketer to channel to consumer . That is , a marketer , the originator , created and transmitted a message through a channel that decoded it for the consumer , the target . <p> Today , computer-mediated communication dominates , and we -- marketers and consumers -- are deeply enmeshed in it , not on either end of it . And consumers are no longer targets . The networked world means that all connected individuals are potentially exposed to the marketer 's message . This is passed on , spread quickly and modified ; consumers have become participants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to come to terms with how this has changed the way they interact with consumers , few have realised that the ever increasing channels and information sources will change , has changed , the way marketers gather data and conduct research . <p> Data is proliferating at a rate that would shock even Alvin Toffler -- visionary author of Future Shock . This is more than just oodles and googlepexes of data , but massively complex , interconnected , continuously modified and viral streams , growing exponentially . <p> In my opinion , tomorrow 's marketers must rely on this data to inform their decision-making , and not just the feedback they receive from customers through the connected social media space . <p> That 's a seemingly controversial opinion . Effectively , I 'm saying marketers should downgrade the current attention given to Facebook posts , LinkedIn discussion groups , Twitter feeds and so on . <p> How can I justify that ? The answer is just one word -- ' representativeness ' . <p> Granted , while feedback may provide some accurate data , it can not be extrapolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-selection bias and is controlled by the consumer . In other words , the customer that chooses to contribute and offer feedback may not be representative of all your customers . Typically customers that feel strongly positive or negative are the ones that choose to participate . This has a role to play , and we must engage on these platforms , but not take major decisions based on this content . <p> The only viable alternative is research , because research gives the market researcher control of the sample . And , in the ideal world , the application of intelligence leads us to insight and strategy . <p> From research to intelligence <p> We can define intelligence as the routine of collection , collation , interpretation and dissemination of information . <p> When it comes to collection , there 's a vast array of tools that continue to spring up to amass data , both quantitative and qualitative . Think of updated eye-tracking , neuroscience brain monitors , rich behavioural data for mining , social network site mining , pop-up and interactive surveys , proprietary online panels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new projective techniques , GPS tagging , video surveillance and network analysis , to name a few . In fact , Dashboard has developed its own proprietary platform called ATI ( Automatic Telephonic Interviewing ) . <p> The potential trap is to harvest data that has little value . Focus ( on the problem , issue or data needs ) and selection of the most appropriate way to collect the data , taking channel independence and privacy into account , are key . Often clients are sold data collection solutions that are sexy , but are not designed to do the job at hand . The insight value lies in collecting accurate , cost effective and timeous data , regardless of which collection tools are used . <p> Interpreting the data <p> Wherever and however we get our data , we need to collate and aggregate it , or pull it together before we can make any sense of it , and unlocking trend insight depends on how well this data is organised . For example , we wish to combine our customer satisfaction measures from web-based interactions , call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fortunately many great tools ( software and web-sites ) exist including digital curation utilising metadata . <p> It is also important to critically evaluate the data before interpreting it . Consider these questions : <p> * Source credibility -- can it be trusted ? <p> * Purpose -- what was the original data intended for ? Is there a hidden agenda ? Are there biases ? <p> * Completeness -- can it address your issue entirely , or adequately ? <p> * Time assessment -- when was it collected and is it still current ? <p> * Definitions -- have these changed over time or do they fit your need ? <p> * Corroboration -- does it agree with other known data ? <p> Interpretation of data is and will remain the key human aspect of the intelligence chain . A close relationship with the suppliers of the data enhances this function , from design through to output . <p> Computer-mediated communication has , fortunately , provided us with additional means to shortcut our way to analysis using a technique called collaborative filtering . Also known as semantical ergonomics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past will tend to agree in the future and taps into a network of agents ( or people with similar interests or on-line groups ) . <p> Once data has been collected , collated and analysed , disseminating or sharing the findings and insights is key . It must be timeous , succinct and relevant ... and has also been helped tremendously by the wave of new tools that continue to pop-up and be developed . <p> In conclusion , combining intelligence and systems provides marketers with the insights they need to be successful in today 's computer-mediated communication world . <p> However , this can only be achieved by harnessing the power of technology . Being channel independent is the Holy Grail , but there should be a clear strategy for each channel for collection and dissemination .

In this article , I briefly address the knowledge economy , the emphasis placed on the science , technology , engineering and mathematics ( Stem ) disciplines as opposed to the liberal arts and human sciences , and the question of the missing " fourth helix " , comprising the socioeconomic and cultural dimensions of academic transformation . <p> In the South African context , the views of Manuel Castells on the knowledge-based economy and the information society have been especially influential . <p> Mutually reinforcingIn brief , developments in capitalism have brought about a symbiotic , mutually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciplines , and transnational corporations that are heavily dependent on the knowledge produced in the relevant research centres .

Such critique as has been forthcoming is usually formulated in antimanagerialist terms and is relevant and useful , but it does not penetrate beneath the surface phenomena . It does not question the paradigm within which the university third mission is restricted to the UIG triple helix . <p> From the point of view of someone who is committed to a different kind of world , one where the abysmal gap between the rich and the poor is eliminated , the crucial questions involved in this matter are twofold . <p> First , is it morally and politically defensible to use public revenues , dispensed through government and universities , to maximise profits for corporate entities that appropriate such profits for their shareholders ? Cooper has argued that the usually implicit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of apologists for the " market university " has no evidence to back it up . In the face of the global reality that more than two-thirds of humanity are excluded from these circuits , this is culpable naivety at best and intellectual dishonesty at worst . <p> Second , the general assumption is that the university 's third mission is exhausted in the construction and maintenance of partnerships with business and government . To the extent that government is supposed to be representative of " the people " , it could be argued that civil society is indirectly included in the triple helix . However , this fiction is difficult to sustain in an age of scepticism about the democratic integrity of ? governments across the globe . <p> Fourth helixCooper has strongly proposed that a " fourth helix " , representing the socioeconomic and cultural aspects , be added to the UIG linkage .

@@2496230 <p> Cape Town - Social media played a diminished role in the national elections , despite the presence of major political parties on online platforms , a social media strategist has said . <p> " Party leaders have higher numbers of followers than the parties themselves - but then South African politics is very personality driven , " social media consultant for Afrosocialmedia Samantha Fleming told News24 . <p> The African National Congress , Democratic Alliance and Economic Freedom Fighters all invested effort into their Facebook and Twitter campaigns during the election cycle , but Fleming said that engagement levels on policy was low . <p> " There was n't much deep debate on social media about party policies , or how voters could compare one party 's policies over another . " <p> Results show an overwhelming majority win for the ANC , and Fleming hailed the rise of smaller parties ' voices in the public space . <p> " The growth in opposition and smaller parties indicates a growing and colourful electorate - and most importantly a vibrant democracy , where diversity and debate is tolerated .

The ANC is not a party that plays out its internal politics in the media . <p> " Discussion happens behind closed doors , and negative publicity about the leader will not sway many loyal voters who believe the party has brought about freedom and democracy , " Fleming cautioned . <p> She said that the rise of the EFF was largely attributable to unhappiness with basic service delivery . <p> " What is more relevant in swaying votes , I think , is disillusionment because of lack of service delivery , hence the dizzying growth of the EFF in a matter of months .

However , for me to say anything more than that would be guessing , " said Visser . <p> Gian Visser -- Afrihost CEO <h> What people can expect from Afrihost in future <p> Visser said that consumers can look forward to many exciting developments from the company . <p> " One of the biggest barriers preventing people from making use of Afrihost Mobile data -- if they are not MTN contract clients who can easily use the Afrihost APN -- is that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SIM , " said Visser . <p> " We are hoping to do something that 'll help get Afrihost mobile data into more people 's hands .

The exclusive 20-inch Carrera-S alloys can be ordered in black too . Inside , buyers can expect most surfaces finished in alcantara and GTS branding on the headrests , dials and door sills . A cool option here is the trim strips in darkened aluminium . <p> REAL VALUE <p> Visual clues aside , all the go-faster under-the-skin boxes have been ticked for Boxster and Cayman GTS buyers , and this is where the real value starts becoming evident . <p> Based on the S versions of the respective ranges , the same naturally-breathing 3.4-litre can be found ahead of the rear axle , but in either guise this flat six is now 11kW and 10Nm stronger . <p> This means that the Boxster GTS makes 243kW/370Nm and the Cayman GTS 250kW/380Nm . The additional power is attributed to software tweaking , with Porsche claiming slightly quicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4.6 for the Cayman ) , higher top-ends ( Boxster at 281km/h and Cayman at 285km/h ) , and a few seconds shaved off Nurburgring lap times . <p> Other little standard driver delights include the Sport Chrono Package which adds launch control and angrier driver modes ( and an analogue stopwatch on the dash ) ; while Porsche Active Suspension Management ( PASM ) throws in a 10mm lower ride height and varied stiffness and damping configurations to match those spicier driver modes . Hardcore buyers may still want Porsche 's Torque Vectoring System , which acts as an electronic rear limited slip-diff -- but this is an option here . <p> HEAVY METAL SOUNDTRACK <p> And what would a bad-ass GTS be without a heavy metal soundtrack ? Yup , a sports exhaust ( with wicked downshift throttle blips ) is standard , and has been tweaked for even greater feline-scaring ability here . As usual , the exhaust can be primed with a dedicated button on the centre console or automatically when the Sport Plus driver mode is selected . <p> It 's hard to believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it does , and quite a tricky one at that . It has more curves than Kate Upton , and just one longish piece that could hardly be classified as a straight . The Cayman GTS was the weapon handed over here , and where I thought that the Cayman S was pretty much sorted in the handling stakes , the GTS is just that little bit harder and sharper . <p> In terms of straight-line speed , you 'd have to drive S and GTS cars back to back to feel a difference . <p> But what did become apparent in driving both Boxster and Cayman GTS versions on public roads over two days , was just how much more torsionally rigid and more of a driver 's tool the Cayman is . The engineers reckon the Cayman is 2.5 times more rigid than the Boxster , and it shows . <p> The tweaked exhaust in the GTS derivatives is also way louder than I remember in the S versions , and I wonder whether some would prefer it over longer runs with the flaps closed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Boxster GTS and R998 000 for the Cayman GTS you 're spending R113k and R128k more respectively , versus their S nameplate counterparts . <p> If you look at the power gain and all the additional spec , the new range-topper becomes quite an attractive choice in either body guise . - Star Motoring

In 2010 , HJOC was awarded an extensive of the contract for a further five years . <p> Fire Lake Iron Ore Mine has been responsible for producing between ten and 15 percent of the iron ore concentrate that ArcelorMittal produces in Canada . As a satellite mine connected to Mont Wright , transportation of this iron ore concentrate to the processing plant is of critical importance . There is only one train track between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there is a continuous flow of ore from one to the other . Since it began operating the mine in 2006 , the company has not had a single train arrive at Mont Wright without ore , all the while lowering its loading times . Needless to say therefore that ArcelorMittal has always been very pleased with how the project has progressed . <p> At Mont Wright itself HJOC is responsible for overburden stripping at the mine , a project that has been ongoing since 1989 , with the exception of 1992 and 1993 . The productive equipment fleet at the Mont Wright stripping project includes up to 20 off-highway trucks in the 50 and 100-tonne sizes , matched with excavators in the eight and 14 cubic yard range . Since the overburden stripping project began , the strategy adopted by HJOC has resulted in " on time , on budget " performance which has resulted in a win-win scenario for all parties . <p> A further overburden stripping project of note can also be found occurring in Labrador City , Newfoundland and Labrador , of behalf of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range from 1.0 to 4.0 million tonnes of overburden material , with the production equipment fleet used for this work including off-highway Cat 777 trucks , Komatsu PC 2000 excavator , Hitachi 1200 excavator , Cat D8 bulldozers and Cat 16 H graders . <p> One other area of the company 's work that is of particular importance is its Tailings Confinement Programme . This project began in 1981 and has been continuous since 1985 . It has seen HJOC take responsibility for the construction of dams , dykes and canals on behalf of ArcelorMittal , which are used to confine the red water and mine tailings within a closed loop basin . This has been a hugely successful and important area of work for HJOC and one that continues to evolve as the volume of tailings storage requires increasing . <p> In addition to its work in the mining sector , and its countless other successes in various industries , HJOC is rapidly becoming the " go to " company when it comes to Canada 's hydroelectric development projects . At the heart of this is a well-trained team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the construction of powerhouses and dams . <p> The most recent hydroelectric project that HJOC has completed work on is the Lower Churchill Project taking place in Labrador . This particular project is aimed at developing the remaining 35 per cent of the Churchill River that has not already been developed by the Churchill Falls Generating Station . Its two installations at Gull Island and Muskrat Falls will ultimately boast a combined capacity of more than 3,074MW and have the ability to provide 16.7TWh of electricity per year . HJOC 's portion of the civil works , which included drill/blast , excavation and the construction of roller compacted concrete ( RCC ) dykes was completed in 2013 . <p> Another example of the company 's work on such major projects would be its efforts on the Wuskwatim Generation Project . A result of close to a decade of planning , studies , negotiations and environmental assessments , the Wuskwatim Generation Project is a 200MW run-of-river hydroelectric generating station being developed on the Burntwood River at Taskinigup Falls , located in the Nelson House Resource Management Area . This type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to traditional hydroelectric dams , with the Wuskwatim Project set to cause less than one-half of one square kilometre of flooding once operational , the least amount of flooding of any hydro project in the entire Province . <p> Safety is the core value of HJOC . Through a cooperative attitude and empowering all workers to be proactive safety leaders , the vision of an accident-free workplace is seen as a realistic and obtainable goal . H.J. O'Connell Ltd. ' s Environment , Safety and Health - Loss Control Program meets , and often exceeds , the demanding standards and requirements enacted by legislation and/or established by industry and project owners . <p> Given the nature of the work carried out by the company , the concept of sustainability comes high upon the list of values that HJOC holds dear . With every project it undertakes , HJOC enters into its work with the vision of leaving a site or location in the best condition possible . This is the approach it takes right from the onset of the planning stages of a job and its desire to leave an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise to numerous environmental and health and safety initiatives and programmes over the years . <p> Looking towards the future , HJOC 's first task will be to ensure that with its existing portfolio of projects continue to improve when it comes to the level of high standards that HJOC adheres to , while at the same time the company will look to improve further upon the quality of its work and seek out further efficiencies across the business . Meanwhile , HJPOC continues to aggressively pursue several other projects throughout Canada , projects that it hopes will contribute to the growth of the business in the latter stages of 2014 and beyond . <h> Content you might like <p> A leading supplier to Canada 's resource industries for more than eight decades , H.

But Chimedza denied this . <p> " It is not true to say that nurses are made to fetch water from boreholes at the hospital . In the extremely rare instances where water has to be ferried from boreholes , this is the responsibility of nurse aides and not of professional staff , " he said . <p> Chimedza also said only one case of cholera had been reported since the beginning of the year , although typhoid cases peaked around week 12 , 13 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , that the dangers of not having adequate water at the hospital are obvious as infection control becomes poor . <p> " There may be a spread of diseases from patient to patient so water is critical in the operation of any hospital .

@@2520237 <h> Listen to the early adopters : 3 tried and tested Lean Startup principles to follow <p> The day I picked up Eric Reis ' The Lean Startup I could n't put it down . If you 're a startup or just looking to move into the startup world and you have n't read it , do yourself a favour and grab a copy of The Lean Startup today . <p> I 've gained a fair mount of knowledge over the years from starting , building , failing and succeeding in a number of businesses . However , if I had read this book when I started my first venture over 12 years ago , I would have definitely succeeded in some of my earlier failures . <p> The Lean Start up is a movement with the core goal of getting your product to market as fast , low cost and direct as possible . The key focus is to get your MVP ( Minimum Viable Product ) into the hands of the early adopters . <p> Here are three principals I follow using the Lean Startup methodology : <p> 1 . Get to market early and with minimal waste <p> Sounds easy right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market that is nowhere near to your vision ? Well the answer is simple -- you never really know when it is finished until your customers are buying . <p> With Magnetic , we went to market with a product that later evolved to what it is today . But we still follow the principal reason as to why we created it -- to simplify processes and make businesses more efficient . <p> We did n't need all the bells and whistles to find out if our market wanted a system like it , we just needed something that would make them want more . Once we knew we had interest from bug companies , we knew we were onto something . Knowing this allowed us to further develop the product further . <p> Take out : " The biggest challenge you will face is knowing when to stop developing your product and just launch . " <p> 2 . Learn from your early adopters : <p> Why is this important ? What you can learn from early adopters in the first couple of days of them using your product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surveys combined . I follow a simple rule here -- you do n't get what you do n't ask for . <p> When we started we initially sent clients a mail telling them all about our product and the features . We thought this was a great idea . <p> " Let 's jam as much information into a single email just because they 've signed up for our product . " <p> Wrong . <p> The response we got from these emails was non-existent . But it was n't just the fact that we did n't get a response , the main issue was that we did n't even know what response we wanted as we were n't asking any questions . <p> How did we fix this ? With a simple email , asking our clients why they signed up , no product push ( I got this tip from Alex at GrooveHQ -- Genius ) , and the results were phenomenal . Our response rate went from less than 10% to a massive 83% . <p> Here is the exact email we send out : <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopters to find out what their likes and dislikes were and focused on giving them more of what they loved and corrected what they did n't want . This allowed us to develop our product based on what our active users wanted , thus when new clients signed up from similar industries to those we worked with ; the on-boarding is streamlined and simple . <p> 3 . Do n't Pivot Too Late <p> " Pivots are a permanent fact of life for any growing business . Even after a company achieves initial success , it must continue to pivot . Decision on when and how to pivot can not be made formulaically . It requires human judgement " -- Lean Startup , What is Pivot . <p> Knowing when to pivot is crucial . In an early stage startup , you may find yourself feeling stumped , wondering why your core market is n't responding the way you had hoped . This does not mean it 's time for panic stations -- in previous situations where we had to pivot , this was exciting . An opportunity to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly , towards a more refined product based on what our clients actually wanted and not what we thought they wanted . <p> Our first pivot actually came from a client request . Our initial idea has n't changed , we always wanted to be an all purpose business management solution , but in our minds this was CRM , Project Management and Accounts . We had no intention of spreading our wings further than that , until a client asked if we could include leave management for employees . Initially we shut this down very quickly due to the development load we had . <p> Then we had a proposition , the client enjoyed our product so much , so they offered to share the costs of a developer to have the module developed . So we asked a few of our clients if they also wanted an HR Module and the answer was a big YES . <p> ? So we did it , we made a small pivot in our product offering that has brought us a whole new base of customers . <p> This article was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author 's consent .

@@2536239 <p> Does the new Subaru WRX have what it takes to better the flaky image of its predecessor ? <p> What is it ? <p> The fourth-generation Subaru WRX has arrived to right its predecessor 's wrongs -- that weird hatchback abortion that was quickly panel beaten back into the shape of a sedan a year or so after it was launched . Yep , even the most hardcore Subaru faithful will admit that this was n't Fuji Heavy Industry 's finest hour . Fortunately Subaru got its head together , returned to past form and produced a damn fine replacement . Hewn out of stiffer steel and loaded with more technology than ever before , I am pleased to say that the new fresh-faced WRX is a much better car on every level . Its base price remains unchanged too -- quite an achievement . <p> How does it look ? <p> Better than the last one , that 's for damn sure . Stealing design cues from German saloons like the BMW 3 Series , the latest WRX is considerably more grown-up when compared to any of its lairy predecessors . Although it reaches a new level of stylistic refinement -- it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Scooby still manages to make a semi-bold statement thanks to that large intercooler bonnet scoop and menacing new front apron cut with lots of trapezoidal cooling ducts and grilles . Humdrum Japanese generic in profile , the rump reignites some excitement what with its chunky taillights ( another BMW E90 dead ringer ) ; compact boot spoiler ; rear air-diffuser and quad exhaust tailpipes . <p> Of course it 's on the inside of the new WRX where you will find the biggest evolutionary up-step . You see the old car felt like it had been constructed from melted down plastic offcuts stolen from a GWM skip . But this one has nice soft-touch surfaces that have been properly screwed together . No longer do you have to live with a flimsy centre console that can be wiggled from side to side with your index finger . <p> Ergonomics are much improved and the list of standard features vast . Nice to haves like leather seats , automatic climate control , cruise control , a rearview camera , Bluetooth connectivity and a six-speaker audio system all form part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a turbo boost gauge to help you live out your Fast and Furious aspirations . <p> What 's it like to drive ? <p> The first thing you 'll notice about the new WRX is a delightful lack of turbo lag -- something that could n't be said about its predecessor . The smaller displacement 2.0 boxer engine bolted beneath its bonnet is now noticeably more linear , displaying very little of that off-boost lethargy that was the perennial bugbear of the outgoing 2.5 motor . <p> Subaru have achieved this hike in overall responsiveness by using twin-scroll turbocharger technology as well as a newly developed direct fuel injection system . Now you might think that a reduction in cubic centimeters would equal a loss of muscle . Fortunately this smaller capacity unit produces a tad more power ( +2kW ) and torque ( +7Nm ) . As such the new WRX is an effortlessly fast car , a machine that piles on speed with a ferocity that could easily match some of the hottest of hot hatchbacks . It 's deceptive too thanks to considerably improved NVH ( Noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than roars . Yeah , I would definitely spec the optional sports pipes . <p> Now because of Subaru SA 's brilliant event organising ( four journalists to one car ) I did n't really get much of a chance to explore this Scooby 's handling dynamics . But from what little time I did enjoy behind the wheel I could definitely feel a difference over the outgoing model . The steering is quicker and the nose feels a lot more eager to turn into a corner . In fact I found it rather Mitsubishi EVO X like , which is a very good thing . There was also noticeably less body roll , a quality that inspires you to gun it harder through corners than you would have before . <p> I was also very impressed by the optional Sport Lineartronic gearbox : a Continuously Variable Transmission ( CVT ) that , when popped into Sport Sharp mode , behaves very much like one of those dual-clutch systems you might find inside an Audi or Volkswagen product . Seriously , put your foot down , call those steering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find much of a difference between the two . Although having said this I would still most definitely pick the standard six-speed manual , simply because it suits the car 's personality better . <p> Any special features ? <p> Picking a WRX equipped with the Lineartronic transmission means that you also score something called Subaru Intelligent Drive ( SI-Drive ) . Similar to Audi Drive Select it gives you three factory-programmed drive modes ( Intelligent , Sport and Sport Sharp ) , each of which has an influence on the car 's engine , gearbox and steering maps . Active Torque Vectoring ( ATV ) debuts on all new WRX models with the aim of enhancing cornering ability by applying mild braking force to the inside front wheel while , at the same time , sending more drive to the opposite wheel . The end result is a car that changes direction with a little bit more verve . <p> Should you buy one ? <p> Being better made , better equipped and considerably better to drive than its underwhelming predecessor , I 've got to say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a strong performer that blends an iconic performance-brand cachet into a spacious and relatively comfortable sedan that you can happily use everyday of the week . <p> Unfortunately it is sparring against some mightily tough competition at the moment in the form of the Volkswagen Golf R and Audi S3 Sedan -- both of which offer much more premium image . If this happens to be important to you then I would recommend shelling out extra for either of the two Germans . If not , pocket the change and enjoy a machine that does that legendary WRX badge some justice . <h> About <p> Thomas Falkiner is the motoring writer for both the Sunday Times and Times newspapers .

@@2544230 <h> Making big bucks but adding clutter to airports <p> Advertising at airports is hugely lucrative but not everyone is happy with the way in which this environment is being managed . <p> Competition to advertise in what has become a lucrative but unregulated advertising environment has resulted in cluttered and noisy airports across South Africa . <p> This is according to Bazil Lauryssen , the chief executive officer of Continental Outdoor , who says that Airports Company South Africa ( Acsa ) has sacrificed the look and feel of its airports for ballooning advertising revenue . <p> " You only need to go to the airport and get bombarded with all these different advertising messages to understand that it 's an environment where it looks like all you want to do is maximise money , as opposed to creating a world-class airport environment , " says Lauryssen . <p> Acsa controls nine airports across the country , the biggest being OR Tambo International . The company makes a substantial amount of money from leasing space in and around its airports to concessionaires such as Provantage Media Group , Continental Outdoor Media , Khombisa Media and Primedia Outdoor , thereby giving these media owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel often and have time to kill while in transit . <p> But Acsa has come under the spotlight , says Lauryssen , for shaping itself as a media owner and buyer , in addition to being a landlord . It started taking control of its ad space and selling advertising directly to brands during the 2010 Fifa World Cup . As such , it bypassed media agency expertise by working directly with tournament sponsors such as MTN and Coca-Cola . <p> " It got out of control and the economics and the perception of value was created , " says Lauryssen . " Little did they know , it was a once-off event , so the advertising revenue obviously peaked , because they cut out the media owner , and they festooned their airport with clutter but made lots of money . " <p> In an interview with The Media in 2010 , Acsa 's Solomon Makgale said the company had no intention of cancelling existing contracts with media companies , but affirmed that it was exploring new ways of optimising revenue . <p> " Acsa will conduct , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be implemented going forward . We will also ensure adequate resources are in place to implement it , " said Makgale . <p> Four years later , little has changed for media owners who want to do business with Acsa . <p> " It 's an environment where , frankly , the landlord has been irresponsible and has allowed too many operators to exploit advertising , with varying types of quality , " says Lauryssen . <p> There is no real incentive for media owners to abide by the integrity of the airports because there are no regulatory structures in place to control which sites can be used for advertising , explains Lauryssen . The problem is compounded by the fact that advertisers increasingly want total branded solutions , which include reaching people in prime airport spaces . <p> " I would take a step back and understand what my ultimate goal is first . Then decide how I 'm going to get to that goal . Is the goal to make money , or is the goal delivering a world-class experience to ( airline ) commuters and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money out of advertising that is done tastefully and with new technologies ? " asks Lauryssen . <p> Acsa has enlisted the help of out of home communications agency Posterscope as consultants as they realign the business model of their advertising division . <p> " Part of the realignment is to look at the needs of advertisers , brand houses , concessionaires and passengers and to merge this with our current platforms , including digital migration and the future use of displays and activations , " says Acsa spokesperson Unathi Batyashe-Fillis . <p> " While our partnership with our current concessionaires has yielded mutual , commercial benefit , it remains in the best interest of advertisers ' businesses that , as a company , we continue to demonstrate value to these brand houses by providing unique media solutions given the evolution of the sector . " <p> Acsa declined to provide further details as to how their strategy is being modified . <p> According to Lauryssen , however , the solution is easy . <p> " The simple thing that you need to do is declutter , maximise certain areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can put any technology you want to upgrade as you go along because technology costs money so you need a decent amount of revenue to be able to invest in it without giving all the economics away to the landlord , " he says . <p> Lauryssen believes that Acsa is unlikely to approve of any solutions that Posterscope comes up with . <p> " The airports are n't going to like what they 're going to hear because they treat us , the media owners , poorly . They 're getting more of the economics than they generally should , they bend over backwards for new entrants and do n't support existing players , " says Lauryssen . <p> Other media owners declined to comment on this story . <p> This story was first published in the May 2014 issue of The Media magazine .

The cheese reference is due to the fact that in the past cheese was expensive therefore only wealthier black people had cheese on a regular basis ) . <p> The term " cheeseboy " is challenging because , like ' clever black ' , it suggests that there 's a fixed definition of being black , that blackness is n't just the shade of one 's skin or state of mind but also the environment a person lives in . <p> It 's what psychiatrist , philosopher and post-colonial thought leader Frantz Fanon refers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In this book , which analyses the mindset of black people in colonial and post-colonial society , Fanon shows us that it can be difficult for black people to find their place in this ' white man 's world ' . <p> On the one hand , the black man/woman has to relate to his/her white counterparts and on the other hand with his/her own race . The subjects find themselves in a dichotomous relationship between white and black . <p> Although Black Skin , White Masks was published in 1952 its contents can still be applied in contemporary society . When you , as a black person , live in the suburbs , are educated and speak English fluently and not so much your mother tongue black people from the township and rural areas will make fun of you and say uzenza umlungu ( you are acting like a white person ) . <p> Conversely , black people who live in the suburbs may call their more rural and township counterparts backwards , tribal or ghetto . For instance , there was a time during our high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of students who came from the rural areas and spoke a ' different ' English to theirs . <p> Another instance would be black people who stop doing certain traditional practices such as slaughtering animals for ancestral rituals because they have converted to Christianity . In some cases , these people are seen as not having pride in their culture , and in essence their blackness . <p> When it comes to integrating into white circles , there is also dissonance that occurs . Often , you have to be the ' other ' kind of black person who is an exception ( i.e suburban , private school ) to fully be accepted into a white friendship circle . <p> Journalist Shandukani Mulaudzi , shared why she dislikes the term : " I do n't like the term Clever Black . I think it suggests that the average black person is unable to apply their mind to matters that require thinking . <p> Generally this would be matters of politics , business or academic discourse . It creates a space where elite blacks see themselves as " different blacks " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not good enough and you should therefore be proud . <p> Terms such as Clever Black , Coconut and Cheeseboy show us that the shaping of ones identity becomes difficult because of preconceived notions and expected behaviour .

@@2547236 drillers <p> 04 June 2014 , 18:00 <p> The love we show the striking miners in Marikana is truly amazing . <p> Take me , for instance . <p> Now the other day I went with colleagues to have something to eat . I had a large , scrumptious English breakfast -- I talk here of mango juice , cereal and fresh fruits preceding what is in fact the nucleus of the famous full English breakfast -- bacon and eggs . This was accompanied by mushroons , grilled tomato , sausages and toast . Well , I had no tea but some strong black coffee instead -- an espresso , to be exact . <p> Yes , it was all nourishing and filling and very nice too , thank you . <p> A few minutes later we were done and headed back to our various work stations . On my short trip there the news junky in me competed and won against the house head -- and so I put the dial on SAFM and found them talking about Marikana . ( I remember the presenter accusing Mr Mathunjwa of living large while the workers went without food for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself but who will speak for the miners ? You ? Me ? No ? Ja . I thought so . Besides , I am not as naive as to imagine that a leader staying in a mansion can not for that reason alone care for the poor and lead the working class . ) <p> And then a heart-rending point hit me . I just had a full and nourishing English breakfast , yet the Lonmin workers and their families have had nothing to eat in months ! <p> Just so we are clear , I support the strike 100% . I believe my support for it is within reason because the miners also deserve a good life , just like mine bosses and European owners who earn hundreds of millions . I in fact think the R12500 per month demand is peanuts for men who risk their lives every second of the day to find platinum as they drill . <p> But overall I support them because I am black -- yes , I am , and I know what going to sleep without food or going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not mean to suggest that just because a group of workers are on strike we should all stop living . <p> The workers of Lonmin in Marikana say they earn as little as R4500 for unearthing billions in wealth for the overseas bosses , the very bosses who lead a life of extreme opulence through the sweat of exploited and underpaid workers . <p> The strike has gone for as long as it has because the obscenely rich capitalists say they ca n't afford the R12500 a month pay demand . The simple meaning of this refusal is that employers do not want blacks to improve their living conditions . A better life for all is alright if it is not for the workers . <p> So when some say the strikers are responsible for the contracting economy , I wonder whose interest that statement seeks to protect because these workers do n't own the economy to start with . I mean , if they do , how come they are being killed , literally , for demanding a decent plate at the end of the day ? <p> As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small complication is I have thus far not demonstrated this in any meaningful terms . <p> The interesting thing is all blacks -- and all whites who claim to be standing with blacks , know that this strike is necessary for the miners to create conditions for a better life , but it seems like we are just watching as others go hungry while fighting for decent pay . <p> This is however not new . You and I stood and watched when the very same miners were massacred for making the same demand only a few months ago . <p> We did not put our tools down in solidarity with them , did we ? <p> We in fact continued , like me , to have our full English breakfast , daily , without any worries whatsoever . <p> The point is we need to decide if the miners are right or wrong to fight for more money . <p> If they are right , then we should actively stand by them . And by that I mean all of us must bring the economy to a standstill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that we feel the miners are right to demand a living wage . <p> Besides , it is not like we are not as exploited and as underpaid as the miners . We are all rock drillers . We are all oppressed by the same enemy . We must all come together to fight this enemy , instead of obsessing like I do with filling English breakfast . <p> Disclaimer : All articles and letters published on MyNews24 have been independently written by members of News24 's community .

All five are capable of being eliminated in the group stage while , by the same token , it would n't be a major surprise for any of the quintet to progress to the knockout stages , with the potential exception of the multi-talented Ghanaian side . <p> While this makes fortune-telling a mug 's game , it is also what makes the prospect of the 2014 World Cup so enticing from an African perspective . It is unlikely that the continent 's sides will deliver a communal showing as dismal as four years ago ( when five of the six were eliminated in the first round ) but they do remain an incredibly volatile bunch . <p> Amazingly , despite being the same five World Cup qualifiers as 2010 , all of Nigeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have endured either non-qualification for a Cup of Nations tournament or a poor performance at the competition in the intervening four years . Despite the presence of talismanic players , some of the most decorated in world football over the same period , any of the quintet are capable of flopping . <p> Similarly , the coaching situation is fascinating . <p> Despite possessing the most talented collections of players , both Ghana and , to a greater extent , the Cote d'Ivoire have arguably been mismanaged over the last few years . Conversely , Algeria and Cameroon , who have the more limited sets of players , have grown to be well organised units latterly under Vahid Halilhodzic and Volker Finke respectively . <p> Stephen Keshi probably stands somewhere between these two stalls . His achievements at the Cup of Nations in 2013 and his tactical manipulation of the Super Eagles starting XI deserves credit , but things are threatening to unravel following his highly questionable personnel decisions for the squad of 23 . The Big Boss 's legacy , disputably more than those of the other men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who I fully expect to escape Group A , I would give Cameroon , Mexico and Croatia all roughly equal chance of progression . <p> Mexico are arguably the weakest of the three , but their record of making the Last 16 for the last five World Cups looks ominous . They have not been eliminated in the first round since 1978 . <p> Croatia 's midfield ranks among the best in the world , but an opening day defeat to the hosts might put them on the back foot from the off . Not since 1982 has a team lost in the tournament curtain raiser and still finished in the top two of their group . <p> After their draw with Germany and their victory over Moldova , the Indomitable Lions might just be coming good at the right time . Their defence looks strong , and , in Samuel Eto'o , they possess an elite striker who will be super-motivated to leave a lasting impression in a tournament that has , too often , passed him by . <p> Progression could set-up a tasty second-round battle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Cote d'IvoireI fear the Cote d'Ivoire have been grossly misrepresented in the international media in the weeks leading up to the World Cup . <p> It has become too easy to reel off predictable tropes and platitudes about the ' Golden Generation ' and the insurmountable pressure they are facing to escape from the group in Brazil . <p> The fabled generation of ASEC Mimosas graduates are starting to ebb away , but while Didier Drogba , Kolo Toure and Didier Zokora are clearly past their prime , Yaya Toure , Gervinho and Salomon Kalou are at the height of their powers and coming off the back of fine seasons at club level . <p> The experience of the veterans , the class of the midfield , and the green shoots of the next generation , namely Serge Aurier and Wilfried Bony , make the Elephants a menacing prospect . <p> The pressure is much less than it has been and indeed , under the fairly aimless guidance of Sabri Lamouchi , I would argue that expectations are not particularly high at all . <p> I anticipate that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Japan and Greece ( although even without Falcao , Colombia 's attack will trouble Zokora/Bamba/Kolo ) , as well as their own qualities . <p> After that , they will likely run into one of Uruguay , Italy and England -- any option would mean a fantastic match , but here , I fear , is where the Golden Generation ( or at least what 's left of it ) will come to an end . <p> Ed Dove 's Prediction : Last 16 <p> NigeriaA month ago I would have been one of those dancing around in my new ( lemon ) green Nigeria jersey , wildly proclaiming that this would be the year when the Super Eagles would take their place in the Last Eight . <p> My mood has dampened a lot over the intervening days . <p> Disheartened by the provisional line-up , discouraged by the friendly performances , and dismayed by the final squad of 23 , I fear that Keshi has made life incredibly hard for himself and for those players he does take to Brazil . <p> A week ago , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from kissing goodbye to the quarter-finals .

They may have escaped from ominous pools in the past ( against Italy , Czech Republic and the USA in 2006 , Germany , Serbia and Australia in 2010 ) , but Germany , Portugal and the USA represent an altogether more menacing challenge . <p> Secondly , it 's hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side as he should , with his star man , Kwadwo Asamoah as the hub .

@@2562240 <p> After touring 40 cities worldwide , from Kuala Lumpur to Budapest , Da Vinci -- The Genius is in Gauteng , where it will stay until June 22 . Prior to setting up in Woodmead , Johannesburg , the privately owned edu-exhibition had an extended run in Cape Town from November last year to March this year . It saw about 45 000 people traipse through its doors -- to great acclaim , if the online guest book is anything to go by . <p> That Da Vinci was a genius is without doubt . His paintings were among the most influential of the Renaissance period and his Mona Lisa is one of the best known and loved art works of all times . <p> Da Vinci 's mercurial nature saw him dabble in the roles of inventor , scientist , artist , anatomist , sculptor , engineer , musician , mathematician and architect . Many of his inventions must have seemed comical in 15th-century Italy , but are now acknowledged as being way ahead of their time . They range from fantastical ( and impractical ) flying machines , a type of submarine , shoes for walking on water , quick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crank mechanisms and finned mortar shells to a steam cannon . Which raises the question : How does one effectively portray the lifetime achievements of a polymath in a way that is relevant and interesting to both children and adults ? <p> Da Vinci -- The Genius makes a valiant effort by building replicas of Leonardo 's ideas based on the notes and drawings found in his codices ( notebooks ) . <p> Life-size exhibitsThe exhibition boasts more than 200 pieces , including 75 life-size machine inventions . There are touch-screen presentations , which allow you to flip through pages from his codices and demonstrate some of the concepts behind his work -- such as the principles of sacred geometry demonstrated in the Vitruvian Man . <p> The promoters promise visitors the opportunity to " push , pull , crank and interact with many of the exhibits for a hands-on understanding of the scientific principles behind them " . <p> In offering an appraisal of the exhibition , I feel it is necessary to take Da Vinci 's own words into consideration : " You do ill if you praise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand . " I by no means understand the intricacies and economics of researching and staging a travelling exhibition . How does one fit a collection of displays and items into spaces of varying shapes and sizes ? How does one maintain the condition of the exhibits on the road ? How can you ensure that the information offered is interesting to a wide range of cultures and age groups ? The variables must be boggling . <p> What I do understand , however , is my own expectation and that that expectation is , to a large extent , based on my wallet . Having pre-booked my ticket for R140 , I arrived at The Amazing Space in Woodmead . I paid R10 for safe parking and coughed up an additional R40 for the audio tour . Having spent just shy of R200 , my expectations were to be wowed by an exhibition of international standards , something for which I am happy to fork out.Unfortunately I came away quite disappointed . <p> Flying machinesOn entering , the first section of exhibition features replicas of Da Vinci 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines . The machines are well-built in wood and canvas and offer a believable representation given the date of their invention . I would have liked to be allowed to " push , pull or crank " some of these large-scale machines , but they are strictly hands off . <p> The touch screen presentation of the codices is impressive and it was remarkable to see and try to interpret the " mirror image " writing for which Da Vinci is famous . The actual replicas of the codices , however , are not -- the cheaply printed and glued together books reminded me of a school project . I also found the " replicas " of his paintings in this section to be of poor quality . <p> This variable quality repeats itself throughout the exhibition . Some items are high-tech and inspiring , some are okay and some are really a bit shabby . <p> The exhibition boasts more than 200 pieces , including 75 life-size machine inventions . <p> The second and more interactive section of the exhibition features Da Vinci 's musical inventions and some small-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encouraged to " push , pull or crank " .

I found this the most gratifying section and particularly enjoyed the animated audio-visual presentation of the Last Supper . <p> The 25 Secrets of the Mona Lisa exhibit is also extremely interesting . The " secrets " have been gleaned from engineer-optician Pascal Cottee , whose multi-spectral , high-definition camera has visually peeled away the layers of hundreds of years of varnish , renovation and grime to reveal the painting in its original luminosity , colour and detail . <p> In all I walked away after about two-and-a-half hours with mixed feelings . On the one hand I was disappointed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It did take a lot of reading , though , which might prove challenging to an attention-deficit generation of children and teens . <p> If money is not a consideration , I 'd say go for it . But if it is , you could get similar information by staying home and renting a good documentary on the Renaissance giant . <p> Da Vinci -- The Genius is on at The Amazing Place in Woodmead , Johannesburg , until June 22 .

As a nice touch , the Red-E graciously switches itself off when charging is complete . Four blue LED 's above the microUSB outlet also signals when Red-E is charging , how much power is left or whether the Red-E is actually on . It 's a welcome inclusion . <p> The design is conservative but it 's the performance that 's the real deal swinger .

Annoyingly , there is also no indication when the battery is indeed flat , other than the complete lack of LEDs after mashing the power button a few times . <p> Connection-wise , the 30-pin Apple connector was as temperamental as the LEDs , charging older iDevices only when it felt obliged to do so . Of course , if one is really stuck , there 's always Apple 's proprietary cable , but this really should n't be an excuse . <p> Although there are other options on the market and this device is not without fault , the Red-E feels and behaves more consistently than most batteries of its size .

Notwithstanding the broad , urgent and complex nature of comprehensive campus internationalisation , too often college presidents do not allocate the financial resources it requires. ? <p> One of the reasons why internationalisation does not get the attention it deserves is the limited demonstrable impact of internationalisation at the campus level . <p> Charles and Deardoff assert that colleges ? ? that have embraced comprehensive internationalisation generate returns greater than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reputation and ranking .

A properly designed impact evaluation can answer the question of whether the programme is working or not , and hence assist in decisions about scaling up. ? <p> Successful strategies for comprehensive internationalisation would not only focus on asking for resources ( inputs ) , but would also put corresponding efforts into assessing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data collection , analysis and dissemination . <p> Maximising the potential of internationalisation <p> Internationalisation of higher education is gaining increasing attention from universities for a variety of reasons . <p> However , the potential is not maximised due to lack of attention given to the importance of adapting the definition of internationalisation to the institutional mission and lack of commensurate efforts to assess the impact of internationalisation on the campus community . <p> To achieve the desired results , institutions need to become more focused not only on defining internationalisation beyond the movement of people , but also on assessing the impact on people . This approach not only engages stakeholders , but also ensures alignment with the institutional mission in an evidence-driven manner . <p> * Dr Rahul Choudaha is chief knowledge officer and senior director of strategic development at World Education Services in New York , and blogs and tweets on international higher education trends .

The burning question is whether entrepreneurship can actually be taught . <p> The report , Entrepreneurship Education and Training : Insights from Ghana , Kenya , and Mozambique , suggests that skilled entrepreneurship offers potential rewards across the socio-economic spectrum and could be used to reduce graduate joblessness . <p> The main problem lies in whether entrepreneurial success can be taught , taking into account that business education researchers and experts are divided and currently there is no unified curriculum on subject content . <p> Entrepreneurial education and training is populated by a variety of programmes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their goals vary just as widely . <p> ? The landscape of what is being taught is poorly known , ? says Dr Alexandria Valerio , a senior economist in the Education Department at the World Bank and coordinator of the report that was released last month . <p> According to Valerio , the situation is further complicated by most programmes being delivered in mixed educational and cultural frameworks . <p> ? For instance , some courses emphasise socio-emotional skills that include leadership , psychology of planning , personal initiative , persuasion and negotiation , while others concentrate purely on development of business acumen and mind-sets , ? says Valerio . <p> Dr Alicia Robb , a senior fellow with the Kauffman Foundation and a key member of the team of experts that wrote the report for the World Bank , said that despite thin evidence on outcomes , ? there is still high optimism of benefits that could be accrued from entrepreneurship education ? . <p> Case studies <p> In Ghana , Kenya and Mozambique , policy-makers feel there are potential spillovers from entrepreneurship education and training programmes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the report , as many as 50% of graduates who leave Ghanaian universities and polytechnics fail to find jobs for two years after their national service , and 20% do not find jobs for three years . <p> The situation is similar in Kenya and Mozambique , where the majority of university graduates rely on work in the informal sector , which is considered vulnerable employment . <p> Amid efforts to tackle such problems , several universities in the three countries have established entrepreneurship education programmes that target both undergraduate and postgraduate students . <p> ? While some of these universities claim to prepare students for careers as entrepreneurs , they also aim to prepare them for careers in entrepreneurship promotion as entrepreneurship facilitators , ? says Valerio . <p> Integrating entrepreneurship <p> Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology and Kenyatta University have integrated entrepreneurship concepts into most of their academic programmes while Mount Kenya University , which is a private institution , has begun training all faculty in all disciplines in entrepreneurship and management . <p> Apart from infusing entrepreneurship and innovation concepts across most of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenya ? offers full academic programmes in entrepreneurship in its school of commerce and management . <p> The universities of Jomo Kenyatta , Kenyatta and Strathmore have linked their academic entrepreneurship agendas to incubator programmes that offer a range of services , from networking and mentorship connections to access to potential funding from the private sector . <p> Jomo Kenyatta is regarded as a pioneer of entrepreneurship education at the higher education level , being the first university in East Africa to offer a PhD in entrepreneurship . <p> Entrepreneurship education is increasingly entrenched in tertiary institutions in Mozambique , notably in Eduardo Mondlane University , the Higher Institute of Science and Technology of Mozambique , and the Pedagogical University . <p> According to the report , the Higher Institute of Science and Technology of Mozambique hosts the Empresa Junior programme , which includes workshops and a business plan competition to provide exposure to entrepreneurship among students . <p> The Pedagogical University has established a partnership with the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation to expose teachers to entrepreneurship . <p> At Eduardo Mondlane University , all students are required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The university recently opened an Entrepreneurship Higher Education School , which runs courses on business management and leadership . <p> In Kenya and Mozambique , entrepreneurship programmes in higher education are delivered in a mix of stand-alone degree courses and entrepreneurship education units integrated across disciplines . <p> ? But whereas Kenya and Mozambique show signs of entrepreneurship education and training being integrated across all the universities , in Ghana entrepreneurship education programmes are mainly concentrated in private universities , ? says Wilberforce Owusu-Ansah , a lecturer at Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and a key member of the research teams that prepared the countries ? case studies . <p> For instance , while the private Entrepreneurship Training Institute in Accra offers both a full degree programme and a postgraduate diploma in entrepreneurship , in public universities entrepreneurship education tends to come in the form of a one-semester core course for undergraduate students , Owusu-Ansah explained . <p> Little evidence <p> Indicators from Nigeria and Uganda also show that there is commitment by universities and other tertiary institutions in many African countries to promote entrepreneurial skills as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Labour Organisation-backed Student Training for Promoting Entrepreneurship Programme in two Ugandan universities and entrepreneurship diploma at Auchi Polytechnic School of Business in Nigeria are two such examples , where limited evaluations show desire by students to set up small-scale businesses after graduation , ? says Alicia Robb . <p> Unfortunately , in the landscape of global research on entrepreneurship education and training , there is little evidence to indicate that such programmes could resolve unemployment crises through self-employment and creation of small-scale enterprises . <p> According to the report , global monitoring studies have identified corruption , prohibitively high taxes and burdensome regulatory regimes as serious impediments to small-scale business ownership in Sub-Saharan Africa . <p> ? Crime and insecurity also remain a very large concern , especially for those in the informal sector , ? adds the report . <p> Local and cultural factors <p> The researchers also raised concerns about local and cultural barriers to entrepreneurship that are related to discouragement by family and peers and lack of access to finance . In most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa , among the most frequently cited barriers to entrepreneurs ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graduate entrepreneurs interviewed by University World News in Nairobi for this story noted lack of acceptance of entrepreneurship as a respected career path . <p> There was also fear of venturing into self-employment as a result of cultural attitudes , especially towards familial financial obligations : it becomes hard to deny goods or credit to extended family members or relatives . <p> In Ghana , prospective student entrepreneurs described to researchers how prejudice , a ? pull him down ? attitude and superstition can compromise entrepreneurs ? willingness to persevere . In Mozambique , entrepreneurs cited deep-rooted cultural values that thwarted entrepreneurial success . <p> But as researchers pointed out , there is a need to evaluate whether entrepreneurship has any capacity to reduce the graduate employment crisis in Africa . <p> COMMENTS <p> Usukhbayar Ariunbold , what do you think ? Do you think entrepreneurship can be taught ? <p> Christopher Weir on the University World News Facebook page <p> I think the answer can be both Yes and No for " can entrepreneurship be taught ? " . Of course , there are a number of higher education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue the business world . Students can get a PhD in entrepreneurship . Yet the main thing is not about obtaining the degree or diploma , which is not really useful without proper , real-life experience . How many of the graduates from a business school start up their own businesses ? A marriage of economic environment , social factors , personal development ( entrepreneurial spirit , calculated risk-taking abilities , vision , feeling ) and social capital may mould the true entrepreneur , I guess . In short , of course entrepreneurship can be taught - but not every graduate is ready to become an entrepreneur after attending university . <p> Usukhbayar Ariunbold on the University World News Facebook page <p> I think that the teaching side is more about providing inspiration than anything else , and perhaps a slightly different way of looking at things .

This substance was what I had been missing . <p> Not long after graduating , I spent a year in London , revelling in the club scene . I learned to dance , to flirt , to make friends with strangers . But without the drugs I had no social fuel , nothing to sustain me through any awkward moments , nothing to assure me that everything was going to be okay . <p> By the time I moved to Cape Town I had discovered my drug of choice : cocaine .

She had also taken drugs , but was always able to stop whenever she wanted to . I seemed to lack the same " off " switch . <p> I remember leaving a friend 's wedding in the winelands to drive back to Cape Town to score drugs . I left my wife alone , our friends asking where I was . I missed the entire reception , arriving back so obviously high that even the parents noticed . <p> Just one year into my marriage , I was constantly lying to my wife .

She moved out of our flat and gave me an ultimatum : clean up or our marriage is over . I will always be grateful to her for this -- the reality of possibly losing her gave me my first moment of clarity . <p> I told my parents about my problem and admitted myself to a drug rehabilitation centre . For the next 12 weeks I faced the fear and shame I had been suppressing for my entire life . It was one of the most painful things I 've ever experienced , but also one of the most worthwhile .

But what it means is that we are not responsible for being sick in the first place . It means that , once we know how to recover , we are responsible for that recovery . <p> It 's a great pity , then , that most of society is still focused on the drugs themselves and not the people who are addicted to them . Billions have been spent fighting the " war on drugs " , but people have not stopped taking drugs .

It took nearly a decade for my disease to show its teeth . <p> We should treat teenagers more like adults . Many ( if not most ) of them will try drugs at some point . What they need to be vigilant about is their relationship to those substances , not the substances themselves . <h> In defence of being a responsible drug user <p> I always swore I would never drop acid . I can still remember the time I berated my best friend when he told me he went candy flipping ( dropping acid -- lysergic acid diethylamide , or LSD -- and taking ecstacy at the same time ) on a beach in Kenton in the Eastern Cape . <p> We were university students and , even though I was smoking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I was not convinced .

I bought myself three pills of ecstacy while the rest of my friends dropped acid . <p> One by one their eyes started to glaze over ; they were " coming on " but I still felt nothing . My E was just not working . So I marched up to the dealer as he nodded his dreaded head to the trance music blaring from the speakers .

Wherever it 's observed around the world it 's a month of giving , and sharing , and extra prayers , earnest supplications to God and much recitation of the Qur'an . <p> But beyond the faith-based additions to the month , there are also specific culinary delights associated with it in different countries . Dates and water are usually the first course on any Iftar menu , because the Prophet Muhammad instructed his followers to break their fast with these items . But beyond that , what Muslims eat at the time of breaking their fast will usually depend on their culture . <p> Here in South Africa , in most Indian Muslim homes , there 's haleem , a nutritious broth , with naan bread , and milkshake . And there are samoosas -- lots and lots of them . <p> No , not the big , fat , ready-to-eat triangles overflowing with onions and oozing with oil that you can buy over the counter at many shopping malls .

" According to her , from 1930 to 1945 samoosas only featured on the Ramadan menu on special nights , and on the day of Eid ul-Fitr ( breaking of the Ramadan fast ) . <p> " Slowly its popularity and improvement in finances led to its entrenchment over time as the twin of haleem , " she says . <p> Dozens and dozens My mum fries an average of a dozen samoosas a day during Ramadan for our family of four , which means our freezer is stocked up with around 30 dozen ahead of time .

The others simply pop the mince on to the strip , extend one corner over the other and make the triangle . Either way , the end result is something I am deeply envious of . <p> " Samoosas must be filled with pride , point to point , " says Chotikhala , whose years of exertion in the kitchen have possibly -- by her own admission -- contributed to her osteoporosis , which means she ca n't " stand and fill " as she 'd like to .

These days she buys it from one of hundreds of women around the country who make their living selling pur on its own , or samoosas , or filling samoosas for housewives who do n't have the time to do so . You can buy homemade samoosas at anything ranging from R20 to R40 a dozen .

@@2627240 <p> THE first sign of the approaching storm was the incident that occurred at the forced sale of Field-Cornet Bezuidenhout 's wagon , on which a distress had been levied . The British Government had begun to collect taxes and to take proceedings against those who refused to pay them . Among these was Piet Bezuidenhout , who lived in the Potchefstroom district . This refusal to pay taxes was one of the methods of passive resistance which were now employed towards the British Government . Hitherto , many of the burghers had paid their taxes , declaring that they were only yielding to force . But when this was explained by the English politicians as though the population were contented and peacefully paying their taxes , some asked for a receipt showing that they were only paying under protest and others refused to pay at all . <p> The Government then levied a distress on Bezuidenhout 's wagon and sent it to public auction at Potchefstroom .

" <p> I answered : <p> " I should agree with you , if we had acknowledged the annexation ; but that is not the case .

It is only necessary to say that , in view of their very small number in all about 7,000 men it was necessary for the Boers to go to work with the greatest circumspection . The plan was to cut off all the villages in which the English had a garrison and to send the rest of the burghers to the Natal frontier , there to arrest the approaching reinforcements of the enemy . Another difficulty was the scarcity of ammunition . At the beginning of the war the Boers had only about 15 rounds per man , so that they had to do precisely as they did in the later stages of the last war , first capture ammunition from the enemy and then fight him with his own ammunition . <p> In these circumstances , our enterprise would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had also been called out against us , if God had not strengthened our hearts , so that we went bravely to face greatly superior numbers . <p> Let us linger for a moment on only one fight in this war , the Battle of Bronkhorstspruit , and that for certain reasons . This was an engagement with the 94th Regiment , which was on its way from Lydenburg to Pretoria . The Boer commanders , who had received news of its approach , sent Commandant Frans Joubert , with about 150 men , to meet it . <p> When the two forces came into touch , Joubert sent a message to the British commander , Colonel Anstruther , asking him to return to Lydenburg , in which case no fighting need take place . The man who carried the message was a burgher , called Paul de Beer , who spoke English well . Anstruther 's answer was brief : <p> " I am on my way to Pretoria and I am going to Pretoria . " <p> Joubert and his men , therefore , had no choice but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bare hill , on which stood a few hawthorn-trees . The English took up their position in a sunk road , while the burghers had to charge across open ground . <p> The fight lasted only a few minutes . About 230 of the English were dead or wounded ; the rest surrendered . Colonel Anstruther , who himself was mortally wounded , sent for Commandant Joubert , told him that he was beaten in fair fight , and asked him to accept his sword as a present . He died a few minutes later . It would not have been worth while to enter into these details , notwithstanding the earlier lying accusations that the English had been treacherously attacked on this occasion , if Field Marshal Earl Roberts of Waterford , Kandahar and Pretoria had not rescued this contemptible calumny from oblivion . <p> When , in the course of the last war , he arrived at Bronkhorstspruit , he telegraphed to England that he was now at the spot where a British force had been decimated by treachery in 1881 . But this only shows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war was continued throughout the territory of the Republic under the able command of the late General Joubert , who was then in the full vigor of his years and displayed his military capacity in a brilliant fashion that aroused general amazement . <p> Under Joubert stood other capable men , such as General Smit and General Piet Cronje , who distinguished himself in the last war by his heroic resistance at Paarde Kraal . The campaign reached its climax in the Battle of Majuba Hill , on the 27th of February 1881 . <p> During the war , I remained for the most part with the Government at Heidelberg , but I also made several journeys to the commandos , for instance to Potchefstroom , in the Drakensberg , and to Standerton , to exhort and encourage the burghers in those places . I also went to Rustenburg to address the burghers who were besieging the British garrison . <p> Here I learnt that Magato 's Kaffirs , who lived near Rustenburg , had assumed a threatening attitude , and I at once proceeded thither , accompanied by seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving at Magato 's town , I found the Kaffirs gathered to the number of thousands under arms in their huts , clearly with no good intention . <p> I went straight to Magato 's hut and addressed him in these words : <p> " Why did you supply the English in their camp at Rustenburg with provisions , although I had told you to observe a strictly neutral attitude in this war , which is a war between white men ? " <p> Magato replied : <p> " I received a message from the English saying that they had already taken Heidelberg and were on the way here , and that , if I did not obey their orders , they would come to punish me . " <p> I retorted : <p> " If you wo n't listen to me , I shall have to bring you before the court-martial , " and caught him by the hand . <p> While I was speaking to the chief in these threatening terms , the Kaffirs stormed into the hut from every side , armed with axes , assegais and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ der Walt , placed himself with his rifle beside Magato , and threatened to shoot him down if the least harm came to me . <p> When Magato saw that his life was at stake , he ordered his captains to disperse the Kaffirs . The captains had to beat back the crowd with cudgels and knobkerries before they succeeded in separating them . When the riot had subsided , I said to Magato : <p> " Call in your Kaffirs again ; I want to give them my orders . " <p> Magato at first refused , saying that I could tell him , Magato , what I wanted . But I said : <p> " No , I will speak to your people myself . " <p> Thereupon the Kaffirs were summoned , and approached unarmed and timidly . I spoke to them , rebuked them for their bad conduct and warned them to keep quiet in the future , as " Kaffirs had nothing to do with this war . " After that , I resumed my conversation with Magato , told him how reprehensible his conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would remain neutral and neither assist nor oppose the English or the Boers . <p> As I had to go back to Heidelberg , I asked Magato for a couple of horses . Magato beckoned me into his hut and , when we were alone , said : <p> " I can not give you any horses , for , if I did , the English would know it to-morrow . But repeat your request in the presence of my Kaffirs ; then I will refuse , and then you must say , ' Very well , then I will take them by force , if you will not give them to me . ' Then I shall say in my heart , ' It is good , ' but I shall refuse with my mouth . " <p> I did so , and took two excellent horses for my return journey to Heidelberg . <p> About this time , a messenger came to ask me to come to the Natal frontier , as the English had requested an armistice in order to negotiate for peace . <p> I at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a very difficult journey . Thanks to the heavy rains , the roads were hardly practicable , and a circuitous route had to be followed in order to avoid the places occupied by the English . The armistice was to come to an end on the 14th of March ; but it was impossible for me to reach my destination , Laing 's Nek , in Natal , by that date . In the meanwhile , General Joubert , in view of the delay of the journey , obtained a four days ' prolongation of the armistice . Together with my companions , Pretorius , Mare and Dr. Jorissen , I was enthusiastically received by the burghers . <p> Soon after , a conference was held between the representatives of the Boers on the one hand and Sir Evelyn Wood , for the British Government , on the other . It took place halfway between the two camps . During the armistice , Sir Evelyn had received instructions from the British Colonial Secretary which were to form the basis of the negotiations . These were : <p> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 ) The Boers to be entitled to empower persons to negotiate a peace . <p> ( 3 ) The appointment of a royal commission to investigate all military questions and to hand over the country . <p> ( 4 ) Self-government under British suzerainty . <p> ( 5 ) A British resident to be appointed at Pretoria . <p> ( 6 ) The foreign policy of the South African Republic to be placed under British control . <p> The late President Brand of the Orange Free State was to be present at the negotiations in order to facilitate a settlement . The composition of the so-called royal commission gave rise to many difficulties . The British Government wished it to consist exclusively of British subjects , with the exception of President Brand , who was to sit on behalf of both parties . <p> The Boer leaders , on the other hand , desired a mixed commission , consisting of representatives of both parties . Moreover , the British Government wished to keep back for themselves a portion of the Republic , namely , the Utrecht and Wakkerstroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear of in any case . After long arguments , Sir Evelyn Wood asked : <p> " Suppose we do not yield on this point , will you go on fighting ? " <p> I replied : <p> " That is not a fair question . If we do not yield , will you go on fighting ? " <p> Another difficulty was the question of the withdrawal of Her Majesty 's troops from the Republic and the provisioning of the English garrisons in the villages during the negotiations . It looked for one moment as though the negotiations would fall through , and that was the moment at which Dr. Jorissen , by my order , drew up his so-called third proclamation. 1 <p> *** <p> 1 The text of this proclamation will be found in Dr. Jorissen 's Transvaalsche Herinneringen , 1897. - Note by the Editor of the German Edition . <p> *** <p> I caused this third proclamation to be read out to President Brand , who had by that time arrived and who made every effort to induce me to refrain from publishing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at O'Neill 's house . <p> It was a very difficult matter to agree on the different points . Sir Evelyn Wood did his very utmost to get off with verbal assurances ; and , as the armistice had to be prolonged in order to continue the negotiations , he seized the opportunity , while I was engaged in conversation with General Joubert and Dr. Jorissen , to charge an orderly to take the news of the prolongation of the armistice to the camp . But I noticed this and asked : <p> " Where is the man going ? " <p> As soon as I heard the nature of his mission , I said to one of Wood 's aides-de-camp : <p> " Stop that man ! " <p> I then went in to the tent and said to General Wood that I asked him , as an honest man , first to sign the agreement containing the points discussed between us . The document lay on the table , but Sir Evelyn refused to sign . It was not until I cried , " Burghers , saddle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evasion was impossible , gave in and signed . <p> The orderly was then allowed to go off with the news of the prolongation of the armistice . <p> When the provisional peace protocol was signed , the English officers tried to disparage the Boer victory and to make us confess that we had suffered fearful losses and could , therefore , not have continued our resistance : <p> " How many did you have killed on the Nek ? " one of them asked Joubert , confidently . <p> " I myself had one , " answered Joubert , " and one wounded . " <p> The officer laughed and maintained that he had seen more of our men killed with his own eyes : <p> " Very well , " said Joubert , very angrily . " Do you go and dig one of them up and bring him here ; and I promise you I 'll eat him , skin and all . " <p> A chaplain from Newcastle , on the other hand , expressed to me his regard for the Boers and his admiration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the English had fought very bravely and shot down many Boers , until their ammunition gave out ; then , of course , they had to give up the fight : <p> " Our fellows would let themselves be shot before handing over a cartridge . " <p> I made no reply , but again turned to the chaplain and said : <p> " When you see Her Majesty , mind you tell her that she must give her soldiers a special reward for the care with which they guarded their ammunition supply ; we found it on the hill , quite safely packed on the donkeys . " <p> Wood himself put similar questions . He asked , among other things : <p> " What were the 200 men for whom you were sending to the Biggarsberg ? " <p> " We heard that you were marching there with 12,000 . " <p> " And you sent your 200 ? " <p> " Yes , we had no more to send ; but I have seen that they would have been enough . " <p> By this agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name of the people of the South African Republic , the following objects were secured absolutely free autonomy under British suzerainty , with the appointment of a British Resident at Pretoria , and the return of British property seized during the war . The point that nearly led to the breaking-off of the negotiations , namely , the question of the loss of territory , was left to the decision of the royal commission . Sir Evelyn Wood bound himself not to occupy the positions on Laing 's Nek , if the Boers abandoned them , nor to send troops or ammunition to the Transvaal . <p> Moreover , the royal commission was to settle all undecided matters within six months , to confirm the treaty of peace and to restore the country to the Boers . This commission , which met shortly after , consisted of Sir Hercules Robinson , the newly-appointed High Commissioner ; Sir Henry de Villiers , Chief Justice of Cape Colony ; and Sir Evelyn Wood . They effected a draft treaty , which is known by the name of the Pretoria Convention of 1881 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was summoned to approve this convention . Five months earlier , in an extraordinary session , I had praised England 's magnanimity , expressed my full confidence in the commission and pointed to a reconciliation with England as the basis of a happy national existence , in order to appease the burghers . <p> But I , too , now found myself obliged to protest against certain articles of the convention , and complained by telegram , but in vain , to Gladstone that several clauses of the treaty contained the opposite of what had actually been arranged by word of mouth . Eventually the treaty was only accepted with the reservation that we were yielding to force and that we trusted that , in view of this forced acceptance , the British Government would see their way to alter the convention and to remove the points which made it unacceptable to the Volksraad , notably the imposition of the suzerainty and the unjust curtailments of territory . <p> One of the points which offended the burghers was that , instead of being called the " South African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Transvaal State . ' The country only recovered the title of South African Republic by the London Convention of 1884 . But , in the meanwhile , in my official correspondence with the British Resident , I was always accustomed to speak of the South African Republic . One fine day the latter came to me to complain about this , saying that the name of the country was the Transvaal State , and not the South African Republic . <p> " How do you prove that ? " said I. <p> " Why , " answered Hudson , " by the convention , which clearly says , ' Transvaal State . ' " " Very well , " I rejoined . " If I sell you a farm and , in the deed of sale , I say , ' I , Paul Kruger , hereinafter called the Vendor , and so on , ' then , in what follows , I am no longer ' Paul Kruger , ' but the ' Vendor . ' Even so in this case . In the convention , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to as the ' Transvaal State ; ' but that does not make it its real name , but only its specification . Its real name is and remains the ' South African Republic . ' " <p> Hudson laughed and said : <p> " Well , call it as you please , only do not mind if I keep to the name of the Transvaal State . " <p> On the 8th of August , after the Volksraad had met , the country was restored in due form and the dear Fierkleur was once more solemnly hoisted .

@@2630238 <h> 5-TILES keyboard review : the Qwerty pretender <p> Call me a Neanderthal , but I miss typing on a phone with a physical Qwerty keyboard . Nothing quite beats the tangible feedback a springing key with defined edges provides . BlackBerry 's now largely extinct Bold range had the best example but now , although touchscreen smartphones are more powerful than we could ever have anticipated then , typing anything of length on one is an unwanted chore . <p> The self-proclaimed " keyboard designed for the future " features a slim five key-layout in a bar as opposed to the usual barrage of Qwerty tiles , saving around 70% of screen real-estate . Those used to Qwerty ( or even Dvorak ) will be puzzled by the layout 's non-normative design , but it is a very attractive app . The standard skin comes in the pastel rainbow colours , which is n't as garish as it sounds . It looks much better than what has emerged from Microsoft 's current tile-obsessive UI design studio although in landscape mode the bar failed to span across the entire width of the screen . <p> The introductory page is also easy to navigate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all adjustable . A host of European-based languages are also natively supported , but sadly that 's about all for now which will win no favours with international users . Skins can be applied on the paid version too , which 'll set you back around US$4 . The free version however , is more than adequate for test purposes and is the more widely used variant judging by Google Play 's metrics . <p> A never-ending typing lesson <p> Apart from the different appearance , using 5-TILES is unlike any keyboard I 've tried before . <p> According to the layout 's creator , Michal Kubacki , the 5-TILES 's one-finger swiping method can be fully mastered in under 30 minutes , which I retort is an over-idealised statement . It took me well over a week to learn its ins and outs , commands and all , and to this day , I still find myself staring at my phone , aimlessly trying to navigate the tiles to type something as simple as my name . It makes messaging , or typing a lengthy password , even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the positioning of the keys that threw me off . As noted previously , each of the five keys house multiple letters . Said letters are typed using a tap and swipe method that corresponds with the position of the intended letter and the position of the letter . For example , to type a " C " -- which is the fourth letter in the first key -- the user taps the first key and swipes towards the fourth key . It sounds simple , but it feels ungainly and unnatural . <p> Essential commands like DEL , SHIFT , ENTER and directional keys are accessed through a downward or upward swipe of their respective keys . A cheat sheet is available for reference , but it 's incredibly foreign not having those commands staring you in the face , but after about a day , their locations become relatively familiar -- more so than the keys themselves . <p> Accessing punctuation and special characters requires some specialised gesture-based voodoo , which induces much head scratching . Coming from months of learning SwiftKey 's ins and outs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period and commas not positioned in a predictable place . More often than not , I abstained from punctuation altogether and reverted to an abbreviated , IM-tainted version of English . It was the only way I could come close to my current typing speed but not ideal for mashing out work-related emails . <p> Potential for wearables , not smartphones <p> For its host of drawbacks , 5-TILES does come with its fair share of glinting positives . Although it 's a horror to learn , more screen for important content means you wo n't need to close the keyboard to read an IM , for instance . It 's also much easier to type on it with one hand than a Qwerty , as a simple finger swipe in opposing directions is all that 's needed . <p> For these reasons , ETAOI Systems hopes to infiltrate the wearables market with this keyboard . Michal Kubacki also has desires on being Google Glass 's keyboard of choice , noting that the linear swipe-motion is perfect for the Glass 's touch pad . <p> I have my doubts about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it does n't give consumers enough reason to ditch Qwerty to learn a completely new and rare keyboard layout . The paid version also has some nice additions , but it 's not enough to justify buying it either . I can see this keyboard being a big hit on smartwatches and the like , but not smartphones . <p> Like I said before , 5-TILES is not intrinsically terrible , there 's just equally nothing wrong with the Qwerty system . <p> Verdict : ETOAI 's 5-TILES keyboard is new and an interesting concept for small screens , but it takes too long to learn for no real end reward . There are only advantages that come with the compact layout for wearables but as a smartphone keyboard , it leaves a lot to be desired in the face of Qwerty 's dominance . Do n't give up that Qwerty keyboard , or the US$4 , just yet . <p> Score : 4/10 <h> Author Bio <p> Joining the Memeburn team on April Fool 's 2014 , Andy completed his B.A. Honours degree in English Literature at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an undercover nerd , the interwoven world of bits and pixels came more naturally to him than a duck to quacking .

@@2689240 <h> The hyper-sexualisation of breasts , and especially the female nipple has left many uncomfortable around breastfeeding mothers . <h> Related Links <p> Recently , a photo was released of new mom Olivia Wilde breastfeeding her son Otis ( in head-to-toe Prada couture , nogal ) during a Glamour magazine cover shoot . The picture quickly went viral -- with some deeming her public display of naked breast inappropriate , while others ( like me ) saw it as a beautiful act of motherhood . <p> Models like Miranda Kerr , Jaime King and Gisele B ? ndchen have also caught heat , in the last year , for posting pictures on social media of themselves breastfeeding . On the one hand they got flak for doing something with their breasts that was n't solely for viewing pleasure , and on the other hand a lot of new mothers complained of the pressure they feel to look perfectly groomed while taking care of their youngsters . Others purely said that they were ' over-sharing ' .

Breastfeeding is the most natural thing . " <p> Yes it is . That is in fact the primary purpose of the breast , is it not ? Then why is this picture of Wilde or those shared by supermodels making so many men and women uncomfortable ? <p> Is it because the breast has become so hyper-sexualised in modern society , that breastfeeding is no longer seen as something that is inextricably linked to it ? <p> Surely that needs to change .

@@2732235 <p> When it comes to specific gaming PC peripherals , there are two camps ; those who think that the regular , non-fancy hardware gets the job done , and those who need the absolute best . This year 's version on Razer 's Blackwidow Ultimate keyboard is definitely for the latter , but it would be hard to call it an innovation . <p> The Razer Blackwidow is immediately recognisable . The trademark keyboard from Razer has been around for ages , with each year bringing a few refinements and adjustments to the table . The " Ultimate " suffix at the end just means that there 's a little more flair to the real hardware that you 're paying for , such as fancy green backlighting that is almost required in my taste for keyboards . The Blackwidow for this year has subtle , small changes that will only really make a difference to the hardcore online gamers . <p> On the surface , the Blackwidow 2014 is near identical . It 's a big , black piece of plastic that is more at home on a desk where it never needs to move . It also comes with an assortment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it a few extra capabilities . You 'll be able to connect a USB and even headphones to the Blackwidow , something which has been a staple in the range for a while now . Despite the size , the elevated structure of the keyboard is extremely comfortable to use . There 's no palm rest , but that does n't really matter when your fingers feel at home as soon as they touch the surface of the keys . <p> As I 've said , the Blackwidow is a large but comfortable keyboard . It 's comes packaged with a 10-key numpad and an additional row of Macro keys down the left hand side , with all the keys on the obese side . It 's takes a while to get used to , but once you 've used it for a few minutes you 'll never want to go back to anything else . I 've used my fair share of keyboards over the years , but the Blackwidow is by far the most comfortable I 've ever used . I even think it helped with some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nope , it did n't ) <p> One thing that may take a bit more getting used to though is the noise . I 've never used a mechanical keyboard before this , but I 've always known that they 're far louder pieces of hardware thanks to the fully mechanical switches . That being said , nearly every keystroke on the Blackwidow sounds like a gunshot . You could opt for the quieter , slightly pricier Stealth Edition , but after a day or two I really did n't mind the sound , and neither did those working close to me . It 's different , but the benefits of having mechanical switches is worth it . At least it is for the hardcore crowd . <p> Mechanical switches have faster response times and give you an edge in online games . Most mechanical keyboards go for the now popular Cherry MX mechanical switches , but even Razer is n't completely satisfied with their performance . Instead of re-inventing the wheel though , Razer has decided to just tweak what already works quite well , creating their own brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help your typing speed and words per minute , but rather make each and every click a little faster . <p> These new green switches are what set this year 's edition apart from last year 's . Razer 's own brand have a much shorter actuation , meaning that the take a shorter time to actually trigger a keystroke and return back up again . It 's a minute change that will go unnoticed on the regular gamer , but for those where a split second means the difference between victory and defeat it 's definitely important . It 's a switch Razer will probably stick with on future Blackwidow keyboards as well , but unless you 're competing in some seriously important eSports you 'll never actually need it . <p> What you will probably get out of them is durability . Regular Cherry MX switches are rated for around 50 million keystrokes . That 's an insane figure that you 'll probably never reach , but Razer wanted to make sure that you 'd have some headroom if you ever did . That 's why their Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit more life to your keyboard should you ever use it that much . Unlikely , but it 's still there if you need it . <p> Funnily enough , the best part about the Blackwidow almost has nothing to do with the hardware itself . This year 's Blackwidow comes with Razer 's Synapse 2.0 software , allowing you to truly cater the keyboard to your every need . There might only be a limited number of dedicated macro keys on the keyboard itself , but literally every key is able to store a macro command using this software . Better yet , you 're able to store profiles for different games on your PC or in the cloud as well , with each profile launching as soon as you start a specific title . It gives the Blackwidow a whole new sense of flexibility , perfect for the gamer who has many different gaming needs . <p> There 's also other less useful features , such as setting the backlight to pulsate and ensure your descent into madness shortly after . You can customise the keyboard 's brightness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I kept this setting at the same number for nearly every application . The green lighting makes the keyboard look stunning , but I was surprised that the alternate functions of keys were made completely opaque . That made finding a hashtag or percentage sign a bit confusing in the dark , something which would have been no issue if they had been a little transparent . <p> The Razer Blackwidow Ultimate is an expensive keyboard , retailing at close to R1800 at most places . The regular , non-ultimate version is a lot less but also sacrifices some of the smaller details such as backlighting . There is n't any major reason to upgrade to this year 's version should you have last year 's blue Cherry MX switch model unless milliseconds matter to you . However , this is a solid , durable and comfortable keyboard that will gladly server you for years to come . If you 've been looking for a reason to upgrade your old keyboard and want something that balances style , utility and purpose , then look no further . <h> Join the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tree Edition available with rainbow lights . <p> Charl van der Merwe <p> It 's called the Chroma , not the Tree edition ? ? and yes by Xmas it should be out ? ? hehe <p> Alien Emperor Trevor <p> Not for me -- clacking mech kbs annoy me , not a big fan of green &amp; it costs more than I spend on petrol in a month . <p> Sir Rants A Lot : On Pandora <p> I ca n't use mechanical keyboards .

My K75 with Cherry Reds has no click sound , just the sound of the keys bottoming out . <p> Martinpr <p> Try a mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX red switches and o-rings . It reduces the noise quite a bit . Also reduces the joint impact on your fingers if you keep bottoming out on the keyboard . <p> Matewis Jubilai <p> The dealbreaker for me is : only 5 dedicated macro keys . My current keyboard has 10 ( i.e. a second row of keys ) and it 's comfortable to have all of them in one place . Nevertheless it 's awesome that you can program other keys with macro commands -- I 'll certainly want to have that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand macro keys . even if theyr not in a terrible spot , it still takes longer to reach than regular key binds like ctrl + 1 . personally think that if macro keys mattered that much , I would rather get a cheaper keyboard and get something like the Razer Orbweaver instead . <p> also , even with only having 5 macro keys , razer synapse is &gt;&gt; although Id be way too lazy to use that shit . <p> Matewis Jubilai <p> I suppose it varies from person to person , but I found the separate macro keys easier to use for control groups in rts than 1,2 , ... , 0 .

We expect that as our work becomes more established , politicians will come knocking on our door to ask how they can help , which was the experience in Britain . <p> JS : Was there a receptive political audience here for the organisation ? <p> YR : The president 's office is aware of Cage 's presence in South Africa and we are hopeful of positive , political engagement in the future . <p> JS : How do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ? <p> YR : We will be launching a series of initiatives over the coming months and through all levels of media and the social networks , as well as the Cage Africa website , people will be able to read about what we are planning . <p> JS : Rendition and torture , such as Cage uncovered at the highest level in the UK , form a part of the shadowiest areas of Western government . Is activism helping to change minds in the Establishment ? <p> YR : Ordinary people elect politicians and parliamentarians and councillors are reminded of this as elections approach . Voters have long memories , and as powerful people ask them for help , they are reminded of past indiscretions . On this basis alone , we believe activism will help focus the minds of this in the Establishment , especially those who need to be reminded that they are the people 's servants and not the other way around . <p> JS : How have you been embraced in European countries and other parts of the world ? <p> YR : In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European-wide initiatives , including a very high-profile one with Amnesty in a bid to find countries willing to accommodate ex-Guantanamo detainees who could not return to their native countries because of genuine fears of persecution . <p> JS : What is Cage 's position on Africom ? And should Africans be concerned about keeping a watch on this key US command on our continent ? <p> YR : About 56 countries collaborated in the notorious US rendition and torture programme , and we know this led to widespread abuse , human rights violations , torture and the emergence of Guantanamo Bay . Therefore , we should be suspicious with any similar ventures , especially when it involves questionable regimes happy to be used as outsource torture centres by the US . <p> JS : Do you believe there is enough of an awareness among ordinary people as to what has happened at Guantanamo Bay ? <p> YR : Amazingly , there are many people who believe Guantanamo closed years ago , and whenever Cage or other human rights groups use street theatre with performers and activists wearing bright orange boiler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large number of American people , thought it had closed down , especially when Obama made an election pledge to do so . <p> JS : What is the current position for the remaining prisoners there ? What kinds of legal battles are going on to protect the interests of the prisoners ? <p> YR : All the prisoners have legal representation , but there are constant reports of lawyer intimidation and interference in the judicial process . The military tribunals were set up to deal with a small number of so-called high-value detainees , but the majority ( about 140 ) , who have been cleared for release , are still languishing in a legal limbo . <p> JS : What 's Cage 's view of Obama 's role in failing to close the prison and allow justice to prevail ? <p> YR : We are hugely disappointed that the most powerful man in the world , who called for transparency in the War on Terror and the closure of Guantanamo detention facility , has achieved neither ; in fact the War on Terror has accelerated and expanded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how does it intersect with the rather terrifying arrival of Islamic State ? <p> YR : The War on Terror has been used and abused to keep entire populations under political control and in the grip of fear by constantly reminding people of atrocities like 9/11 , July 7 , the Madrid and Bali bombings . Groups like Islamic State conveniently emerge at a time when some Western governments need to reinforce the fear factory to drive through rushed legislation , further reducing people 's freedoms and liberties . <p> JS : Was there an awareness in Cage and other organisations , whose members often support the cause of detained Muslims , that Islamic State was burgeoning ? <p> YR : The reality is , had George Bush and Tony Blair not proceeded with their illegal invasion , occupation and war in Iraq , groups like Islamic State would never have emerged . Middle East foreign policy by the US and UK has been a spectacular failure ever since , and the War on Terror has only served to fuel that . It is no coincidence that Islamic State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to dress their Western captives . It has now emerged that the journalist James Foley was regularly tortured and waterboarded and that Islamic State have adopted these practices from the infamous CIA handbook on torture . <p> JS : Your own experience has been a powerful presence for human rights activists . How do you feel about the Taliban today and about Afghanistan ? <p> YR : What happened to me was extremely traumatic and subsequently life-changing , but I never allowed it to cloud my judgement over what I saw as the wrongful invasion and occupation of Afghanistan . <p> Thirteen years ago , we were very much on opposing sides and now , in South Africa , at the powerful venue of the Apartheid Museum , we were able to set aside any differences to focus on something we both firmly believe in : justice and equality . <p> Afghanistan is a great country , and I am convinced that peace and stability can be restored there -- once all of the occupiers have gone . <p> And to the pessimistic , I would point to South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country to move from its dark past into the sunlight . <p> I know it is an ongoing process and there are still many mountains to climb , but South Africa has shown the world what can be achieved when people are serious about peace . <p> JS : Can we stop the wars caused by Islamophobia ? <p> YR : I am eternally optimistic , and I know we can win the war against Islamophobia -- not by force but through education , empathy and understanding . <p> Conflict serves no purpose other than to make some powerful people in powerful places even richer and more powerful from the blood of innocents . <p> The Star <p> ** The views expressed here do not necessarily reflect those of Independent Newspapers . <p> Biography <p> Yvonne Ridley was a journalist when she was captured by the Taliban in 2001 .

According to Shaw : <p> They kept a low profile and avoided discussing or theorising about their wedding with the media ; <p> They kept it simple ( in other words they did n't fly their celebrity friends from one city to another for wedding festivities ) ; <p> They got married in their own private space ( in their French estate ) , at an inaccessible venue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who refrained from tweeting cryptically on social media ; and <p> They hired discreet people to plan their wedding . <p> A lesson from the CartersBrangelina are not the first celebrity couple to have fooled the press .

@@2756233 <h> Mitsubishi Mirage faces uphill battle <p> In these parts , Mitsubishi may be better known for its big bakkies and SUVs , but in other markets the Japanese brand has been quite successful in this segment with this car 's predecessor , known as the Colt . Experience with this small , front-wheel drive genre dates back as far as 1978 , and the car pictured here is actually around three years old -- even if its local introduction was only a month ago . <p> It 's easy to see this car 's designed to appeal to blend-in types . Its jellybean styling is anonymous to say the least , and if flashier options like Kia 's Picanto and Chevy 's Spark sit at one end of the look-at-me scale , the Mirage falls at the polar opposite . I 'd categorise it as basic transport , and not only in the appearance department . <p> BASIC MECHANICALS <p> Mechanically speaking , the Mirage is about as bare boned as you can get . Propulsion comes from a simple little 1.2-litre three-cylinder petrol engine which boasts **25;397;TOOLONG valve timing but not much else . Relative to high-tech turbo three-pots in cars like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come from the Ark . <p> Average consumption is claimed at 4.9 litres per 100km ( we averaged just over 6 ) , and power is rated at 57kW and 100Nm , which if I 'm kind , is adequate . To be fair , the little pull it does have is spread out across a wide powerband from low revs , so unlike tiny turbo motors there 's not much need to stir gears in search of a power sweet spot . Infrequent shifts make for an easy , lazy drive and this factor is one of the hatch 's strongest attributes . <p> DO N'T RUSH IT ! <p> Rush the Mirage , and it falls flat on its face . Not only does vooma taper off as revs rise , but what starts as a typical three-cylinder thrum ends up as harsh revving mechanical misery as the tacho needle strains upward . <p> Mitsubishi says it went to great lengths to keep mass down ( it weighs just 825kg ) , and judging by the noise it 's evident it started with sound deadening material . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in shifts , and it whines excessively on overrun . <p> The cabin may be noisy , but it 's fairly sturdy in build and it 's presented in modern fashion . Shiny piano black and smooth satin silver plastics are smattered tastefully over the dashboard , but unfortunately all interior materials feel cheap to the touch . I do like the simple to use stereo system that 's integrated neatly into the dash facia , and even if there 's a lack of complex gadgetry the items that are there are very user friendly . <p> THREE MODELS <p> For R144 900 you get the top GLS model as tested here , which comes with 15 " alloys , a USB port in the cubbyhole , keyless ignition , a fancier climate control with a matching orange digital display , electric windows at the back , and audio controls on the steering wheel ; but a more stripped down GL version 's also available for R124 900 with 14 " steel wheels , black mirrors and door handles and no fog lights . A middle ground GLX gets a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aftersales is covered by a three-year/100 000km warranty and a two-year/30 000km service plan on all three versions . <p> STODGY HANDLING <p> All Mirages come with drum brakes at the back but ABS with EBD is standard . Two airbags are also included in the deal , but I reckon Mitsubishi could further develop safety if it addressed handling issues . The Mirage bobbles uneasily over the smallest of road ripples and it feels top heavy in corners . This , combined with overly-assisted electric steering which wanders numbly at all times , makes for a very skittish package -- and there 's no stability control on board to bail you out of trouble if it arises . <p> VERDICT <p> South African budget hatch buyers are completely spoiled for choice , with around 25 models totalling over 70 derivatives all coming in under the R150 000 mark .

Their interest is long term . Racehorses and racing are not toys that you grow tired of after the novelty of owning them has worn off . Their advisors know their business backwards .

@@2760233 <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the message we 've been getting since the recent downgrading of the big four banks . Economists and other pundits are saying we should all take a chill pill : our money is safe . The Reserve Bank says so , too . Our banks are robust ; Moody 's rating agency has overreacted to the collapse of African Bank ( or " bail-in " , which is the favoured euphemism ) . One commentator has even proffered that rating agencies should be rebranded " reaction agencies " . <p> That 's all very well , but if you 're an investor who has lost money , the only pill you 're swallowing right now is a bitter one . <p> And if you 're one of African Bank 's over-indebted borrowers , you wo n't be feeling warm and fuzzy about your bank . In fact , no matter where you bank , you could well be feeling a little blue about how this story is playing out . <p> Can you put your faith in the banks ? If you 're a borrower , I 'm not sure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tipped off about a case of reckless lending at African Bank . We verified it and sought comment from African Bank . The bank responded , claiming the " allegation " related to " an isolated case of agents fraudulently manipulating the system at a single branch " . Bank staff received illicit payments from customers to secure their loans , they said . The capital value of the loans -- about 700 of them -- was R15.5 million . <p> The National Credit Regulator ( NCR ) called for a fine of R300 million for reckless lending . But African Bank denied it was a case of reckless lending . It claimed that customers had pretty much bribed bank staff to approve their loan applications . For a charge of reckless lending to stick , the borrower must be innocent . If you lie or understate your expenses , you 're guilty of reckless borrowing . <p> Hours after receiving African Bank 's response to our questions , my phone was ringing off the hook . The NCR wanted us to pull the story ; so too did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would create panic , they said . Then we got a call from National Treasury , fishing for information . <p> It was all very strange . The credit regulator had confirmed the story , but the regulator of banks was n't happy , which made the credit regulator jumpy , and both were telling us it was n't a story . <p> It seems that a market conduct regulator ( NCR ) working in conjunction with a prudential regulator ( the Reserve Bank ) is problematic given the interests that each serves . <p> Hours later , and before we published , African Bank posted a statement on the JSE 's news service saying it was being investigated and there was a call for a R300-million fine . With the news , the bank 's shares fell just over six percent . <p> The story blew over , the share recovered , and eight months later a settlement was reached between the bank and the NCR . The bank would pay a R20-million fine and the case against it would be withdrawn . Meaning , no finding of reckless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrist . If anyone got " slapped " in that bout it was the credit regulator . <p> This week , it was announced that the Reserve Bank is to investigate African Bank . It will seek to determine whether " any business of African Bank was conducted recklessly , negligently or with the intent to defraud depositors " . It will also probe any " questionable management practices or material nondisclosures , with the intent to defraud depositors " . <p> Emphasis on depositors . But what about borrowers ? <p> The Reserve Bank 's enquiry is limited to depositors and their interests . Reckless lending , as defined in the National Credit Act ( NCA ) , does not fall within the Reserve Bank 's scope . That is the NCR 's domain . <p> In terms of the National Credit Amendment Act , the NCR has the power to bring charges of reckless lending against an errant credit provider . So why has n't it launched an investigation ? <p> " It 's such an easy audit to do , " says one expert . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of Abil 's borrowers . Were any of them in default at the time of being granted credit ? Because if they could n't pay their debts , it would be prima facie reckless to extend more credit to them . " <p> The NCA says the credit provider must check your debt repayment history . And if you 're in arrears , you ca n't afford more credit . Simple . <p> It has been suggested that African Bank was masking the non-payment of loans by granting consolidation loans . In other words , the consumer has multiple loans that he 's not servicing . So the credit provider gives him one big loan to pay off all the small ones ( owed to self-same credit provider ) , and that masks the consumer 's non-payment on the bank 's books . But the record of non-payment remains on the consumer 's credit record . Which is why it 's strange that an investigation into reckless lending has n't been launched . <p> What about the other banks ?

Some of them are now heavily over-indebted and facing foreclosure . <p> Consumers have made serious allegations and reported these to the NCR : bad credit records , understated expenses , overstated income -- all pointing to reckless lending . <p> Then there is the fact that the country 's biggest vehicle financier saw the patent flaws in the Satinsky deal , yet its competitors took no heed . Should n't Wesbank 's refusal to do business with Satinsky have been a big red warning light for Absa , Nedbank and Standard Bank ?

@@2764239 <p> With the long wait until the RPGs I 'm really excited to play , Risen 3 could have been the perfect filler game . It boasts large environments , nuanced character upgrades and plenty of side and story missions . Unfortunately , it simply does n't work as a game . <p> Risen 3 explores the story of an intrepid pirate who is killed by a Shadow Lord and returns as a spirit-less version of himself . I 'm not entirely clear on the value of a spirit -- it seems to just mean that he was lacking in health and ability , but he can carry on without a spirit with relative ease . <p> Of course , the goal of the game is to regain your soul and take down the evil titan lords who caused these problems to begin with . Not the most innovative story , but it could have worked . The characters are extremely poorly designed , relying almost entirely on such tired stereotypes as the sexy female pirate ( who is also your sister ) and the darker-skinned voodoo companion . <p> The first glaring issue with the game are the shoddy graphics . Based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that it is aiming to be a gorgeous game . There are carefully created waves on the ocean and plenty of detailed aspects of the environment . Unfortunately , the textures are so poor with so many glitches and clipping issues that the whole game looks quite laughable . I had times when my companion was glitched into a mountain while fighting , and when I entered one house the carpet would disappear and reappear in pieces , even when my character was stationary . <p> Just as the visual textures are intangible at the best of times , the sounds also contribute to the negative gameplay experience . While exploring the world , you can find mining nodes . However , despite excellent animation to show the mining , the sound effect is similar to that of tapping your finger on a pile of papers . Nothing has any substance in the game , whether it 's the pickaxe for mining or the sword you swing . Even the voice acting is cringe-worthy . <p> Speaking of swinging the sword , I found the combat to be just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . It is slow and unresponsive , something that becomes even more aggravating when certain bosses have minuscule windows of opportunity for attacks . Even worse were the controls for naval combat . I literally threw my controller during one section of the game which involved aiming a cannon from your ship to kill off all the enemy sailors . Aiming and shooting was done with the right bumper and A button , while taking cover made use of the right trigger . This meant that every time I attempted to fire on the enemy , I accidentally took cover instead . It was as though they did n't make use of any play testers before shipping the game . <p> Despite the appallingly bad glitches and bizarrely horrendous controls , Risen 3 does show some elements of excellent RPG gameplay . As you kill creatures and complete quests , you gain glory which works like experience . You spend your glory on attribute points to improve your character 's various abilities such as melee or dexterity . On each island you will also find NPCs who can teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then can help you improve your persuasion or lock picking . It 's a nicely executed system and helps players pursue a play style that matches their personal preferences . <p> Once you align with a particular group , players also gain those new abilities . However , while you can only align with one guild , you can still make use of various abilities . Spells can either be learned , or spell scrolls can be bought/found . In one particularly difficult battle , I found that I was benefitted by combining my Demon Hunter abilities with some Voodoo magic to maximize my damage . This approach to combat and magic was a lot of fun to experiment with and probably the most enjoyable part of the game . <p> Unfortunately , your companions are n't nearly as interesting or customizable . Throughout your journey , players encounter a variety of characters who can be recruited to join your crew . Unfortunately , they are almost devoid of personality , have some atrocious AI in combat and are n't customizable . This meant that at the game 's start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but by the end the companions had become irrelevant to the point that I 'd often forget to take them with me when I ventured into a new area . <p> Risen 3 takes place on seven islands , with extensive load times when you travel between them . While the size of the islands vary , most are large enough to make exploration relatively enjoyable , with plenty of side missions to keep you busy in between chasing down the main story quests . The game makes use of teleportation platforms that require a specific stone to active , enabling future fast travel . However , thanks to the layout of the islands , I often found that I was running through the same few areas more often than I would have liked and the lack of underground mapping made subterranean exploration feel like an unforgiving combination of guess work and intuition with minimal reward . <p> Despite only running about 25 hours in gameplay , Risen 3 took me much longer to complete thanks to glitches , memory leaks and complete crashes . The game would often lag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut down the console and restart just to continue . The framerate drops dramatically at times and I learned that avoiding contact with multiple enemies at once was n't just an issue thanks to the horrible combat , but also because the system could n't handle it and would crash or slow to a crawl . <h> Share this : <h> Conclusion <p> Despite some excellent moments , Risen 3 reaches too far and falls short . Glitchy and clunky design will undermine even the most ardent RPG fans hopes of enjoying this game . You 're better off waiting for the games you actually want to play . <p> 5.0 <p> Risen 3 : Titan Lords was reviewed by Zoe Hawkins on a Xbox 360 <h> In this article <p> Wielding my lasso of truth , I am the combination of nerd passion and grammar nazi .

@@2767235 <h> Product placement should n't irk viewers <p> Advertising has made its way into programming on television but in some cases it has become too obvious and disconcerting . <p> " The Ariel product placement is about as subtle as Enrique Iglesias 's mole , " tweeted an irate Come Dine With Me South Africa viewer about the detergent range 's blatant advertising during the show . <p> The first two seasons of the South African iteration of the popular British cooking show were sponsored by Pick n Pay , a collaboration that allowed the supermarket 's products to fit seamlessly into the programme . <p> But then Ariel backed the third season and its products kept appearing in obvious and unlikely places throughout the show . This drove viewers to social media to complain about what they considered an over-commercialisation of the programme . <p> Joel Churcher , BBC Worldwide 's vice president and general manager for Africa , says that the show 's ratings were " not at all " affected by Ariel 's product placement and that the broadcaster in fact received very few complaints about it . The reason that the show was scrapped after the third season , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is fast-paced and our plan is to consistently surprise our audience with fresh , innovative and entertaining formats " . <p> Whatever the reason , tweets about Iglesias 's mole and others like it show how social media has flattened the unofficial rules that govern product placement on television . In the new arm 's length relationship that brands now have with consumers , audiences can be as vocal as they want to be when they are dissatisfied with advertising . <p> Fahmeeda Cassim-Surtee , DStv 's sales and marketing director , says social media may have become a loudhailer that empowers consumers , but it also means that brands have to be more careful with what they offer and what their products deliver . <p> " If product placement seems too obvious and irrelevant , there will be criticism . The responsibility around this sits with the brand , the content producer and the broadcaster . But it often has the biggest backlash against the brand , " says Cassim-Surtee . <p> A website called brandspotters.com aggregates such scathing tweets about product placement in movies , series and soapies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under local soapies Generations , Isidingo and Muvhango , all of which are broadcast on SABC channels . <p> When asked about the perceived over-commercialisation of shows like Generations , Tshifhiwa Mulaudzi , the general manager of SABC 's television sales , says that for a programme which attracts up to eight million viewers every night , Generations does not suffer from excessive product placement . <p> " Generations is the most-watched programme on the free-to-air and paid-for platform . It 's actually not over-commercialised ; it 's under-commercialised . We have been very careful with the extent to which we do product placement there , " says Mulaudzi . <p> Mulaudzi says that the SABC goes to great pains to make sure that its product placement -- which makes up roughly 20-25% of the broadcaster 's advertising revenue -- is not intrusive and does not irritate viewers . <p> " You 've got to be considerate of the type of genre and the type of brand you believe can live in that environment . If you just do it recklessly , it becomes a Christmas tree , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to make a lot of money by selling our channels ' platforms , we have to be considerate of viewers at home , " says Mulaudzi . <p> The SABC has also had to deal with a backlash from some of their on-air talent . Recently , Don Mlangeni-Nawa who has played Zebedee Matabane in Isidingo for 15 years , was brought before a disciplinary hearing after refusing to endorse a particular bank in his lines . <p> Mulaudzi did not want to comment on Mlangeni-Nawa 's specific incident , but instead said that he would like to see South African television business models work more like those in Hollywood . <p> LA Screenings is an annual event held in Los Angeles where television programme buyers and potential advertisers from around the world meet up to view prime time pilots for US television 's next season . Mulaudzi says actors are also present at these screenings to interact with prospective clients because they understand the importance of cultivating such relationship with advertisers . <p> In South Africa , however , the business model works differently . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce content and license it to networks . Here , it 's the other way around . Media owners actually give a brief of what they want and production companies pitch for business . In other markets , you license that content for that period . It can also be broadcast on your competitor 's network , " says Mulaudzi . <p> Another thing that international markets have that the South African television industry does n't , is legislation that governs precisely how product placement should be done . <p> Product placement was allowed for the first time on United Kingdom television in 2011 , but only under strict conditions regulated by the independent competition authority , Ofcom . Under these regulations , there must be " editorial justification " for a product to be placed in a programme , which means that it must fit in effortlessly with the show 's content . Content may also not be shaped around product placement . According to Ofcom , products also should n't receive too much prominence on programmes and it should n't feel like they are deliberately being promoted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the TV channel must show a special logo indicating such . <p> Cassim-Surtee says that DStv represents channels that abide by Ofcom regulations , so this is already something to which the television service adheres . <p> " Our rights deals around shows that are international formats also preclude us from manipulating how the content can be delivered . There are already rules around what can and can not be done , " she says . <p> Mulaudzi says that while South African television is to a certain extent regulated by the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa ( Icasa ) , he believes in self-regulation . <p> " I have to be mindful that I work for the SABC and our job is to inform , educate and entertain . I have to always take into account our reason to exist . We are a public broadcaster and there is that public service at the back of my mind all the time , " he says . <p> Bruce Williamson , the managing director of Universal McCann ( UM ) in Johannesburg , says that he does n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Ultimately viewers will decide with their eyeballs . When a show becomes overtly contrived , viewers look elsewhere , ratings are lost and the value of attaching one 's brand to these shows is diminished . With the onset of digital terrestrial television , there will be a lot more choice for viewers , which will make them more fickle about what they watch , " says Williamson . <p> " The best instances are where the product placement actually enhances the viewing experience . People watch television for entertainment , not to be marketed to . " <p> This story was first published in the August 2014 issue of The Media magazine .

@@2781240 a promised lifeline to struggling power utility Eskom , announcing a bail-out package aimed at plugging its R225-billion funding gap and helping it get back to financial sustainability . <p> Experts have already warned however that the plan -- which includes unspecified additional funding -- raises the risk of further credit rating downgrades for the government . <p> The rescue plan comes as Eskom continues to face serious operational challenges , heightening the risk of more load shedding for consumers . <p> On Sunday , the national treasury announced in a statement that the plan was aimed at helping to " relieve the impact on electricity consumers , as well as add additional support to Eskom 's balance sheet " . <p> It will include government support for regulatory tariff adjustments and further funding for the state-owned supplier , with the amount to be announced at October 's medium-term budget policy statement . <p> The equity injection will come from " leveraging non-strategic government assets " -- suggesting possible privatisation -- with further detail to be revealed at the budget announcement . <p> Eskom will also raise additional debt of R50-billion , over and above the R200-billion earmarked for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do have a negative impact on Eskom 's balance sheet , it is necessary to reduce the immediate impact on electricity consumers , " said the statement . <p> Eskom has existing government guarantees of R350-billion , of which it has only drawn R122-billion . The treasury said the guarantees will be used to reduce Eskom 's debt costs but stressed it needed to manage costs and raise sufficient revenue to cover these . <p> ' Negative for balance sheet'Other elements of the package include accelerating electricity demand management measures that do not undermine economic growth ; supporting the growth of independent power producers and a drive to improve operational efficiency . <p> " Eskom will need to improve the efficiency of its operations through more effective maintenance of existing power stations , limiting cost over-runs in the new build programme , improving procurement outcomes and management of working capital , " the treasury said . <p> Razia Khan , head for Africa macro research at Standard Chartered , said it was " something of a foregone conclusion that the state would provide Eskom the necessary support " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clarified , the mention of leveraging non-strategic asset did hint at " potential privatisation of some state assets , " she said in a research note . <p> Ratings agencies would likely view the plan as a " negative for the balance sheet of the South African government , " Khan said . <p> " With South Africa 's rating already threatened by its weak growth outlook , and an almost-across-the-board deterioration in a number of credit metrics , the decision of cabinet to approve an equity injection for Eskom -- although expected -- adds to potential downgrade pressure . " <p> Eskom 's funding gap is partly driven by the company not generating enough revenue to cover the cost of supplying electricity , says the treasury . <p> It is currently building two mega coal power stations in a bid to boost capacity and avoid widespread blackouts . One of the plants , Medupi , was supposed to have come online by the end of last year but is running behind schedule as a result of labour disputes . <p> Supply challengesEskom 's operational challenges are as acute as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of keeping the lights on at the expense of maintenance , heightening the risk of load shedding for consumers . <p> Over two fifths of Eskom 's power generating plants are in disrepair and urgently need maintenance to bring it back to adequate performance levels . <p> Of Eskom 's 87 coal-fired generation units -- six are typically located at each power station -- 36 are in urgent need of maintenance , according to Eskom spokesperson Andrew Etzinger . <p> The backlog will take at least two years to eliminate he said in an interview last week . In addition , it would take " a significant amount of capacity " from both the uncompleted Medupi and Kusile power stations , before the country had an adequate electricity reserve margin . <p> The previous strategy of deferring refurbishment in a bid to keep the lights on had caused a downward spiral , said Etzinger .

This reflected " an understanding of all stakeholders , including our shareholder , that keeping the lights on at all costs is just not sustainable " , he said . <p> As part of its new philosophy , Eskom has returned decentralised decision making to its power station managers .

In other words , the repair work that is needed , is often more than is initially expected or planned for . <p> Eskom did not have a " significant skills issue " he noted but it was working to make better use of the skills it already had . <p> He stressed these problems did not necessarily translate into load shedding which was also influenced by demand , planned maintenance and trips at power stations .

Photo : Thobile Mathonsi <h> Ex-judge in bid to halt JSC probe <p> Pretoria - Controvertial former North Gauteng High Court Judge Ntsikelelo Poswa has turned to the court in an attempt to stop the Judicial Service Commission ( JSC ) from going ahead with a tribunal to investigate complaints of impeachable misconduct against him . <p> In his application before a full Bench ( three judges ) , counsel for Judge Poswa said they wanted the JSC barred from ever " going after him " . <p> This is apart from asking the court to review the decision by the JSC to investigate complaints placed before it in January 2009 by former Pretoria judge president Bernard Ngoepe . The complaints relate to five outstanding judgments which were not delivered by Judge Poswa at the time . The majority of the judgments were outstanding for about a year . In one case Judge Poswa did deliver an order , but gave no reasons for his conclusion . <p> The litigants laid complaints with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the JSC , which decided to set up a judicial conduct tribunal . <p> Judge Poswa was only one of several judges against whom complaints were laid about outstanding judgments . <p> Judge Poswa , who will be 75 in a few weeks ' time , has been medically discharged because of ill health . <p> The main thrust of the objection against the pending investigation of his conduct is that the JSC is acting in terms of its new rules - which came into effect in 2010 . <p> His advocate , Selby Mbenenge SC , said as the charges were laid in 2009 , the old act should be applicable . The JSC was , in terms of the old act , not empowered to set up a conduct tribunal to investigate a judge , he said . He also objected to technical aspects of the complaints laid , stating that it was not done in the accepted format . <p> Mbenenge told the court that in any event , as things stood today , Judge Poswa had delivered all his outstanding judgments , bar one .

The judges hearing Monday 's application on several occasions said that at the time the tribunal was set up , the judgments were long outstanding . Some dated back as far as 2006 when he was still active on the Bench . <p> They said the case before them now was to decide on whether to set aside the JSC 's decision to investigate Judge Poswa and not to determine whether he was guilty of any wrongdoing over the judgments . <p> Mbenenge said ill health also hampered his client in concluding his judgments . This caused Judge Claasen to question how he was able to then prepare " volumes and volumes " of affidavits and statements in launching this application . <p> Judge Kgomo wanted to know whether Judge Poswa , when he first appeared before the JSC , told it that he was " incapable " of writing any judgments . " What is the duty of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to then deliver a judgment , " Judge Kgomo said . Judge Claasen questioned what counsel for the judge wanted to happen with the complaints . " It will be dealt with , one way or another , " he said . But Mbenenge was adamant that under the new dispensation , the JSC could not investigate the judge . <p> Judgment was reserved . <p> Earlier , Judge Poswa made headlines when he questioned a paternity test which revealed with 99.99 percent certainty that he was the father of a child , conceived with his former lover . He said there was a 0.01 percent chance he was n't the father .

@@2784236 <p> Violent crimes against farm dwellers , and in particular such crimes committed against farmers and their families , is a relative recent phenomena since unionisation in 1910 . Prior to 1986 , very little recorded evidence of noteworthy occurrence of violent crimes on farms and agricultural smallholdings exists . The prominence thereof , is obvious since the middle eighties and continues to this day . <p> The content of this submission is based on the following : <p> Professional experiences as a SADF / SANDF member 1966 - 2002 . The following appointments in particular demanded a direct involvement in Rural Safety : <p> General officer Commanding Western Province Command , 1 February 1997 - 18 November 1999 , General Officer Commanding Regional Joint Task Force West , 20 November 1999 - 31 July 2003 . In both the capacities the undersigned acted first as co-chairperson of the Western Cape Provincial Operational Coordinating Committee and for the latter part as GOC RJTF West , not only as co-chairperson for the Western Cape POCOC , but also for the Northern Cape POCOC . <p> Experience as senior management member of TAU SA , specialising in Rural Safety , August 2003 to date . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Priority Committee for Rural Safety . <p> Aim . This submission aims to highlight violent crimes against farm dwellers , also referred to as " Farm Attacks " and to offer evidence which will illuminate the development thereof to the present day . <p> HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENTS <p> The occurrence of violent crime against farm dwellers rose to levels causing concern in the latter half of the eighties . At that stage the liberation struggle in the Republic of South Africa well within the country 's borders , followed a pattern similar to what was experienced in the erstwhile Rhodesia and SWA / Namibia where very little , if any , distinction between military targets and so-called " soft targets " was made . <p> Whereas attacks by insurgents armed with small arms occurred , the indiscriminate use of land mines on dirt roads frequented by farmers also became evident claiming the lives of innocent farm workers . In fact , the first victim who died as a result of a land mine explosion , was Jas Balie ( 25 ) , a black tractor driver who was killed on 27 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in South Africa on 26 November 1985 during which Edward Meluba who was a passenger in the vehicle , died a few days later . <p> In tracing evidential indicators as to what triggered and elevated farmers to the level where they were regarded as legitimate targets , two specific broadcasts by Radio Freedom dated respectively 26 February 1986 and 28 October 1986 were traced . These stated : <p> " Umkhonto we Sizwe is a revolutionary army and it is not about to embark on mayhem against whites , civilians , against children , but we are going to step up our attacks against enemy personnel . We are referring to the members of the police forces , to the members of the SADF , to those in the administration terrorising and harassing our people , to those farmers and other people who are part of the defence force of our country , of the military , para-military and reserves . " <p> " ........ farmers were not simply being targeted for their involvement in SADF structures but for racial and ideological reasons as well " . <p> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> RESPONSE BY GOVERNMENT <p> The unabated and escalating violence against farm dwellers continued beyond 1994 and available statistics indicate that there was a steady increase in both attacks and fatalities . This unacceptable state of affairs resulted in an urgent request by the then South African Agricultural Union in 1997 that government should address the situation as a matter of urgency . <p> In October 1997 , a comprehensive Rural Safety Strategy was jointly produced by the SA Police Service and the SA National Defence Force . This strategy utilised the resources of both departments , supported by the capabilities and capacities of other stake holders which were jointly integrated in joint operational structures which were responsible for the planning and execution of operations . The capacity available in the Commando system of the SANDF , augmented by SAPS resources , was primarily utilised to create a nation-wide presence in rural areas . The mere fact that Commando members were predominantly local residents who knew the area and who served on a voluntary basis without expecting compensation , was a huge advantage . <p> The late President Mandela convened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rural safety in general , but the occurrence of violent crimes against farm dwellers in particular , was discussed . This impetus impacted positively on the execution of the Rural Safety Strategy which was already in operation and resulted in the refinement of the system . <p> In the period immediately following the summit , it became apparent that the continuation of the problem necessitated the establishment of a National Priority Committee for Rural Safety . Both the SAPS and the SANDF were represented on this committee by senior officials whilst organised agriculture was also co-opted and thereafter regularly attended Priority Committee meetings . <p> In April 2001 , President Mbeki appointed a Committee of Inquiry , chaired by Advocate C.F. du Plessis and consisting of seven academics and researchers , to investigate farm attacks . Before the report was made public on 31 July 2003 , President Mbeki announced the closing down of the Commandos on 14 February 2003 . <p> The President 's announcement indicated furthermore that a new SAPS Sector Policing system would seamlessly be introduced to ensure the continuation of service delivery . Much emphasis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loss of human resources which was previously available from the ranks of the Commandos . <p> The findings of the Committee of Inquiry into Farm Attacks were made public on 31 July 2003 . <p> As a result of President Mbeki 's announcement , the military withdrew in a phased process from the internal security situation and in time the SAPS also took over the border protection duties of the SANDF . Whereas the Sector Policing system was well designed and implemented in an increasing number of metropolitan , peri-urban- and rural areas , to date the effective implementation thereof in agricultural areas leaves much to be desired . <p> During this process , valuable know-how and experience was lost with the disbandment of the commando system , as these persons in general did not continue serving under the SAPS command system by becoming reservists , due to the procedural requirements to be integrated into the SAPS . Very little progress was made with the recruitment of reservists which gradually led to a loss of interest . <p> DEFINITION OF A " FARM ATTACK " <p> The proliferation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected a wide variety of interpretations of exactly what constitutes a " farm attack " . For the purposes of this submission , the definition as utilised by the 2001 Committee of Inquiry into Farm Attacks , as well as the updated definition approved by the National priority Committee on Rural Safety is utilised for statistical purposes . <p> The 2001 definition is : <p> " Attacks on farms and smallholdings refer to acts aimed at the person of residents , workers and visitors to farms and smallholdings , whether with the intent to murder , rape , rob or inflict bodily harm . In addition , all actions aimed at disrupting farming activities as a commercial concern , whether for motives related to ideology , labour disputes , land issues , revenge , grievances , racist concerns or intimidation , should be included . Cases related to domestic violence , drunkenness , or resulting from commonplace social interaction between people are excluded from this definition " <p> The later definition is : <p> " Acts of violence against farms and smallholdings are those acts aimed at any person or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallholdings with the intent to either murder , rape , rob or otherwise inflict bodily harm or to intimidate . <p> For statistical purposes the following crimes are listed as specific acts which constitute violence against farms and smallholdings : <p> Direct acts against the person / victim(s) <p> Murder <p> Attempted murder <p> Rape <p> Assault GBH <p> Robbery <p> Armed robbery ( including vehicle hijackings ) <p> Indirect acts <p> Intimidation <p> Arson <p> Malicious damage to property <p> The monitoring of these acts of violence resulted from discussions between Government and Organised Agriculture and the recognition by Government that this type of violence poses a specific crime threat which requires specific attention . <p> Cases related to domestic violence , drunkenness or commonplace social interaction between people on farms and smallholdings are excluded from this definition . ( Such cases have to be attended to by the police as part of normal policing ) <p> It is important to determine as accurately as possible the motive behind these acts of violence . Special attention should be paid to determine whether those are aimed at disrupting the commercial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political , ideological or racist considerations , or whether labour and land disputes , revenge or any other reason are involved . <p> Note : In the absence of formal definitions of what constitutes a " farm " and what a " smallholding " , the so-called Thursday Committee ( a sub-committee of the Priority Committee on Rural Safety which meets on Thursdays to evaluate all reports of violence against farms and smallholdings ) is totally dependent on the information provided by the Provincial , area and station offices to determine whether the premises on which an act was perpetrated are to be classified as either a farm or a smallholding . This distinction is also necessary for the separation of statistics pertaining to acts of violence against farms and smallholdings . " <p> These definitions are applied as the standard to determine what qualifies as a ' farm attack " as reflected within the TAU SA data base and what is to be excluded . <p> TAU SA STATISTICAL DATA 1990 - 2014 <p> The TAU SA data base was established after statistics specifically pertaining to farm attacks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2006 / 2007 and thereafter . TAU SA is dependent on the reports from its structures in the various provinces , media reports as well as other data bases in the social media to compile its own statistics . The publication of the book " Land of Sorrows " in 2011 was also jointly utilised by TAU SA and Solidarity to invite the public to report cases of farm attacks not reflected in the publication . <p> New cases of confirmed incidents were included in a second edition published in 2012 . Whilst it is acknowledged that not all cases of violent crimes on farms are included , the cases reflected therein represent a conservative confirmed record of crimes meeting the definition and subsequently confirmed . It is also submitted that the number of non-fatal attacks in particular , should be regarded as extremely conservative because not all cases of attempted murder , assault to do grievous bodily harm , rape and common assault are reported in the media unless the injuries were considered to be extremely serious or the victim was a well-known personality . <p> A total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 September 2014 are reflected in the TAU SA data base . It should also be noted that after a peak in reported murders during 2004 ( 115 ) the situation has stabilised at a still-unacceptable level of an average of 62 murders annually . <p> The statistical record for Farm Attacks from January 1990 to 15 September 2014 is reflected in Appendix A. <p> ANALYSIS OF VICTIMS <p> The requirement to determine the status and occupation of victims led TAU SA to undertake an analysis of those murdered . Considering the apparent perception that TAU SA is primarily interested in the lot of victims from European ( white ) origin , the broad classification of " race " was included to enable a proper interpretation of the results . <p> The analysis of murdered victims is reflected in Appendix B. <p> Based on this analysis and other available statistics , Dr Johan Burger from the Institute for Security Studies concluded the following comparative ratios based on the universal practice to base such ratios on the 100,000 base line for 2012 / 2013 : <p> National murder average in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farmers murdered : 132,8 <p> PRIME TARGET AREAS <p> Based on the available statistics , the priority target areas are the following : <p> Gauteng Province - Murders 382 / Attacks 698 / Total 1080 <p> Mpumalanga Province - Murders 239 / Attacks 646 / Total 885 <p> Northwest Province - Murders 251 / Attacks 573 / Total 824 <p> Limpopo - Murders 184 / Attacks 391 / Total 575 <p> It is equally noticeable that in comparison the high levels of violent crime on farms and agricultural smallholdings in the Northern provinces , the situation in the Western- and Northern Cape Provinces is comparatively less violent . <p> It is equally noticeable that in the targeted provinces , a comparison between the occurrences of farm attacks over a three year period reflects a pattern which may indicate that as wide a geographical area as possible is evidently covered in order to deliberately create a perception within the farming community that a much bigger target area is threatened . An example of this is reflected in a map plot of Gauteng Province indicating the incidents ( attacks and murders ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is equally noticeable that farming areas where an effective safety- and security capability exists either in the form of a security company or a farm watch , are avoided by criminals and the prevalence of violent crime is noticeably lower compared to other areas . <p> POORLY REPORTED CRIMES <p> A number of other crimes committed on farms and agricultural small holdings relevant to the current situation are vastly underreported primarily because such complaints are not regarded as serious by the SAPS . These include the following : <p> Arson ( even though it is included in the current definition and causes extremely serious and wide-spread danger to life and damage to livestock , crops and property ) <p> Malicious Damage to Property <p> Trespassing . <p> Illegal hunting . <p> Stray dogs . <p> The fact that these issues , which could be underlying causes for conflict which may result in more serious consequences , are often either ignored , rejected or underestimated by the authorities ( including the police ) as to the damage which could be caused by unanticipated outcomes . It has repeatedly been stated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the cause of retribution against the farmer . This motive has not been validated and therefore demands due consideration and correction . <p> RESPONSE TO SPECIFIC ISSUES RAISED BY THE HRC <p> " What is your experience in relation to violence committed against farm owners as well as against farm workers ? " <p> The TAU SA analysis of its data base confirms that irrespective of race in comparison to farmers , far less farm workers are victims of violent crimes . What also needs to be recorded is the abnormal high level of brutality during attacks , which is a major concern . <p> In a significant number instances , the perpetrator is known to the victim . <p> Repeated accusations in the past forthcoming from ministerial level as well as from state departments , made mention of a variety of crimes ranging from murder to illegal evictions committed against farm workers . Despite repeated efforts to substantiate such accusations , very little factual confirmation was forthcoming . Isolated cases are highlighted to deliberately create the perception that such practices are widespread . <p> " Would you estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or criminally motivated , or both ? " <p> Very little , if any , evidence exists of whites being the perpetrators of farm attacks . In the same breath , the vast majority of victims are white whilst the overwhelming number of those committing the crimes are black . The obvious racial composition of the two groups conveys a message in itself which leaves very little space for other arguments other than in the case of farm attacks that racial bias ( which could be interpreted as hatred ) is prevalent . This is furthermore supported by reported racist utterances by the criminals addressing their victims as " white pig " , " white bitch " and " dog " , etc . <p> It needs to be pointed out , however , that in the Summary of the Report , the Committee of Inquiry found that the degree of violence and cruelty present during farm attacks was exceedingly high and most state advocates attributed this extreme violence to racial hatred . There is no recent evidence contradicting this finding . ( Page 428 ) <p> The level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) counters the popular statement that the motive for the crime is common assault , robbery or theft . In most cases , there is little resemblance of an acceptable relationship between the level of violence used against the victims and the superficial motive for the crime . A formal request to the National Priority Committee on Rural Safety to include the possibility of " muti " or the role of " traditional healers " ( which played a role in the Marikana incident ) in the investigation of serious violent crime produced no results other than an uncomfortable silence after the request was tabled . <p> A case in point is the recent murder of Mr and Mrs Lens of the farm Elim in the Groenvlei district . Both unarmed victims were killed " execution style " by being shot in the back of the head at close range . A summarised report of the incident ( Groenvlei CAS 2/09/2014 ) is attached as Appendix D. What is disturbing , is the fact that the late Mr Lens formally reported a threat by a farm dweller to kill him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatsoever was taken . ( Should it be required , an affidavit of an eye witness on the scene shortly after the crime was committed , can be obtained and submitted . ) Similar detail is available in the book " Land of Sorrows " - a copy of which could be provided on request . <p> It can not be argued that the perceived motives for violent crimes on farms and smallholdings are not related to the robbery / theft of firearms , cash or other valuables , but irrespective of the application of the 2011 Rural Safety Strategy and the ( theoretical ) priority thereof , little seems to have changed and the level of brutal assault and murder remains at the post 2004 average . At the same time , the number of farmers is declining . <p> The extreme level of unemployment causes the unemployed to regard the farm dweller as an easy target due to remoteness and distance from immediate support in the case of being attacked . <p> The comment begs to be made that during the duration of the 2010 Soccer World Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were recorded and not a single murder took place during the six week period before and after the event . No sooner had the last foreign visitors left , when the familiar pattern of farm attacks resumed . <p> " What is your experience relating to living conditions and labour practices employed on farms ? " <p> Within the ranks of organised agriculture , the conformation with legal requirements pertaining to labour and providing proper housing , is generally accepted and applied . A recent statement by the Department of Labour confirmed that the vast majority of commercial farmers comply with the letter of the law . <p> It should be borne in mind that no standard exists to define " proper housing " on farms . Such structures are constructed at the cost to the farmer . In this regard the cumulative implications of ESTA , and the fact that many farm dwellers are in fact no longer in the employ of the farmer , but remain entitled to the houses which were occupied during their service . Additional houses therefore require to be constructed when new workers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector of the national economy where continued security of tenure is legally enforced . Not only does this create strained relations between the landowner and people not in his employ , but it gradually erodes the property to which he is entitled . <p> Compared to other job seekers and employees , farm workers are far better off than many people doomed to a sub-standard RDP house far removed from the workplace which in itself creates additional expenditure in the form of transport costs . <p> With the exception of large commercial agricultural enterprises who can afford the services of security companies , the vast majority of farmers in rural areas are unable to do so . This is primarily due to the fact that the time and distance factor in outlying areas in relation to the potential number of clients considerably adds to the cost of service when compared to the same in high density urban areas . This situation is exacerbated due to the significant number of absent- and part-time farmers who have little concern for the safety and well-being of the wider community within which their properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies active in providing safety and security services to the farming community . Such enterprises are legally bound to be accredited to PSIRA and as such subject to regular inspections and control measures . In this regard they have no option than to be legally compliant . <p> " In your experience , has the service delivery offered by the South African Police Service improved since the last hearing was held by the Commission in 2008 ? " <p> Based on the continued levels of violent crime as reflected in the database of TAU SA , the nett effect of service delivery has not improved . In this regard the question whether SAPS members at station level realise that violent crimes on farms ( irrespective of who the victims might be ) should be treated as a priority , could well be raised . Too many reports are forthcoming of SAPS members either being unwilling to register complaints or to respond to such complaints within an acceptable time and manner . <p> Furthermore it seems as if too many priority crimes ( rural safety , rhino poaching , precious metals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , elections , etc. ) and insufficient resources to address the challenges and obligations result in no priority being treated like a priority . <p> Delays experienced with the SAPS Reservist Policy contributed to the creation of a void which had a detrimental effect on rural safety ( and probably on other areas of policing as well ) . The lack of funds results in a shortage of critical equipment such as firearms , radios , bullet proof vests , handcuffs , torches , etc. as well as functional training in disciplines required within the rural safety environment . The latter applies in particular to the protection of crime scenes before forensic evidence has been collected . <p> A major communication challenge exists between farmers and SAPS members unable to communicate effectively and clearly ( especially in emergencies ) with each other when they are both used to mother tongues not understood by the other . The assumption that all are fluent in a common language is removed from reality . No progress in this regard has been made . <p> Rather than regarding Farm Watches as beneficial to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm safety is concerned , there is a perceived and unnecessary suspicion amongst some officials which prevents co-operation , creates friction and thus neutralises efficiency . <p> A belief exists within the farming community that pre-emptive action based on crime intelligence , which could have prevented murder and serious injury , does not exist , irrespective of the community 's willingness to report situations which could escalate to violent crime . In fact , it is seriously questioned whether the police are capable of generating timely intelligence aimed at crime prevention in all aspects related to crime on farms . <p> The original focus of prioritising and preventing farm attacks was lost within the wider spectrum of " rural crime " occurring within the bigger rural community and which could include many transgressions of the law not specifically contained in the initial and subsequent definition of a " farm attack " . Resources , already unable to cope with policing the rural area at large is therefore further watered down having to attend to social crimes which are not regarded as having " priority " status . <p> The distance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene of the incident , is generally significant and is a major constraint to react to a reported incidence . Furthermore , poor maintenance of gravel roads , affects the time to respond as well as availability of serviceable vehicles . <p> " What strategies could be implemented to improve the effectiveness of rural safety plans and overall sector policing strategies ? " <p> Clear and unambiguous political condemnation of farm attacks by the President and cabinet ministers , in the same vein as similar condemnations of SAPS members murdered in the execution of their duties is urgently and consistently required . Their obvious silence in this regard could be interpreted as non-verbal approval thereof thus resulting in a continuation of murder and mutilation . In the minds of some , the 1986 declaration of farmers as " legitimate targets " may still be in force . <p> The protection of isolated and vulnerable farmers and farm dwellers and the rural economy in general should be regarded as a national- and strategic imperative to ensure food security . <p> In essence the recognition of farm related violent crimes and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strategy will go a long way to improve the current situation . <p> The current situation could be improved by the following additional considerations : <p> Redefining the issue of " Rural Safety " to ensure alignment with the original intention of focussing on farm attacks and agriculture-related crime . <p> Ensuring that sufficient resources ( both of the human and logistical kind ) are allocated to servicing the core of the priority . <p> A higher degree of sensitivity regarding the " land issue " which is causing tremendous uncertainty in certain quarters is required . Irrespective of formal policy developments , ideological utterances from political and extra-parliamentary groups which implies totally unacceptable repercussions perceptually based on restitution , security of tenure , etc. could create an explosive situation should land- and farm occupations and threats against legal land- and property owners materialise in the absence of statutory protection of law-abiding citizens . <p> The introduction of a decentralised crime intelligence capability to service and support the Rural Crime functionaries . <p> Greater emphasis on the combatting of so-called less serious crimes such as arson , malicious damage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time being supportive of landowners protecting their property and livelihood against these crimes . <p> The necessity to rely on security measures specifically catering for isolated and vulnerable people beyond the rapid response of the nearest police presence , require due consideration of the possibility to subsidise the acquisitioning of related alarm- and security systems as well as appropriate firearms suitable for self-defence against criminals often armed with semi-automatic weapons . <p> Whilst this input is provided from an agriculture perspective , the need for public policing of both formal- and informal settlements in rural areas should also be emphasised . In many cases criminally orientated and unemployed persons create a potential criminal presence which could spill over to farms and agricultural holdings . <p> Increased visibility of crime prevention authorities through all hours of the day . This necessitates that arrangements and structures to be in place to allow local inhabitants to participate in these actions thus enhancing capacity . <p> At national level , government needs to ensure policies are in place to allow society , which includes the agricultural sector , to flourish economically thus creating an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence of official sources of public standing and the half-hearted implementation of the Rural Safety Strategy reinforces the perception within the farming community that they continue to be regarded as " legitimate targets " undeserving of due consideration and proper protection . In doing so , the " Us " and " Them " attitude resulting from the liberation struggle is still prevalent . Not a single denouncement from a national ministerial level can be recalled . Surely , 20 years down the line after the 1994 watershed , the critically important role of the farming community in the South African economy deserves unqualified support . <p> The question may well be posed - If we accept that the 2003 Report on this matter , augmented by the 2008 Progress Report made sufficient provision for the combatting of farm attacks , and had the 2003 Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Farm Attacks been properly implemented , how many lives and suffering might have been saved ? What we fail to address , we fail to solve and improve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@2790232 <h> By Alec Fenn <p> COMMENT : The Dane has become better known for his endless sound bites than his ability in front of goal and must now produce the goods for Wolfsburg or face an uncertain future <p> It 's been five years since Nicklas Bendtner gave an interview he should but probably does n't regret . <p> " Within the next five years I want to be the top goalscorer in the Premier League and known as a world-class striker , " he said back in 2009 . <p> He was 22 at the time - young , but certainly not short on confidence . <p> At the same time most young men of the same age are plotting escape routes out of their overdrafts , the Bendtner myth was already well established . <p> A year earlier , the former Arsenal man was involved in a famous on-field bust-up with strike partner Emmanuel Adebayor during a Carling Cup tie against north London rivals Tottenham . <p> Off the field , he had already succeeded in charming the 34-year-old Baroness Caroline Luel-Brockdorff , a member of the Danish royal family and a millionaire in her own right . <p> However , Bendtner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and five years on his own lofty predictions have fallen some way short of reality . <p> On Thursday night the 26-year-old will line up against Everton at Goodison Park in the group stage of the Europa League , but in the green and white of Wolfsburg rather than the red of Arsenal . <p> Ten years after arriving in London as a 16-year-old , Bendtner left the Gunners on a free transfer this summer , opting for a fresh start with a club who finished fifth in the Bundesliga last season . <p> His legacy at the Emirates will largely consist of the troubled events and outlandish sound bites he has become best known for , rather than for his goalscoring exploits ( he scored just 47 goals in 171 games in red and white ) - not quite the eventuality he once envisaged . <p> But just where did it all go wrong ? <p> Arsenal fans , of course , will tell you the answer lies very much at the feet of Bendtner and upon closer inspection of his roll call of trials and tribulations , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early promise -- he scored 11 times in 42 games as an 18-year-old on loan at Birmingham City in the Championship back in 2006-2007 ; he never came close to building upon that start back at his parent club . <p> The problem is , such has been the persistent strength of his voice , you always believed that at some point he would deliver upon his promise to develop into the player he remains insistent he will become . <p> " Trust me it will happen , " he said in that same interview in 2009 . <p> " As I have done before and will do so again , I will sit at the other end and laugh at those people when it is all done . " <p> At international level , at least , there have been glimpses of his talent . A tally of 24 goals in 60 appearances for Denmark is a strike rate comparable with many of the game 's top strikers , but he has so far failed to replicate that output at domestic level . <p> Fingers have also been pointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bendtner was pictured stumbling out of a London nightclub with his jeans around his ankles hours after Arsenal were beaten by Manchester United in the semi-finals of the Champions League . <p> While the high speed car crash that wrote off his prized Aston Martin and could easily have ended his life four months later was far from his fault , his decision to replace it with an identical ? 200,000 model projected an image of a spoilt child with too many toys at his disposal . <p> Then there was his conviction for drink driving in March 2012 on the same night his mother was given the all clear following lengthy treatment for cancer - another ill-thought action borne out of the misguided notion of the invincibility of youth . The Dane seems to attract trouble when automobiles and alcohol are involved and earlier this year his name was plastered across the press after an alleged , drunken row with a taxi driver in Copenhagen . <p> In between those high profile misdemeanours Bendtner 's progress has n't so much stalled but gone into reverse . He spent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score in nine appearances for the Serie A champions . <p> He returned to England last term as something of a laughing stock , in a land where missed chances and errant quotes are quickly recycled into comical vines and memes , in a social media soap opera he has starred in all too frequently . <p> And so as he readies himself to set foot on English soil once again , he finds himself quite possibly in the last chance saloon in his quest to come good on those promises of five years ago , though you suspect there 's little chance he would agree .

It was a difficult birth for her mother , June* , who claimed the pregnancy was unplanned but that she and her boyfriend , Theuns , were going to make a go of it . <p> According to an affidavit submitted by June to the High Court in Pretoria in a failed bid to regain custody of the baby , Christina suffered from respiratory problems and was only discharged from intensive care 40 days after her birth . <p> June told the court that the first few months of her baby 's life were plagued by various illnesses , prompting numerous doctor 's visits to treat the sickly infant . <p> When one of the doctors noticed a bruise on Christina 's left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply eye ointment to treat her perpetually swollen eye , just one of the many injuries the baby sustained . <p> In mid-September last year , a neighbour believed Christina 's inconsolable crying and malnourished appearance needed to be investigated .

While June insisted in her affidavit that she told the social workers the allegations were " ludicrous " , the social workers ' reports told a different story .

@@2860232 <h> Should SA consider nationalisation ? <p> 17 October 2014 , 12:49 <p> By Sivuyile Thanklord Crisboy Ncuthushe <p> Firstly , I will define nationalization and privatization . Secondly , I will also take time and try to give you a brief history of the two . Thirdly , I will give some points that are considered before the decision could be taken on whether to do or not . Fourthly , arguments in South African status , lastly give you a conclusion based on all above facts . <p> 1st Definitions <p> Nationalization means the permanent take over of private property by government , this take over can be done voluntarily , with payment to the previous owners of business or forced take over with no payment , or payment with bonds with no value . <p> Privatization is the transfer of ownership of property or business from a government to private entity . <p> 2nd History <p> After the World War II , most countries embarked on nationalization , the soviets governments did that because they wanted to put the union leaders in a position to dictate terms on behalf of workers the goal was not solely to increase efficiency or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight what was called capital dislocation and to improve economic growth . Privatization is old as it started during the ancient Greece period where everything was sold to private owners being army , tax collection etc . Post World War II as mentioned above most countries started to nationalize . Privatization increased again in the late 1970s and early 1980s . Large privatization took place in 1980s and 1990s . I can reference to privatization of Post Office by Japan . <p> South Africa has been colonized since 1652 ; it only gained its independence in 1994 . I know you will argue that it went through two major stage of all colonization , but , the fact is , it was colonized for more than 300 years . This is the time most countries were reverting back to privatization . <p> 3rd Wages and conditions <p> Private companies aim is to maximize profit which can be achieved by minimizing the cost of production . Labor is also referred to as factor of production , therefore is cost will need to be minimized in order to make huge profits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too low . In the present day technology is the trend to all industries , this expose labor to retrenchments . Citizen are turned to what Marx referred to as wage slave because of low wages <p> Since the goal is to make profit employees are forced to work extra abnormal hours in poor conditions that expose them to risk of being injured without compensation . Safety measures are being compromised , because they are costly and considered unnecessary as they are not the factor of production . <p> In order to prevent private businesses from exploiting labor and improve working conditions government need to come up with policies and regulations , <p> In South Africa we have these best policies and regulations , but we lack monitoring or control , which still leaves us to exploitation of workers ( low wages and poor working conditions ) . <p> Efficiency gains and losses <p> Fiscal considerations:The argument that privatization helps to raise cash for the government is related to the privatization 's impact on productivity . If the public ownership is optimal , then government is better off keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits . If the government is cash-strapped it should issue debt ( or raise taxes ) . The privatization proceeds are high only when the new private owners are more efficient ( or at least expect to be more efficient ) . Therefore the fiscal benefits of privatization are certainly related to the efficiency and welfare advantages of private ownership . Yet , the fiscal issues are very important as they provide government with incentives to undertake the privatization -- to raise cash and to eliminate public subsidies to SOE . <p> Therefore in South Africa , all our state owned enterprise are at risk as I could say they are not optimal , but sub-optimal or let say poor . <p> Operation efficiency <p> One of the strongest claims for privatization is that it will increase the operating efficiency , and therefore the profitability , of the enterprises concerned . Empirical studies have yielded mixed results ; although the balance of evidence favors the hypothesis that privatization increases operating efficiency . Borcherding , Pommerehne and Schneider ( 1982 ) surveyed the literature on municipal services and reported that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more efficient or no significant difference was observed . However , in studies of electricity and water services , either the public sector has been found to be more efficient ( Pescatrice and Trapani 1980 ; Bhattacharyya , Parker and Raffiee 1994 ) or no significant difference has been discovered ( Byrnes , Grosskopf and Hayes 1986 ) . <p> In S.A. municipalities and electricity are still controlled by government but EFF is also pushing for privatization of banks . Eskom is not doing well in electricity but private banks are the most efficient institutions in the country except the post bank which is owned by State . Remember a Batho Pele policy how good is that policy ? <p> Entrepreneurship <p> There is no doubt that nationalization will prevent entrepreneur the entry into certain industries , because is only the state that is allowed to operate . But , will nationalization destroy entrepreneurship ? <p> Prices <p> Nationalization strongest claim is that it lowers the prices whereas privatization is blamed of high prices which leads to basic needs of lower class not met . <p> 4th Argument @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and give my understanding of status core . History shows that most parts of the world for what ever reasons after World War II they have nationalized their industries , then at the later stage depending into the needs of the country they slowly started to privatize . Now lets take a look in our beloved SA it was colonized for more 300 years not only by one country but different countries meaning our capital have been dislocated . I am not going to talk much about union leaders being given unnecessary powers because that is already achieved , so that cant be the reason for S.A. to consider nationalization . The resources of S.A. are owned and managed by foreign institutions and foreign countries , which makes the South Africans not to benefit from the fruits of their trees . <p> Currently we have seen riots in farms of Western Cape , people demanding high wages and better working conditions . There are still cases of child labor . Marikana has been one of the moments no one will ever forget except if you have interest in Lonmin mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have policies but that is not enough . There is a need for implementation and monitoring of these policies . South Africa is known to be one of the countries with best constitution but I disagree when it comes to labor laws . Labor laws were supposing to accommodate two major parties or to mediate between two parties ( employer and employee ) but the way S. A labor laws have been designed they only protect the employer . The company might have bad working conditions , exploit workers , damage the environment , unfair dismiss employees and get away with it because the labor law is not clear . The only thing that governs the relationship between the employee and employer is the contract that is drafted by an employer for an employee to sign in order to be offered a job . Come on good people I am looking for a job and you give me a piece of paper with rules and whatever that is in there . I am going to sign it anyway not because I want to be subjected to your unfair contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a son of rich man or you are rich or employer you will agree with me . <p> There is a popular view that if mines and banks are nationalized the state will lose lot of revenue generated from tax of those industries . But the question remains how much percentage the state will lose compare to what it is losing now . In SA we are using progressive tax system . Therefore most of revenue goes to investors than government . The decision whether to Nationalize or privatize is based on the administration of the time . In SA each administration of course will be led by the party which is ANC must consider this decision then the next must privatize again . Before these institutions could start making loses . Only South African citizen should buy these institutions this will locate the capital and have impact in economic development . <p> Private institutions have better operation efficiency than private institutions , in such a way that some of the industries like rail transportation , Post bank , hospitalization should be privatized to improve operation efficiency as the employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ownership to avoid high prices and monopoly . <p> The truth is the world is evolving so is technology unless otherwise we are saying South African are not capable of coming with new ideas , then we can say nationalization will have bad effect on entrepreneurship . But if there will be any it will be minimum . What needs to be done since the state will be controlling and contributing more on GDP ? The gains must be used to promote the spirit of entrepreneurship and support new ideas . <p> There is a view that if we nationalize there is a claim that prices will be low , and in privatization prices will be high . Truly speaking that is not exactly the case . If privatized prices can be regulated and kept as low as possible . If nationalized SOEs turned to be bully and have influence into state which makes them to be able to increase prices and exploit consumers as they wish . Government needs to limit the powers that are carried by these companies . An example is SANRAL in S.A. <p> Politician @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nationalization as they will give preferences to their comrades . Politics are an enemy to both of these decisions . All they need to do is decide then let an independent economic expect implement the process . <p> 5th Conclusion <p> S.A should consider nationalization , while doing so ; also consider privatization of certain industries that are not longer efficient . We need to take a turn in our economy we cant allow most of our wealth and capital to go to foreign countries at the same we can not tolerate inefficient service and poor quality . <p> Disclaimer : All articles and letters published on MyNews24 have been independently written by members of News24 's community .

@@2860237 <h> The Truth of Genesis : The Mystery of Genesis ! <p> 17 October 2014 , 15:24 <p> " In the beginning , God created the heavens and the Earth " . That is the first sentence in the Holy Bible , given to modern mankind , via God 's chosen people . But what does it mean ? " Four point six billion years ago , God created our universe , starting with the planet Earth " . The expanse of space that God ( Yehovah ) made , which we live in , was created for us over 4 billion years ago . Since Yehovah is both infinite and eternal , what did He do to occupy Himself before He decided to create our universe ? This is explained in the article " The Truth of Genesis : An Attack Against Christians and Jews , Part 1 -- The Origin of Satan ! " . It is also explained in the PowerPoint presentation , the " Observations of Moses " . <p> Unknown decillions of Earth years in the past , Yehovah had been creating universes with different element based life forms . We live in the universe of man , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc-angel assigned to it , to fulfill the role of an overseer or superintendent . In our case , the arc-angel assigned was Lucifer , whose " head got too big for his britches " , and after 3 billion years wanted mankind to worship him , in return for advanced favors . He was bored with the slow progress of original mankind . <p> One thing lead to another . When original mankind refused to bow , Lucifer took out his anger on marine lower life forms , escalating ever so often up to the chain until told to stop by God . Like a spoiled teenager that does n't think they have to clean up their room , Lucifer convinced a third of overseers in the other universes ( creations ) to join him in an attempted overthrow of God . He could not approach the angels in Heaven because 1 ) he would brisk exposure , and ( 2 he had nothing in return to offer them which those angels did n't already have . The extra- celestial Civil War in Heaven ensued , and Lucifer lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Jude 1:6 ) , awaiting adjudication by the saints ( 1st Corinth. 6:3 ) during the White Throne Judgment . Because of prior covenants before Lucifer was given control of our universe , he was only cast down back to Earth in 245 Million BC , to have judgment at a later time . <p> Satan ( Lucifer ) instigated the " Great Extinction " upon his fall from heaven , and destroyed eras of life on Earth four more times . The Fourth Day was of creation week , which was the only day of that week which Moses was shown . The first Restoration Week was presented by the fifth day , in 244 Million BC , when God created the sea monsters ( giant reptiles of the sea ) and the first birds . The sixth day was of Restoration Week two , when God created giant mammals and the first horse ( herbivores ) in 64 Million BC , along with the third era of mankind . It was this era that God first made mankind " in His image " . <p> So when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense unless you first know that you are looking at seven weeks ( seven eras ) , and not just one week , given in moadim order , which is the fourth day , the fifth day , the sixth day , the seventh day , then the first day , the second day and then the third day . These represent seven eras of mankind , given in the Spring and Fall feast sequence . The third day has not come yet , and is the final ( forever lasting ) era of mankind , where Yeshua will reign over the Earth in place of Lucifer . <p> When Lucifer beguiled Eve , and Eve then persuaded Adam to eat of the forbidden fruit , Yehovah had given Lucifer enough rope to hang himself , opening the door for the rescinding of Lucifer 's assignment as ruler of this universe . But it took five eras of mankind to do it . Be advised that in no way , shape , or form , does Genesis imply a " young Earth " . That is only the foolishness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " creationism deny literal interpretation . <p> Yeshua ( Jesus ) was both of the lineage of King David ( Judah ) , and Moses ( Levi ) , by means of His virgin birth . The mother of ( virgin ) Mary , and the maternal grandmother of John the Baptist were sisters , and of the linage of Moses and Aaron . Mary 's father was of the kingly line of David . The tribe of Judah , the fourth son of Israel , represented the humanity and royalty of the Messiah . The four Spring feasts were fulfilled by Jesus with His first advent ( as the Messiah ) . Levi , the third son , represented the Divinity and Priesthood of the Messiah . The first of the three Fall feasts shall be fulfilled upon His upcoming or second return ( Day of Trumpets ) . His third coming ( Yom Kippur ) will be 1,000 years later , and His fourth coming ( Feast of Tabernacles ) on His final return and reign will be after the White Throne Judgment . <p> Disclaimer : All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by members of News24 's community .

@@2860238 <p> Eight-year-old Boniswa Mthembu loves holidays and weekends , not because it 's a break from school but because it 's the only time he gets to play with other children . <p> He does n't go to school with the other children in his homestead , because he has a physical disability . <p> He plays the waiting game : waiting for the chance to go to school one day ; waiting for the other children to come home every afternoon . <p> He is one of hundreds of children with physical and intellectual disabilities who live in the rural area near Manguzi in northern KwaZulu-Natal . <p> They ? languish at home because there are not enough special needs schools , Margaret Masinga , who is the secretary of the local Disabled Peoples ' Organisation , tells the Mail &amp; Guardian on the way to meet the Mthembus . <p> Homesteads are dispersed and the roads are bad , Masinga says , so getting to the nearest special needs school would take hours of walking , and catching a taxi is unaffordable for many families . <p> The three special needs schools in the area would probably not enrol these children anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sisizakele Special School , which has a waiting list of more than 400 . <p> The local ordinary schools are not much help either because they are already overcrowded , " so mothers give up and the children stay at home " , Masinga says . <p> Boniswa lives with his 30-year-old unemployed mother , Nonhlanhla Mthembu , and his retired grandmother in houses made of stones , mud and wooden poles . His cousins live nearby . There are no books , toys or a TV , so Boniswa follows his mother around all day as she cooks and cleans . <p> He can walk only with the help of a rudimentary walker , which he got from the Manguzi Hospital . The wheels at the back are missing . <p> When Boniswa was two years old , a doctor told his mother that he had a " muscle problem " . Now his legs are permanently bent at the knee and he walks on his tiptoes while leaning on the walker . <p> Mthembu is sitting on a log under a tree , frowning and waiting for Masinga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's stressful because he is always asking me : ' Why am I not going to school ? ' " <p> She is wearing a red dress and , despite the humidity , a white cardigan . Every time I look at Boniswa , he smiles and looks down quickly . <p> He ca n't read or write , and when I ask him to draw himself in the sand , he ca n't do that either . <p> Mthembu tried to enrol him in Sisizakele last year but was turned away and the local ordinary school would not take him either . <p> A June report commissioned by rights organisation Section27 said that in 2012/2013 there were 17 169 pupils enrolled in 71 special needs schools that employed 496 teachers and teacher assistants . <p> The province had 73 " full-service schools " for pupils with and without disabilities . There were about 20 000 pupils , 150 teachers and assistants at these schools . <p> The spokesperson for the KwaZulu-Natal education department , Isaac Luthuli , says that this year the province has 73 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not respond to questions about the number of teachers currently employed at these schools . <p> He also said there are 101 full-service schools , which accommodate all pupils -- able-bodied and those with disabilities . <p> Margaret Masinga is the secretary of the local Disabled Peoples ' Organisation . ( Delwyn Verasamy , MG ) <p> The previous day Masinga was sitting on a low wall in Manguzi town under the white sky . It was overcast but hot and she was wearing a brightly coloured dress . <p> Many people here believe that disabled children will never grow up to contribute meaningfully to society , she told the M&amp;G . <p> " But there is no such thing as a disabled child not being able to do this , " says Masinga . <p> She had polio as a child and walks with the help of crutches . She had been allowed to enrol in an ordinary school . Later she did a computer course and eventually got a job as a physiotherapist 's assistant . <p> Masinga is the secretary of the Disabled Peoples ' Organisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pupils about disabilities . <p> She says there are not nearly enough special needs schools but that ordinary schools try to help . Some of them will accept a disabled child knowing they wo n't be able to teach him or her , but that at least the child is socialising with other children . " There is a 23-year-old woman with an intellectual disability who is still doing grade four at a nearby ordinary school . " <p> Down the road from the Mthembus are the Khumalos . We sit on the family 's brown suede lounge suite , but seven-year-old Nelisiwe ca n't keep still . She has epileptic seizures about twice a year , despite being on medication . Her mother , Esther , says she is intellectually disabled because of the seizures . <p> " The ordinary school she is at said she is n't allowed back next year because teachers complain that she is aggressive with the other children ... She breaks all the things , windows ... " <p> Her mother tried to get Nelisiwe into Sisizakele this year but was told there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the opposite direction , we struggle to drive our hired car on the sandy road towards a third homestead . <p> After getting stuck twice , we return to Manguzi town . It is a glaring reminder of the transport struggles that local people face . <p> The next day we return in a borrowed 4x4 bakkie . There are no signposts and no cellphone signal . <p> It is lucky that Thandazile Moyale was already in Manguzi that morning and could drive with us to her home , where she lives with her physically and intellectually disabled daughter . <p> Minenhle ( 15 ) sits next to Masinga on the couch , shakes her arms above her head and laughs . <p> She is wearing loose jeans and a T-shirt that says : " Born to tweet " . It 's unlikely she will ever know what tweeting is or how to use this technology if she stays out of school . <p> She has epilepsy and when she " fits " , Moyale says , " she fits for the whole day " . <p> Minenhle Moyale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at home because there are not enough special needs schools in the area she lives in .

" When we have to walk to the taxi , she bends over and puts her hands on her knees and that 's when I carry her . " <p> Minenhle must weigh at least 40kg . <p> Like all the other families , Moyale was told by every school she approached : no space . Minenhle now stays at home with her grandmother . <p> The problems faced by these mothers in trying to get their disabled children into school is endemic , so Masinga sent emails to Section27 earlier this year ? to ask for help . <p> Section27 researcher Muhammad Zakaria Suleman said the organisation had written to the provincial department on at least three occasions since the beginning of this year , " asking them to engage with us on how to address the situation " . <p> " We are now concerned that the children of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend Sisizakele Special Needs School in 2015 may be prejudiced by not being placed at Sisizakele or another appropriate school next year . " <p> Sisizakele is in Bhambanana , about an hour from Manguzi . The principal , Sophia Jood , walks with Masinga and me down the corridor of the new school 's pristine buildings . What started as a community project for disabled children in 2005 has blossomed into a R109-million school that serves 161 pupils . <p> But the province has provided only eight teachers , one teacher 's assistant and five other support staff , says the softly spoken Jood . She sighs . She looks tired . The school needs 17 teachers to be able to function properly . <p> " In some classes there are 31 children all with different disabilities with one teacher and one assistant ... It 's criminal . " <p> The R109-million Sisizakele Special School in Bhambanana , outside Manguzi , does snot have enough staff to operate at full capacity .

" <p> But the bargaining council is far from Manguzi . <p> Meanwhile , the disabled children are not being given the opportunity to at least learn to look after themselves . <p> As Moyale says about her daughter , Minenhle : " I worry because I wonder who will stand up for her if something happens to me . " <p> Special need for special teachers <p> A report commissioned by Section27 , released in June , said there were 71 special needs schools in KwaZulu-Natal in 2012/2013 , enrolling 17 169 pupils and employing 496 teachers . <p> Of these , 10 were remedial teachers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The report is called Brief Overview of Resource Allocation/Expenditure on Special Needs Education : Focus on KZN Department of Education and Sisizakele Special Needs School . <p> It said the acceptable ratio of disabled pupils to teachers should be 10:1 , but " the pupil:teacher ratio is 34.6:1 " . <p> The department had regularly reported vacancies for special needs teachers . The report said this was concerning because the number of special needs pupils were increasing " with minimal shifts in the number of educators employed " . <p> National figures are just as worrying as those for KwaZulu-Natal , but basic education department spokesperson Elijah Mhlanga said the department was committed " to meeting the needs of all pupils with disabilities over the next five years " . <p> He said 791 ordinary schools had been targeted for upgrading to become full-service schools and that there were 440 special schools in the country . <p> According to a report published by the Children 's Institute at the University of Cape Town , titled South Africa 's Progress in Realising Children 's Rights : A Law Review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children with disabilities ... out of school " . <p> It said that " more than 120 000 children with disabilities were in ordinary schools " , but that a 2006 survey had found that " 97.1% ... had no accessible toilets and 97.8% had no ramps " .

" <p> In Orange Farm , the picture is very different from the one that the national department 's countrywide statistics paint , Elphick says . " Although it is said that more than 90% of children with disabilities are in school , our experience in Orange Farm is that just over 30% of children who should be in school actually are enrolled and are currently going to school . " She says that access to healthcare is harder in rural areas . <p> " Early identification , intervention and inclusion of children with any kind of impairment gives the best and most cost-effective outcomes . <p> This type of intervention often requires rehabilitation therapies on a regular basis , but at rural hospitals , and even in the cities , children are almost never able to reliably see a rehabilitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

On stage was the star-studded Slaves band : Thuthukani " Chief " Cele on keyboards , Eugene Mthethwa ( who later achieved fame with kwaito group Trompies ) also on keyboards , Vulindela Yeni on saxophone , Chris Ntaka on lead guitar , Jabu Sibumbe on bass , Ray Mohono on drums , Chris Dlamini on percussion and drums , Ndumiso Nyovane on trumpet , Jabu Mdluli on trombone , Sister Phumi Maduna , Thembi Khumalo and Khabo Ntsele on backing vocals . <p> And the star of the show , Dube himself , on lead vocals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clad in his army gear and a red , yellow and green rastafari scarf around his sweat-drenched neck -- and topless -- ran around the stadium like a man possessed , to the reverberating sounds of Ayo Bayo ( I Got You Babe ) ; One Love ( a classic Bob Marley composition ) ; I 've Got Jah ; Together As One ; Born To Suffer ; Prisoner ; The Hand That Giveth ; Truth In The World . <p> And this was the kind of performance fans globally would come to know and expect from Lucky Dube and The Slaves . The energy . The professionalism . The talent . The respect for fans . <p> And over the years names such as Isaac Mtshali ( drums ) , backing vocalists Marilyn Nokwe , Beulah Hashe , Phumzile Ntuli , Felicia Marion and Veronica Makhalimela would also become part of The Slaves family . <p> Dube was selfless -- so much so that he allowed his band to record on their own .

@@2863234 @ BMW X3 xDrive 20d X-Line : Evolution of the species <p> Deon Schoeman <p> Deon Schoeman <p> Life , etc <p> 20 Oct 2014 12:06 ( South Africa ) <p> BMW 's X3 not only pioneered the compact premium SUV segment , but remains its most successful exponent . It 's grown in size and complexity , while the competition has become fiercer , too . BMW hopes the latest changes to the X3 will allow the luxury SUV to keep its nose in front . By DEON SCHOEMAN . <p> Whatever happened to the humble , practical , no-nonsense 4x4 ? The basic , bare-metal bundu bashers that pioneered the four-wheel drive segment in the early1950s have long since made way for much more sophisticated machines . But do the fancy all-terrainers of today really eclipse their illustrious predecessors ? <p> That depends on the application . The enduring popularity of the Land Rover Defender -- a no-nonsense 4x4 that still goes where almost nothing else can follow , and has n't changed that much in more than seven decades , suggests that there is a very real market for authentic go-anywhere machines . <p> But for the majority of would-be SUV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and too Spartan . They like the visibility and the perceived security of the SUV 's taller stance , the practicality of a spacious interior , and the promise of all-terrain talent , even if they have no intention of conquering the Richtersveld 's torturous tracks . <p> Most of all , nobody wants to forsake the creature comforts , the convenience and the safety of conventional cars -- we want the Bluetooth connectivity , the climate control , the keyless entry , the electronic safety blanket of ABS , EBD , EBA and ESC , the touchscreen display and the on-board computer . And we want to go off-road when it suits us ... <p> Enter the modern-day SUV , a category that continues to grow , and these days comes in all shapes and sizes -- from small and cheeky to large and ostentatious . SUVs often blur the lines between conventional cars , crossovers , and multi-purpose vehicles , and even all-wheel drive is n't always a prerequisite anymore . <p> It 's been more than a decade since BMW extended the brand 's reach beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUV . Badged the X3 , the feisty all-terrainer pioneered the genre in the premium segment , and it remains a popular choice . <p> Four years after being released , the current-generation X3 has just undergone an update . But the emphasis here is on evolutionary refinement , rather than on revolution . <p> Not surprisingly then , the latest X3 looks very much like the old one -- unless you see it from the front . While the silhouette remains virtually unchanged , the front view displays a redesigned nose that 's slightly longer , with more upright , redesigned kidney grilles , new headlight clusters , and different front and rear bumpers . <p> There 's also a new equipment package called xLine , which adds further visual appeal . The xLine package seeks to place a little more visual emphasis on the all-terrain capability of the X3 . <p> Highlights include the metallic bumper inserts , brushed aluminium finishes for the air intakes , and scuff plates front and rear -- although be warned , the latter are just for show , and are n't meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUV , after all ! <p> Step inside , and those already familiar with the X3 will feel instantly at home . That the cabin is as comfortable and as ergonomically intuitive as before suggests that BMW did n't want to mess too much with a winning formula . <p> As a result , the changes are subtle , with the emphasis on enhanced finishes and materials , as well as a greater choice of options . From a tactile perspective , the cockpit exudes and air of upmarket well-being , while the switchgear operates with slick precision . <p> Equipment levels have been updated , and the central display , combined with BMW 's iDrive control interface , is standard across the range , while a new option is the motorised tailgate , which can even be opened by sweeping your foot under the rear bumper -- useful when you arrive at the vehicle with arms full of shopping bags . <p> In the case of the xDrive20d tested here , the cosmetic updates are combined with a significant change to the engine . The two-litre turbodiesel is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power has increased to 140kW , with the torque peak now at 400Nm . At the same time , combined cycle fuel consumption has been improved to just 5.2 litres/100km for the eight-speed automatic gearbox-equipped version . The extra power and reduced appetite has been achieved by upping the injector pressure , allowing both extra urge and more efficient operation . <p> You 'll need to drive the X3 with some circumspection to get anywhere close to that claimed consumption figure , however : in a mix of conditions which included a trip to Clarens in the Free State , the real-world result was a somewhat more pragmatic 7 litres/100km . <p> The X3 's lustier two-litre engine also delivers lustier performance . The zero to 100km/h sprint time is despatched in a brisk 8.1sec , while top speed comes to 210km/h . Even so , the power delivery is smoother and more linear than before , which tends to understate the SUV 's urge . <p> In-gear tractability is excellent , with no lag to speak of , and instantaneous response to throttle input . Switch to Sport mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The eight-speed auto swaps gears seamlessly , adding to the overall sense of effortlessness . <p> While the demand for SUVs continues to grow , the segment is also becoming a lot more competitive , even for premium brands . This latest , updated X3 does n't have to reinvent the wheel , but it combines fresher looks with the things that matter most : more power , lower fuel consumption , improved efficiency and an even more cosseting cabin experience . <p> Of course , the xDrive20d is not the onlyX3 option . The range also includes a 3.0-litre turbodiesel and a choice of three turbocharged petrol engines , each with its own character , and in the case of the larger-engined versions more power , too . <p> However , in my books , it 's the X3 xDrive20d that remains the pick of the bunch , and finds the sweet spot between refinement , performance , versatility and economy .

@@2863238 <p> Cosatu general secretary Zwelinzima Vavi , SACP general secretary Blade Nzimande , and ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe . There is no doubt about the stabilising force that the tripartite alliance brings to politics , says the writer . File picture : Bonile Ban <h> Labour pains for the ruling party <p> Labour has brought the country to a crossroads and depending on how the ANC plays this , we could follow Zimbabwe 's or China 's lead , writes Lesiba Seshoka . <p> Johannesburg - The hostilities that have paralysed Cosatu as well as the emergence of new so-called independent unions are likely to bring the labour , economic and political situation in the country to a crossroads . <p> As it appears , the roads may lead us either to a Chinese or Zimbabwean situation , depending on what decisions the ruling party makes -- or fails to make . <p> For years , Cosatu 's alliance with the ANC and the SACP has been lauded as a vital stabilising force for the economy while employers perceived the relationship as toxic -- one that promoted labour inflexibility , that is , curtailed the right of employers to freely hire and fire as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship was seen as Cosatu having " one " with the ruling party without using condoms . <p> But labour generally benefited from the relationship because the laws that favoured it were passed while the ruling party benefited through electoral support and to a larger extent , reasonable labour stability . <p> Of course the notion of labour stability may be questionable given that employers have always lamented the number of strikes and their duration . <p> But in relation to the damaging five months ' industrial action that the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union ( Amcu ) went through this year , one could argue that the country had a relatively stable labour environment and that the Amcu strike was a harbinger of what is to come . <p> Apart from Cosatu , there have always been other independent trade unions affiliated to either the National Council of Trade Unions ( Nactu ) or the Federation of Unions of South Africa ( Fedusa ) . <p> Thus , some may argue that the emergence of independent trade unions may not necessarily be a destabilising force or a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one perceives the crossroads that South Africa 's labour is at . <p> If trade unions such as the National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa ( Numsa ) and likeminded trade unions were to pull out of Cosatu as they are threatening to do , a weaker federation will remain . <p> Employers can only hope that that will translate into the ruling party reviewing its labour laws in favour of business to snub and spite the majority emergent unions in Nactu , Fedusa and the new crew , wherever they would be . <p> This is informed by the relationship between South Africa and China at a bilateral level as well as at a multilateral level within the Brazil , Russia , India , China and South Africa business communities . <p> In recent times , there have been many visits to China by the ANC and the SACP . <p> While visiting may not necessarily mean anything , the perception of the bosses and many in society is that the ANC may be envying the emerging Chinese economy led by the Communist Party of China , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other hand , Cosatu has been opposed to China and asked for a boycott of Chinese goods , which it claims were produced through the exploitation of labour . <p> But take the perception that South Africa 's ruling party has become China 's lapdog , which is perpetuated by what is reported as our country 's refusal to grant the Dalai Lama a visa , it is probable that our labour situation may assimilate China 's . <p> The employers will celebrate the arrival of their newfound hegemony . Suppose that is the case , the acrimony and animosity between the poor and the ruling party will escalate , so will the acrimony between labour and employers , resulting in a formidable labour party which many have been betting on . <p> The gap between the rich and the poor will widen , which will be bad news for a country that has the greatest inequality on Earth . <p> But the protest levels will increase , which will also be bad for a country that has already been dubbed the protest capital of the world . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the side of the bosses , the ANC may opt to be indecisive and silently maintain the status quo in terms of labour laws . If this happens , which is likely , Amcu , the new trade unions led by Numsa and possibly the Economic Freedom Fighters ( EFF ) may work together to unleash a series of political strikes that will destabilise the country for good . <p> This will in many ways emulate the Zimbabwean political situation where Morgan Tsvangirai then leader of the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions broke the alliance with the ruling Zanu-PF and the relationship deteriorated . <p> In 1989 , he was charged by the Zimbabwean government for espionage leading to a series of strikes in 1997 in a bid to force the government to adopt more responsible economic policies . <p> He later formed the Movement for Democratic Change ( MDC ) . <p> This is of , course , not far-fetched . the metalworkers union has already shown its support and well wishes for Amcu in all its strikes as has the EFF which has become more popular in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feather are said to always flock together . <p> These may lead us to the Zimbabwean situation where the economy would collapse as the country becomes strike-hit . <p> The adage that says where elephants fight , the grass will not grow will become reality . <p> But who will suffer in the event that things go either way ? <p> Of course it would be ordinary working-class people , who will be eager to go to work at the height of a politically inspired industrial action . <p> It would be the employers who would be looking forward to raking in trillions of rand at the expense of the poor , but are unable to make ends meet because the poor are blockaded with machetes and pangas en route to work . <p> It will be the economy and the masses that depend on social grants because they are unable to get the money because of the shrinking fiscus . <p> It will be the student who depends on the National Student Financial Aid Scheme ( NSFAS ) who will be unable to attend tertiary education because there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will collapse because it relies on the state for survival . It will be the entire system that collapses . <p> But that would translate the truth that the ANC/SACP/Cosatu alliance was indeed a vital stabilising force for the country . <p> Already , South Africa has become less competitive for investors and is ranking far lower as an investment destination of choice . <p> In a sense , our labour environment is on a knife-edge , or rather at a crossroads , but the ruling party is between a rock and a hard place . <p> To act or not to act , that is the question . <p> * Lesiba Seshoka is executive director of corporate relations at the University of Kwazulu-Natal . <p> ** The views expressed here are not necessarily those of Independent Newspapers .

@@2874235 <h> SA Post office on strike - who knew <p> 23 October 2014 , 09:22 <p> Imagine my surprise when I heard the South African post office was on strike . And to make it worse , they have downed tools for the last three months ! I am appalled . How could I have missed this ? The country must have come to a complete standstill while I was busy on Facebook . The wheels must have come off , mere anarchy has loosed on our world - things must have fallen apart . <p> So I phoned my mom . She is normally very up to date on these matters , and told her what I had just read somewhere on the Internet . " Nonsense " said she , " We would have known . " And then there was a pause . A long pause ( which is unusual as she normally pauses just long enough to take a breath ) . " But now that I think of it , I have n't seen a E-toll account " ( which she likes to hide from my father , given that there is a " gantry " between her home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> And indeed it is . The South African Post Office has been on strike for nearly three months , and I am not sure anyone has noticed . Can you imagine this sort of thing happening in the U.K. Prime Ministers would be asked to resign , people would have shaken their unshakeable heads . Old men and ladies ( and young ones even ) would take to the streets waving their placards demanding that this be dealt with forthwith . It would be viewed , as a sign that society as it was known , had come to an end . Heads would role , but not in an Isis sort of way . But not to overstate the obvious , that is because they actually have a postal service . <p> So I remember the days when we would mail invitations to an event . I recall so clearly , at age 12 , rushing to post box daily to see who would had sent a " Reply Card " and would be coming to my bar mitzvah ( it turned out I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ) . And then we got concerned that the invitations would be damaged or not arrive on time and then we got concerned they would never make it at all , and then we stopped using this medium for anything important -- for anything that mattered . So now we either hand deliver or we email . And doctors email , and the City of Johannesburg emails and just about everyone does . Because it 's efficient and because we have been trained to do so . And I am not sure , aside from those E-Toll people , who actually supports the post office . <p> And it 's not because we do n't want to . It is simply because they have made themselves irrelevant . Like blacksmiths and telex operators , I wonder if there is a future in postal mail and I wonder if the strike is even worth resolving . What if we turned post offices into schools and practiced reading those letters no one thinks that they will ever receive . Postman people can become fitness trainers ( they must have some level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can go to Postnet . Not that I even have ever understood that dubious relationship .

And whereas I cant confirm if this is true , I know that I was recently unable to complete a transaction on a book as they would not deliver to our neck of the scary woods . <p> It seems to me that the SA Post Office has maneuvered itself into redundancy .

It 's expensive if you lose ; it can be equally costly even if you win . And that 's just the money -- the personal and social costs in embarrassment and pain to all involved ca n't ever be calculated . <p> Earlier this month the high court in Windhoek ruled on a R95 000 damages claim brought by Hendrick Useb against George Gawaseb for adultery with Useb 's former wife , Charmaine . <p> Useb said his marriage was a " normal average relationship " , with " no significant discord apart from occasional differences " . <p> But on November 27 , 2011 , Charmaine came home after staying out all night and refused to explain where she 'd been . <p> They argued , she collected her clothes and then left home to move in with Gawaseb . <p> Useb was the only one to give evidence in his case and he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charmaine freely admitted that they were involved in a romantic relationship that started after Charmaine left Useb , but before the marriage formally ended in divorce .

You do n't like to drop points but all this talk about records and statistics , maybe that became a bit of a monkey on the players ' backs . Maybe once they 've got that out of the way now , they can even kick on again . " <p> Baxter has once again ruled out making wholesale changes to his starting 11 . <p> Despite being a Briton , where the trend in his country of birth is to give a number of squad members and youngsters a run in cup competitions in order to rest senior members of the team , Baxter said he could not afford to field a team sporting a host of new faces . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitively as possible . It 's not like Manchester United playing in the League Cup against Barnsley and selecting a pure ' B ' team , " Baxter said . <p> " They can do that and still be superior .

So , at the same time as we want to give people playing time , one , they 've got to earn the shirt and two , they 've got to be in good form . "

@@2878236 <h> Optimism despite global market volatility <p> A sharp sell-off of shares on global financial markets has dominated news headlines in recent weeks , but asset managers say you should keep some perspective , because there are still many opportunities in global markets . <p> Chris Freund , portfolio manager at Investec Asset Management , says the recent weakness in world markets is not a sign of worse to come , and you would do well to sit it out . <p> Henk Potts , the director of global research and investments at Barclays , says there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic about the speed and the strength of the global economic recovery , and there are plenty of opportunities for investors in international markets . <p> Freund says the latest decline in global markets does not appear to be the start of a bear market , as these are usually brought about by one of three catalysts : the significant overvaluation of shares and other securities , a credit squeeze or banking crisis , or a material slowdown in economic growth or a recession . <p> While share valuations ( prices relative to company earnings ) are mildly high , shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recent weakness , he says . <p> Freund says there also does not appear to be a credit crunch or banking crisis . <p> There are , however , perceptions of global growth slowing down materially , with the main factor being a noticeable deterioration in European growth , he says . <p> Freund says that although European data has been weaker than anticipated for some time , the main difference now is that Germany , the economy that has performed strongest in the Eurozone , is now also looking considerably weaker . <p> However , Freund says Investec does not believe the current conditions warrant the fear the market seems to be expressing and does not anticipate Europe slipping back into a recession . <p> The recent disappointing data is all related to manufacturing , which accounts for only about 30 percent of the economy , he says . <p> He says the weaker euro and lower oil price will support European economies , assisting the exporting countries , such as Germany , and consumers . <p> Freund also expects increased spending in the Eurozone next year from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures has been implemented to stimulate the Eurozone . Politicians are trying to reform their finances and restructure their economies , while the European Central Bank is trying to calm investors ' nerves and do whatever it can to make the European project work , he says . <p> The backlash against the austerity measures in certain European countries may slow down the timetable , but will not damage the policy , Potts says . <p> He believes a real economic recovery is under way in the Eurozone and companies are leaner , so likely to make better profits . <p> Equity valuations are a lot cheaper in the Eurozone than in the US , at around 13 times , and this means better prospects for investors , Potts says . <p> While the Eurozone is troubled , broad economic measures in the United States paint a bright picture , Potts says . Manufacturing output and household wealth are both higher now than before the 2008 financial crisis , productivity is improving , consumers are spending and unemployment has fallen from a peak of 10 percent of the employable population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house prices are rising , builders ' confidence remains high , existing home sales remain strong , credit conditions have been improving and the foreclosure rate has been declining . <p> The US economy is expected to grow at about two percent this year and 2.7 percent next year , he says . <p> Potts says the first interest rate hike in the US is expected to be in June next year , but rates will rise slowly over about four years . <p> While equity markets have tended to fall on news about the withdrawal of central bank stimulation in the aftermath of the credit crisis , Potts says you should bear in mind that higher interest rates also indicate that the business world is improving and the economic backdrop is getting stronger . <p> Companies will flourish and corporate profitability will get a lot stronger , he says . <p> US equity valuations are around a price-to-earnings ratio of 15.5 , but are not as bad as some commentators suggest when compared with historical levels ( see graph : link below ) . Given the stronger economic growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Potts says . <p> Some investors are questioning whether it is right to continue to invest in equities given their recent longer-term strong performance , Potts says . But remember that your exposure to equities in a balanced portfolio will do more to determine a portfolio 's performance than any other investment decision , he says . <p> While equities create the greatest opportunity for profit , they also have the greatest potential for loss . But if you want to earn higher risk-adjusted returns in a low-interest-rate environment , you need to own a slice of a listed company . <p> Barclays expects that after a period of volatility and perhaps a small correction , global financial markets will push higher , Potts says . <p> He say the US stock market has out-performed most markets in most currencies for most of the past 30 years . Over the past five years , it has been an easy call to invest in US equities because equity markets have been underpinned by low valuations , liquidity and growth in the economy , he says <p> However , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider than the US market . <p> Potts says there are opportunities in Japan if you believe that President Shinzo Abe 's plan to remedy two decades of economic stagnation in that country will be successful . Dubbed " Abenomics " , the plan involves increasing Japan 's money supply , boosting government spending and implementing reforms designed to make the economy more competitive . <p> It maystill be too early , but if just a small fraction of money invested in Japanese bond markets moves to its equity markets , it will have a big positive impact on these shares , Potts says . <p> He says you should also have at least a 10-percent exposure to emerging markets , which are smaller and less liquid and transparent than developed markets and therefore inherently more risky , but offer the potential of good returns . <p> Potts says you should look for countries that will benefit from the pick-up in global economic activity from stronger demand from the US consumer . He suggests China , Taiwan , Korea , Mexico and Poland , although he says Mexico and Poland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Potts also suggests you invest in some frontier markets , such as Africa . <p> Freund says that , globally , headline inflation is starting to decelerate as a result of declining food and oil prices . <p> The subdued inflation means that central banks will not be under pressure to raise interest rates , and the US Federal Reserve may even postpone raising rates beyond the generally expected mid-2015 date . <p> Freund says this should be positive for equity markets . <p> He says that the crucial risk is Europe , but as long as the current conditions do not persist for a prolonged period or get worse , Investec does not anticipate the start of something more sinister for equity markets . <p> LOCAL MARKETS : ' DO N'T PANIC ' <p> There is no need to panic despite the local share market turning negative over the short term , say analysts . <p> The FTSE/JSE All Share index ( Alsi ) returned 15.44 percent over the year to the end of September and 22.18 percent a year over the three years to the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the three months to the end of September , the return was minus 2.13 percent .

Despite this , the Alsi has returned 20 percent a year since then , he says . <p> Odendaal says the local market has followed the global market 's declines , but has been affected more by falling commodity prices . <p> Commodity prices have fallen partly on concerns about China , where economic growth has slowed from " breakneck rates " achieved over the past decade , to a " still strong about seven percent " in real terms , Odendaal says . <p> Commodities have also declined as a result of the United States dollar strengthening and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp declines on any market are a worry , equity investors need to be able to stomach this kind of volatility and keep a long-term view . Diversification has again proved to be a very useful strategy , with financial shares , local bonds and listed property holding up well during the recent market turmoil . <p> Do not panic and sell after a market correction , as it will only crystallise your losses , he says . 
@@2878237 <h> Making e-commerce work in Africa <p> Payment methods and logistics challenges have made e-commerce in Sub-Saharan Africa ( outside South Africa ) more talked about than usual . But recent players in Nigeria have shaped the way things work to meet market conditions and are having promising signs of success . <p> Russell Southwood spoke to Jeremy Doutte , CEO , Jumia Nigeria . <p> Early e-commerce market entrant in Nigeria Nasper 's Kalahari.com came and went and the " told-you-so 's " said what did you expect : the number of customers was tiny . Rocket Internet start-up Jumia was launched two years in May 2012 . <p> Together Konga ( invested in by Sweden 's Kinevik and Naspers ) and Jumia are estimated by those who have seen the figures to have around or over 2 million customers . <p> Doutta ( who has also worked for Jumia in Nigeria ) says originally they were working on the idea of pushing the Amazon concept into Africa . But they realised early on things were going to be very different : there was not the same logistics chain as you found in developed countries ; there was little or no financing ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to completely rework the model so it remains a bit galling when they hear people saying they just copied it . <p> " The key success factors were not here so we had to move to cash on delivery . " But the big gap in the market was the lack of quality retailing at something less than premium prices . For the average shopper , finding something they wanted might involve a long journey , at the end of which there was no guarantee the product they wanted would be in stock . <p> During my visit I also spoke to Rukky Ladoja , the women behind a start-up with two fashion brands in the market : Grey and Even Tribe . The mid-market brand Even Tribe sells more or less completely through Jumia 's online channel . <p> The numbers are not huge but it has opened up a way of addressing its customers with clothes that reflect Nigerian body shapes and colours wanted , leapfrogging the less than perfect retail sector . <p> Jumia 's customers buy literally everything but one of the biggest categories is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes , the mobile phone . This is followed by fashion wear . Recently it added diet supplements and " this supplier is now in the Top 15 of our suppliers in 2 weeks . " <p> Jumia offers its delivery service across the whole of this large country : " There are some challenges to reach everywhere but we have 16 logistics hubs and a small warehouse . " <p> So how long does it take to get something delivered for a customer in the northern city of Kano ? 2-3 days says Doutte but a customer had posted on his Facebook page that with one item the next day . Nevertheless Doutte prefers to stick to the 2-3 days delivery time . <p> 60% of its orders come from Lagos and the rest from elsewhere . It wants to expand the volume of orders coming from elsewhere and is " planning to push the geographic spread . " <p> There is also an issue in terms of access to devices to do the ordering : there are more smartphones than laptops and PCs in the market . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 6% of people in Northern Nigeria have access to laptops or PCs respectively . <p> So Jumia is pushing entry-level smartphones with its own app pre-loaded . It is working with a Chinese OEM out of Dubai called Innjoo to provide low-cost smartphones direct to customers over the platform . Doutta says that there US$50 smartphones " but they are not so good " but for US$75 " you can get a very good phone with a 5 inch screen . " <p> Until recently , orders by device origin were split 50/50 between Laptops and PCs and mobile phones . The latter has begun to creep up to 53% . <p> Overall , Doutta says that it plans to dramatically increase the customer experience with better trucks , better tracking and bigger warehouses . It already employs 1,200 staff directly and a contracted sales staff of 800 . It puts 800 motor cycles and trucks on the road . <p> Doutta also has worked at Jumia Morocco so I asked him what were the key differences between it and the Nigerian market ? : " Here the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak and limited offline retail . There are malls and shops everywhere in Morocco . <p> They may not be as good as Paris or London but they 're very good . Here the retail offer is average . It 's hard to go to Shoprite on a Saturday afternoon . Nigerians like to innovate and try and are really open-minded . E-Commerce is an aspirational way of shopping . " <p> He says that Konga is Jumia 's main competition but that there is also a much smaller operator called OLX . It also has a sister company called Kaymu.co.ng which provides a marketplace model for retailers . <p> He says that there are three key things that investors or start-ups coming in from outside the continent need to understand : <p> 1 . People think it will be cheap to operate in Africa . He says everything is expensive in Lagos from the power bill he was looking at when I arrived to the monthly cost of his apartment . <p> 2 . There will be no competition . Wrong again . Konga is providing strong competition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very smart and strong ( to survive ) . They will do amazing things " . <p> 3 . There will be lots of innovation . In fact it 's actually harder to innovate than elsewhere . <p> He also pointed to the dearth of good , high-quality people , something that other companies in the field also identify as a problem : " There 's the big challenge of human talent . It 's not available in large enough quantities for the size of the opportunity available . " <p> But given the scale of the opportunity in Nigeria and elsewhere that 's a nice problem to have rather than there being no opportunity . 
@@2878239 <h> Beware being fleeced if you 're a debt defaulter <p> The National Credit Regulator ( NCR ) has asked African Bank 's auditors to report back to the regulator on refunds amounting to R620 million which the ailing bank owes about 164 000 customers who were charged excessive fees . <p> The National Credit Act limits what a credit provider can charge in respect of any credit agreement , and credit providers are compelled by law to submit to the regulator an annual compliance report . <p> Lesiba Mashapa , the company secretary at the NCR , says that African Bank 's auditors , Deloitte , picked up non-compliance with a section of the Act that sets out the maximum amount that can be collected from a consumer in default . <p> The audit report that revealed the non-compliance was submitted by Deloitte to the NCR last year , Mashapa says . " Engagements with African Bank ensued and the bank agreed to take corrective action .

" <p> The section of the National Credit Act that sets out the maximum amount that can be collected from a consumer in default , including interest and collection costs , states that , despite any provision in common law or a credit agreement to the contrary , charges ( such as interest , service fees , credit life insurance and collection costs ) that accrue when a consumer is in default may not , in total , exceed the unpaid balance of the principal debt at the time of the default . <p> Stephen Logan , an attorney who specialises in consumer law , says it is incorrect to refer to this section of the Act as the " in duplum rule " . <p> The in duplum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest that a creditor may charge on an account that is in arrears . In terms of the in duplum rule , if you borrow R5 000 and default when you owe R4 000 , the credit provider may continue to charge interest on the outstanding amount , but only until the accumulated interest reaches R4 000 . However , the credit provider is still at liberty to charge you other costs and fees until you have paid off the entire debt . <p> But the Act provides for an extension of the in duplum rule so that it applies to costs and fees in addition to interest . <p> This means that the following amounts , when added together , may not exceed the unpaid balance of the principal debt under a credit agreement at the time when the default occurs : <p> * Initiation fee ; <p> * Service fee ; <p> * Interest ; <p> * Cost of credit insurance ; <p> * Default administration charges ; and <p> * Collection costs . <p> Mashapa says legal fees are " a big problem " .

It has not submitted a single report since ratifying the ICCPR in 1998 , yet is obligated to submit a report every four years . This measure is usually reserved for states that have shown a general and systematic disregard for the international human rights system . <p> South Africa became party to a number of human-rights treaties after 1994 reflecting the country 's commitment to upholding and advancing human-rights standards as a member of the international community . Becoming a member to one of the human-rights treaties places certain obligations on states , but it essentially means that the country must take active steps ( by adopting legislation , developing policies and implementing these ) to ensure that the rights contained in an international convention are a reality in the state concerned . <p> Being a party to a human-rights treaty also requires that a state reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example the UN Committee against Torture in respect of the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel , Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment .

Following a review , the treaty monitoring body will publish a short report on its assessment of the situation , noting both achievements and areas for further development . It will then formulate realistic recommendations for improvement . Importantly , state reporting is a basis for dialogue between the state and the independent experts of the treaty monitoring body . <p> During the first round of reporting to the various treaty monitoring bodies , South Africa did in general comply with reporting requirements but since then has generally failed to report .

These treaties reflect the importance of key democracy and governance features and are aimed at protecting vulnerable groups , such as women , children or people deprived of their liberty . <p> The ICCPR stands out in respect of reporting because South Africa has never submitted a report to the treaty monitoring body , the Human Rights Committee , after it ratified it in 1998 . In view of this , the Human Rights Committee has decided to review South Africa in the absence of a report in March 2015 .

The South African government was invited on five occasions to respond to the allegations made by McCallum , but failed to do so . In the end , the committee made its decision without input from the government . <p> While government officials and politicians are eager to tell the public about human rights and our liberal constitution , it appears that they are less than forthcoming when they have to report on an international level on actual measures taken to fulfil constitutional and human-rights treaty obligations . The fact of the matter is that there are indeed a number of notable achievements to report on , such as the recent criminalisation of torture in domestic law and the extent of social security provided to the poor .

The history of South Africa 's state reporting then reflects a retrogressive slide away from 1994 when the country was eager to be part of and participate in the international human-rights system to a situation where the government is effectively ignoring its reporting obligations and by implication distancing itself from the requisite international transparency and accountability . <p> Fortunately , the UN treaty monitoring bodies are not unfamiliar with poor reporting and will therefore do with South Africa what they have done with other poor reporting states , namely to take the exceptional measure of reviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves one not only with a sense of frustration but also shame , because this is not what we foresaw in 1994 . <p> Thank you Lucas for this article.I have been with DIRCO for years and tried to provide solutions to enable us to present our documents/country reports on time .

Our movement is founded principally to redress these historical injustices that continue to shape South Africa twenty years after democracy . Since , these injustices are founded on land dispossession , it therefore follows that any resolution of the historical dispossession and recreation of a new society with new values of true equality for all has to be driven by land redistribution . The Economic Freedom Fighters(EFF) have resolved to fight for land return as part of its generational mission as articulated in the founding manifesto of the party . <p> Several challenges face our movement towards realizing the task of land redistribution as a key determinant in achieving the goal of Economic Freedom in our life time . These basic questions are inter alia : How shall the land be redistributed ? How shall land be owned and by whom ( the land tenure regime ) ? What shall we do with the land once it has been reclaimed ? Furthermore , the paper shall deal with the concerned that rests in the question ; how shall our movement circumvent the real danger of imperialist sabotage ? Is such an attack inevitable ? What is the position of our movement between now and when EFF takes power ? This paper seeks to provide an overall frame work of understanding the land and agrarian questions as key questions of a thorough-going revolutionary project informed by the ideologue frame work of our movement which is the Marxist-Leninst-Fanonian perspective and outlook . <p> 1 ) The Creation of Modern Racist South Africa <p> There is no understanding the South Africa of today without understanding the history of land dispossession . There is no facet of SA society which is not implicated in the land question . The fact that we have two societies1 in one is direct outcomes of land theft . <p> The fact that we have been forced to adopt Europeans religion , cuisine , languages and identify is direct outcomes of the land question2 . Pre 1994 South Africa has been variously described as a settler colonial , colonialism of a special type and racial capitalist amongst others descriptions . All these descriptions in varying degree recognize the reality of modern South Africa as created principally by land dispossession . The creation of modern South Africa has to be located in 1652 with the arrival of white settlers in the cape shores . Jan van Riebeeck remains the symbolic father of settlerdom3 . <p> Modern South Africa is created out triple dispossessions4 . The primary dispossession is land dispossession which logically led to the two other dispossessions which is dispossession of African labour and finally and perhaps more devastatingly the dispossession of the African way of being . These triads of dispossessions are made possession by the original organizing logic of slavery which has reduced the African into a mere " thing amongst things " as Fanon avers . <p> The capturing of African as slaves and placed on the auction block with animals and also put on the plantation next to the oxen and whipped to create wealth and security for the white master had opened Africa for abuse and theft of not just the land but her people too . Land dispossession and attendant dispossessions correctly then are part of the second coming , which is colonialism of various types . The first transgression that links all black people in the world is slavery . <p> The reality of being captured was true for each and every African , therefore slavery affected even those who were not captured . What is key here is to recognize that the transgression against the black body provided lisence for the land related transgression by the West . Its almost impossible to imagine colonialism without slavery . <p> Its important to note that land dispossession was effected to power white supremacy and the relative racist industrialization of South Africa . The discovery of gold and diamond in the mid nineteenth century intensified the dispossession of African land and labour . <p> The proleretarianisation of the African was primarily to feed the labour needs of the new industries based on both diamonds and gold . Ironically , these discoveries also led to deepening of land dispossession to force African off the land to provide labour on farms and mines . Cecil John Rhodes was very honest about this process , he said " it must be brought to Africans that they will spend one tenth of their time providing labour " . <p> The hut tax that led to Bambatha to rebel in 1906 was essentially a scheme to force Africans into labour . The tax was to be paid in the coloniser 's currency . This means if one was not in the employment of whites then they had no means to pay the tax . The refusal to pay the colonial tax by Bambatha was essentially a refusal to surrender more of his people to the slavery of labour and also to the reality of landless . <p> The assault on the African sense of being is graphically described by Fanon as " ... colonialism is not satisfied merely by holding a people in its grip and emptying the native 's brains of all form and content ... itcolonialism turns to the past of the oppressed people and distorts , disfigures , and destroys it . " Once this process of mutilation of the African spirit and soul was complete , African identity laid fundamentally injured and traumatized . Shame and sense of inferiority generally defined what it means to be an African . <p> The great civilizations of Timbaktu and Kemetic discoveries lay shattered in the face of western destructive forces . The pyramids as testimony of superiority of life defined by the unison of science and the development of the spirit were equally defiled and stripped of its place in the in the Pantheon of world civilization . Once , the African was enslaved and colonized , all her achievement was disappeared under the lies of white supremacy . As Aime Cesaire ironically said referring to us blacks , " those who discovered nothing ! " . <p> To conceal the great sin committed against the African a massive machine of lies by erasure was invented by the West . The African , was then placed outside of history and humanity and blackened . White was life as black was death . The self-imagine of the Africa , was destroyed . The west impose itself by the sword and the gun . In essence land dispossession led to cultural dispossession too , therefore , ipso facto , the demand for land is the demand for cultural liberation of our people . <p> The outcomes of these inter linked dispossessions present themselves graphically today as the life of blacks in poverty and squalor on the one hand and the life of whites as charecterised by privilege and security on the other : township and suburbs ! Employer and employee , baas and boy , miesies and maid , Sandton and Alexander , metro rail and Gautrain , private hospital and public hospital , mansion and RDP house . <p> When we close our eyes and imagine these categories and the races that occupy them we can see , that the black has been forced into both a material and spiritual wasteland . Therefore , the call for land return , is essentially a call for redress of all dispossessions that have visited upon the African . Land return is essentially for the reparation of the haunted African soul and to create new social relations away from the current ones which are essentially racist and anti-black . Without land , there is no redressing the 350 years of dispossession and disfigurement of black life . <p> So the battle for a different South Africa was always depended on how best to deal with the land question . The first battle happened as soon as they colonialist arrived in the cape . It went on since 1652 to basically 1906 with the defeat of Bambatha . By 1913 the African was already disposed being . The infamous 1913 Land Act , was not the point of dispossession but a point of confirmation in law what has been achieved through superior arms in the battle field by the settler colonialist . The 1913 Land Act is therefore a mere codification into law of the fact of dispossession . <p> The formation of the African National Congress in 1912 , was part of the resistance to colonial occupation that never realy ended but only fluctuating with time and opportunity . It can be argued that the culmination of the resistance against the internal occupying force was the assumption of the armed struggle by the people 's army such as Umkhonto weSizwe ( MK ) and the Azanian People 's Liberation Army ( Apla ) . Whilest these armies mounted a brave battle against the settler regime they did not march to Pretoria victoriously . This reality is significant in understanding why after twenty years of democracy there has been no land redistribution . <p> 2 ) The Great Compromise <p> It is common knowledge that the post 1994 democratic settlement was the outcomes of a negotiated settlement . Whilst the balance of forces at the time suggests that there was stalemate , whereby the warring factions were forced to sit down and negotiate since none could claim victory and impose their will over the other . For the liberation forces this meant the much anticipated march to Pretoria by the victorious people 's movements was never to be , instead the matter was settled by negotiations . Negotiations are a matter of give and take . <p> What did the oppressed have to give at the negotiations table ? And on the other hand what did the oppressor offer ? An analysis of the balance sheet from the negotiations table shows that ultimately the oppressed exchange their birth right to land for political power . This political power , ironically , was rendered impotent as long as the representatives of the oppressed were willing to maintain their side of the bargain even long after its strategic utility had been achieved . <p> If in 1994 , such a compromise was necessary for the black majority to attain political power , then it was a wise move , however , once the conditions that necessitated the compromise were obliterated by the fact of the consolidation of the control of the former liberation movement on the levers of state power and the instrument of legitimate use of violence ( police , army , secret services etc ) and on the other the continued support of the overwhelming majority of our people on the other , then maintain the compromise meant simple a sell-out position and self-enslavement driven by cowardice and fear . This the elevates a tactical retreat into a strategic defeat and making virtue of out of refusal to use political power to complete the programme of decolonization5 . <p> Such a criminal refusal to use power to continue the logic of liberation war simple means the ruling party transformed itself into the body guards of white supremacy . Post 1994 , then became a normal neo-colony where those who fought the white settlers during the colonial/apartheid period had after assuming power continued with the same colonial/apartheid administration , which was established to privileged a settler white minority through violence and super exploitation of the black majority . Dr Chinweizu , coined the concept of " black colonialists " for the black rulers who took power and continued the same system they fought against . <p> The essential characteristic of this black colonialists or the comprador is the insertion of their economies into the global economic system of oppression to continue the same colonial relations of exporting raw materials to the " mother " country whilst importing finished goods and thereby sustain a colonial economy . The other arm of this system is maintaining the colonial relations of production by a mixture of violence and consent , but increasingly by violence more so when the native population forced into wage slavery demands part of the national wealth through a fair share in the profits through modest demands for a living wage or land . Under such conditions , the electoral process is used to legitimize the continued colonial relations . The refusal to end colonialism and apartheid is justified by the mantra that " the people voted for us " . Generally , such elections do not represent the will of the people because they are based on lies and the people have not completely yet arrive at a new radical political consciousness . <p> To return to the negotiation table . The oppressed through their representatives ( unelected at the time ) , offered land and the economy to the apartheid regime in exchange for political office . This agreement found expression in section 25 of the Constitution of South Africa . The section is drafted in a contradictory manner , reflecting the indetermined balance of forces at the time . <p> 3 ) The Property Clause <p> In this section we discuss the specificity of the property clause or section 25 of the Constitution . As indicated about its this clause which gives expression to the great 1994 political compromise . The full section is laid out below followed by a discussion on the key perspectives on the clause . <p> The Section 25 ( Property Clause ) is Drafted Thus : <p> 1 . No one may be deprived of property except in terms of law of general application , and no law may permit arbitrary deprivation of property . <p> 2 . Property may be expropriated only in terms of law of general application <p> a ) For a public purpose or in the public interest ; and <p> b ) Subject to compensation , the amount of which and the time and manner of payment of which have either been agreed to by those affected or decided or approved by a court . <p> 3 . The amount of the compensation and the time and manner of payment must be just and equitable , reflecting an equitable balance between the public interest and the interests of those affected , having regard to all relevant circumstances , including <p> a ) The current use of the property ; <p> b ) The history of the acquisition and use of the property ; <p> c ) The market value of the property ; <p> d ) The extent of direct state investment and subsidy in the acquisition and beneficial capital improvement of the property ; and <p> e ) The purpose of the expropriation . <p> 4 . For the purposes of this section <p> a ) The public interest includes the nation 's commitment to land reform , and to reforms to bring about equitable access to all South Africa 's natural resources ; and <p> b ) Property is not limited to land . <p> 5 . The state must take reasonable legislative and other measures , within its available resources , to foster conditions which enable citizens to gain access to land on an equitable basis . <p> 6 . A person or community whose tenure of land is legally insecure as a result of past racially discriminatory laws or practices is entitled , to the extent provided by an Act of Parliament , either to tenure which is legally secure or to comparable redress . <p> 7 . A person or community dispossessed of property after 19 June 1913 as a result of past racially discriminatory laws or practices is entitled , to the extent provided by an Act of Parliament , either to restitution of that property or to equitable redress . <p> 8 . No provision of this section may impede the state from taking legislative and other measures to achieve land , water and related reform , in order to redress the results of past racial discrimination , provided that any departure from the provisions of this section is in accordance with the provisions of section 36 ( 1 ) . <p> 9 . Parliament must enact the legislation referred to in subsection ( 6 ) . <p> The section dealing is one of the longest and most debated sections of the constitution . The debate turns on two primary questions , does the constitution as currently framed and amended allow for land expropriation or on the other hand , even if there is nothing that explicitly states that the South African land reform process envisaged by this section can only be meet constitutional muster if it 's based on the " willing buyer willing seller " principle which is essentially a principle that offends the demand for justice by those who have been historically dispossessed . <p> These debates on section 25 or the property clause , become technicist and excessively legalistic and and claims to be apolitical and thereby deeply ideological however masquerading as mere points of law . The fact that the ruling party has not tested these provisions by legislating for expropriation of land further leave the question open . EFF demands places land return outside the strictures of laws that would offend the return of land without compensation . <p> This exceeds the debate on section 25 , which has thus far pivoted on the quantum of compensation to be paid where expropriation was to be considered and not on whether compensation must not be considered at all . It 's important to emphasize this point , that the principal position of the EFF is Land Expropriation without Compensation . <p> The liberal constitutionalist view argues that , there is nothing in the SA constitution that prevents land redistribution and even expropriation but with " just and equitable " compensation " . It 's important to note that the liberal constitutionalists , take for granted that compensation shall be paid for land . Such compensation would as parts of section 25 indicates not be determined strictly by market value but other considerations too , read cumulatively and contextually . <p> This debate at the face of it seems reasonable because it argues that the right to land redistribution is protected in as much as the right to property is protected by the constitution . The million dollar question is where would a court of law likely to throw its weight in determining " just and equitable " compensation . How would the quantum of what is " just and equitable " be determined in a society governed by capitalist logic and jurisprudence ? <p> The retort from the radical political economist has been that law favors the holders of power and property and therefore any interpretation of " just and equitable " compensation left to the courts of law shall come to the same thing as market value and " willing buyer willing seller " , at best it becomes forced sales for land redistribution . <p> These political economists such as Lungisile Ntsebeza , Ricado Jacobs , Gillingwe Mayende6 and Sam Moyo , also posit the question , why should land as a political question be settled by courts of law not popular will ? This group of thinkers with varying degrees challenge the foundational assumptions of the Constitution which is based on treating both the settler and the native as if they have equal birth right to land . The underlying assessment is that such treatment of the matter is unethical , becuase land belongs to the natives ! <p> These radical economists and Africana philosophers such as Ramose and Mabogo More have highlighted the difficulty related to the supremacy of the constitution versus the supremacy of the Legislature . Constitutional supremacy is protected by section one of the constitution which seeks 75% votes for alteration . Any law that offends the constitution would accordingly be struck down . <p> These thinkers supported by some progressive judges7 insist that the first question to ask is , who drafted the constitution and in whose interests ? This question invites the questioning of the very Kempton Park agreement and insist that only a properly constituted Constituent Assembly can determine the matter . Incidentally , the actual drafters of the constitutions remain by and large a well-kept secret . The race , class and gender identity of such drafters would assist greatly in the deconstruction of the provisions of the supreme law of the land . <p> The Liberal Constitutionalists presents an ahistorical argument that assumes equality of things . Incidentally this view is the dominant view that calibrates the policy positions of the ruling party and official opposition . This argument sees nothing wrong with paying compensation so long as its " just and equitable " . What this means no one yet knows . But if we look at how the South African Constitutional Court settled the claims of the white Zimbabwean farmers who lost land due to the land redistribution programme in Zimbabwe then there is little to take solace from the courts . The Constitutional Court ruled in favour of the white farmers in 2013 . Judge president Mogoeng Mogoeng delivered the judgment and insisted that all governments in the SADC region are bound by the SADC Tribunal 's provision which protects property . This he concluded meant , compensation has to be paid whenever there is land expropriation . The decision meant property belonging to the Zimbabwean government in South Africa could be auctioned to pay the white farmers . <p> These developments seem to vindicate the position assumed by radical political economist , African philosophers and majority of landless people , that the land question left to the courts shall be settled in the interest of properly holders . Also a legalistic route is subject to never ending expensive processes with unpredictable out comes . These concerns gestures towards precisely the native idiom and logic on the land question . This idiom is informed by a basic idea that those who were dispossessed seek justice . <p> For the black majority land was stolen and therefore it must be returned without paying a cent . Paying any compensation for land or rather buying back our land offends the sense of justice and promotes illegality . From this perspective land expropriation without compensation is the most just and desired outcomes . <p> Accordingly , the laws of the country must conform to this popular and just logic . This is the logic that propelled all the warriors for land and decolonization throughout the African continent . It 's the same logic that drove the first political prisoner on Robben Island Achimao ( Harry die Strandlooper ) to ask Jan van Riebeeck the question : " between the indigenous people and the white settler who has the right over land ? " this is the fundamental question which can only be answered effectively by decolonization that is primarily the return of land to restore black dignity . <p> 4 ) SA 20 Years of Bad Policy on Land <p> South Africa is in total a country of 123 million hectares . 80% of this land is designated Agricultural land . After the long wars of land dispossession culminating in the 1913 Land Act , which legalized the land theft of African by giving whites 87% and Africans forced to only 13% of the land . In reality , today , less than 1% of the population own more than 80% of the land . In concrete terms only 40 000 white families own 80% of South African land . We are a nation of 53 million people ! It is known that about 22 million Africans need land desperately . Furthermore , we know that about a 700 000 people are farm workers ( including their families it comes to about 7 million people who live on farms as landless workers ) . <p> After 20 years of democracy only about 8% of the land has been bought back from those who stolen if from Africans . This is the fruits of the land policy of the ANC which is based on the Kempton Park compromise , from which springs the policy of willing buyer willing seller . The 8% of land bought to date has been bought by an obscene amount of about R50 billion since 1994 . Essentially South Africa has no land redistribution programme , the ruling party is paralysed by fear of white people on the one hand and on the other uncessarily upholds the 1994 compromise . If we follow the current pace of land rdistribution it would take almost 100 years to buy back only 30% of the land . <p> The current session of parliament has inherited about 15 Bills which shall come before parliament . All of these Bills are drafted to avoid and to pre-empt the proposals of the EFF for radical land redistribution through expropriation without compensation . The EFF must continue to expose the emptiness and deceptiveness of these Bills and reject them all . The most pernicious and dangerous policy proposal is one called the 50% equate for farm workers8 . This policy will only assist white farmers to evict farm workers and ensure the completion of the land dispossession process . <p> 5 ) Racist Agrarian Structure <p> Land dispossession helped to create a racist society with skewed land ownership between blacks and whites on the one hand , on the other created a racist agrarian structure which is socially discriminatory , economically exploitative and environmentally harmful . Essentially , the South African agrarian sector is sustained by racist feudalism , where black farm workers are mere slaves and the white farmers lords . Food production is driven by the profit motive . <p> The consequence is that the farm owning class makes massive profits from cheap labour , export markets and sales of food to the section of society which can afford . The result is food insecurity for the majority on the one hand , and harmful environmental activities on the other hand . The profit motive that drives the agrarian sector in SA leads to poisoning the soil and people with Genetically Modified Organisism ( GMOs ) . <p> The economic logic of the racist agrarian structure is slush and burn without investment . Consequently , those who work on farms are trapped in abject poverty and lack of benefits from industrialization and economic development , whilst the white farmer has access to all these benefits . Literally , in one farm we find the advanced technological secured life of the industrialized West and at the same time enclaves of rurality and third world squalor . <p> The agrarian sector is further divided between white commercial agriculture ( racist feudalism ) and the former banstustans ( local despotism ) . The commercial farming sector has all the modern benefits of technology , state assistance , access to finances and markets . The former banstustan sector is trapped in rurality , neglect and poverty . Incidentally , within the white commercial sector the conditions of farm workers are akin to those of the rural people in former homelands . <p> Its not just land ownership which is concentrated unjustly , but also the Agricultural sector is dominated by a few monopolies which produce most of the food that gets into the markets . The result of this is that there is no food security for majority , at least 42% of Africans are designated relatively poor and without food security and only 1% of whites suffer the same fate . <p> Black Shash tells us that up to 22% Africans are desperately poor in SA and not sure where the next meal will come from , but these Agriculture monopolies are making shocking profits and even produce for the European markets when people are starving here in SA . The logic of the current Agricultural sector puts profits before people and that must change . <p> The South African agricultural sector is not only racist and lopsided but also its inefficient and wasteful . The sector contributes less 5% to the GDP . It employs about 700 000 poorly treated and super exploited farm workers . This alone makes the sector a perfect candidate for expropriation . <p> The sector could answer most employment needs by hiring millions of small scale producers , millions of well paid farm workers , reduce food inflation and move our people from the humiliation of food insecurity that has lead to the belief that the offal is " African Food " , now our people eat chicken feet . The question is who eats the steak and chicken ? Our people should not be condemned to " Mala-Mogodu " out of economic compulsion , but out of culinary choice based on democratic access to diverse foods in our land . <p> 6 ) Farm Workers <p> The situation of farm workers deserves special mention because they are the people who feed the nation but are the mostly oppressed and exploited on our farms . Every morning when you go to the fridge to get milk you must spare a thought for those who made sure you can have breakfast , these people who themselves are under fed and badly paid and treated . This are the people the ANC and DA have agreed should be paid R105 a day ! We know most do n't even get this amount . <p> We must never forget this : these farm workers are descendent of people who owned the land they are today forced to work for next to nothing ! Most of the current farm workers have histories on the land that it 's much longer that most owners . In other words the land belong to the people now working as servants of the white farmers ! <p> Farm workers , are everyday abused on farms , they get killed with no justice ( remember the Lion Case ? It 's not the only one ) . Farm workers are denied burial rights ( landless in life and in death ) , they are everyday evicted from land . EFF will prioritise these landless farmers who already doing most of the farming without recognition of proper compensation for their efforts . Farm workers are slaves , we must end slavery on farms by fairer redistribution of land . <p> A new agrarian revolution must accompany any reform of the land sector . The relations of production of farms must move away from the current racist feudalism charactered by exploitation of people and the environment to a new relations based on putting people before profits and protection of the environment whilst ensuring food security and sovereignty for all . In other words , farm workers must be freed from the ongoing slavery on farms . Furthermore , such a new agrarian structure must end the divide between country and town . The former homelands , must be governed by a democratic system that undermines feudal relations and free people from local despotism and liberate women from patriarchal relations . All these changes must be driven by a democratic land tenure system9 . <p> Farm workers must receive their own land to carve their own autonomous lives not bound to the employment . Secondly , farm workers must receive a minimum wage of no less R5000 a month to break the racist relations of production on farms . <p> 7 ) Land Expropriation without Compensation ! <p> The first and fundamental process towards decolonizing South African land ownership is the return of land through the principle of land expropriation without compensation . The land belongs to the people as a whole and must be returned to the people as such . This principle goes beyond the limitations of the " willing buyer-Willing seller " and also resolves the colonial idiom over land ownership and control once and for all . Any resolution of the land question that does n't not conform to this logic is bound to prolong colonial relations and white supremacist nature of South African society . There are not progressive or convincing arguments against land expropriation without compensation in colonial societies such as South Africa . <p> 8 ) How will Land Expropriation be realized ? <p> There are about three forms of land redistribution . First is the overthrow of the landed gentry in a revolutionary process driven by demand for land , such as in Russia in 1917 , the Chinese revolution in 1957 , the Cuban Revolution in 1959 , the Zanzibar revolution of 1962 , the Mozambiqean revolution of 1975 , these are some of the well-known revolutionary processes that leads to immediate agrarian revolution . Amongst the first and most impressive and clear decrees issued by Lenin in Russian immediately after the revolution was the Land Decree which ended the brutal feudal system in Russian . It 's worth reproducing parts of the 1917 decree , <p> a ) " Landed proprietorship is abolished forthwith without any compensation . <p> b ) The landed estates , as also all crown , monastery , and church lands , with all their livestock , implements , buildings and everything pertaining thereto , shall be placed at the disposal of the land committees and the Soviets of Peasants ' Deputies pending the convocation of the Constituent Assembly . <p> c ) All damage to confiscated property , which henceforth belongs to the whole people , is proclaimed a grave crime to be punished by the revolutionary courts . The Soviets of Peasants ' Deputies shall take all necessary measures to assure the observance of the strictest order during the confiscation of the landed estates , to determine the size of estates , and the particular estates subject to confiscation , to draw up exact inventories of all property confiscated and to protect in the strictest revolutionary way all agricultural enterprises transferred to the people , with all buildings , implements , livestock , stocks of produce , etc. " 10 <p> a ) This declaration is great guide to the kind of decrees necessary to march society from one epoch to the next . It also shows the revolutionary clear mindedness of the Bolsheviks and determination to end feudalism to usher into a new society . Furthermore , the decree is aware of the imperial and class enemies plans to sabotage any agrarian revolution . Measures to deal with all these challenges at the same time are fundamental to a successful land and agrarian revolution . <p> b ) Land expropriation during a revolution or revolutionary scenario is the most effective means to address the land question . But states can after a revolution also undertake revolutionary land programmes , or even democratic means to so . The Zimbabwean revolution was based on the demand for land . It escalated into an armed conflict for decolonisation and ended with the Lancaster House compromise not different from the Kempton Park settlement . The significant provision of the Lancaster Agreement was that for the first ten years 1980 to 1990 , the revolutionary government was bound to a ' willing buyer- willing seller " arrangement with both Britain and the USA promising to pay for all land bought from the white settler minority which was defeated in the Chimurenga . <p> c ) Needless to say by the end of the decade both Britain and the USA had reneged on their part to the agreement . For the next decade land reform had stalled . It was only in the beginning of the 2000s with the crisis created by the World Bank 's Structural Adjustment Programmes , that the war veterans demanded land be returned without compensation . Within a difficult two years period land was redistributed to more than 275 000 black families , benefitting millions , and on the other hand resolving the colonial structure of the economy whereby between 4000 and 6000 white farmers owned 80% of the Zimbabwean land . The reaction of the imperial world was swift , with economic sabotage of Zimbabwe11 . <p> d ) Two key lessons from Zimbabwe is that first , expropriation of land can not happen outside the total control of the economy and ensuring food production continues . Secondly and mostly importantly it is important to ensure that political connectivity does not subvert an equitable redistribution of land . The land reform and redistribution model must be explicitly biased towards the ordinary people and politicians as far possible not be in the front of the queue preferable be served last . <p> e ) The Venezuelan example is another lesson in how state led land redistribution of land within a democratic system is possible . The Venezuelan example has inspired many Latin American countries to buck the neo-liberal hegemony and to for the expropriation of land and other minerals . The same processes have been undertaken in Bolivia and Ecuador amongst others . The Venezuelan model is derived from a radical state , supported by a highly radical and conscious people . The mains means of legalising land redistribution is the law . The revolutionary and exemplary leadership of Hugo Chavez ensured popular support for the radical measures which benefited people and ended the power of the landed gentry . <p> f ) The third important measures for land redistribution is the reclamation of land by people in unfavorable conditions such as during a guerilla war , through the creation of " liberated territory " . Here the state is hostile to the revolutionary demands of the people for land , then the people through their own revolutionary action and often guided by their vanguard movement but also spontaneously reclaim land at great cost to themselves . Often such a process is raven with state terror and mass slaughtering of peasants and the poor not unlike the Marikana Massacre . People 's land redistribution within hostile environment is often part of building resistance towards a revolutionary process to overthrow the existing order . Today , the most significant movement has been the Landless Workers Movement in Brazil otherwise known as the MST . This movement through its own struggles has liberated massive amounts of land and established some of the most productive farming processes even recognised by the United Nations . But the struggle is not easy , despite the constitution of Brazil legalizing land occupations on unused land . Often members of MST are murdered and arrested . <p> g ) We have alluded to three main means of land reclamation above , firstly during a revolution , secondly , by a progressive state siding with the landless and lastly , through people 's own activity during a hostile time as part of building an environment for revolutionary change . It is important to therefore , locate where the South African situation is to determine what cause of action is most productive and lead to the balance of forces on the side of the poor , landless and popular majority whose liberation and livelihoods depends on successful land redistribution . The land and agrarian strategy elaborated has to be based on a firm grasp of the political context of today and how progressively this must be changed through a combination of interventions . <p> 9 ) Accessing Land in SA Today <p> There are two broad realities under which land be accessed . First , is under conditions where EFF is not in power . The second is when EFF is in power or under revolutionary conditions . Each reality demands a different tactical and political process . Below we discuss what EFF should do to increase the possibility of revolutionary government and land redistribution through a series of interventions , including how to use parliament to strengthen the development of mass revolutionary movement outside parliament . The strategy is to strangulate the forces of reaction with a double dialectical move at once whose rhythm resonated with outside-inside motion . <p> 9.1 ) Parliament <p> 9.1.1 ) Substantive Motions <p> As a Leninst Party , the EFF shall agitate at multiple levels for land redistribution programme . First , access to parliament shall be used to move substantive motions for " Expropriation of Land without compensations " at every opportunity . A debate on this motion in the national assembly shall be agitated for . The arguments for land exproriation without compensation remains a superior logic within the reality of white racism of the South Africa society . Such a motion shall educate the masses of our and also expose the reactionary nature of the parliamentary parties and reveal more the revolutionary character of our party to the suffering majority of our people . Within this tactical move , the argument whether the South African Constitution allows for expropriation without compensation shall be clarified more . <p> 9.1.2 ) Amend Section 25 <p> EFF shall agitate for the total amendment of section 25 of the constitution to allow for expropriation without compensation and has offered its 6.2% towards realizing a two thirds majority to make the amendment possible . This offer is a revolutionary gesture that insists on the resolution of the land question as part of a national agenda beyond partisan party process . But it 's also an offer that makes all parties that refuse it exposed for their neo-apartheid nature and servants of the white landed classes and preservers of the anti-black status qou . It shall become clear to our people that only EFF with a two thirds majority can realise land redistribution , because of its revolutionary character . The question has to be asked , why is the ruling party rejecting the call for amending section 25 ? <p> 9.1.3 ) Referendum ! <p> Should the motion for land and expropriation be defeated in the National Assembly ( NA ) , EFF must call for a referendum on whether our people agree to buy back the stolen land . This is so because , the NA is constituted by only 400 people and the land question were never put on a plebiscite . The question to vote for is a simple yes ! or no ! on " Should South Africa buy back land from white land owners " ? This motion would also ignite national debate and education and also develop radical consciousness . <p> Should the NA refuse the referendum call , then EFF must undertake such a process with civil society and church and launch the , " 1 million say YES to land redistribution ! " Campaign . After the campaign has secured the 1 million votes , EFF should be undertaken and mass action to force the National Assembly to undertake a referendum and test the popular will on the question . EFF must return power to the people and insist on the democratic participation of our people on the resolution of the land question . Land is too important to be left to only 400 people ! <p> 9.1.4 ) National Land Conference <p> To fortify national consciousness and to win over allies to the EFF position on land , it is proposed that a land conference be held in 2015 June . This conference to include all the landless formations , churches , land civil society , researchers an expers . The conference shall take stock of the land reform programmne in South Africa and test some of the proposals of the EFF with a broad range of society players . Such a conference shall have an international lessons component form societies which has carried land redistribution . It is strong suggested that a fact finding mission to Zimbabwe be carried out as part of the preparations for the conference . <p> 9.1.5 ) Support Land Demand in Cape Town <p> Also EFF shall support the spontaneous land occupation movement and seek to guide it . In the specific case of the Western Cape and Cape Town in particular , EFF has to undertake campaigns inside parliament to insist that a permanent solution is found the annual shack fires and floods which often put people in the most distressing conditions for weeks and often leads to deaths by shack fires and floods . These annual tragic events are preventable and an indication of the urban land question . Parliament is in Cape Town and these developments also happen in Cape Town . EFF must undertake massive campaigns for parliament to respond to this predictable and unacceptable reality for the poor of Cape Town . <p> 9.1.6 ) Lessons from Philippines <p> The limitations of using progressive laws outside the existence of a progressive movement is what is happening right now in the Philippines . In 2009 the Pilipino government inacted a radical land redistribution law , which amongst others prescribed that land can be redistributed without or little compensation from large scale land owners to the land hungry . The Comprehensive Agrarian Reform Program Extension with Reforms , or CARPER , was praised by all progressive people and celebrated by landless peasants . But five years since its promulgation , the peasants and landless have not benefited from this progressive land law . <p> The main reason as articulated by professor Walden Bello is that the government or bureaucracy that was meant to carry out the land policy was reactionary and therefore subverted the policy at implementation level . It is therefore , important that any land redistribution law is supported and driven by a mass movement and does n't not take away the power of the people but supports it . The Philippine example shows that it 's possible to have progressive laws but reactionary bureaucracies and therefore undermine the very progressive laws . All means must be undertaken not to surrender land redistribution to professionals within the state system . The state must support and protect the people who must play a central role in the agrarian revolution . <p> 10 ) Mass Action Outside Parliament <p> Following these processes described above , EFF must consider a return to land campaign . 2017 must be declared the year of land return ! This campaign , following the exhaustion of the parliamentary process , the education of our people , and mobilizing towards the 1 million yes campaign , must engage all the landless people of the country to undertake land return to the people . Many communities have laid claim since 1994 , and the re-opening of the Restitution process shall attract even more landless people who shall not see any land in their lifetimes under the current land reform regime . <p> Add to this number the urban landless and farm workers . This land return campaign , recognises that South African under the ruling party is hostile to land redistribution and therefore building mass power to reclaim land outside the state process is the only realistic option open to the people . However , to arrive at this conclusion , EFF needs mass support and understanding , hence all the parliamentary processes must be understood as part of building a radical consciousness and people 's power from the base . <p> During this period , EFF as the vanguard of protest movement shall support all spontaneous action for land both rural and urban . Furthermore EFF shall also support all people 's action against evictions from land and housing because all these questions are linked back to the original land question . These spontaneous actions would be imbued with long term revolutionary capacity and further calibrated to expose the true nature of the bourgeoisie democratic order that put stolen property above the interest of the masses . <p> 11 ) How Shall Land be Owned and by whom ( The Land Tenure Regime ) ? <p> EFF is committed to land for all the people of the country on an equitable basis . All those who need land shall be given land at no cost to themselves . The state shall remain the custodian of all the land in the country . Land access shall be done by a simple application , as simple as an application for a grant . Any citizen shall state the purpose for which the land is being applied for and the state shall provide such an applicant with the land within the set limits and land uses permitted for such land in the area in question . <p> Each citizen above the age of 18 shallow be allowed use of land for 25 years on a renewable licensing system . The state shall not arbitrarily refuse re-licensing to land owners . Licenses can only be revoked if the land use to which the land user was granted has not been realized . The state shall also allow reasonable alterations of the land use agreement . <p> There shall be democratic land use committee within each district with gender parity representation . These committees shall assist the state in management and monitoring of land uses including awarding of land use licenses . There shall be land tribunals at provincial level to deal with land disputes that are not resolvable at local and district level . A national land arbitration council shall be the instant of final appeal . <p> 12 ) State Shall be the Sole Owners of All Land <p> The state shall be sole land owner in the country , holding such land in trust for the people as a whole . Land shall stop to be a commodity , in other words , no land shall be sold and bought . Land shall be accessed without paying a cent to all those who need it both black and white . All shall apply to the state for land use licenses . Foreigners shall be allocated land for use only not land shall be sold . <p> 13 ) Bond Repayment to be reduced to 10 Years ! <p> The price land which is part of current value of mortgages shall be immediately subtracted from the bond value . This would reduce the current exorbitant bond prices and contribute to the policy of reducing bond repayment to less than ten years as proposed by the EFF . <p> 14 ) Which Land shall be except from Expropriation ? <p> Land Expropriation does n't not apply to residential areas or the housing stock . The EFF government shall not expropriate houses of individuals or residential land . A set size for residential property shall be set and multiple ownership of land not permitted but leasing on a 99 year period for such housing shall be permitted . <p> Land that is currently managed or held in trust under the traditional leadership shall also be subjected to the same rule as private agricultural and industrial land . In other words , land currently administered by chiefs shall revert to the state and all citizens shall apply for land use . Apply for land use licenses include land for cultural , traditional and spiritual uses . Land shall be managed by democratically elected committees with 100% gender representation . It must be emphasized that the EFF land redistribution policy is not about dispossessing our people but addressing land dispossession , therefore , the net effect of these interventions shall lead to more land than land dispossession . <p> 16 ) National Question <p> The land question is directly linked to the national question ( NQ ) , which is about overcoming the colonial tribal divisions , apartheid artificial identities and end to white supremacy . The resolution of the NQ is basically about creating new society based on values of equality and democracy for all . To this extent any recreation of tribal enclaves and consciousness that threatens to undermine the development of national consciousness must be rejected . <p> The reopening of the land restitution claims must be seen within the context of the ruling party 's attempt to bribe the kings and chiefs to deliver the rural vote . To attain this the ruling party has gone into a reckless revival of tribal identities , with the real consequence of tribal warfare based on overlapping claims and land being given or rather the promise of land access through tribal affiliation instead of need and citizenship . <p> The re-opening of the Restitution of Land Rights or the claims process must be rejected as a dangerous return to the Bantustan divisions to maintain " local despotism " and subjecting large sections of our to the status of subjects instead of citizens12 . This is done for the same logic as apartheid did , to divide and rule . The urban voters are increasingly shedding the illusion that ANC is a liberation movement and voting for radical transformation . The ruling party seeks to bulkanise the country to ensure electoral support through taking care of the chiefs and kings and subverting democracy and building a new nation . Land must never be accessed on the basis of tribal affiliation . The land and all its wealth belong to the people as a whole not to tribal enclaves . <p> The role of traditional leadership is not to administer land but to oversee the cultural life of the people and to assist in developing our cultures further to strengthen the African revolutionary spirit and revival of the black self to attain total mental and physical liberation . Land and all its riches belong to the people as a whole . <p> 17 ) What Shall We Do With The Land Once It Has Been Reclaimed ? <p> Often rural development is used as ruse to deny the legitimacy of land redistribution . This logic must be exposed for what it is . As part of responding to the colonizing discourses on land , there is a need to place the question squarely : LAND MUST BE RETURNED BECAUSE IT BELONGS TO BLACK PEOPLE ! That 's the first principle . What we would do with the land is none of the business of the land thieves . We want back because it 's ours ! That there shall be a new efficient black farming class and that land shall be used productively is secondary question . We want it back even if it 's to look at it every morning and cry out loud IZWE-LETHU ! <p> 18 ) Rural Development <p> Rural Development is central to the agrarian revolution . It must end the current profit motive that dominates agricultural production . Rural development must end the slave and master relations on farms and also end the town and rural divisions between town and country . Land redistribution and obliteration of the power of the landed racial lords on commercial farms and feudal in former homelands is central to a new agrarian system that responds to the needs of people and the environment . <p> 19 ) The following measures shall be taken by an EFF government . <p> a ) The EFF Government 's ideological , political and programmatic approach to ruraldevelopment is inspired by the notion that there should be " Combination ofagriculture with manufacturing industries ; gradual abolition of all the distinctionbetween town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace overthe country " . <p> b ) The EFF 's view of rural development is not trapped in the notion that the rurality ofrural areas should be left intact , instead , rural areas should begin to partake in realeconomic activities and programmes , which should be supported and financed bythe State . <p> c ) The EFF Government custodianship of all land will lead into equal redistribution of allland amongst all people . <p> e ) The EFF Government will revive abandoned factories in the townships and ruralareas . <p> f ) The EFF Government will help chicken farmers with state owned hatcheries , abattoirs and chicken processing factories which will be at the centre of growing andassisting the production of chicken products . <p> g ) The EFF Government will help small agriculture to gain sustainable access to marketsthrough increasing state consumption of food and agricultural products from smallscale farmers , compelling food retailers to buy food and agricultural products locallyand opening African and world food markets . <p> h ) The EFF government shall pass laws to prohibit the production of GeneticallyModified Organism ( GMOs ) specifically maize , the staple diet of the people . <p> i ) National campaigns shall be undertaken to educate the nation about the dangers ofGMOs . <p> j ) Institutions of higher learning shall be required to provide courses in ruraldevelopment to prepare graduates for national service . <p> Imperialism and global racist elements are expected to react to the mass land redistribution through Expropriation Without Compensation just like they did in Zimbabwe . The strategy of imperial sabotage is based on mass terror , starvation and attacks on the economy of progressive government including running on the currency of such nations to instigate unmanageable inflation to strangulate the people to submission through hunger and economic hardships . <p> Our people must be educated and prepared for this reaction and the revolutionary government must be prepared to defend national soverignity and ameliorate the impact of such expected imperial attack . The fact that imperialism shall respond in these ways should not be a deterant to the radical agenda but a motivation to plan better . EFF is driven by revolutionary courage and shall not be intimidated into submission by bully tactics of imperialism and representatives of settler colonialism . <p> The first line of defense is ideological front . Our people must be educated about the truth of the country right now . The fact that only 40 000 families own 80% of the South African land . That only 8% redistributed in 20 years and it would take more than 100 years to redistribute only 30% of through the willing buyer willing seller at more than R200 billion rand . Our people must be educated about the truth that land was stolen from the African majority . The vanguard Party must also brought to the consciousness of the people the food insecurity of the majority and the ignity that we have been reduced to chicken feet eater people by the humiliation of racism and landlessness . The Party must raise the consciousness of the people to desire true liberation and to lead dignified lives as free citizens . <p> It is important to counter the imperialist propaganda against the Zimbabwean land Chimurenga or land revolution . The truth must be told about who destroyed the Zimabwean economy and why and how . The truth must be further be told about how the Zimabwean economy is currently being stabilized and the historic revival of the agricultural sector now black owned . The success of the tobacco industry , cotton and maize must be elevated and exposed . <p> To complete this task it would be important that EFF organizes fact finding missions to Zimbabwe including taking the mainstream media with so that the truth is exposed and our people get a fair picture of developments in Zimbabwe . Yes the Zimbabwean people have come under heavy global imperialist attack , there is no denying the massive negative consequences of these attacks . EFF is aware of these and therefore should plan better for such eventuality . The lessons from Zimbabwe must not be forgotten as the movement marches forward to a new land and agrarian reality based on decolonization . <p> Other key measures includes setting up and training Red Brigades which shall ensure production on farms continues and food gets into the shelves during the period of expropriation . The state shall criminalise any sabotage of food production and penalty shall not be less than treason . Farm workers shall be prioritized for political education , supported as producers and defended as new farmers to ensure continuity of production at all times . The fact that about 80% of South African food that gets to the market is produced by about 5000 Agricultural corporation is an advantage for the revolutionary government . This makes monitoring of any politically motivated food supply sabotage much an easier task . <p> The vanguard party shall imbue our people with warrior spirit the Marikana Warriors . We chose to die on our feet than to live on our knees . We prepare for battles ahead ! <p> Footnotes : <p> 1 The two nations thesis was convincingly articulated by former president Thabo Mbeki , where he showed that there was a white South Africa which is saturated by privilege and there was black South African which was defined by poverty and exclusion . <p> 5 A tactical retreat in war is part of the ethic of battle . If one set out to get to point B which is well defined , but in the road one was faced with an obstacle such as a mountain , on cost benefit analysis one could choose a detour instead of climbing the impossible terrain . But moving sideways is only temporary till one gets the strategic advantage to proceed to point B. the liberation movement forgot the strategic vision of liberation and accepted the necessary de tour as the destination and therefore sold out the original vision of liberation . <p> 6 Dr Gilingwe Mayende is a former Director General in Department of Land Affairs . He worked in that capacity for almost a decade and argues that section 25 as amended ultimately sanctions the " willing buyer , - willing seller " principle . He is like most radical economist arguing for the amendment of the section . <p> 7 Judge Siraj Desai has publicity began to question the foundations of the constitution on property . <p> 9 Land Tenure , refers to land holding system and management of land . basically , how land must be used , accessed and managed and by whom ? Who owns the land ? is part of the tenure arrangement regimes . <p> 10 " The Decree on Land , written by Lenin , was passed by the second congress of soviets of workers , Second Congress of Soviets of Workers ' , Soldiers ' and Peasants ' Deputies on 26 October 1917 , following the success of the October Revolutution . It decreed an abolition of private property , private and the redistribution of the landed estates amongst the peasantry " <p> 11 The Economic attack on the Zimbabwean Economic to punish Zanu-PF for taking the historic measures has been deep . Its enoucouraging to see that the economic hardships are now getting resolved and the Zimbabwean people own their land and thereby rendering Zimbabwe the only truly liberated African country in Sab-Saharan Africa .

Preaching on the streets is not a prerequisite but church leaders encourage it . <p> No special qualifications neededThere are no special qualifications for a person to take to the streets . Ultimately , anyone who believes that God has selected him or her -- and who does not have stage fright -- can start spreading the gospel . <p> Another preacher , David Balugambe ( 56 ) , who says he has been a Bible teacher and a church pastor for many years , insists he is on the streets because of sheer zeal . <p> " I surrendered my life to Jesus Christ " , says Balugambe , who travels from Kasengejje on the outskirts of Kampala to the heart of the capital five days a week to preach from 4.30 in the afternoon to 8pm . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postal services on Kampala Road , the city 's main thoroughfare , Balugambe says : " The devil is always at work but God will bring us victory . " <p> Freedom of worshipUgandans have not always been free to worship on the streets . In the 1970s during the reign of Idi Amin , himself Muslim , evangelical churches were banned . <p> The country suffered through civil war until 1986 when the bush fighter Museveni came to power . His reign has seen the return of freedom of worship . <p> Evangelicalism profited from a sense of disappointment among Christian Ugandans who came to associate the Catholic and Anglican churches with the politics that they held responsible for much of the chaos that had consumed Uganda after independence in 1962 . <p> Evangelicalism , with its individual loyalty to God , offered a promising alternative to the established , hierarchical churches that had increasingly come to be viewed as unaccountable , according to British academic Paul Gifford in his 1997 study , African Christianity : Its Public Role in Uganda and Other African Countries . <p> In a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political " rebirth " of Uganda . <p> Gifford also highlights the role of faith-based , Western nongovernmental organisations in the spread of evangelicalism in Uganda . <p> After becoming president , Museveni put Uganda on the path of economic liberalisation and privatisation as prescribed by the Bretton Woods institutions . The vacuum left by the state was filled by foreign NGOs which , over time , became a sort of shadow government , providing basic services and jobs and education to the population . Some of them spread the Christian gospel . <p> Evangelicalism also attracts followers because of the prosperity it promises . <p> " Poverty and population growth drive more and more people to the evangelical churches where they pay the little money they have in the false hope of a miracle " , says a 31-year-old self-employed businessperson in Kampala who asked not to be named .

The services are not as boring as those of other churches , especially the Catholic one . " <p> Regardless of all this , the street preachers have their own explanation for the rapid spread of evangelicalism . <p> " God has called upon Uganda to replace Israel , " says Katende . " We bring the faith to all other nations of the world -- like how Uganda is also the source of the Nile , the world 's longest river . " <p> Ugandans sometimes proudly refer to their country as " the pearl of Africa " . In variance on this nickname , Katende refers to Uganda as " the pearl of the Lord " . <p> Pieces of yellow paper decorate the walls of Katende 's rickety church building in Kampala 's slum area of Ndeeba .

This constituted a decrease compared with 1991 , when Catholics still represented 44.5% and Anglicans 39.2% of the population . <p> In 1991 Pentecostalism was not yet recognised as a separate affiliation on formal data collection forms . -- Mark Schenkel

He is CEO of Pareto , a big property investor which is ultimately owned by the South African government . In this piece , Muller says the property sector charter allows for more gradual implementation of Black Economic Empowerment , however property companies have been " sluggish " in meeting their own targets . The next step is for revised legislation and codes to kick in . More ownership needs to shift to non-white hands . Muller points out , too , that empowerment at executive level needs an overhaul too . With only 11 of 78 listed property executive director positions filed by black people -- and only one woman -- he has a point . -- JC <p> By Marius Muller* <p> The deadline to align the Property Sector Transformation Charter with the DTI 's Revised B-BBEE Act and Codes is looming . The sector is running out of time to adapt its charter and , if it does n't make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the property industry will automatically adopt the revised DTI BEE codes . This will place it under immense pressure to speed up transformation . <p> Marius Muller , Pareto CEO , warns property companies that they are a long way off from complying with BEE requirements . <p> With the new codes there 's a great opportunity to relook how the property sector achieves BEE and ensure it is done in a sustainable way . In general , the sector has made slow transformation progress . After 20 years of democracy , we should be seeing more change . There 's more that we can do . We should want to do better . <p> The first BEE Codes were introduced in 2007 , after which the Property Sector Transformation Charter was separately legislated but , following a review , the South African Government revised the BEE Codes in October 2013 . The sector has to the end of April 2015 to ensure its charter is compliant with the new codes . <p> Much work was done by the sector to legislate its own transformation charter , so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standards set out by the DTI , and move forward as an industry . <p> The property charter allows for more gradual implementation of BEE , compared with the revised BEE codes , which would result in greater transformation , faster . <p> The big change in the revised codes is the adherence to a minimum score in three areas : ownership , skills development , and enterprise and supply development . A business must score a minimum of 40% of their target in the each of these areas , or it will drop a BEE level . <p> However , the implications for the property sector go beyond this . <p> The real challenge for the property sector is that it enjoyed certain concessions previously , which translated into lower transformation targets and this manifested in slower implementation of BEE . He points out that even with these lower targets , the sector is making sluggish progress . <p> And , should the alignment of the Property Charter fail to meet its deadline , it could leave the listed property sector , in particular , scrambling to make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sector , black ownership must be over 25% for transformation to have taken place . In the case of most listed companies , 40% of ownership is mandated because of shareholding by pension funds , which have a broad base of policyholders . So , listed companies are required to achieve 25% black ownership of the remaining 60% shareholding , or 15% black ownership . Yet for listed property companies , the level of mandated investment is 70% . So they only need 7.5% black ownership to be transformed . <p> Business outside of the property sector has generally been given 10 years to reach there 15% black ownership targets , whereas listed property companies have 20 years to achieve their targets , ie the reduced 7.5% . Given that , nearly 10-years down the line , the property sector is nowhere near its halfway mark of 3.75% of black ownership , it is clear there is a lack of transformation in the sector . From a sustainability perspective , this puts the sector at a disadvantage . <p> It 's not the principle that 's the problem . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful with their transformation and I acknowledge their efforts , so we need to consider why it is n't happening in the property sector and how we can do it differently to make it work in future . As an industry we really do have a responsibility to openly and honestly discuss our contribution to transformation , particularly given the sensitivity and legacy of property ownership in South Africa . <p> Transformation starts with the people driving the process . Pareto has a Level One BEE rating -- all members of its executive team are black and Pareto also has female and disabled representivity . <p> In the listed property sector today , there is little transformation in executive teams . A recent IPD study , which excluded dual listed and internationally domiciled companies , revealed that only 11 of the 78 listed property executive director positions are filled by black persons and only one is female .

Black leadership is the most economical and effective way of achieving transformation , we should be seeing more . <p> While the future of transformation in the property sector is a big issue , Muller is adamant it should n't be an emotive issue . We need to look at the facts and figures and ensure they make sense . What is crystal clear is that we 're running out of time to ensure compliance with the revised BEE Codes for the sector .

@@2908239 <h> Do we need a firearms amnesty ? <p> 06 November 2014 , 12:00 <p> In recent weeks firearm related crime has been a very important topic of discussion . In one of the recent developments Gun Free South Africa spokesperson Adele Kirstein , George Bezos and some other prominent public figures announced in a press conference that they will be asking parliament to pass a no questions asked firearms amnesty and they asked the public to join them in marching on parliament . <p> What is the purpose of this firearms amnesty ? The stated purpose is to allow people in possession of illegal firearms an opportunity to hand in those firearms to the police without fear of prosecution . That sounds very good , does n't it ? But let us think about it for a moment . Who are the people with illegal firearms ? Are they law abiding citizens who somehow found themselves in possession of a firearm and who are just looking for an opportunity to legally get rid of something that they did not want ? Or , are they criminals who use firearms to rob , intimidate and kill ? Who will benefit from the amnesty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And if we think about it further ; will these criminals eagerly rush to the nearest police station to hand in their illegal firearms ? You may get some who will go and hand in their illegal firearms , but most will see it as an opportunity to commit more crime . Mr Criminal will most likely be thinking that he should go and rob and intimidate and kill some more , as long as he does n't get caught and as long as he hands in his illegal firearm before the amnesty runs out , he will suffer no consequences . <p> We desperately need to instil respect for the law in our criminal underclass . One why to instil respect for the law in the public at large and also in criminals is to demonstrate that criminal actions have consequences . Should a firearms amnesty be passed it will demonstrate the exact opposite , criminals will be given permission to do what they want , as long as they hand in their illegal weapons before the amnesty expires . <p> There are some otherwise law abiding citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring to a particularly vulnerable section of our society . People living in disadvantaged communities where there are also high crime rates . These disadvantaged citizens has been prevented from obtaining legal firearms since our existing firearms laws makes it difficult and expensive to obtain a licence for a firearm . These are the people who obtain an illegal firearm with the sole purpose of protecting themselves and their loved ones and they are forced to break the law to do so . Change the firearm amnesty to benefit this section of our society as well as other law abiding citizens . Instead of creating a no questions asked amnesty , create an amnesty where a person is given an opportunity to obtain a legal license for his firearm on condition that he can prove to the police that he has n't committed any crimes with his firearm . <p> Other law abiding citizens who may benefit from a conditional amnesty are people who may have inherited firearms . They want to keep it because it 's an heirloom from their father or grandfather , but they do n't go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it nearly impossible . Allow these people to step forward and obtain a legal firearm licence for these heirlooms . <p> What we need is not a firearm amnesty . We need effective law enforcement . We need the government to stop spending money frivolously and allocate more resources to the police and the courts . Put more policemen on the street , put more magistrates and judges in the courts , train those extra policemen , judges and magistrates and start locking the criminals up . I will agree with Mr Bezos that the death penalty might not be the answer , but neither is an amnesty which will only encourage further criminal behaviour . <p> Gun Free South Africa also wants to remove legal firearms from the hands of law abiding citizens thereby depriving the man in the street of his best defence against criminal attack . When you are being attacked the police wo n't be there to protect you , they will only arrive later to investigate the crime which has already been committed and hopefully track down the perpetrator . By that time the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as citizens are allowed the means to effectively defend ourselves there will be fewer victims . Remember that the police can not prevent crimes ; give them the correct resources and they will however be able to solve more crimes . Another reason that we , the public , can not rely on the police to protect us from crime is that they also fall victim to crime as can be seen in this link : <p> Two young thugs thought they could attack an elderly ( 70 year old ) man and his wife . Instead he turned the tables on them . Gun Free South Africa would have you believe that the thugs would take his firearm . They did n't instead they ran away pleading for their lives and one of them even surrendered to the old man before the police arrived . This gentleman was not saved by the police , he was not saved by a ban on firearms and he was not saved by a no questions asked firearms amnesty . He took the responsibility and saved himself and in doing so he arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making our country a little bit safer . <p> So my plea to my fellow citizens is this ; do not support Adele Kirstein , George Bezos and their associates in calling for a no questions asked firearms amnesty . Insist that they stop persecuting the law abiding citizen who only wants to protect himself and his loved ones and start punishing the criminals who have no respect for the law . <p> Disclaimer : All articles and letters published on MyNews24 have been independently written by members of News24 's community .

The US-based Insurance Institute for Highway Safety found that forward-collision warning systems cut vehicle-to-vehicle crashes by seven percent - not a quantum leap , but a potential life saver . <p> " Passive safety features will stay important , and we need them .

" The project was about showing how far you can go , not just with fancy lasers , but with stuff you can buy off the shelf , " said David Pfeiffer , one of the team . <p> Such features , however , require solving thorny problems , including how to avoid pedestrians . <p> While in-car cameras are good at identifying and classifying objects , they do n't work so well in fog or at night .

According to Gavin Ratner , Director and Spokesperson for MechCaL the mines that will now benefit from MechCaL 's technology include Dishaba , Tumela , Bathopele , Khuseleka , Thembelani , Siphumelele and Twickenham . MechCaL will be supplying close to 316 fans ranging from 22kW 762mm fans to the standard 762mm 45kW fans as well as a few of their 75kW 1016mm units for underground use . <p> MechCaL has become well known for their innovative designs and unique use of technology to manufacture fans for the mining industry . Their patented design is coupled with the use of light weight materials to create fans that boast increased efficiency , operational and energy savings , and lower mean time between failures .

We have done numerous tests to prove that due to the traditional fans under delivery , the 22kW 762mm MechCaL fans could replace them resulting in huge electrical savings for the same air delivered . We have also looked at the possibility of changing the current duct sizes to reduce the airspeed in the ducts , and then also reducing the losses .

" Yes , the MechCaL fan is very efficient , resulting in direct energy savings and added to this , the long term mean time between failure of the system results in maintenance savings but what these also mean for the mines is a reduction in production stoppages as work can continue even if the fan is not running .

South Africa will probably play with a real gang mentality with Morn ? Morkel and Vernon Philander in support of Steyn .

" <p> Hot-headed and emotional Proteas are , of course , exactly what Clarke and his sledger-in-chief , David Warner , want to see . A frequent and popular target for his salt-infused barbs is Faf du Plessis -- and it is no coincidence that he has also been one of the most successful batsmen against the Australian attack . Whereas others may flinch , Du Plessis thrives on the abuse . No wonder he says it is being overplayed in the media . <p> Just another team " Definitely .

A Test-saving century on debut in Adelaide two years ago and a man of the series award in the triangular ODI series in Zimbabwe two months ago are fond memories . Even Johnson holds no fears . <p> " I enjoy facing Mitch -- I 've had some success against him , too . As a top-order batsman you want to face fast bowling ; I do n't mind it at all , " Du Plessis said . As true as that may be , there may have been another reason for saying so two days before the opening game .

Enjoy facing me , do you ? We 'll bloody well see about that , " you can almost picture him saying . If Du Plessis was engaging in a little reverse psychological warfare , it would not be the first time and should come as no surprise . <p> Steyn , on the other hand , rarely bothers to play " games " and is comfortable with his heart on his sleeve . The team management 's decision to keep him away from the media -- despite great demand -- may have been a prudent exercise in damage limitation . Or it could be captain AB de Villiers 's way of ensuring that he does all his meaningful talking with the ball , and with a maximum head of steam . <p> Johnson may have suspected the same thing , having been treated in the same way by his own captain during the Ashes campaigns . Given his straight talking before this series , it was hard not to interpret his words about Steyn as an attempted pacifier : <p> " Going head to head with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high 140s km/h .

@@2925240 <h> A salute to Maserati , as it turns 100 <p> Muscat , Oman - The last thing I expected to find while going through the illustrious history of Italian supercar maker Maserati , was a prominent mention of SA 's famed Kyalami circuit . <p> The company 's last F1 win , with Juan Manuel Fangio at the wheel of a 250F took place in 1957 at the German Grand Prix -- but in 1967 Pedro Rodriguez recorded the company 's last F1 win with a Maserati three-litre engine , taking the chequered flag at the SA Grand Prix at Kyalami in a Cooper-V12 . <p> Fast-forward to 2014 and it 's a special time for the Modena-based factory , with next month marking a century of Maserati 's existence . It 's an establishment that opened its doors in Bologna , founded by Alfieri Maserati to service Isotta Fraschini cars -- but which later on ( along with three other Maserati brothers ) started the car-manufacturing business . <p> The famous trident on the bonnet of every car , as you may or may not know , was inspired by the statue of Neptune in the Piazza Maggiore in Bologna ( the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and red in the logo matching the city 's official colours . <p> The early years saw the company mainly converting customer cars for racing , with the first genuine Maserati only seeing the light of the day in 1926 in the form of the 1.5-litre supercharged eight-cylinder Tipo 26 race car ( which weighed 760kg and made 90kW ) . <p> The move to Modena , the current home of Maserati , came with the company 's original sale in 1939 to a family based in that city . Importantly , this was followed by Maserati 's first road car , the A6 , born in 1947 with a 1.5-litre 48kW engine and a top-end of 170km/h ( just 58 of these were built ) . <p> Today Maserati is owned by the Fiat Chrysler group ( which also owns Ferrari ) ; with the current selection including the sporty two-door GranTurismo and GranCabrio ; the luxury-limo Quattroporte ; and the company 's latest family sedan , the Ghibli ( which is a fabled Maserati nameplate in its own right ) . <p> And what better way to celebrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two rather special centenary-edition models , in Muscat -- an area said to be the jewel of Arabia -- for a blast in commemoration of the past . <p> As you 'd expect , the honour of the Centennial Edition badging goes to the sportiest cars in the stable , with the range-topping MC versions of the four-seater GranTurismo and GranCabrio scoring visual flair which I reckon even ' ol Alfieri would be proud of . <p> Power , as before , is courtesy of a 338kW/520Nm 4.7-litre naturally-snorting V8 -- while Centenary tweaks include new body colours , wheels with centenary logos , specifically-toned interiors with special embroidering , and lashings of carbonfibre across the cabin . And here 's a little tip ; go for the Magma Red or Inchiostro Blue paint -- they represent the colours in the Maserati badge and the colours of Bologna . <p> The blue GranCabrio Centenary I bulleted through the golden mountainsides of Muscat was both one of the sexiest and most celebrated cars I 've yet driven .

And let me tell you , this car , which now accounts for half of Maserati 's sales numbers on the planet , has a lot going for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The all-wheel-drive Ghibli S I drove was family-man nirvana , powered by a modern 3-litre twin-turbo V6 ( designed by Maserati and manufactured by Ferrari ) mated to a silky eight-speed auto box .

@@2929230 <h> ' Environmental exploitation fuelling Ebola ' <p> Cape Town - Foreign exploitation of the resources of Africa 's poorest nations has stripped away the ecological barriers that once kept the deadly Ebola virus at bay , and now allowed it to run rampant , Dr David Sanders , associate professor of biological sciences at Purdue University in Indiana , told those attending lunchtime prayers at Claremont Main Road Mosque on Friday . <p> Sanders was invited to give the address on Friday , before prayers , on one of his latest research papers , " Ebola epidemic exposes the pathology of the global and political system " .

@@2929236 <h> Property syndication director is liable <p> The masterminds of property syndication schemes -- including the directors of schemes that have been liquidated -- can not be absolved of their liability for losses suffered by investors . This , in essence , is the crux of a ruling handed down by the Appeal Board of the Financial Services Board ( FSB ) this week . <p> The appeal board has dismissed a financial adviser 's appeal that he should not be held liable for his client 's losses resulting from an investment in a Blue Zone property syndication . And it has gone a step further -- by agreeing with the adviser that the directors of the scheme should be held liable , but disagreeing that they should be solely liable . It decided to hold both the adviser and a former director of the failed property syndication scheme jointly and severally liable to repay a pensioner who lost R100 000 . <p> The appeal board is set to hear appeals in another two cases in which the financial advice ombud has held the masterminds of property syndications liable for the losses suffered by investors . <p> The former directors of Sharemax are appealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Noluntu Bam , the Ombud for Financial Services Providers , or Financial Advisory and Intermediary Services ( FAIS ) Ombud , is awaiting the outcome of these cases before signing off on property syndication determinations . The ombud 's office has received about 3 000 complaints relating to Sharemax alone . <p> The appeal that was dismissed this week was brought by Cape Town financial adviser John Alexander Moore and Johnsure Investments CC . <p> In March 2011 , the ombud handed down a determination against Moore for giving bad advice to Cape Town pensioner Gerald Black . The ombud said Moore had failed to take into account that his client was a " conservatively moderate investor " , whereas the investment was " high risk " ; had failed to make an independent and objective assessment of the Blue Zone Spitskop property development , relying instead on glossy brochures ; and had made himself out to be an expert on a product that he was neither qualified nor licensed to sell . <p> In both appeals against the ombud 's ruling to the FSB 's Appeal Board , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property syndication scheme , should be held liable for Black 's losses because Moore was acting under supervision of Blue Zone . <p> Moore admitted he had failed to comply with provisions of the FAIS Act in that he had not furnished Black with a disclosure document . But the fact that he " may have been negligent " was not the cause of Black 's loss , he claimed . The loss was caused by the " fraudulent and irresponsible conduct " of the directors of Blue Zone . <p> Moore 's legal counsel argued that he could not have reasonably foreseen the fraud in the Blue Zone scheme . <p> His counsel also referred the appeal board to two determinations issued by the FAIS Ombud , holding the directors and key individuals of financial services providers accountable for the losses suffered by investors . <p> In its decision , the appeal board said it agreed with Moore that Blue Zone should have been held responsible for Black 's loss and " should have been party to this matter at the outset of the complaint and investigation by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zone was the financial service provider ( FSP ) and the individuals who masterminded the scheme were directors and key individuals of the FSP ; Moore was their mandated representative ; Van Zyl was ... the supervisor for services rendered on behalf of Blue Zone ; and Van Zyl performed all management and activities on behalf of Blue Zone " . <p> Moore 's first appeal was referred back to the FAIS Ombud for determination of the liability of Blue Zone , but the ombud said Blue Zone had been liquidated in 2011 -- and because it no longer existed , the ombud 's office could n't pursue the company and its directors . <p> But the appeal board decided " there is no reason why Blue Zone directors , Lamprecht and Van Zyl , should not be held personally accountable for the failed investment scheme " . <p> " The fact that they were not cited as parties in these proceedings and the fact that the FAIS Ombud had not approached them since the complaint was lodged , can not absolve them of their liability , " the decision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both supervisor and supervisee must comply with the FAIS Act and code of conduct . There was non-compliance by both Van Zyl and Moore , the board found . <p> While Moore could not have foreseen the fraudulent activities that led to the collapse of the scheme , he could have foreseen that the investment , which had no guarantees , was risky , the appeal board says . The loss suffered by Black " was as a result of Moore 's negligence " . Had the risks been explained to Black , in all probability he would not have invested in the product . <p> As for Van Zyl , the board said he can not hide behind the facade of an entity which has long been liquidated . " As one of the directors of Blue Zone and supervisor to Moore , he had an obligation to the complainant as well as ensuring Moore was supervised at all times .

@@4787231 President must answer questions in Parliament <p> Pierre de Vos <p> Pierre de Vos <p> Pierre De Vos teaches Constitutional law at the University of Cape Town Law Faculty , where he serves as deputy dean and as the Claude Leon Foundation Chair in Constitutional Governance . He writes a regular blog , entitled ' Constitutionally Speaking ' , in which he attempts to mix one part righteous anger , one part cold legal reasoning and one part irreverence to help keep South Africans informed about Constitutional and other legal developments related to the democracy . <p> 25 Nov 2014 11:43 ( South Africa ) <p> The collapse of the ' deal ' between opposition parties and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa is not surprising . From a principled constitutional perspective the collapse of the deal must be welcomed . This is because the deputy president did not have the constitutional authority to make the deal , which remained unenforceable . To enforce the deal would flout the Rule of Law . <p> It is sometimes difficult to insist on the scrupulous enforcement of legal rules and principles . Many people are tempted to look the other way when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flout the legal rules and constitutional principles . Conversely , many people only insist on a strict adherence to legal rules or constitutional principles when a political party or functionary they dislike flouts the rules or principles . <p> Because of the fairly widespread lack of respect for Speaker Baleka Mbete among the members of the chattering classes ( and because of the increasing chaos in the National Assembly ) , there were not many people who questioned the deal concluded between the deputy president and opposition parties . For reasons not known to me , it appears that members of the ANC caucus -- correctly -- did question the appropriateness of the deal . <p> There are two reasons why the deal ( which has since collapsed ) was a constitutional non-starter . <p> First , the deputy president ( while a member of the National Assembly ) is a member of the executive and as such represents the executive when he engages with members of the National Assembly . <p> In terms of section 91(4) the deputy president has been chosen to act as the leader of government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the National Assembly require that he be consulted on several issues and although he serves as a member of the programming committee of the National Assembly , neither the Constitution nor the rules of the National Assembly accords the deputy president ( as leader of government business ) any leadership role in the National Assembly . <p> The speaker heads the National Assembly . Constitutionally only the speaker can make decisions about the affairs of the National Assembly and then only when this is authorised by the Constitution and the rules of the National Assembly . If a deal was going to be struck about the affairs of Parliament , the speaker was the appropriate person to do so . <p> This does not mean that the deputy president may not meet with the leaders of opposition parties . Neither does it mean that he may not -- on behalf of the governing party -- make political deals with opposition parties . What he is not authorised to do is to make deals with opposition parties regarding the affairs of Parliament . The deal reached last week was therefore ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But , second , even if the speaker had led the negotiations with opposition parties and had concluded the deal , she would not ( in a formal sense ) have been legally authorised to do so . <p> Rule 2(1) of the National Assembly states that the " Speaker may give a ruling or frame a Rule in respect of any eventuality for which these Rules do not provide " . <p> But the problem is that the rules and legislation already regulate the two most important aspects on which the governing party and the opposition differed . It does so in great detail . <p> These issues are the disciplining of Economic Freedom Fighters ( EFF ) members in terms of the provisions of the Powers Privileges and Immunities of Parliament and Provincial Legislatures Act 2004 for insisting that the President " pay back the money " and the need for the President to answer questions in the Assembly four times a year . <p> It may very well be that the disciplinary action taken against EFF members were not " in accordance with a procedure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12(3) ( a ) of the Powers Privileges and Immunities of Parliament and Provincial Legislatures Act . <p> The EFF members have a more than even chance of persuading a judge that the procedure ( prescribed by the rules of the National Assembly ) that led to their " conviction was neither reasonable or procedurally fair " . The judge could then set aside the findings . But neither the speaker ( nor the deputy president ) formally has the legal authority to do so . <p> But this is not a particularly difficult problem to solve . While the deputy president and the speaker do not have the formal legal power to suspend or scrap the findings of the disciplinary committee against EFF members , the National Assembly does have that power . <p> This is because the National Assembly has the power to either endorse or reject the findings of the disciplinary committee established in terms of the legislation . This means that had the deputy president and the chief whip of the ANC been able to sell this aspect of the deal to their party , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciplinary committee against the EFF members . The disciplinary action against the EFF would then have fallen by the wayside . <p> This is somewhat of a technicality , which means that in practice either the deputy president or the speaker would have been able indirectly to deliver on a promise to halt disciplinary action against the EFF if the members of their party had backed them up . <p> But this is not the case with the requirement that the President must appear in Parliament to answer questions . This is , first , because section 55(2) of the Constitution states that the " National Assembly must provide for mechanisms to ensure that all executive organs of state in the national sphere of government are accountable to it " . <p> These executive organs of state include the President . <p> This obligation is given practical effect to by National Assembly rule 111 which states that , " Questions to the President must be ( a ) scheduled for a question day at least once per term in accordance with the annual Parliamentary programme ; and ( b ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The rule is peremptory , which means the President does not have discretion in the matter . The Speaker must ensure that he is scheduled to answer questions once every term . <p> Here the rules at first appear to be confusing . A ' term ' is defined as " the period for which the Assembly is elected in terms of section 49(1) of the Constitution " . Section 49(1) states that the National Assembly is elected for a term of five years . If " term " were given this meaning every time the word " term " is used in the rules , it would render many of the rules incomprehensible and absurd . <p> It would also mean a President would have to answer oral questions in the National Assembly only once every five years . This would clearly be in conflict with section 55(2) , which means the rule must be read differently . This is exactly what has happened up to now . <p> As I noted , the word ' term ' is also used elsewhere in the rules to refer the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Given the context of rule 111 , ' term ' clearly refers to these distinct periods . Usually there are four ' terms ' for Parliament every year . <p> However , this year there was an election , which means when establishing whether the President has complied with his legal obligation set out by rule 111 , one has to establish how many terms Parliament was in session this year after the May election . <p> The parliamentary programme for the fifth Parliament elected after the May election states that Parliament sat for three distinct terms after the election . This means that the rules of the National Assembly requires that the President answer oral questions in the National Assembly at least three times from June to November this year . <p> This did not happen . <p> The President has only answered oral questions in the National Assembly once since the election . He is therefore legally required to answer questions in the National Assembly two more times before the third term of Parliament ends on Friday . This is not going to happen , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrange for this ) are therefore in breach of their legal obligations in terms of section 55(2) of the Constitution read with rule 111 of the National Assembly . <p> Neither the deputy president ( as leader of government business ) nor the Speaker has the legal authority to waive these rules . A basic tenet of the Rule of Law is that all pre-announced and clear legal rules have to be complied with . In the absence of a court ruling to authorise a non-enforcement of a legal rule , it would constitute a breach of the Rule of Law to ignore such a rule in order to facilitate a political agreement . <p> This is the thing with legal rules ; they can not be suspended merely because a few politicians decide that the legal rules are inconvenient or -- if applied -- would embarrass the President or disadvantage the opposition . <p> What is clear is that there has been a breakdown of trust between political parties in the National Assembly . Without a modicum of trust , the system can not work . If the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eventually the legitimacy of the both the governing party and opposition parties would also suffer . <p> This means that , despite the legal difficulties , some kind of solution needs to be found to ensure that the rules are impartially applied and the members more or less obey the impartially applied rules . A starting point would be to ensure the implementation of rule 111 and to arrange for the President to answer questions as required by the Constitution and the rules of the National Assembly .

They typically try to avoid the question altogether and answer around it using whatever they can find on the Internet in order to try and get a passing grade .

Unfortunately this is not just at the secondary level . I had a gentleman recently approach me from Denel Technical Academy at the Waterkloof air show who highlighted this very problem . He shared a story of a recent engineering graduate from a top South African university who began working in his factory . " Can you pass me the #10 spanner ? " he said to the new employee .

One of the first questions I asked was , does anyone know what this is , pointing to the fifth generation Makerbot compact desktop 3D printer . One ambitious young gentleman raised his hand emphatically and said , " I do ... It 's a coffee machine ! " <p> Again , to be fair , 3D printing might be somewhat new when it comes to schools and education . It might not be in the matric exam . However , every South African high school learner should at least be aware of its existence . It is an old technology that made its way to the technological world in 1986 , almost 30 years ago .

We need to remember Bloom 's revised taxonomy of " Understand , Apply , Analyse , Evaluate , and Create " . We need to teach learning skills such as critical thinking and problem solving , collaboration and communication , and creativity and innovation . We need to teach more than just what is going to be in a particular exam . We need make lessons more hands-on and creative , and then be more careful on measuring stated goals and objectives to determine if the learner is in fact ' learning ' .

" which amounts to giving you six months to return the goods . <p> As far as grey imports go , Section 25 ( 2 ) of the CPA states that " a person who markets any goods that bear a trade mark , but have been imported without the approval or licence of the registered owner of that trade mark , must apply a conspicuous notice to those goods in the prescribed manner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " prescribed manner and form " should be : <p> Advert <p> Disclosure of reconditioned or grey market goods ( 1 ) The notice contemplated in subsections ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) of section 25 of the Act and meeting the requirements of section 22 of the Act must be applied- ( a ) in a place on the goods and the marketing material of the goods where a consumer is likely to see that notice ; and ( b ) in an easily legible size and manner , to the goods and all forms of advertising or promotion , including in-store promotions , packaging , websites and brochures , when these goods are advertised or promoted , stating clearly that they have been reconditioned , rebuilt or remade , as the case may be . ( 2 ) The supplier must when selling the goods to the consumer- ( a ) expressly draw his or her attention to the notice prescribed in subregulation ( 1 ) ; ( b ) in plain language explain the meaning of the notice to the consumer ; and ( c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and meeting the requirements of section 22 of the Act must be applied- ( i ) in a place on the goods and the marketing material of the goods where a consumer is likely to see that notice ; and ( ii ) in an easily legible size and manner ; to the goods and all forms of advertising or promotion , including in-store promotions , packaging , websites and brochures , when these goods are advertised or promoted , stating clearly , if the goods bear a trade mark , that they have been imported without the approval or licence of the registered owner of that trade mark and that no guarantee or warranty in respect of such goods will be honoured or fulfilled by any official or licensed importer of such goods . <p> That means Kalahari.com 's disclaimer is on the right side of the law . <p> Gordon added that " generally customers are really happy with the availability , quality and price of our supply , " while indicating that they have had few issues of a similar nature . <p> " This is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can to allow people to understand that this is a parallel import . " <p> While Kalahari.com can argue that consumers who do n't spot the notices only have themselves to blame , though , not all online stores are as transparent about where their goods come from . <p> Take French mobile phone company Orange 's South African store , for example . It specialises in selling phones and tablets which are n't officially available here , like Google 's Nexus 5 and a range of Wiko smartphones . It also competes extraordinarily well on price for handsets which are widely available , often undercutting other stores for flagship phones by R2 000 or more . <p> Nearly all of its stock -- to the best of our knowledge -- is imported on demand from overseas , usually Europe . And it 's not clear anywhere on the Orange shopping pages that phones are imported and buyers wo n't qualify for the manufacturer warranty in South Africa . <p> " In terms of our compliance in accordance with the CPA , this is handled by our legal department to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities . Our T&amp;Cs do provide for the necessary info dealing with Samsung products but also all products globally as the majority of our products are imported ( we continue to increase the amount of products we source locally versus when we started early in 2013 ) , " said Blake Levitan , country manager for Orange Horizons South Africa . <p> Orange 's T&amp;Cs do mention that it will only provide a six month warranty on goods -- the minimum under South African law -- and for those phones which are shipped in you can forget about extended warranties from local manufacturers ' offices . We have raised the issue with Orange and encouraged the firm that it should make its warnings to consumers clearer as per the guidelines in the CPA . <p> As we said before , for the most part Orange is really , really cheap .

@@4793239 if you mix the Instagram culture , R1-Man and Jean Claude Van Damme ? NATIVE VML co-founder Ben Wagner 's presentation at the 2014 DMX Conference , of course . <p> On 26 November , I attended the Digital Marketing Exchange 2014 annual conference programme at the Table Bay Hotel . The day kicked off with master of ceremonies , former radio presenter Mel Jones setting the agenda . First up was Ben Wagner , co-founder of NATIVE VML and head of NATIVE Cape Town , on the South African digital marketing landscape . He spoke of the opportunities available for marketers and brands alike . <p> Ben Wagner of NATIVE VML , mid-presentation at the 2014 DMX Conference <p> Like all trends , Wagner says digital is like a day at the beach . You knew high tide was coming but suddenly your towel 's drenched . He likes to look through Zapiro 's lens for an idea of what 's truly pulsing in the country . More specifically , he says there 's no more exciting time , in terms of advertising spend . It 's a very robust industry that has matured locally , with many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge amount of discussion about the coming digital age , but all elements that will make up the future are already here now , and converging fast . <p> He then discussed trends of the local digital marketing landscape . The first trend was that the individual has found the power within himself to take on Goliath . We only need to look at the recent consumer Cell C billboard debacle featured on Bizcommunity , and the RottenBank site as proof of this . Consumers are not afraid to make their voice heard , and to join forces and stop brands ' bullying tactics . This means brands need to have more than just the correct price and promotion in place - they also need purpose to lead with . Wagner says at NATIVE VML , they focus on creating purpose-driven work that actually makes a difference . <p> Wagner gave the Sanlam Savings Month video of R1 Man as an innovative way of educating consumers about the importance of saving . Wagner said the important thing here was n't that R1 Man became such a phenomenon , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Work with your consumers and they 'll remain loyal to your brand <p> The next important trend Wagner mentioned is the need for marketers to develop shared value with community by providing entertainment . It 's also important for these shared values to resonate with stakeholders and partners . He spoke of NATIVE VML 's Gold-Loerie winning ' Ke Yona soccer team search ' integrated campaign for Nedbank , which demonstrated how ordinary South Africans can make things happen and achieve their goals with Nedbank . Wagner says the campaign worked as it was about more than just football , it was also about dreams and ambitions , with nine of the ' Ke Yona ' players now playing for Orlando Pirates . <h> Data , mobile , people - how they work together <p> The next trend Wagner mentioned is the obvious one of mobile starting to overlay social and data , in order to create new inflection point for advertising . Wagner says Nike got this right with its Nike Plus ID and Fuelband campaigns , which were n't just about moving product but about creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the growing trend of designing for mobile-first or mobile-only becoming more prevalent . He said this is especially true of brands targeting the lower LSMs , as is the case in much marketing across the African continent . He says there 's already been a dramatic shift but he predicts it will happen more and more . Keep in mind that mobile means you have limited screen size , which offers a much more intimate experience as we literally lean into the handset to experience it . <p> As an example Wagner mentioned NATIVE VML 's Bookly campaign - simply put , this is an e-book reader for basic feature phones . It uses minimal bandwidth and also encourages users to become writers in their own language , to create the largest vernacular library in the world . It now boasts stories in all 11 official languages , which is a boon to those who previously did n't have access to basic literature . <p> Wagner said the next intersection is data . It 's not about the ' big data ' buzz either but rather about smart data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ note of how the Instagram generation lives in two realities simultaneously <p> There 's no doubt that the youth are the Instagram generation , but did you realise they view the present as an anticipated memory . Wagner explains that the success of photo-filtering apps has created a generation that sees each moment as something to experience later , meaning they live in two realities at the same time . This means we learn to be happy for this moment as it 's your life , but also remember that it 'll be gone in a flash and then all you 'll have is the memory . This means we all become artists and architects of our historical digital paper trail , which is n't necessarily a bad thing , just a new , fascinating trend to note , with Wagner mentioning the Ogilvy Cape Town Polo Tag test drive social game as an example of this ... <p> The fifth and final trend Wagner covered in his 40-minute presentation was the Internet of Things , which is currently exploding overseas and starting to make itself felt locally . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the browser into shopping centre environments , but advises that if content is king , context is queen so there 's no point coming up with something amazing if you skip the contextual relevance . <p> Wagner concluded and said one of the best examples of branded content he 's seen is what Volvo trucks did in a typically boring product category with its Jean Claude Van Damme video , calling it a big idea that worked well for a brave client . <p> With so many new trends emerging and the industry in a constant state of flux , Wagner said it 's important for marketers to become ambidextrous ' mathemagicians ' who can do the deep dive into data to pull out the few crucial elements and keep training themselves . If not , they wo n't get the results they need . Marketers also need to narrow their focus and market to a single person instead of a ' market ' , and see the consumer as an individual . Where possible , get the audience to participate in your marketing efforts as they 're there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> LEGAL DISCLAIMER : This Message Board accepts no liability of legal consequences that arise from the Message Boards ( e.g. defamation , slander , or other such crimes ) .
