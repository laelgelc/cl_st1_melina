This is better than filling permanently , as it may prevent banks from giving credit due to asset liability mis-matches . <p> The liquidity injections allow banks to lend without deposits and trigger forex shortages , expand the external current account deficit -- unless they were used to buy assets from fleeing foreign investors and more forex losses . <p> Classical economists have called such injections ' fictitious capital ' in a pegged regime . <p> However US academics ( led by Mercantilists like John H Williams ) and economic bureaucrats who built the Bretton Woods and the International Monetary Fund , thought it was possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been weak , and instead used statistics to claim that it was possible . <p> That it was not possible was proved with the collapse of the Bretton Woods . But third world countries -- outside of East Asia and GCC -- continue to believe that it is possible , with disastrous consequences and never-ending trips to the IMF . <p> A third world country is necessarily pegged . No single anchor regime country will remain poor for long . <p> In past currency crises , foreign reserves losses ( losses of NFA ) were filled permanent purchases of Treasury securities , so large liquidity shortages running into hundreds of billions of rupees were not seen . <p> As a result , a few foreign banks ended up with over 300 billion rupees of excess cash . <p> This is similar to people withdrawing cash from the banking system and burying them in proverbial coffee tins in their backyard as reportedly happened in the US during the Great Depression . <p> A third reason for expanding liquidity shortages was the roll-over of central bank held Treasury bills ( zero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sri Lanka 's net credit to government went up , without any changes in net foreign assets -- since the central bank has run out of reserves -- while reserve money or at least notes in circulation fell . <p> Loosening Monetary Policy <p> Over the past few weeks , the central bank started injecting liquidity ( printing money ) on a longer term basis reducing the overnight shortages . <p> Any of foreign bank money , or newly injected money that is used to buy Treasury bills will end up in state banks . <p> The central bank should maintain a liquidity short to absorb any liquidity that foreign banks use up to buy Treasury bills . <p> The central bank was blamed by many for the current high rates . <p> Though it is true that country 's chronically high rates -- and the high rates of all third world soft-pegged countries -- are due to monetary instability coming from the central bank 's mis-management of a soft-pegged exchange rate regime , in this currency crises the threat of a domestic debt re-structuring has also contributed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central bank can not inject liquidity to suppress rates when private credit picks up and maintain the peg . Each time it is done , forex shortages emerge and the corrective rates are higher than if the rates were allowed to go up a little naturally to balance domestic credit and savings . <p> After months of injections , the rupee then collapses and rates go up steeply . This has happened repeatedly and has worsened under flexible inflation targeting . A floating exchange rate regime is needed for any type of inflation targeting ( to operate a domestic anchor based monetary regime the external anchor has to be abandoned ) . <p> In this context caution should be exercised in the current liquidity injections . <p> A Fragile but so far Consistent Peg <p> Sri Lanka is maintaining a peg at 360 to the US dollar without any reserves at the moment . It is done by a surrender rule where forced sales are made at around that price to the central bank , injecting liquidity and selling the same dollars back to banks . <p> Depending to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , the Bank of Thailand many decades ago re-built foreign reserves devastated by Japanese driven money printing during World War II , through such a strategy . <p> This column has in the past advocated floating the exchange rate and re-pegging , to re-establish the credibility of the peg . Before any float the surrender rule should be removed . <p> Exporters are still not selling forward , indicating that there is no market credibility for the 360 peg , though the central bank has operated monetary policy consistent with such a regime through liquidity shortages and negative private credit through higher rates . <p> Risks Remain <p> Until the credibility of the peg is fully restored , some overnight liquidity shortages should to be maintained , especially at state banks , for the following reasons , despite private credit being negative . <p> a ) The Treasury has warned that it may still require printed money . Overnight liquidity short should be large enough to absorb any such injections . <p> c ) The shift of private sterilized money from foreign banks to state bank DST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because any of the new liquidity injections , and the privately sterilized money shifting from foreign banks to state or other banks can create forex shortages if loaned to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation or Ceylon Electricity Board , to import fuel . <p> Though private credit is negative and the risks of foreign shortages , re-emerging are reduced , credit given to state energy utilities hit the forex market direct . <p> It is also not clear whether there will be any central bank profit transfers this year . In 2022 NFA was negative , but there are profits from domestic assets which if transferred as printed money can create forex shortages as they are used by the recipients . <p> That is why this column has advocated in the past that profit transfers be made in US dollars in the first instance and be done with it . <p> Sri Lanka has not yet got the IMF program , therefore confidence is low and any excess liquidity can undermine the very fragile peg . <p> Though there has been net excess liquidity in the market for a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rupees . <p> Peg and a Hard Place <p> The central bank is caught between a peg and hard a place , with a clamour by businesses to bring down rates . <p> In past crises , rates have started to come down from about two to three months after the currency is successfully floated , private credit turns negative and budget deficits begin to narrow . <p> But there has been no successful float to create credibility of the exchange rate in the market , the IMF deal and the attendant inflows that accompany it are yet to come . <p> Therefore , despite private credit being negative , due to problems in the CEB in particular and generally the budget , caution has to be exercise in liquidity injections and it will be a prudent strategy to maintain a short overall of at least 50 billion rupees . <p> After the IMF program comes , or even before that if there is a successful float and re-pegging , the central bank should consider abandoning the floor repo rate . <p> Many East Asian central banks do that and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of access to the repo window is a similar strategy , but is fraught some risks at the moment because the new liquidity is not coming from an acquisition of foreign assets but from domestic assets . <p> The central bank could also consider rolling over Treasuries at par through a legal change until they are sold down to re-build reserves after the IMF program comes . This will reduce the government interest bill and eliminate any risks from a single day profit transfer . <p> Having said that IMF programs are no solution to a trigger-happy pegged bank that injects liquidity through open market operations . <p> The State Bank of Pakistan is melting now within an IMF program . Sri Lanka had currency problems in both 2011 and 2018 within IMF programs which were temporarily suspended as liquidity injections were made amid high domestic credit which led to missed foreign reserve targets . <p> Liquidity shortages lose their value beyond a certain point , so the recent injections may not be harmful . <p> However care should be taken never to go to back to excess liquidity conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , email , and website in this browser for the next time I comment . <p> ? <p> **28;1049;TOOLONG ... submission failed .

Then the other urgent expenses will come down to second and third places . Our argument is entirely based on that . The Government has never said that it will not allocate money to conduct the election . " <p> State Minister Dr. Siyambalapitiya said his assessment is when the economic issues have decimated the political will and political authority , the first priority should be given to resolve the economic crisis . Therefore , the Finance Ministry has pointed out as to whether we are in a position to bear the cost of an election at this juncture . <p> Excerpts of the interview . <p> Q : The Opposition is alleging that the SLPP is scared of facing the election and that is why attempts are being made to postpone the elections . What is your comment ? <p> A : We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe economic crisis . This economic crisis has decimated elections and democracy . A strong President and a Government elected through the democratic will of the people were in power last year . <p> The former President was elected to the presidency with a resounding mandate of 6.9 million votes which eventually paved the way to create a two-thirds majority Parliament . However , all those were decimated by the people 's pressure due to the economic crisis . Amid that economic pressure , it was not possible to protect democracy or the political authority established by the people 's sovereignty . <p> We are yet in the same position and attempting to recover . On our part , we have the prime responsibility to further stabilise the economy . Members of political parties talk about certain issues which are advantageous to them . They make various comments on the LG polls and other political parties . These are mere speculation made based on Facebook comments and the speeches made on the political stage without any scientific basis . <p> Q : Cabinet Spokesman Minister Dr. Bandula Gunawardena told reporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't have sufficient funds at present to hold an election . Is it possible for a Government to not give money for an election ? <p> A : I state with responsibility that we have never said that we will not give money to conduct the election . Budget 2023 has been passed . If the expenditures have been passed in the Budget , then we have to prioritise them . We put an end to lengthy fuel and gas queues as we prioritised our expenditures properly . <p> We reduced the 12-hour power cuts to one or two hours . There is a shortage of drugs but it is less compared to those days . Farmers who were clamouring for fertiliser those days are now trying to sell their paddy . Therefore , some sort of change has taken place . When analysing the crisis that we faced it looks like a miracle that we were able to pay the salaries to public servants on time . We did this without allocating money to all the expenditure heads mentioned in those documents . That is why the expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the approval of the Cabinet <p> The expenditures of ministries were also cut by one percent . At present , the issue is how to prioritise the expenses of the LG election . Our argument is entirely based on that . <p> Q : The Election Commission has said that the Government Printer has not been given funds to print ballot papers for the election . Is there any truth in this ? <p> A:This does n't mean we are against conducting the election . In January , Government expenditure increased three-fold compared to its revenue . That gives an understanding of the expenditure and how we manage it with immense difficulties . Citing priority , can we postpone the payment of salaries of public servants even by a day ? Can we delay the payment of pensions and Samurdhi allowances ? This is the problem that we face at the present . <p> Q : In a situation where the people have faced severe hardships , again the electricity tariff has been increased . This time by 66 percent . Is n't there any alternative without putting more burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't increase the electricity tariff , steps should be taken to reduce production cost . The issue is whether we can reduce the production cost instantly . Nearly 40 percent of our electricity is generated through hydropower . We have a big target of going for renewable energy sources and we have already launched some of them . <p> We should go for more renewable energy sources . Until we reach that target , the Ceylon Electricity Board ( CEB ) faces a serious issue to continue the power supply uninterruptedly . They do n't have any viable alternative to the issue . It is very obvious that an unnecessary clash was created among the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka ( PUCSL ) , Ceylon Electricity Board ( CEB ) and Power and Energy Ministry . It is a question whether the PUCSL has properly realised its responsibilities . <p> The Government will not increase electricity rates and put more tax burden on the people especially when there is an election at hand . The Government has been compelled to do this as there is no other viable alternative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand . <p> Q : There are media reports that the Dollar reserve has increased from zero to US$ 2 billion while inflation which was 70 percent when the President took over the country has reduced to 54 percent . Is there any truth in this ? <p> A : That is true . At present , the inflation rate has come down . That does n't mean the economy has stabilised and the prices of goods have reduced . The percentage of the increase of the prices of goods has declined . Our foreign reserves are slowly increasing . These are the positive results of the hard decisions taken by the President as the Minister in charge of Finance and the Central Bank . <p> Q : The Cabinet of Ministers has approved a proposal to introduce a new Excise Act to replace 111-year old Excise Ordinance that dates back to the colonial days . Could you explain ? <p> A : We are in the process of taking measures to introduce a new Excise Act . It is one of the oldest acts in the country . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notices issued . Therefore , we have decided to amend the Act to suit present day needs . <p> Q : You have said that Sri Lanka is expecting debt assurances from China in the near future which will permit the country to get approval for the facility from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) . Would you like to comment ? <p> A : I hope we will be able to reach a consensus very soon . Now people are asking the reason for the delay to get IMF approval as we have sought its assistance on 16 earlier occasions . I would categorically say on all those 16 occasions , we went to IMF at the appropriate time . Therefore , it was very easy for us to find solutions . <p> This time we went to the IMF after a delay of one or two years . Then we have to seriously consider the situation that we face .

The ongoing situation is very advantageous for the Opposition . When the electricity tariff is increased by 66 percent , it is a very good slogan for the Opposition . <p> We have a traditional Opposition in our country . They know that when they come to power ; there is no way to bring down the electricity tariff hike . However , they use it to attack the Government . <p> What the Opposition wants is to grab power .

We have to catch thieves using the existing laws in the country . Some say after they come to power , their friends overseas will send them money . At present these slogans have become very attractive among the people who have faced severe hardship due to the economic crisis . <p> Voters should seriously consider as to why all those who shout loud on the political stage today did n't accept the power given to them six months ago . That is mainly because they did n't have an alternative to the economic issues . Now they pretend that they have a solution to the economic issues to capture power . <p> Q : The SLPP itself has split into several factions with the ' Helicopter ' alliance and several others . How will this impact the chances of the SLPP at future elections ? <p> A:The SLPP is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had to face issues within its tenure in office . I am not a member of the SLPP .

Again the SLPP has given nominations and entered the election fray and is continuing its politics . This is democracy . <p> Q : The SLFP and several other political parties formed an alliance to contest the upcoming LG polls under the ' Helicopter ' symbol . However , a couple days later the SLFP quit the alliance and decided to contest the LG polls separately . What is your comment ? <p> A : I do n't want to criticise the SLFP as it is like my home .

There are various disputes among the group to contest the next Presidential Election as well . According to my political experience this alliance will not last long . <p> Q : Some political commentators say that the conditions are rife for another ' Aragalaya ' to emerge although the President has categorically said that he will not permit another ' Aragalaya ' to emerge . In your opinion , is another ' Aragalaya ' possible in the country ? <p> A:I do n't know whether the people have such a need . Last time the ' Aragalaya ' emerged without the backing of any of those who are clamouring for a change today . Series of economic issues led to the creation of ' Aragalaya ' . Those days farmers did n't have fertiliser to cultivate so they also joined the ' Aragalaya ' . Those who were in lengthy fuel and gas queues and faced hardships due to long hours of power cuts took the lead of ' Aragalaya ' . However , some people attempted to portray that they gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lives with the people at village level , I am well aware that the people are not asking for an election .

They are afraid that if the President and the Government manage to continue their affairs successfully during the next couple of months , all of them will have to give up their plans . This is the truth . <p> The people at the village level do n't have any interest in an election and they are seriously concerned about how to solve the burning issues they face . I do n't think anybody would be able to launch another ' Aragalaya ' . <p> Q : The people are clamouring for a system change . Does the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will satisfy the demand for such a system change ? <p> A : Actually , it is high time for this . The President made an open invitation to all the parties to join the Government and accept portfolios but they were reluctant to do so . The Parliament has to continue with the majority . There were so many opportunities to effect a system change inside Parliament without shouting in the streets . They also had the opportunity to appoint their own President and a Cabinet of Ministers .

Paediatric Cancer which was once considered comparatively rare in the past has shown in recent years that the burden of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rising . <p> What is Paediatric Cancer ? And why is there an increase of this type of cancer at present ? <p> A. Cancers detected from birth up to completion of 19 years ( 0-19 ) are considered as ' Paediatric Cancers ' . Therefore , it includes cancers diagnosed in childhood and adolescence . <p> Over the years there is a marginal increasing trend of paediatric cancers due to early diagnosis with the expansion of health services and diagnostic facilities . <p> Q. A recent WHO report has stated that cancer is a leading cause of death for children and adolescents , particularly in high-income countries and that the likelihood of surviving a diagnosis of childhood cancer depends on the country in which the child lives . For example in high-income countries , more than 80 percent of children with cancer are cured , but in many low and middle income countries only 15-45 percent are cured . Do you agree ? <p> A. In high income countries since most of the communicable disease related deaths are reduced during the paediatric age groups , proportion of cancer related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What about Sri Lanka ? <p> A. Where Sri Lanka is considered , it is assumed that survival rate is better than the neighbouring countries as it is above 60 percent . <p> Q. The Report further adds that the reasons for lower survival rates include : delay in diagnosis and advanced disease , an inability to obtain an accurate diagnosis , inaccessible therapy , abandonment of treatment , death from toxicity and side effects , and avoidable relapse . Your comments ? <p> A.Yes those are the key factors for poor survival <p> Q. What age group is most at risk ? Newborn children ? Between 1-5 yrs ? or Pre-teens ? <p> A. Compared to adults , cancers in childhood are rare . When 5 year age groups of childhood and adolescence ( 0-4,5-9,10-14 , 15-19 ) are considered , higher incidences of cancers are reported in the 0-4 age period and 15-19 age period . When above age categories are considered relatively higher risk will be 1-5 years . <p> Q. What kind of cancer is commonest among each of these age groups ? I was told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what is the approximate percentage of children with this condition in Sri Lanka ? . <p> A. Yes leukaemia is the commonest cancer in children . In 2020 among males and females in Sri Lanka about 283 leukaemia patients ( Male- 166 . , Female -117 ) were reported to Sri Lanka National Cancer Registry . <p> Q. I read that nerve tumours also occur during early years of life , while bone tumors and muscle tumours are also common in the age group of 05 -09 years of age . Is this true ? <p> A. Yes those paediatric cancers are identified among those age groups . <p> Q. What about brain tumors that occur in the same age group ? <p> A.Yes <p> Q. How are these cancers detected ? Scans ? Blood tests ? <p> A. According to the type of cancer , the method of diagnosis may vary . Paediatric cancers can be broadly divided into Solid and Blood cancers . Blood cancers are diagnosed with blood tests , bone marrow biopsies and advanced immunohistochemistry tests which will help to confirm as well as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CT Scans , MRI Scans and histological biopsies are helpful in diagnosis of cancers . PET Scan is a whole body scan which will be helpful for advanced scan . This facility is available at Apeksha Hospital too . <p> Q. Which of the methods you just mentioned can be considered most effective and the safest to use for children ? According to cancer researchers it is a biopsy . What is a biopsy ? <p> A.A Biopsy is taking a tissue sample to be checked in a pathology lab . However , as mentioned earlier , methods of diagnosis vary according to the cancer type . <p> Q. Are there side effects when using these detection methods on young children ? If so , what are they ? <p> A. There are minimal side effects since trained staff is involved in taking biopsies . <p> However , some may experience pain at biopsy sites and mild risk of bleeding . Local site infection is another possibility . <p> Q. What are the treatment options ? Chemotherapy ? Surgery ? <p> A. As the method of diagnosis differs according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also differ according to the type of cancer . However , the main method of treatment for blood cancer may be chemotherapy while for solid tumours it may be surgery . <p> Q. Are these treatment facilities available to all Lankan children with cancer ? <p> A.Yes , most of the treatment options are available at Apeksha Hospital which has a dedicated Department for Paediatric Cancers . <p> If surgery is required most of the time they are performed by Paediatric surgeons and surgeons of surgical subspecialties like neurosurgery , orthopedic surgery , ophthalmological surgery and ENT Surgery . <p> Q. Can they be obtained free by parents/guardians on a low cost budget ? If so , where and which hospitals ? <p> A. Treatment is free from the point of delivery . <p> Q. What happens if a child with symptoms of cancer is brought in for examination later than he should have due to various reasons ? <p> A. He/she will have to undergo investigation at the earliest possible time before we decide on the next procedure . However , delay of presentation may affect the prognosis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reverse or control the further progress of the disease of a child already afflicted with cancer ? <p> A.With treatment most of the childhood cancers can be successfully dealt with and the further progress of the disease can be controlled . <p> Q. What are the symptoms of children who have reached the most advanced stages of cancer ? <p> A.In the advanced stages existing symptoms of each cancer are aggravated and child may experience severe pain and severe fatigue , breathlessness , disturbance of sleep . <p> However , I wish to reiterate this important message to parents . Do n't wait till the symptoms advance . <p> Be aware about early warning symptoms of childhood cancers and seek medical advice without delay .. Below are some of the key symptoms on Child Cancer listed for their benefit which they should look out for in order to give their children a better chance for quicker recovery : <p> * Continued , unexplained weight loss <p> * Headaches with vomiting during early night or early morning <p> * Increased swelling or pain in bones , joints and legs <p> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armpit <p> * Development of excessive , bleeding , bruising or rash <p> * Constant Infection <p> * A whitish colour behind the pupil <p> Nausea which persists or vomiting without nausea <p> * Constant tiredness or noticeable paleness <p> * Eye or vision changes which occur suddenly and persists <p> * Recurrent fevers of unknown origin <p> Q. I understand that Palliative Care is available to children with advanced cancer . What is palliative care ? <p> A. Palliative care for children with cancer can be defined as the active total care of the child 's body , mind and spirit . Generally palliative care begins when the childhood cancer is diagnosed , and continues regardless of whether or not a child receives treatment to cure the cancer . <p> Q. Is this also available to the distraught parents ? <p> A. Yes palliative care is addressing not only the affected child but also supports other children of the family and their parents as well . <p> Q. Ideally a young child hospitalised with cancer needs his/her parents close to him all day and night for assurance and comfort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government hospitals where these children can be hosed along with their parents ? <p> A.Majority of childhood cancers are treated at the Paediatric Oncology Wards at the Apeksha hospital . With the paediatric cancer patients one of their parents can stay . <p> Q. Now that we are fast moving into a hi-tech age , what benefits have these technologies brought to especially Sri Lankan patients by way of improving their overall quality of life and increasing their chances of survival ? <p> A. One of the main benefits of hi-technology is the reduced time for diagnosing cancers . <p> Q. Due to its complex nature , cancer is often a health issue that has led to many myths and wrong beliefs . What are some of the myths that are common in Sri Lanka ? And how would you like to debunk them ? <p> A.

So has the Health Ministry and NCCP provided any precautionary interventions to protect them from such diseases ? <p> A.Yes . All infection control measures are followed and vaccination was given to the identified age cohorts . <p> Q. The WHO has set a deadline of giving all children with cancer across the world quality care with optimal benefits by the year 2030 . Do you think this is a realistic goal considering the severe economic crisis we are undergoing right now , shortages of doctors and the general exodus of qualified doctors due to pay cuts and rising living costs ? <p> A.Those challenges could be overcome with active participation of all stakeholders <p> Q.

@@97030233 <h> Youth Observer <h> Turning obstacles into opportunities <p> In our previous article on motivating the youth , we focused on some issues affecting youth and how they could be addressed . Motivating youth should begin at home and parents have a major role to play in this regard . One problem that we often encounter in this age of the smartphone and the Internet is that youngsters are hooked on these devices almost 24/7 , with no time at all for interacting with their parents . Thus many parents do not know about the pressures and problems faced by their teenage or youth children . This could be rectified by setting aside a certain time period , say , dinner time , for conversing about the day 's events with the children . If they are found to be having any problems , the parents themselves can step into help or even direct them for outside counselling . In any case , parents should keep an eye on their children and guide them on the correct path . <p> Goal setting <p> Goals are also very important for motivating youth . Parents and teachers must set achievable targets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and getting good jobs , but also in terms of becoming better citizens overall . For example , gaining fluency in English could be an example for a goal that is eminently achievable . In this connection , it is vital to mentor youth on the correct path that should be pursued and to build trust . The generation gap may sometimes work against advice given by elderly citizens to younger ones . It is important to bridge this trust deficit . <p> But teachers , parents and religious dignitaries alone can not motivate youth . A part of it should come from the youth themselves . They should have the drive and the desire to reach greater horizons . The determination to succeed can do wonders , along with self-belief . If a youth believes in himself or herself , the sky is the limit for such an individual . <p> Motivating factors <p> As for motivation itself , there are several types -- some types of motivation come from within each individual while others are outside forces . Incentive motivation is one such " outside " force . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any goal without an incentive of some kind . It can be as simple as presenting a laptop to a student who gets very good grades at the GCE Advanced Level examination . That is an incentive to work harder towards the next goal of finishing university education . <p> Although not many will admit it , fear too can be a motivating factor for many people . We have heard parents telling their children that " you will not get a good job if you do not study well . " At work , the boss may tell a newly-recruited youth that no increments would be forthcoming if he or she does not discharge the assigned responsibilities well . The fear of failure or getting left behind is often a great motivating factor . But this should be handled judiciously , as the fear factor may actually work the other way and inhibit someone from performing in a better way . The solution lies in balancing fear and reward , so that the youth will be motivated to overcome their fears and go forward . <p> There is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any other group ) can be encouraged to perform better until they can prevail over a segment of society . In a way , a youth who seeks to become a teacher displays power motivation , because becoming a teacher will enable him or her to control the destinies of thousands of students over several decades . Similarly , social motivation is another kind of motivational factor where one seeks to be accepted on equal terms by friends , colleagues or another social group . <p> Self-belief and self-determination , a must <p> But as explained above , none of these will work without self-belief and self-determination . According to experts in psychology , there are several types of so-called " intrinsic motivation " where one is motivated through several factors without any external help or input . The motivation to learn is one such factor . Many children , even without being coaxed by their parents , want to do well at exams so that they will be able to secure a well-paying job here or abroad . But it does n't necessarily have to be only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn a foreign language just for pleasure and for self-development . <p> Having a positive attitude can be a motivational tool . If you feel negative about everything and life in general , you will not get anywhere . As the saying goes " if you can keep your head while everybody is losing theirs " , that will help you to get ahead in life . And positivity rubs off on other people too . If someone always harbours positive thoughts , the others around him or her will also feel those positive vibes . This is vital for everyone , but especially for youth who face so many challenges in today 's world . <p> Achievement motivation can be another valuable tool for youth . This is where one has an achievement in mind -- " I will publish a book within the next three years " is a good example . Life is a series of achievements , so this is a way to reach one 's ultimate goals step by step . Youth are generally creative by nature , so the next one -- creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are many ways in which one can be creative -- and one need not even have a so-called inborn talent in some cases . If there is access to a good computer , anyone can become a painter nowadays . Writing , though , still takes a bit of creativity , though even that is facing some danger from Artificial Intelligence programmes such as ChatGPT , which can write essays and articles on demand . <p> Finally , it wo n't do any good to forget about physiological motivation . These primarily include biological needs such as food and water . It is vital for youth not to forget this factor . Eating healthy meals on time and taking plenty of fluids are essential , though many youth have been affected in this regard by the prevailing economic crisis . But the best answer to any kind of adversity is motivation itself -- the will to challenge those head-on and surmount any obstacles that lie in one 's way . Then only can we succeed in life .

@@97311239 <h> Fake news fraud using Prabha and family <p> Members of a dozen Sri Lankan Tamil families gathered in the evening at the residence of a fellow Tamil in Switzerland in early November 2022 . <p> They had all been ardent sympathisers of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) when the tigers were militarily active in Sri Lanka . They had been invited by the host to listen to a Mukkiya Arivippu ( An Important Announcement ) concerning the Tamil people that evening . <p> The people were told by their host that someone would arrive in a while to make the announcement . <p> After a while , two men who at one time were LTTE activists in Switzerland came in . They had a startling piece of news . The assembled gathering was told that LTTE Supremo Veluppillai Prabhakaran described as the " Thamizh Eezha Thesiyath Thalaiver " ( National Leader of Tamil Eelam ) was not dead as reported by the Sri Lankan Govt. and was living incognito in a safe country . <p> Sadly , the leader was now seriously ill and required urgent and expensive medical treatment and care . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only daughter Duvaraka were also alive and had been living with Prabhakaran . <p> But due to Prabhakaran 's ill health and the urgent need to procure funds for him , the mother and daughter had embarked on a mercy mission . They were now in Switzerland to seek help for the leader of patriotic Tamils with a Tamil nationalist consciousness . Both will now talk to you , the gathering was told . <p> Thereafter , one of the men took out his mobile and called . The phone was put on speakerphone . A female introducing herself as Madhivadhani said her husband was alive and required urgent medical help . <p> In a voice choking with emotion , she appealed for financial assistance and then started sobbing . Then another female voice was heard saying " Ammaa , Alatheyungo ( Mother do n't cry ) . This was followed by the second female also requesting financial help for her father after claiming to be Prabhakaran 's daughter Duvaraka . <p> The people were then told that both Madhivadhany and Duvaraka were in a vehicle outside the house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but you ca n't speak to them " it was said . Some people went outside . Two women got down from a parked vehicle and clasped their palms together in a traditional greeting style . <p> Both were wearing Balaclavas covering their faces partially . They got into the vehicle which drove off . The mood inside the home was emotional . A few ladies were in tears . It was quickly decided that they should donate immediately for the leader 's recovery . A sum of 23,635 Francs was raised through cash , cheques and pledges . It was then suggested the amount be made a round figure of 25,000 Francs . This was done and the total sum of donations went up to 25,000 Francs . <p> A Swiss Franc currently equals 381 Sri Lankan rupees . The two men then left . <p> November and December 2022 The above-mentioned incident was one of many happening in Switzerland among Sri Lankan Tamils in November and December last year . Many Tamil families in Swiss cities such as Zurich , Bern and Basel were approached individually and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pre-2009 years . <p> The modus operandi was basically the same with slight differences in the routine adopted . People supportive of the LTTE were contacted by two unidentifiable women claiming to be Prabhakaran 's wife and daughter . <p> They appealed for financial aid to pay for Prabhakaran 's urgent medical expenses who was supposedly afflicted with a serious illness . Many people donated willingly . <p> Many readers in Sri Lanka may be baffled as to how and why Tamil families fell for what was obviously a blatant confidence trick . <p> It is indeed well-known that the LTTE leader Prabhakaran died in May 2009 . His spouse Madhivadhany , daughter Duvaraga and sons Charles Anthony and Balachandran . were also dead . <p> But now it was being claimed that Prabhakaran , wife and daughter were alive and that the sick leader urgently required cash for medical expenses . <p> How could people be so gullible ? The main reason for some Tamils believing the fake news about Prabhakaran being alive is due to the stance is taken - after the war ended in 2009 - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tamil Diaspora as well as prominent pro-LTTE elements in Tamil Nadu . <p> The LTTE structures overseas were financially well-endowed in 2009 . The Tigers through front organizations , institutions and trusted individuals controlled a lot of money-making ventures . <p> They also collected huge sums of money through " contributions " to the LTTE cause . More than a hundred operatives in different countries were full-time tiger activists living comfortably off LTTE funds . <p> So , when the LTTE was defeated militarily and the war came to an end , the situation transformed suddenly . As Yeats wrote in his Easter 1916 " All changed , changed utterly " . <p> The rationale for the overseas LTTE to garner and control funds was to finance the LTTE war machine . Furthermore , the LTTE itself was centred around its supremo Prabhakaran . <p> So , if Prabhakaran was dead and the LTTE was no more , there was no reason for the overseas LTTE activists to generate funds or run commercial enterprises . <p> Perinbananayagam Sivaparan alias Nediyavan The overseas LTTE was in a quandary . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alias Nediyavan ( Tall man ) based in Norway . He and his cohorts decided to deny the fact that Prabhakaran was dead and the war had ended . Instead , it was claimed that the LTTE had " silenced its weapons " ( aayuthangal mounikkappattana ) and the Leader was still alive . <p> Nediyavan also refused to honour Prabhakaran and other tigers who perished at Mullivaaikkaal as Maaveerar ( Great Heroes ) . <p> He argued that if the LTTE openly acknowledged Prabhakaran 's death , it would demoralise the Diaspora and LTTE activists abroad . <p> The overseas Tigers would not be able to raise funds thereafter . The struggle for Tamil Eelam would simply wither away . <p> No Official Commemoration Thus Prabhakaran 's death was never acknowledged ' officially ' by the overseas Tigers . Hence there has been no official commemoration of Prabhakaran or the other LTTE stalwarts killed in May 2009 like Soosai , Pottu , Bhanu , Jeyam or Sornam . <p> The annual Great Heroes Day observances in November refer to fallen tigers in general and those killed before April 2009 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those killed in Mullivaaikkaal as Maaveerar . <p> Tamil Nadu was on the boil when news of Prabhakaran 's death was first announced . Passions were aroused . But the volatile situation was soon calmed by the public pronouncements of Nedumaran , Vaiko and several other known Tamil Nadu LTTE sympathisers who stated the Sri Lankan authorities were lying and that Prabhakaran was alive and safe . <p> " Rivers of blood " did not flow in Tamil Nadu as threatened or feared . <p> Gradually , many prominent Tamil Nadu politicians who said Prabhakaran was alive got " enlightened " later . They changed their position or became silent with the exception of Nedumaran . <p> The leader of the Tamil Nationalist Movement ( TNM ) consistently stated in media interviews and public meetings that Prabhakaran was alive and safe and that the tiger leader would emerge soon to take the Tamil Eelam to struggle forward . <p> No one contradicted or challenged Nedumaran publicly on this out of deference for the veteran politician who had sacrificed much due to his steadfast support of the LTTE . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old , embittered and frustrated politician . But some in Tamil Nadu believed Nedumaran . <p> If only Prabhakaran was alive now As the years passed by the Prabhakaran is alive belief began to wane . Life went on but there was an overwhelming feeling of sadness among many Tamils that the Tamil struggle had ended so pathetically without achieving anything tangible . <p> The loss of thousands of lives in the war and the lack of accountability saddened and troubled many . There was also a lot of overt and covert sympathy for Prabhakaran who had died along with all the members of his family . <p> In a private conversation , some would wistfully yearn " If only Prabhakaran was alive now " . <p> It is this frame of mind that was now being exploited by a set of fraudsters with former Tiger links to hoodwink Tamil civilians into donating money for the supposedly alive and sick LTTE leader to women posing as his wife and daughter . <p> The victims of this confidence trick were all LTTE sympathisers . The perpetrators orchestrating the " Madhivadhany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the past . <p> Thus it was easy to make suckers out of people with this mindset . <p> Drama of Deception The drama of deception to milk sympathetic Tamil Diaspora cash cows was enacted several times in Switzerland in November and December . The two women would be in vehicles when visits to residences were undertaken . They would also meet people directly when visiting apartment buildings . <p> The two women - one young and one old- would not talk much and would appear worried and sad . <p> As the news of Prabha being alive and sick buzzed on the Tamil community grapevine , there was a backlash too . Several Tamils with and without pro-Tiger leanings began to smell a rat . At the forefront of the doubting Thomases were former LTTE members who had been in Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka during the final stages of the war . They knew the truth about the demise of Prabhakaran and his family . <p> These persons started a counter-campaign emphasising that the leader had been martyred and urging people not to be deceived by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those exposing the fraud was Dayamohan , a former LTTE political wing head for Batticaloa and Amparai Districts who is now living in Switzerland . <p> Impostor Duvaraka Exposed An interesting encounter further exposed the fraudsters . Prabhakaran 's daughter Duvaraka had been a member of the LTTE women 's brigade . <p> She had received training to drive vehicles of different varieties . The woman who trained her then was now living overseas with her husband . When the two women went to a house soliciting funds for ' sick ' Prabhakaran , the wife was not there . <p> The husband questioned ' Duvaraka ' about the person who taught her to drive vehicles . The unsatisfactory answer demonstrated that this ' Duvaraka ' was an impostor . <p> Details of this incident too began spreading within Tamil society in Europe . <p> In January this year , a statement was issued in Tamil on behalf of the LTTE on its letterhead . The statement openly condemned the fraudulent exercise and entreated the people not to be deceived by these tricksters . The statement is believed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no ' official ' LTTE now and this statement too in a sense was counterfeit . <p> Nevertheless , it seemed to have made an impact and the attempts to garner funds in the name of a ' sick ' Prabhakaran reportedly ceased in January . <p> It is against this backdrop that the February 13th announcement by TNM leader Nedumaran about Prabhakaran being alive along with his wife and daughter has to be viewed . <p> Many suspect that the veteran Tamil Nadu politician has been inveigled by fraudulent elements in Europe into making this pronouncement in order to continue with the fraud . <p> Though Nedumaran 's announcement has created a stir and revived the " Is Prabhakaran alive or not " controversy , there seems to be no indication so far about fresh efforts to collect cash again in the name of Prabhakaran in Europe . <p> No Respect for LTTE Leader The brazen fake news racket using two woman impersonators to collect cash in the name of a supposedly ailing Prabhakaran is despicable . Furthermore , it is being done by persons with past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these elements do not have any respect or regard for the LTTE leader or for the cause he believed in . <p> It is alleged that the mastermind behind this fraudulent racket is one Jeevaratnam Jeevakumar alias Chiranjeevi Master , a former deputy of ex-LTTE intelligence chief Pottu Ammaan . <p> The plan devised by Master was allegedly executed on the ground by one Abdullah , a former financial head of the LTTE 's Switzerland network . Abdullah 's real name is Chelliah Jeyapalan . He is from Aanaikottai in Jaffna . Abdullah is the man suspected of coordinating and implementing this sting operation besmirching the name of former LTTE leader Veluppillai Prabhakaran.

These handful of Sri Lankan corporates could have easily come up with a plan to present to the public on how Sri Lanka could move forward with their investment without falling subject to more IMF loans . In understanding what the IMF imposes for loans given , whom these conditions apply &amp; affect , the eventual outcomes like poverty , inequality , debt &amp; depression -- people should ask the Sri Lankans promoting going to IMF , why they are so gaga over it ! <p> Conditionality in IMF Loans -- loans are given with conditions though countries have to pay back loan with interest .

This is further backed by OXFAM report says 80% of covid-19 loans given by IMF have pushed nations to poverty . <p> However , ADVOCATA Chair Murtaza Jafferjee claims Sri Lanka would lose access to international creditor markets as soon as it resolves to debt forgiveness while also causing a collapse in the country 's banking system .

Making matters worse is that the majority of these companies that mooted debt default , had made use of the 2017 Foreign Exchange Control Act to deposit their profits overseas .

@@97627236 <p> The AUKUS military alliance and the submarine deal ; Foresight or Folly ? Posted on March 18th , 2023 <h> By Raj Gonsalkorale <p> Former Prime Minister of Australia Paul Keating has labelled the AUKUS military alliance and more specifically the recently concluded submarine deal as the worst mistake Australia has done in its history . His national press club address has been widely publicised and does not need repetition here . <p> It is however interesting to discuss a few basic issues he mentioned as reasons for his criticism . Firstly , his assertion that the AUKUS alliance is all about maintaining US hegemony over the South China sea and containing , to the extent possible , China 's ability to move freely within and outside this area of the sea . Secondly , the futility of a few submarines , nuclear or otherwise , attempting to do this in the shallow , easily detectible sea off China and thirdly , the formation of a military alliance that includes Australia where Australia faces no threat militarily from China . <p> At the outset , in context , it is useful to mention Newtons third law that every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this alliance too could be looked at from this perspective . Accordingly , while trading profitably with each other , the three countries in the Alliance , the US , Australia , and UK , will strengthen their military and China will do their best to outdo , but more importantly outsmart all three . The already accelerated arms race will get to high gear now with billions of dollars being spent more on posturing than on any real military encounter by any of the constituents of AUKUS . Consequences for the ordinary people in all these countries and all other countries will have a flow on effect as funds available for the welfare of the people will be eroded and diverted to military expenditure . <p> Before Newton , Buddha came out with a truism called dependent origination or in Pali , paticca samuppada . As stated in a Buddhist enquiry article ( https : **38;1049;TOOLONG ... what the dependent origination or pa ? icca-samuppada actu ? ally describes is a vision of life or an un ? derstanding in which we see the way everything is interconnected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything effects everything else . We are part of this sys ? tem . We are part of this process of de ? pendent origination -- causal relation ? ships effected by everything that happens around us and , in turn , effecting the kind of world that we all live in in ? wardly and outwardly . " <p> This is the first reality one will have to understand and accept as a reality . Many actions will follow from the military alliance and the submarine deal . The alliance appears to not understand and to disregard the interconnected nature of these actions These will lead to ongoing consequences , most which will be negative rather than positive . Although not a military issue , Australia and the world witnessed the reaction of the Chinese government when some actions of Australia , including its role in the WHO attempt to carry out an inspection of Chinese facilities to ascertain whether the COVID virus originated in a Chinese laboratory . This attempt by Australia without any discussion with China , cost the country dearly with several commercial sanctions which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diplomatic and commercial disagreements are being linked to non-existent military confrontations in the guise of foreign policy . <p> The distrust created with China by AUKUS and the submarine deal will have consequential reactions from China . It is hard if not impossible to see how trust can be restored in an environment where diplomacy has been superseded by militarism . It is unfortunate for the future generations that the current leadership of the two major political parties in Australia have consigned them , without any discussion with them , to an uncertain and confrontational future with China , the worlds next superpower in the not-too-distant future . <p> In any military conflict , irrespective of which side wins " , there are no real winners or losers . It is just a scenario where the aggressors , the defenders and the bystanders play musical chairs , with each category moving around taking on each other 's roles in a cyclical manner . It is a futile , costly exercise that could have been avoided if disagreements were discussed and resolved through compromise and respect for each other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war inflicts on the families and loved ones within each category , and a countless number of people who are not directly associated with a war . <p> During World War 2 , estimates for the total number of casualties in the war vary because many deaths went unrecorded . Most suggest that some 75 million people died in the war , including about 20 million military personnel and 40 million civilians . Many civilians died because of deliberate genocide , massacres , mass-bombings , disease , and starvation . The Soviet Union lost around 27 million people during the war , including 8.7 million military and 19 million civilian deaths . ( https : **38;1089;TOOLONG ... Outside of World War 1 and 2 , the Korean war , the Vietnam war , the Afghanistan , Iraq and other military conflicts have witnessed the deaths of millions . <p> If a war is to be fought , and countries are indifferent to the death and destruction it causes , each side has to have the resolve , strength and the equipment to match the other side . As Mr Keating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing conventional weapons does not seem to be indicative of parity . In the name of parity , if nuclear weapons are to replace conventional ones , the nuclear arms race will intensify , and more people will face death and destruction if a military engagement occurs and nuclear weapons are used . In such possible scenarios , it likely that China will enhance their defence capability in the face of AUKUS nations ramping their military capabilities . With technology advancements being what they are and potentially exponential advancements , the nuclear submarines being designed and built could well be obsolete when they are built and are seaworthy . The world does spend a lot of money to kill people . <p> Mr Keatings third point is about the military strategy Australia has chosen in association with the US and UK over a diplomatic strategy with China . He has maintained , rightly , that China is Australia 's largest trading country and therefore commercial considerations rather than military ones should underpin the relations between the two countries . Again , as he says , the country 's foreign policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mutual trust and not distrust . A military build up as envisaged is bound to foster mistrust between China and Australia and eventually impact adversely on the trading relationship between the two countries . <p> Data released by the General Administration of Customs ( GAC ) showed that , in 2022 , bilateral trade between the two countries reached US$220.91 billion , down 3.9 percent year-on-year , with Australia 's exports to China amounting to US$142.09 billion , a decrease of 13.1 percent from 2021 . China remains a primary export market for many Australian products , such as coal , iron ore , and wine . However , several of these products lost their market share as domestic businesses looked for substitutes to lessen the risk of interruption amid thawing ties ( https : **38;1129;TOOLONG ... Besides this , the website also states that quote notwithstanding the scope of market opportunities for China and Australia , bilateral ties have not always been favourable . Over the past five years , tensions have piled up on a range of issues related to technology , politics , and trade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the first member of the Five Eyes intelligence alliance to prohibit Chinese tech giants Huawei and ZTE telecommunications gear from participating in its telecom infrastructure . In addition , Australia openly supported a number of US-led efforts aimed at containing China 's expanding influence in the Indo-Pacific , including the AUKUS alliance , the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework , the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue , and the Partners in the Blue Pacific . Early in 2020 , amid tensions over the nature of COVID-19 , bilateral ties took a sudden turn for the worst . China imposed import bans on a variety of Australian exports , including coal , barley , wine , cattle , and seafood . Australia responded by escalating the trade dispute to the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) and canceling the Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) deal previously agreed to between China and the state of Victoria . <p> Such occurrences have had a negative impact on trade . Australian exports of wine , barley , lobsters , cattle , and coal were severely impacted , while Chinese companies were subject to increased scrutiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of escalating diplomatic tensions , several Chinese companies adjusted their coal purchases from Australia to reduce potential risks . Consequently , China imported 66.37 million tons less Australian coal in 2021 than it did in 2020 , a decrease of more than 85 percent year-on-year " unquote . <p> In summary , one can not be but convinced that Mr Paul Keating is right that the AUKUS military alliance and the submarine deal will have a negative effect on Australia/China relations in the long term and that future generations will face the consequences of this serious mis step in military strategy camouflaged as foreign policy . The question the younger generations should ask themselves is whether Australia should overlook the misdemeanours of the US when it supports countries like Saudi Arabia and other dictatorships and argue that they , the USA , is a protector of democracy , and that they are taking on China because of its undemocratic policies and practices . Not much or in fact anything is said about the rise in living standards in China and the very significant drop in poverty levels in China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the citadel of democracy , where , according to https : **39;1169;TOOLONG ... the official poverty rate in 2021 was 11.6 percent , with 37.9 mil ? lion people in poverty . In contrast , as estimated by the World Bank , China 's poverty rate had fallen from 88 percent in 1981 to 0.7 percent in 2015 , as measured by the percentage of people living on the equivalent of US$1.90 or less per day in 2011 purchasing price parity terms , which still stands in 2022 ( https : **36;1210;TOOLONG ... It does appear that the US is driven by the fear that China will overtake them as the superpower of the world soon and they are garnering support from willing allies like Australia and UK to delay the inevitable as much as possible . The danger for Australia is that they will be like , to quote a pithy Sinhala idiom ' Girayata ahuwechcha puwak gediya wage ( an arecanut caught between the two levers of a giraya , a familiar object in most Sinhala homes , fashioned out of brass , steel , silver or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation from which there is hardly any chance of escape .

@@97627237 <p> Central Bank Must be Independent to Save the EconomyPosted on March 18th , 2023 <h> Dilrook Kannangara <p> Even a schoolkid who has studied Year 11 Commerce would tell you that the Central Bank must be independent of the government . And that 's how it is around the world . However , Sri Lanka does not follow the rest of the world . Well established norms are questioned , challenged and changed in Sri Lanka to suit politicians and their supporters . What is even more convincing is Independent Ceylon ( 1948 to 1972 ) and Sri Lanka ( 1972 to 1978 ) had an independent Central Bank . <p> Historical Independence of CBSL and Economic Stability <p> Sri Lanka had a great tradition of Central Bank independence until 1978 . Its remnants held some traditional value of independence until 2006 . As a result , politicians could not indebt the nation ( all government long term debt is either taken by the Central Bank or the Central Bank guarantees debt ) beyond repayment capacity . Thanks to CBSL independence , the loan profile of the country was managed well ; politicians could not borrow as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tied to economic growth , and reserves of the CBSL were very healthy and were protected from looting , misappropriation and fraud . <p> Until 1972 Central Bank 's independence was guaranteed by the law as there was no one in a government post who could interfere with the CBSL . There was no executive president then . Sadly things changed since 1978 with the creation of executive presidency . The executive president could interfere with anything . Fortunately , no executive president interfered with the CBSL until 2006 recognizing the need to keep it independent . <p> The economy was stable . Just two years had negative economic growth rates but bounced back immediately . International lenders and trade creditors trusted the CBSL ( as it was independent from the government ) and credit ratings held their ground at acceptable levels . <p> Interference Since 2007 and ISB Debt Trap <p> Unfortunately , CBSL independence ended in 2006 . Politicians appointed another politician to the top post who did not rise through the ranks . A Central Banker who has risen through the ranks would be skilled appropriately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliation would fair reasonably in the post . However , in 2006 the appointee contested the 1999 provincial council election and was elected and he also contested parliamentary elections thereafter . <p> No surprise that Sri Lanka issued its first ISB ( International Sovereign Bond ) in 2007 for $500 million . The decision was taken by the government but the CBSL did not have independence to say no . It was a modest amount ( though five times that of the Lotus Tower ) but it was the first time Sri Lanka went for market borrowings . Previously the CBSL was not interested in foreign market borrowings as they are extremely costly ( high and variable interest rates ) , they must be repaid within 5 years in US dollars , no grace period and no accountability over where it is invested . Thus started Sri Lanka 's loan death trap . Started small but as expected it snowballed out of control . By now about 50% of Sri Lanka 's foreign debt is ISBs . <p> Further Interference and Hedging <p> While ISB foreign loans snowballed , lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations were not only allowed to borrow directly ( bypassing CBSL ) from foreign loan creditors , they were also allowed to enter in to speculative hedging deals with commercial banks . CBSL never allowed it before but as it lost its independence , it could only be a helpless spectator of this economic calamity . However , the CBSL was compelled to guarantee foreign loans taken directly by corporations . This bankrupted these corporations too as they had no foreign currency earnings . ( This was the reason they were not allowed to borrow directly until 2011 ) . <p> This move achieved a political outcome . Direct foreign borrowings of $9.5 billion by state corporations was kept out of CBSL books . The government boasted a lower than actual foreign loan figure just to hoodwink the public . As a result , even most economists were unable to forecast the impending debt and economic crisis as they traditionally based their analyses only on CBSL annual reports . <p> Sri Lanka started suffering credit rating downgrades as the CBSL was not guaranteed independence . <p> CBSL Gold Reserves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of independence were seen in the mismanagement of the nation 's foreign reserves and CBSL gold reserves . Instead of growing these , lack of central bank independence meant they were depleted without replenishment to meet the requirements of politicians and their various visions " ( Chinthanaya " ) . An Independent CBSL would not stand in the way of these visions " just to disrupt them . However , an Independent CBSL would not deplete its reserves and would advise the government how to retain the reserves and implement those plans ( or the economic reasons for not implementing those plans ) . Therefore , any action that depletes national reserves would be blocked by an independent CBSL . Sadly , Sri Lanka was denied this protection due to the absence of a law ensuring independence . <p> Another first for the CBSL happened during this time . Greece was going through economic turmoil and as a EU member it was widely expected to be bailed out by the EU . Some speculative investors bought Greek bonds cheaply hoping they would fetch higher values after the bail out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone to profit at Greece 's expense and those who bought them suffered huge losses . An independent CBSL would never have invested in speculative ventures . <p> In 2015 the CBSL issued local rupee bonds as it does . But this time it was traded by the son-in-law of the CBSL Governor . Interest paid to these bonds were artificially raised to make the trade profitable for the largest buyer ! As a result , interest rates across the banking system went up . Cost of capital ( which is an addition to CBSL base rates ) naturally went up bankrupting many a business venture . <p> Further Interference and Bankruptcy <p> Interference continued as years passed . Politicians blamed the CBSL for not using their tools to extend loans to people . Due to the absence of independence , CBSL was forced to do as instructed . It was also instructed to print currency notes recklessly and to repay ISB loans in 2021 and 2022 when it was obvious such payments would permanently deplete basic reserves any nation must maintain . <p> As a direct result of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign loans on April 12 , 2022 . Sri Lanka 's inflation went to unprecedent heights and stayed amongst the worse in the world . Economic growth rate went negative for 3 years which is a world record not just a Sri Lankan record . <p> People Pay CBSL Salaries to Serve Them , Not Politicians <p> CBSL must be independent . It owes it to the people who pay their salaries . People benefited when the CBSL was independent and suffered due to lack of it . No one wants a central bank independent from the people which is not possible . What is needed is a central bank independent of politicians . Politicians ' claim that the central bank would be another independent state if it were granted independence is absurd . It has not happened in any country and not in Sri Lanka either before 1978 . CBSL salaries are paid by the people and not by politicians so politicians have no right to have anything to do with the central bank . Central Bank policy is the same across the world -- economic development and stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent central bank would do . And that 's exactly what a central bank would be unable to do if it is not given independence . The government should manage the fiscal policy which can follow a political vision to the extent it does not clash with the monetary policy . For ease of understanding , it is like managing money in a household . Money can be spent on needs , wants and dreams but only to the extent the household has ( or can reasonably repay if borrowed ) . No one can spend money to pursue their dreams if it bankrupts the household . That includes genuine desires , gambling and even charity if they can not be afforded by the household . In a functioning household these will be conservatively managed by the mother who is conscious of future money needs and is not concerned about being popular with the children when it comes to money matters . <p> Today the stakes are even higher . Sri Lanka is at the mercy of international lenders ( IMF , loan creditors and trade creditors ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they do n't come to the party , Sri Lanka collapses . There are no more free lunches . <p> Sri Lanka is at a crossroads -- legally enact and ensure central bank independence and overcome the many economic crises it is in or plunge deeper into manifold crises . <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

China , on the other hand , is moving forward with various efforts to strengthen its position across the Middle East . By strengthening economic relations , China continues to strengthen diplomatic relations with countries in the region . On the other hand , in the international reality , we can see that the two countries have become weak in their internal affairs as a result of long-term military operations and mutual negative relations centered on the Yemen war . <p> However , this agreement has been welcomed in Iran . The country 's senior officials hailed the agreement as a step towards reducing tensions and strengthening regional security . In addition , it has been mentioned in Iranian media that this agreement indicates the " defeat " of the Western world and Israel . It should be noted that Iran is suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centered on a movement has destabilized the ongoing politics of Iran . <p> China has been Iran 's largest trading partner for 10 consecutive years from 2012 to 2022 . In 2022 , Sino-Iranian trade amounted to 15.8 billion US dollars , up 7 percent from the previous year . As a result , China 's exports to Iran increased by 14 percent to 9.44 billion US dollars in 2022 compared to 2021 . This indicates Iran 's good relations with China . This is basically what has made Iran sit at the negotiating table . It is also a way out of the current situation . <p> On the other hand , China is Saudi Arabia 's largest trading partner . In December 2022 , China exported $3.54 billion worth of goods to Saudi Arabia and China imported $5.67 billion worth of goods from Saudi Arabia . The positive stance of the Saudi government in negotiations with Iran through the mediation of China is understandable . China is the world 's largest buyer of crude oil , and the country imports more oil from Saudi Arabia than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the $87.3 billion in bilateral trade between the two countries in 2021 , accounting for 77 percent of China 's total imports from Saudi Arabia . In contrast , Saudi Arabia imported more than $30 billion worth of goods from China in 2022 , including technological equipment , telephones and other equipment . <p> Saudi Arabia 's role in Middle East politics is considered the most important . A country 's foreign policy influences regional and even global policy . Prince Mohammed bin Salman has outlined a radical change in Saudi Arabia targeting the year 2030 . In this regard , regional cooperation is a regulator , which is why the Saudi government wants to maintain good relations with Iran . Saudi Arabia is already facing a great economic pressure due to the war in Yemen . Added to this is the ongoing global economic crisis , which has put the Saudi economy under a strain . Therefore , the importance of China 's mediation is understood . <p> However , through this change , the role of the Middle East in the world will increase . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new role in international politics . For China , this diplomatic success will act as a game changer , challenging the influence of the Western world in Middle East politics . Besides , this agreement is an unprecedented achievement for China in filling the strategic vacuum left by the US and Russia and emerging as a reliable global partner . <p> Good relations between Saudi Arabia and Iran are crucial for the peace and security of the entire Middle East , which will bring to the fore the role of diplomatic settlement in moving the region to a conflict-free state in the coming days and resolving the ongoing crises . Such peacemaking may see changes in other unresolved regional issues as well . In fact , this agreement between Saudi Arabia and Iran will be an example in solving various crises in the future . <p> In the coming days , Saudi-Iranian relations will be tested depending on regional and global developments . Israel 's pressure on the US , the course of Iran-Europe relations , and Iran 's sincerity and goodwill will determine the deal 's future . Along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabia . On the other hand , if Saudi Arabia and Iran work together , we will soon see an end to something like the Yemen war , which will undoubtedly be a victory for global humanity . In addition , China 's diplomatic success and this new strategy and agreement to establish peace in regional politics have created a new arena for China 's competition with the Western world . However , these equations depend mainly on the successful implementation of this agreement . <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

@@97627240 <p> Humanity is losing due to the Biden-Putin warPosted on March 18th , 2023 <h> Fumiko Yamada <p> February 24 marked one year of the Ukraine-Russia war . A year ago , Putin 's 200,000 troops invaded Ukraine with arrogance and arrogance . The roar of the Russian tank fleet , some 35 miles long , died down within a few days . We have seen the devastation of tank fleets and the pursuit of Russian troops in various media , including social media . By miscalculating the military , Putin thought he would arrive in Kiev with his troops and vassals while eating pies . But the West , led by the US , has fueled the armed forces and people of Ukraine with arms , ammunition and logistics to sustain the war of resistance . As a result , Putin has seen some success in a year-long war . Now it is not visible where the end of this war is . There is nothing but stories of destruction , human rights abuses , war crimes and indescribable suffering of the people of the world . As a result , even if no side wins this war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no strong reason behind this war , the worst since 1945 , there is an equation between US arrogance and Russia 's security concerns . After the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1990 , the United States was assured of its security and established global hegemony . When the threat of socialist imperialism ended , they became concerned with the rise of Islamic power . The United States intervened directly or indirectly in various Muslim countries including the Middle East to prevent the Islamic renaissance at that time . Some Muslim countries quarreled among themselves and supplied weapons to one side , some directly joined the war , and some indirectly intervened by giving other Western allies . Even in some places , it takes the method of preventing the rise of political power of Islam by standing the opposition political power of the respective country . <p> We have seen these American interventions in the Iraq-Iran war , the war of the Gulf Multinational Forces , the war in Bosnia , the thwarting of the Algerian elections in 1991 , the independence of East Timor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even before this time , during the Cold War , the direct or indirect intervention of the United States in conflicts in all parts of the world has its signature . In other words , part of the foreign policy of the United States is to maintain its own authority where it is necessary to start a conflict or get involved in the conflict and where it is necessary to lead the peace process , so that its interests can be fully realized everywhere . Thus , in the world of single superpower , when the Americans are busy with the Muslim world ; Then China and Russia started coming out of their shells . China became busy increasing its influence in the country through trade and commerce . On the other hand , Russia is turning around after the transitional period of the 90s . Under the leadership of the authoritarian Putin , Moscow is trying to rise again geopolitically in the world court . In this situation , the United States suddenly regained its composure . Understandably , China and Russia are rapidly rising to take advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the Makey War on Terror . In the midst of this , Joe Biden , a politician who ascended to power in the United States , checked the world geopolitical situation and hastily ended the unfinished war by withdrawing all troops from Afghanistan to save money and manpower for the next war . He followed the strategy of his predecessors to prevent the rise of Russia . Focused on expanding NATO to eastern Europe . Meanwhile , Russia occupied the border city of Crimea with Ukraine in 2014 to ensure the security of its borders . As a result , Ukraine 's pro-Russian President Yakunavych fell and pro-Western and pro-American Zelenovsky came to power . After being elected president , Zelenowski began pushing for NATO membership . On the other hand , the West , led by the United States , continued to urge it to join NATO . As a result , Putin feels NATO 's hot breath on his neck . Putin believes that Russia 's security is going to be under serious threat . With no opposition political forces in the country or anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Putin launched a unilateral invasion of Ukraine on February 24 last year to counter the potential threat of NATO 's expansion to his country 's borders . Perhaps this is what US President Joe Biden wanted . He immediately united Western Europe against Russia and initiated an all-out cooperation effort against Russian aggression in Ukraine . <p> It has made it easier to wrap the world , control the economy , protect the overall interests of the US , including the arms trade . Usually all US presidents are seen to follow such foreign policy . Since the Americans do not have any major problems in their own country or because the country is relatively stable , the US leaders have been showing a tendency to occupy the leadership seat on the problems of any part of the world outside the country in order to maintain their popularity in domestic politics . As part of that , the US is leading the West Europeans in the Ukraine war . Currently , as the Islamic revolutionaries in Muslim countries have waned , the Americans have changed the slogan or excuse for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to ' human rights and democracy ' . In the name of ' war on terror ' , the worst lie in history has invaded Iraq and Afghanistan and killed millions of innocent people including women and children . However , Hindutva terrorism in India and Jewish terrorism in Palestine are being closely condoned . That is , since the said two countries are against Muslims ; Therefore , President Biden sees Hindutva and Zionist terrorism as a self-defense struggle . And despite the demands of the " democracy and human rights " watchdog , the US leadership is completely silent on the question of Egypt 's militarism , Saudi killings in Yemen , destruction in Syria , etc . That is , the philosophy of American human rights and democracy is only related to the interests of America ! That is why they are continuing to cooperate with Russia in Ukraine . <p> Analyzing the results of last year 's war in Ukraine shows only devastation . About 1.3 million people have been displaced . Of these , 8 million have emigrated ( New York Times : 02/03/2023 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and six . And 13 thousand 287 soldiers were killed on both sides ( UN Human Rights Commission : New Horizons : 25/02/2023 ) . Russia has been able to establish military dominance in parts of Ukraine in a year of fierce war . But the damage has been extensive . Many Russian generals were killed . At the same time , military weaknesses have been exposed . At this time , the Russian economy suffered a lot but did not collapse . Western powers thought they could contain Russia by imposing an economic embargo . But that was not possible because of the Russian economy 's reserves of food grains and raw materials to turn the wheels of technology-dependent Western industry . Russia supplied 17.5 percent of the total oil supplied to the world market in 2021 , 47 percent of palladium , 16.7 percent of nickel , 13 percent of aluminum and 25 percent of potash fertilizers ( First Light : 02/03/2023 ) . On the other hand , the damage to Ukraine is more terrible . The country 's infrastructure , especially the energy infrastructure , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the impact of this war in the global field is very serious . The lack of foodgrains and fuel in the world market and inflation has reached extreme levels , about 166 million people have gone below the extreme poverty line ( Pratham Alo : 24/02/2023 ) . As a result , the footsteps of famine are heard in the developing countries . On the other hand , the related countries are increasing the military expenditure to cover the cost of this war . This money is going away from common man 's rice , clothes and education and medical sector . It is known that 62 percent of the world 's total military expenditure is spent by the United States , China , India , the United Kingdom and Russia ( Prothom-alo : 22/02/2023 ) . <p> No signs of an end to the war in Ukraine are yet apparent . Recently , China proposed a 12-point peace proposal to end the war . Ukraine has commented that the proposal is unilateral . And because China itself has failed to condemn Russia 's aggression , the West is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America has warned China against supplying arms to Russia . Analysts do not think that this peace proposal can play an effective role in the work . Meanwhile , many people think that the United States wants to keep China busy by creating tension in Taiwan so that China can not join the war with Russia . That is why it can be seen that in the last one year , the amount of provocation and war of words that the United States has given to China regarding Taiwan has never been seen before . Because the relationship between China and Russia has deepened since the start of the Ukraine war . At the G20 summit in New Delhi last week , US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken spoke for ten minutes while walking with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov . There , Blinken urged Lavrov to withdraw all troops from Ukraine ( Prothom-alo : 21/02/2023 ) . On the other hand , Ukraine 's defense minister also claimed that peace talks with Russia could be held on the condition of withdrawing all Russian troops and returning to the 1991 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion dollars of military aid to Ukraine , including 3 billion dollars from the United States ( previously ) . Again NATO has promised full cooperation against Russia . On February 20 , President Biden suddenly visited Kiev and announced in a strong voice , " Russia will never win in Ukraine , never " . He has promised that the US will stand by Ukraine as long as it takes to win the war ( Prothom-alo : 27/02/2023 ) . In this situation , Russia is making all preparations to increase the intensity of the war in the coming spring . All in all , the Ukraine war has become a war of attrition . Neither side shows signs of backing down or winning . <p> However , the economic condition of America after Corona is not the same as before . Therefore , the Americans are not taking well the fact that President Biden 's huge amount of money is helping the war in Ukraine . Biden is said to be feeling such pressure . In this situation , it is difficult to say how long the Biden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue this war . It may also be that , ahead of the November 2024 election in the United States , Biden may suddenly try to become a hero to the Americans through some kind of negotiation or compromise . And Putin will not be able to carry the burden of this war for a long time . So Putin may respond to any compromise offer by Biden . In the past , American politics was done outside the country . That is , relying on world conflict-peace politics , the US leadership tries to draw voters towards them . So the world will have to wait until then to be freed from the terrible effects of the war in Ukraine . But if the brutality of Russian forces in Ukraine escalates in the name of " Operation Spring " or if Ukraine is on the verge of destruction , the American population will turn towards Ukraine and hatred against Russia may arise . If things go that way , President Joe Biden may take steps to increase aid to Ukraine . In that case , the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world humanity may have reached the brink of defeat . <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

@@97909236 <h> In 1966 , the Indian economist Dr. B.R. Shenoy suggested measures that would have prevented Sri Lanka 's precipitous economic slide in succeeding years . <p> Giving the keynote address at a symposium on Economic Dialogue -- IMF and Beyond " here on March 30 , Sri Lankan President Ranil Wickremesinghe said that Sri Lanka 's economic problems would not have arisen if governments had implemented Indian economist B.R.Shenoy 's Report prepared at the request of the Ceylon government way back in 1966 . <p> In the late 50s and mid-1960s , when Ceylon 's economy was experiencing an all-round slide due to the extreme left-wing policies of the time , the then Finance Minister J.R . Jayewardene , at the suggestion of newspaper magnate Esmond Wickremesinghe , secured the services of the leading Indian right-wing economist Dr. B.R. Shenoy to advice him on restructuring the island nation 's economy and nursing it back to the healthy condition it was in , prior to 1957 . <p> Dr. Shenoy , who was familiar with Ceylon 's economy , having been a lecturer at the University College in Colombo in the 1940s , submitted a well-researched report in 1966 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reform . <p> But given the dominant voice of the Left in the politics of Ceylon at that time , Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake , although a right winger , shelved Shenoy 's recommendations . Senanayake and his successors continued the policy of doling out subsidies and expanding and allowing the inefficient public sector to function in an uneconomic manner , even as these policies were proving to be dysfunctional . Continuance of this populist approach drove the country to wrack and ruin and a historic default in April 2022 . <p> Resurrecting Shenoy 's report in 2015 , W.A.Wijewardena , a former Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka , wrote in India 's Swarajya magazine that in the mid-60s , Ceylon 's foreign exchange reserves had plummeted from 13.4 months of imports in 1948 to 1.9 months of imports in 1966 . <p> After 1956 , the Ceylonese State kept committing its slender resources to expanding and maintaining inefficient state sector institutions and social welfare schemes . To service these , governments resorted to deficit financing . <p> The total public debt which had stood at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 1966 . And since the government was running a sizeable budget deficit , the repayment of public debt , as well as payment of interest thereon , was done by resorting to further borrowing , thereby entrapping the country in a vicious debt trap , " Wijewardena wrote . <p> He drew attention to the increase in money supply above the growth in the real economy , leading to higher prices . The money-GDP ratio had gone up from 17% in 1950 to 29% in 1966 . The government was forced to resort to price and foreign exchange controls . <h> Shenoy 's Report <p> In his report , Shenoy had noted that while the economy was growing at 2% , the population was growing at 2.7% . And while the majority of the population was finding it hard to make ends meet , the small Ceylonese elite was splurging . He warned of the consequences of this undemocratic trend . As Wijewardene pointed out , such glaring inequality led to the bloody Janatha Vimuthi Peramuna ( JVP ) insurgency in 1971 . <p> Shenoy noted that heavy subsidies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He pointed out that in the absence of adequate domestic savings , governments were resorting to bank financing to meet their capital expenditure . Savings had declined from 13.6% of GDP in 1959 to 10.7% in 1965 . During the same period , Australia 's savings were at 29% and Canada 's at 24% . <p> Foreign aid went to the public sector which misused it . But the silver lining was tax revenue . Tax revenue was 24.6% of the national income at that time ( in contrast to 12% in 2015 ) . Tax revenue is dismal now . <p> Accrued income was spent on food subsidies , direct relief payments and social services in the health , education and a host of other sectors . These accounted for 45.7% of revenue collections . The bulk of the capital outlays in the budgets from 1960-61 to 1965-66 ( 74% ) was for economic services and government enterprises " . The revenue part of the budget was larger than the capital part . <p> Deficit financing reached its peak in 1959-60 . Budget deficits increased money supply by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed that consumption expenditure of this sort was unrelated to production and had a debit effect on national savings . <p> He did not recommend increase in taxes because taxes in Ceylon were already high and any further increases would have been ruinous . According to Wijewadene , tax rates in Ceylon stood at 80% at the margin . That should be scaled down drastically in order to promote national savings , Shenoy recommended . Taxation destroys potential national savings into a bonfire of public consumption , " he pointed out . At any rate , higher taxation had not helped the Ceylon economy pick up . <h> De-nationalization <p> Shenoy strongly recommended de-nationalization of select State corporations . He urged the government to withdraw from businesses and production activities as these could be run by private entrepreneurs more economically . <p> Wijewardena noted that the Indian economist had suggested the listing of state corporations in the stock exchange so that they would be disciplined by the market , instead of by political authorities . " Listing in the stock exchange would also help them mobilize funds from the market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> This would have succeeded in the 1950s and 60s , because the Ceylon stock exchange was vibrant thanks to the plantation companies . <p> Shenoy urged the adoption of a freely floating exchange rate to address the persistent balance of payments difficulties in the wake of uncertainty about the receipt of donor funding . He also recommended the lifting of import and export restrictions and the liberalization of external trade . <p> It was pointed out that the strict exchange and import controls have generated a massive black market for foreign exchange on the one hand and a thriving smuggling business on the other . The reaction of the authorities was to impose more and more penalties on the culprits . Hence , there was a substantial disparity between the official exchange rate and black market rate ; the result was the over-invoicing of imports and under-invoicing of exports so that saved foreign exchange could be lucratively sold in the black market . " <h> Changing Food Subsidy System <p> Shenoy recommended replacing the existing food subsidy by a cash subsidy in a phased manner . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11% of the GNP and 53% of budget revenues . <p> In a background of declining savings and capital decay , there can be no justification for continuing these subsidies at this ruinously high level , " he argued . <p> Shenoy suggested a change in the technique of giving subsidies . In place of selling rice at 25 cents per measure , it may be sold at actual cost i.e. the average cost per measure to the Government of imported rice ( the landed cost of this rice is 50-56 cents per measure ) and of rice purchased under the GPS scheme ( the cost of this rice is Rs. 12 per bushel of paddy or Rs. 24 per bushel of rice ) -- plus a small margin to cover the administrative expenses of handling imports . " <p> At the same time , every rice ration cardholder may be paid , outright , in cash , the amount of the de facto payment which he now receives in the form of rice at below cost , " he said . <p> It is important for purposes of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the payments for rice by the ration card holders . The two transactions must be effected by two different agencies . The cash subsidy may be paid through , say , the Post Offices , while rice will continue to be sold through ration shops , " he added . <p> Shenoy was deeply influenced by his teacher Friedrich A. Hayek , who later advised Margaret Thatcher when she reformed the British economy in 1979 . <p> Sri Lanka was literally one period ahead of Britain when it engaged Hayek 's disciple to do the same job 13 years earlier . The difference was that while Britain implemented most of Hayek 's recommendations , Ceylon ignored them , " Wijewardene rued . <h> P. K. Balachandran <p> P. K.

@@98508238 <h> IMF deal : We have a rigorous dose to be taken , otherwise country will slip back - Prof. Rohan Samarajiva <p> I personally believe it will take a little bit longer than four years for the country to get to growth <p> Leading economist Prof. Rohan Samarajiva , who is also chair of LIRNEasia , spells out the way forward for the country in the aftermath of the arrangement with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) . Excerpts of the interview : <p> Q Sri Lanka celebrates the arrangement with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) . But , there is a long way to go since debt restructuring has to be done , and the reform agenda implemented . Is n't it too early to celebrate ? <p> It is the first step . It is way too early to celebrate . It is a time for sober reflection and to understand that this is the first step of a long journey . There are many other countries which have taken such loans . Zambia , for example , got the ( IMF ) board approval . But , they have not got debt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the latest IMF news conference , somebody asked Peter Breuer about the most difficult of these . He said the target for a positive primary balance is very , very ambitious . The primary balance is that we must bring in more money every year to the government than we spend , excluding all loans and interests . We have not done this in 75 years , except for 4-5 years . We have set ourselves this target . But , there are many difficult things in order to achieve this . If we fail to do that , we will fall . That is that the IMF benchmark will not be met . The next tranche will not be given . People will say this country can not get its act together . <p> Q In your assessment , how long and challenging is the journey ? <p> This is a four-year programme . I personally believe it will take a little bit longer than four years for the country to get to growth . Our objective must not to go back to where we were in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth path . Let 's be optimistic ! I would say five or six years to really get on the path . If you look at the projections of growth , they are not very high . There are many , many difficult things to be done . For example , the property tax . It is an extraordinarily difficult thing to calculate . We do n't have an active property market in this country . But , we are going to tax it . I am thankful that they have been realistic about it and said they will do it in 2025 . Between now and 2025 , we have to do a lot of work to achieve those objectives . <p> Q We hear some voices in political circles critical of the IMF arrangement . They sometimes say no country has emerged from their crises after deals with the IMF . But , India and Thailand are good examples to prove otherwise . How do you look at the issue in that context ? <p> I think Prof. Premachandra Athukorale said it best . He said Asian countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , African countries go to the IMF repeatedly . While we are physically located in Asia , we have been behaving like an African country . I liken it to people taking antibiotics . If you take antibiotics , you have to complete the dose . If you stop it half way through , it has no effect . Furthermore , it actually harms you . We are a people that has not taken the full dose all this time . This time , we have a rigorous dose . It is not a simple matter . Because of that , we have to be very , very diligent and committed as a country to achieve that . Otherwise we will slip back . <p> Q In the context of political uncertainty hanging around , how optimistic are you ? <p> Let me put it this way ! I am somebody who chose to come back to Sri Lanka from a tenured job in the United States . Number one , I have to be optimistic . Secondly , we put up a discussion document back in February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme . We said two things . An all-party approach is necessary to get through this crisis . Secondly , we said , for two years , it could be good if we do n't have elections . I even said let 's get the provincial council elections out of the way , and proceed with the all-party arrangement . There were disagreements . Mr. Karu Jayasuriya who I was working with on all these matters said two years was too much . He said one year . Those are debatable matters . But , we really have to work together to achieve this . Now we have not achieved that objective . The first step would have been like a wartime Cabinet . I used the analogy of Winston Churchill . Churchill was the prime minister . His deputy prime minister was from his opposition - the Labour Party during World War II . We did not get that . Then , we had the other idea , Plan B. Whether it is possible for the opposition MPs not to join the government formally but work with the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put in place something called sectoral oversight committees when he was Speaker . They have been revived . We were hoping that the oversight committees would play an active role . We came close . Again , everybody knows it did not quite work as we envisaged . <p> We are now in the plan C. I believe honestly that there are people in the opposition who are cooperative . I believe the government is also open to some suggestions . They could be more conciliatory . In a way , they are less conciliatory now than when the process started . I am sorry about that . What we would like to do is to have at least an effective Plan C. <p> Q Sri Lanka still has to get out of the way without depending on loans . What is your view ? <p> We have to depend on loans . I am going to say something contrary . We have to get out of this crisis . Still , we have to get loans . I just have an objection to wrongly taken loans . <p> Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) . Is n't it ? <p> I am interested in role of ideas and the impact of those ideas on the world . I went back to December , 2006 or January , 2007 . We had a development dialogue . I had quoted in some of my writings Dr. Sarath Amunugama , then Deputy Minister of Finance . He said , " We have new partners . We do n't want these condionalities ' . In 2007 , the taking of International Sovereign Bonds ( ISB ) started . In 2007 , large-scale borrowings from China started . ISBs do n't require anything - feasibility study or anything . Chinese also do n't require a lot of technical conditions to be satisfied . No conditionalities . That is where we started . The article I wrote at that time was called ' Chinese conditionalities ' . We are not getting these conditionalities . If you work with the World Bank , you have to get environmental clearance , feasibility studies etc . With the Japanese , it is even more complicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressway , I showed what the original estimate and the Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) upper limit estimates were , and what we spent by taking a loan from China . That is the cost of Chinese conditionality . We are spending way more . We have to be very careful about those kinds of loans . My favourite example is the Lotus Tower . There was no business case for it . But , we built it on loans . We have to take necessary loans , not these kinds of loans . <p> Q Sri Lanka needs to boost its foreign reserves , though . What is the strategy you propose ? <p> Very clearly , we have to increase exports . I have this diagram . We have all these imports - super diesel , Octane 92 , wheat , grain , cellular phone and so on . These boxes are scaled to show how much we are spending . I showed this to people . Generally speaking , there is nothing here that can be cut . So we have to export in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have exports ( Refers to another diagram ) . You can see we have not diversified . <p> We have to diversify . There is no question about that . We have to diversify not only what we export but also the markets . We have to diversify to Asia . Today , we are selling to the United States and Europe . We have to reduce that reliance and sell more to Asia . How do we do it ? The answer comes in three parts . <p> In the short term , the Export Development Board ( EDB ) has got a national export strategy . If you want , do a quick update of that . But , they have committees already in place to implement the national export strategy . The government does not export . The government provides goods and services to people here . The private sector is the one that engages in export . Because the private sector exports , we have to listen to them . In each of these areas , I would bring people to a series of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the barriers that are being experienced . Secondly , we have to look at people who like to export to Asia and other places . We have to identify the barriers they face and remove them . Trade negotiations going on at the moment are a good vehicle for doing it . We always look at trade agreements in terms of how do we protect our markets from foreigners . We have the second question . You want to export . What are the problems these trade agreements can help you with ? Then , we go to our trading partners -- India , China and Thailand - and ask them to address these issues . That would be the medium term solution . In both cases , we are dealing with industrialists who have some international exposure and experience in exporting . Now , there are longer term opportunities . <p> I am told we generated US $ 1.7 billion from software and business process outsourcing sector . That is higher than what we expected . I personally believe the BPO industry is a sunset industry . We really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . Software industry is a stronger sector where we have the potential . We have to really think about machine learning and related areas - call it Artificial Intelligence . We have to have this conversation to identify the barriers that prevent us from becoming an AI-intensive country . We complain about our young people leaving . If we plan things properly , we can attract them back . <p> Q What are the lessons which we can learn from Thailand and India which went for successful arrangements with the IMF ? <p> I had the benefit of listening to the Thai Central Bank governor from that time . The Thai crisis took a very different form , originating as it did in a crash in the banking sector . The Indian case is similar to ours . Our core problem is the twin deficit problem . We have been running fiscal deficits for most of the past 75 years . Our exports are anemic . Everybody who looks at the goods exports will say that is the problem . I am a person who looks at the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We have to get rid of the barriers holding back the export of goods and services . Government has announced that para tariffs will be phased out . We have to make the necessary structural reforms .

However the Justice Minister cleared his hands on the information and severe allegation stating that his statement was based only on unconfirmed information and that it was not yet considered as evidence . <p> Days have gone by but no traces of any Gunasekara has been revealed and worse of all examinations and investigations have so far given indication that there is no such person in the UK <p> However , the CID had told media that it was not able to find any information about Chamara Gunasekara until April 26 . Moreover , reports indicated that no information had been found about the Bank in England where the money was reportedly deposited , or the account in question . It was also revealed through the media that the CID was seeking expert assistance from the Central Bank to locate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers suspect that those involved in the incident are using various tactics to mislead the country , according to media reports . <p> The Justice Minister 's controversial statement led many enthusiasts including environmental activists and those who want to know the truth about the so called Gunasekara , in case if found , would unravel the whole mystery of X-Press Pearl . <p> An attempt to fabricate a story about a non-existent person and divert attention ? - Environmentalists <p> Environmental activist Nayanaka Ranwella stated that , even after consulting reliable people who have lived in England for 20-30 years , he could not find anyone by the name of Chamara Gunasekara . Ranwella said that there was no listing of a person by that name among the names of Sri Lankans and social service professionals residing in England . He added that the bank where the bribe money is alleged to have been deposited was a small bank located in England , and it would be impossible to carry out such a huge transaction without complying with the country 's laws when there is no one to receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sri Lankan government might be trying to fabricate a story about a non-existent person named Chamara Gunasekara receiving a bribe , and then claim that no such person exists . He expressed uncertainty about whether there are plans to retract allegations of bribery against individuals who may have profited from the damage caused by the X-Press Pearl ship . He further stated that , given all these stories , he has reasonable doubts . <p> Ranwella raised concerns over the fact that the observation team was not allowed to access the area where the ship caught fire , gives rise to suspicions that a bribe was taken . The <p> Environmental activist Nayanaka Ranwella <p> transfer of 250 million dollars should involve a business account , as per the laws of a country like England . Thus , it is unlikely that such a transaction could take place outside the purview of the law in England . Ranwella also alleged that although the bank account mentioned by the Justice Minister may be held in a small bank in England , it has been revealed that there is no such person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe mentioned the name Chamara Gunasekara in Parliament as the person who is said to have received the bribe . The Minister also disclosed many details such as Gunasekara 's account number and the money transfer number <p> Environmentalists charged that many people have profited from the X-Press Pearl ship disaster . According to Ranwella , from installing machines to removing the plastic pellets that washed up on the shore from the sunken ship and up until now attempts are made only to make money out of the worst ever man-made marine disaster in Sri Lankan sea . Additionally , he alleged that some members of the committee appointed to investigate the damage caused due to the ship carrying chemical substances and calculate the compensation had not performed their duties properly . He also said that the place where the chemical substances were recovered from the ship were stored in the Wattala area and was not properly inspected . <p> Tender to remove the ship given to Chinese company with the blessings of a politician <p> An official from Sri Lanka Ports Authority who wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company submitted tenders for the scrapping of the X-Press Pearl ship and removing the debris . At the outset , the tender of the Sri Lankan company had been rejected claiming its inability to carry out the said operation . Ultimately , a Chinese company was awarded the tender for scrapping the ship , reportedly based on the recommendation of a high-ranking politician . The Chinese company later subcontracted the work to three other organizations , according to the spokesperson . <p> The total estimated compensation for the environmental damage caused by the X-Press Pearl ship is USD 6.4 billion . However , according to the information another party has allegedly made a deal with the shipping company to obtain only USD 4 billion as compensation . Some of the officials have agreed to the deal . However according to reports , Sri Lanka will only receive USD 1 billion as total compensation , with another US one billion going to those who agreed to the deal . The remaining USD 2 billion is expected to be kept by the shipping company and that is how the deal has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lanka Ports Authority . Additionally , there are reports that an individual who allegedly received bribes from the ship is now planning to start a business in Sri Lanka . <p> Investigating officers suspect that those involved in the incident are using various tactics to mislead the country , according to media reports . <p> Former Chairman of the Maritime Environment Protection Authority , Darshani Lahadapura , was asked whether any irregularities took place when the reports prepared to claim compensation for the environmental damage caused by the X-Press Pearl ship disaster . She said that the NARA Institute and other committee members were allowed to inspect the ship during the assessment to claim compensation . However they were not allowed to reach the ship claiming safety concerns . " We also realised the risk involved , " Ms. Lahadapura , ex-MEPA chairman said . She also said that the committee responsible for assessing the compensation had been allowed to inspect all the hazardous materials that had been piled up in the Wattala area . <p> " The legal case to demanding compensation was filed through the Attorney General 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owns the ship and the company that operated it ( P&amp;I Club ) and the captain of the ship . We only prepared the environmental report . This compensation is for the damage caused . The compensation for the environmental damage can be calculated for years , and this is the biggest damage caused to a sea area by plastic pellets . This case is one of the most significant cases in the world and the decision would go down in history . " Additionally , she said that the case would be a precedent for future similar cases . We reached out to Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe to inquire whether he had initiated legal action to claim compensation from the X-Press Pearl . But he was unreachable as he was attending parliament . <p> Environmental activist Nayanaka Ranwella said that some individuals in the Sri Lankan government might be trying to fabricate a story about a non-existent person named Chamara Gunasekara receiving a bribe , and then claim that no such person exists <p> However , in a recent parliamentary session , the minister said that he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ship . During this session , the minister also raised concerns about an act of the Sectoral Oversight Committee on April 4 prior to the filing of the lawsuit . According to the minister , officials from the Attorney General 's Department had been summoned to discuss the case before it was filed . A group including Catholic priests were also invited to discuss the impact of the X-Press Pearl incident caused on the fishing community . In addition to this group , a group of lawyers representing the ship 's owner and insurance company were also present . Rajapakshe stated that the Sectoral Oversight Committee had inquired with the officials of the Attorney General 's Department about how the case was filed in the presence of defense lawyers . The Minister of Justice said in Parliament that such a mistake could be detrimental to Sri Lanka 's case and that if the compensation amount is lost as a result , the Sectoral Oversight Committee would be held accountable for it . Our attempts to contact MP Ajith Mannapperuma , Chairman of the Sectoral Oversight Committee failed . However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issue : <p> " I see the issue differently as the Chairman of the Sectoral Oversight Committee . It is different from your point of view .

Our committee meeting started only after the representatives from the shipping company and insurance company had left , " he added . <h> Comments - 0 <h> Add comment <p> Comments will be edited ( grammar , spelling and slang ) and authorized at the discretion of Daily Mirror online .

Two other senior UN monitors of detainee rights and health rights condemned Israel 's ghoulish practice of allowing troublesome Palestinian detainees to die while on hunger strike . <p> " There must be accountability from the Israeli Government following the death of Palestinian hunger striker Khader Adnan " , two independent UN human rights experts said last Wednesday , referring to the decades-long Israeli practice of mass arbitrary detention of Palestinians as " cruel " and " inhumane . " <p> The 45-year-old Palestinian died in his prison cell last Tuesday morning following a nearly three-month hunger strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbitrarily detaining Palestinians without charges and in violation of fair trial guarantees . Adnan was the West Bank-based civilian spokesperson for the small , militarily active , Palestine Islamic Jihad ( PIJ ) group which is headquartered in Gaza and is branded as a " terrorist " group by Tel Aviv . <p> Accountability <p> The UN call for greater accountability came from the independent expert , or Special Rapporteur , on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories , Francesca Albanese , and the Special Rapporteur on the right to health , Tlaleng Mofokeng . There has been condemnation across West Asia of the Israeli Government 's apparent failure to ensure adequate medical attention to Adnan 's rapidly deteriorating condition . <p> A banner welcomes SCO delegates in Goa , India <p> The Palestinian Government declared three days of mourning . Protests across the Palestinian territories culminated in a number of mini-rockets being fired from Gaza into Israel midweek . This prompted a series of air strikes by Israel on densely populated Gaza causing at least one death and several injury casualties and the destruction of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mourned over Adnan 's death , this hapless nation also mourned the killing of nine people during another major Israeli military operation last week in the large city of Jenin and its adjacent refugee camp . <p> Also last week , Israeli air raids targeted the Aleppo International Airport ( IATA code ALP ) in Northern Syria on May 1 . Syrian State media reported that the raids killed one Syrian soldier and put ALP out of commission . The nearby Syrian Air Force ( SAF ) base was also severely bombed . Syria 's State news agency SANA said two civilians and five other Syrian soldiers were wounded . <p> This wholly unprovoked aggression has been a constant pattern by Tel Aviv for decades as it strives to keep the far weaker and currently insurgency-stricken Damascus regime under continuous pressure . Observers in the region speculate that last Monday 's sudden bombing was an ' armed propaganda ' action by Israel just before the Iranian President 's visit to Syria , a major ally of Tehran . <p> Close ties <p> Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi met his counterpart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an Iranian Head of State since Syria 's war began in 2011 , underlining their close ties as Syrian relations with other Arab states remain weak . The two leaders agreed to further strengthen ties and collaboration . <p> Although it has not been officially acknowledged , Iran is known to have provided special forces units to Syria to help balance the military equation in the face of hundreds of American Special Forces semi-officially operating in Eastern Syria and Turkish military units also operating on Syrian soil . <p> Washington has already officially criticised this visit and called on the world community to intensify the isolation of both Damascus and Tehran . This active American posture indicates that Israel 's strike on Aleppo may have also been partly a proxy action on behalf of Washington . <p> Another potential geopolitical flashpoint is last week 's seizure by Iran of an oil tanker as it exited the Persian Gulf with a load of oil for an US oil corporation . This was Iran 's second such seizure in a week and it outraged Washington . <p> The US Navy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Niovi in the Strait of Hormuz after the Guard 's naval craft had apparently forced the vessel to change course . The US released what it said were pictures of small Iranian naval vessels surrounding the tanker . In the previous week Iran seized an oil tanker , the Advantage Sweet , carrying crude for the US energy firm Chevron . <p> Iran 's Tasnim news agency , linked to the Revolutionary Guard , reported that the Guard had seized a tanker for what it claimed were un-specified " violations " of maritime protocol . The Niovi , with a fully Indian crew , is reportedly managed by Smart Tankers of Piraeus , Greece . <p> The UK 's Financial Times ( FT ) , in reporting this potentially volatile development , squarely put the blame for this latest escalation in the Hormuz Strait on Washington 's continuing provocations in enforcing its unilateral economic sanctions against Iran . <p> An FT report said : " US authorities ordered a tanker of Iranian crude oil to redirect towards the US in recent days , in a move officials believe was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Thursday . Three people briefed on the situation said the US had intervened to summon a ship loaded with Iranian crude , originally destined for China , as Washington looks to step up enforcement of sanctions on Tehran . " <p> The FT goes on to insist that Teheran continues this practice of seizing merchant ships as retaliation for the crippling economic sanctions being unilaterally enforced against it by Washington . <p> Sanctions <p> The FT report , however , does not mention that many other poorer nations are currently suffering economically also due to these same sanctions . Sri Lanka , for example , has had to severely reduce its reliance on cheap Iranian crude oil due to American sanctions . <p> Wednesday 's action by Iran is one of a series of ship seizures since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew the US from the historic multilateral treaty ( formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ) that aimed to restrict Iran 's nuclear development and possible nuclear arming . That Treaty had seen Tehran reduce its enrichment of Uranium in exchange for the lifting of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And , as the world struggles with climate change , poverty and refugees starving in the war-torn Horn of Africa , Britain yesterday busted hundreds of millions of Sterling Pounds to crown a monarch who long ago lost his Empire and finds that nearly half of his ' subjects ' consider him irrelevant , if not an economic burden and political embarrassment . <p> Nearly half of the British population no longer want a monarchy , the Anglican Church of which he is the titular head is now a religious minority with over half of Britons now atheist , and , even those few former British colonies , like Canada and Australia , that still nominally have the British monarch as their Head of State seem poised to gradually abolish that archaic institution . <p> Cultural and mineral treasures <p> In South Africa and other former plundered colonies there are movements calling for the repatriation of the cultural and mineral treasures still flaunted by the British monarchy .

@@98637238 <h> President rescued country from economic crisis - Prasanna Ranatunga <p> Chief Government Whip , Minister of Urban Development and Housing Prasanna Ranatunga said that at present , the entire country has realised that President Ranil Wickremesinghe is the leader who is capable of rebuilding the economy . The Minister in an interview with the Sunday Observer said the ordinary people , businessmen and the upper middle class are aware that the President within a very short period has been able to rescue the country from the current economic crisis that emerged one year ago . Therefore , if the President contests as the common candidate at the next Presidential election , I maintain the stance that we all should think as a country and extend our support to him . <p> Excerpts of the interview <p> Q : You have said that more than 126 SLPP parliamentarians are supporting President Ranil Wickremesinghe to continue the current Government until the last possible date . Would you like to comment ? <p> A : What I said was at the moment , we have a strong Government . All have decided to extend their support to the President to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a party , we have made the biggest sacrifice to extend our fullest support to the President in Parliament to overcome the current economic challenge . <p> Q : You have also said that if current President Ranil Wickremesinghe is nominated as a common candidate , you will extend your support to him . What led you to make such a statement ? <p> A:Actually , we do n't know whether President Ranil Wickremesinghe will contest the next Presidential election or not . When the media asked me , I said if the President is nominated as the common candidate and the SLPP takes a decision as a party , I will extend my support to the President . At present , the entire country has realised that President Wickremesinghe is the leader who is capable of rebuilding the economy . <p> The ordinary people , businessmen and upper middle class are aware that the President within a very short period has been able to rescue the country from the current crisis that emerged one year ago . Therefore , if the President contests as the common candidate , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country and extend our support to him . <p> Q : Former Minister and SLPP parliamentarian S.M. Chandrasena told a recent SLPP media conference that former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was misled and misguided by so-called professionals on the organic fertiliser and the entire country had to face bankruptcy . How do you view this ? <p> A : Some of the doctors and professionals who came to the Covid-19 committee recommended not to grant permission for Covid-19 burials of Muslims as it would pave the way for groundwater contamination . It were the professionals who gave those instructions and as politicians we were not aware of its scientific background . <p> I have a doubt that some of those professionals deliberately gave those instructions to create a public displeasure over the Government . Most of them were at the forefront of the Aragalaya that led to the ouster of President Gotabaya Rajapaksa in July , 2022 . However , the people finally put the blame on the Government regarding the cremation of all victims of the Covid-19 virus including Muslims , irrespective of their faith . I was also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rajapaksa had to take that policy decision as it were the doctors and professions who requested not to grant permission for Covid-19 burials . The Government could n't go against the scientific decision by those professionals . The President and the Government were misled and misguided by some professionals . However , the then President Gotabaya Rajapaksa trusted the professionals . Even though we tried to explain and convince the President , he did n't believe us . <p> The next one was the organic fertiliser issue . We said if the farmers request chemical fertiliser , provide them , but our request was not entertained by the President . Some professionals gave lots of explanations saying that there is an international recognition for organic fertiliser . Therefore , the former President was misled by some of these professionals and we ca n't put the blame on the President . When the professionals say something , the President will have to listen to that . Otherwise , if their requests and advice are not followed , they put the blame on us . <p> Q : The main Opposition Samagi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties has taken a firm decision to express their opposition to the proposed Anti-Terrorism Bill . Your views ? <p> A : Justice Minister Dr.Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe has presented the draft bill . The proposed bill was drafted with the consultation of professionals . If there are any contents of the bill which can not be agreed upon and need amendments , an opportunity has been given to discuss them further . That is why the Minister said if any amendments are to be done , they can be done . <p> Q : There is a lot of controversy and the SJB has also filed a complaint at the Bribery Commission over the reports of crediting US$ 250 million to the bank account of a person as bribe to prevent the Sri Lankan Government from securing damages over the X-Press Pearl ship disaster . What is your view in this regard ? <p> A:There are two factors . If the said story is true , it should be investigated . The majority is of the view that something has happened . The first factor is that those who spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release that ship . When the President had given clear instructions to take a guarantee before releasing the ship , we have a problem as to how it was released and who gave orders to that . There is an impression among the people as a result of it , a large amount of money has been fraudulently obtained as a bribe . If this factor is true , it is a serious mistake and investigation should be conducted to bring the culprits to book . <p> There is another opinion when this case is cleared by the investigations just to plant news pretending that such an incident has happened . There is a problem because even after the investigations are completed whether this case will be swept under the carpet . Of these two , anyone can happen . If any false information is given saying that such an incident has not occurred , then the investigations will be completed . However , the issue before us is as to why the ship was released and who gave instructions to do so . Who was the Minister in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ship and what were the measures taken by him . A parliamentary debate will also be held in this regard and then the matter will be discussed at length . <p> Q : Former President Maithripala Sirisena addressing the SLFP May Day rally said the future Governments of the country will be formed with the leadership of the SLFP and it is the only political party that can rebuild the country . How do you respond to this claim ? <p> A:Wrong policy decisions and political decisions , lapses on the part of Government officials and various other riot incidents that took place over the past 72 years may have had an impact on the current economic crisis . However , the highest amount of loans obtained within a short period has been taken during the tenure of the former Yahapalana Government . Maithripala Sirisena was the President at the time . The people also have an opinion regarding the Easter Sunday attacks . Then the former President ca n't say that they did the highest amount of work . The country was destroyed during the tenure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were misled through various false propaganda campaigns by undermining their dignity . The SLFP has declined at present . <p> Q : JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told his supporters on May Day that the majority of the country 's working class is now with the JVP and they have the capacity to rescue the country from the present crisis . Would you like to air your views ? <p> A : My personal experience is when we got defeated in 2001 and my father , former Minister Reggie Ranatunga was alive ; arrangements had been made to hold the UPFA May Day rally in Nuwara Eliya . We brought two buses to go to Nuwara Eliya , but only one bus went due to lack of people . That was the situation which prevailed in the country at that time once we faced that electoral defeat . This time we held our May Day rally in a situation where our party supporters were brutally attacked and killed and the houses of a large number of Government politicians were set on fire a few months ago . I say with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks . <p> The JVP members had got involved in most of those riot incidents . There had been plans to attack and set on fire the houses of Ministers countrywide within a short period . However , this is nothing new to the JVP . They unleashed violence in 1971 and 1988-1989 as well . <p> Recently also they resorted to the same form of violence and showed them via social media to frighten our people . We brought one bus in 2001 to go to our May Day rally , and could win all the elections held thereafter . Even if the people do n't come for political processions and political meetings , they vote us. if the country is in a more difficult situation today than the past , a large number of people participated in our May Day rally . <p> The people in villages are still with us , but they had a fear of coming to Colombo . If an election is held , we would secure victory . During the past few years , the best organisation and the highest number of crowds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their vote base is merely 3 to 4 percent . This is the true situation . Even if the JVP makes a big hue and cry , the country 's intelligent voters know it is a party which unleashed violence and killed people in the past and is not in a position to come to power democratically . <p> Q : You have said that a Presidential Commission with full powers should be appointed to look into the tragic incidents that took place during the violent period of ' Aragalaya ' . Could you explain ? <p> A : We could see how some lawyers went to courts and appeared to grant bail for protestors . Some property who destroyed public properties were granted bail within a few hours . That is why , we have requested to appoint a Presidential Commission with full powers to probe those riot incidents that took place during the latter part of ' Aragalaya ' and bring the culprits to book . <p> Q : Addressing a gathering at the launch of ' Navaya ; Sengawunu Kathawa ' ( Nine : The Hidden Story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims on an alleged conspiracy to topple former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa and his Government . Would you like to comment ? <p> A : The children of most of those who hold higher Government positions either study , work or live in US and other European countries . We also have a certain doubt whether such officials were subjected to any pressure . Similarly , when those riot incidents took place in a situation where the state of emergency and curfew was imposed , we have a doubt who gave instructions not to use even minimal power to control them . We also have this doubt . That is why as I mentioned earlier , we also request to appoint a Presidential Commission with full powers to look into those incidents . <p> Q : At present , there is a split in the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna ( SLPP ) and several constituent parties have quit the Government and formed different political alliances . Will this have any adverse impact on the SLPP at future elections ? <p> A : I hold the view that we should contest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rajapaksa requested to contest together , I opposed it because we had an opportunity to win the election . I also requested to contest separately at the last Parliamentary election . If we contested separately , we could have also obtained 13 seats from the Gampaha district . However , we joined hands with several political parties and that was a decision taken by the SLPP . <p> At the last Parliamentary election , a group called ' professionals ' emerged by letting down the people who really made lots of sacrifices to form the SLPP . Today , these professionals have quit the Government . They were one of the key reasons for the destruction of our party . The names of some of those professionals are even mentioned regarding the X-Press Pearl ship disaster . <p> There was a serious issue with regard to those professionals , especially some of the wrong instructions given by them . Actually , we regret quitting Government of politicians such as Wimal Weerawansa , Udaya Gammanpila and Vasudeva Nanayakkara who were with us since inception . If they did n't go , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those who were with us since the beginning and sacrificed to build the party are still with us . Therefore , we still have a good team at the village level , who can give a good competition at a future election . 
@@98637239 <p> Respiratory physicians and asthma specialists across the world last week ( May 2 ) came together to pool their resources and knowledge to improve the quality of life of all Asthma patients , especially those in low and middle income countries who bear the main burden of this Chronic disease . <p> The Sunday Observer spoke to Assistant Editor of Sri Lanka College of Pulmonologists and Consultant Respiratory Physician , District General Hospital and District Chest Clinic , Trincomalee , Dr Upul Pathirana to give better insights into this common condition that affects both young and old alike . We also asked what advice he could offer to asthma patients on how to manage their symptoms better so that they may be able to lead normal lives . <p> Excerpts . <p> Dr. Upul Pathirana <p> Q : Although Asthma is a very common condition not many still know much about this condition . So tell us , what is Asthma ? <p> A.We have two lungs in our body , which oxygenates the blood and removes waste gas , Carbon Dioxide ( CO2 ) from the blood . To maintain the optimum level of Oxygen ( O2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of air should reach the alveoli ( Alveoli are tiny air sacs connected to the terminal part of the airways ) . The branched system of airways enables air to pass to the alveoli . The symptoms of asthma are associated with difficulty in breathing air out of the lungs due to airway narrowing , airway wall thickening and increased production of phlegm . <p> Q : Why is a special day set aside for this common health problem ? <p> A. Asthma is a serious global health problem affecting all age groups , with an estimated 262 million people in 2019 and 455 000 deaths . Over time , chronic inflammation can damage healthy cells , tissues , and organs . Yet in spite of its wide prevalence and serious outcomes if neglected , many health sectors are yet to give Asthma a high priority in their list of chronic diseases . It is to fill this gap and raise more awareness both among the public , patients , health sectors and policymakers that World Asthma Day is organised each year by the Global Initiative for Asthma , ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symptoms to look out for ? <p> A. Cardinal symptoms of asthma are the cough , wheezing , shortness of breath , and chest tightness , which occur in isolation or in combination . Isolated cough might be the only symptom in asthma , for instance : a child coughing after cycling suggests exercise induced asthma . On the other hand , asthma may present with severe devastating symptoms like extreme breathlessness . <p> Q : How do you distinguish between an ordinary cold and the onset of an asthma attack ? <p> A.The distinction of the above two common health problems is quite significant . Usually , the person who already has asthma will probably know to distinguish an asthma attack from a common cold . However , this may be difficult for those who develop an asthma attack for the first time . The common cold is an acute illness caused by viruses and it is characterised by soreness of your throat , runny nose , sneezing and cough . You may experience body pain and fever . For treating a common cold all you need is simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or acute asthma the symptoms are more aggressive like breathlessness due to wheezing and chest tightness in addition to a simple cough . The important lesson here is that one should keep in mind that viral illnesses can precipitate asthma attacks or make your asthma uncontrolled . <p> A.Air pollution can make asthma symptoms worse and trigger asthma attacks . Viral infections , allergens ( house dust mite and pollen ) , tobacco smoke , stress and exercise can also trigger or worsen asthma symptoms . In addition some medications like aspirin can also induce or trigger asthma attacks in some individuals . <p> Q : What about stress ? Many studies have shown that children and adults with asthma often develop an attack before an exam , or job interview or due to overwork . Is this correct ? <p> A.Yes . Stress is a trigger rather than a cause of asthma . If you have asthma , keep an eye on your stress levels - approximately 40% of people with asthma tell their doctors that stress triggers their symptoms . <p> Q : The theme chosen for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( GINA ) is " Asthma care for ALL " How relevant is it especially for Lankan patients ? <p> A. Availability and access to effective , quality assured asthma medications to all persons especially in low and middle income countries such as we are , is the cornerstone to battle this burden . Hence GINA encourages health care leaders to ensure the availability and access to asthma treatment for all and the " Asthma care for ALL " message promotes the development and implementation of effective asthma management programs in all resource countries . <p> Q : What are the gaps you see in meeting the target of this year 's goal challenge in Sri Lanka ? <p> A. The Sri Lankan health care system has been accomplishing a wonderful job to overcome the asthma related burden . However , there is a lot more room for improvement . It is to this end that in collaboration with the Ministry of Health , the Respiratory Physicians and Sri Lanka College of Pulmonologists have organised many awareness raising activities targeting the public and health care workers . <p> Q @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for asthma is to control and manage the symptoms . How do we do this ? <p> A. To answer the above question , we should look into what is happening inside lungs in patients with asthma . First of all we will look into the term inflammation . <p> Inflammation occurs when the body releases chemicals that trigger an immune response to fight off infection or other injurious agents . Once the injury or infection is healed , the inflammatory process ends . <p> Chronic inflammation is an abnormal immune response in which the inflammatory process does not end when it should or may begin when there is no infection or injury ( that is for harmless environmental material and it is called allergy or hypersensitivity reactions ) . Over time , chronic inflammation can damage healthy cells , tissues , and organs . <p> Q : Treatment- how do you treat asthma ? tell us the procedure . <p> A. I will put this simply to the umbrella term of asthma pathology that is inflammation . <p> We prescribe medications to overcome the inflammation . These are called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of treatment . However , medications to dilate the airways called bronchodilators ( Relievers ) are used to treat breakthrough symptoms and to manage asthma in acute situations . <p> A. There are 2 glands above both kidneys called suprarenal or adrenal glands . These glands secrete a hormone called corticosteroids , which possesses a good anti-inflammatory action . These natural hormones can be synthesised in a laboratory for treatment purposes . The biggest drawback of oral corticosteroid ( example , prednisolone ) is its adverse effects ( such as diabetes , high blood pressure , osteoporosis and infections ) with long-term use . The technology has been applied to overcome the adverse effects by converting tablets of corticosteroids into inhaled formulations . <p> Q : Does that mean inhalers are better ? <p> A.The dose is very minimal in the form of inhalers ( microgram ) in contrast to tablets ( milligram ) . <p> You should swallow the tablets and therefore , it gets absorbed into the blood resulting in more systemic side effects . <p> Inhaler devices directly deposit the medication to the target site of airways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low to moderate doses of inhalers . <p> We use a short course of pills to treat initial uncontrolled or severe symptoms followed by maintenance treatment with inhalers . <p> Your physician may add some other tablets ; these are most of the time non-corticosteroids tablets , but with weak efficacy . <p> Q : If patients , once treated , feel better with good control of symptoms , is it necessary to continue asthma medication on long term as a maintenance treatment ? <p> A. Yes . This is very important . One natural tendency of patients for some chronic disease is to discontinue medications without medical advice when they are asymptomatic . Asthma is a chronic disease , therefore the inflammation is going on despite you not feeling any symptoms until they come to a head . A new attack while not on treatment could be life threatening putting your life at risk , besides consuming a significant health care cost . The chronic inflammation is also not healthy . The end result could be permanent changes within your airways and ultimately it behaves like chronic obstructive pulmonary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partial at this stage irrespective of multiple medications in high doses . So do n't stop without consulting a physician . Once your asthma is well controlled , we will reduce the treatment to the lowest possible maintenance dose of medications . <p> Q : I understand that many people also misuse these devices , which often leads to health complications . How are they misused ? Give us some examples ? <p> A. We have two types of inhalers : preventers and relievers . Preventers help induce and maintain remission . Relievers are there to treat breakthrough symptoms . Some patients get confused with these two and administer relievers regularly without using preventers . They are the patients with poor adherence to regular maintenance therapy , who end up with asthma related complications . Medication misuse is mainly observed in oral corticosteroids and not the inhalers . <p> Q : We have seen an array of inhaler devices in the pharmacies . What are the differences and how do you choose what is best for your patient ? <p> A. We can divide all the inhaler devices into two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose inhalers ( pMDI ) . DPI contains small particles in the form of powder form , therefore ; you have to have good inhalation force to take the medication into your lungs . In comparison to DPI , pMDI has the capacity to generate the mist , therefore ; you should inspire slowly for optimum drug deposition . Those who are unable to have good coordination with inspiration , we may add a spacer device to the pMDI . The physician will choose one that will suit his individual patient after discussing the matter with the patient . <p> Q : Do you have a message to our readers who are vulnerable to asthma on managing their symptoms effectively ? <p> A. Asthma is a chronic disease , therefore ; the treatment is long term . We can achieve a state of remission of your asthma which is near- normal to cure . Inhaler devices are the development and technology , and it is a few steps beyond pills . <p> You must not be scared about inhalers and good adherence to the prescribed medication will keep you in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@98637240 <h> Youth Observer <h> A sophisticated computer program to combat antibiotic resistance <p> British scientists are developing a sophisticated computer program to help combat antibiotic resistance -- a problem estimated to be responsible for 1.2 million deaths a year worldwide . <p> Antibiotic resistance is considered one of the biggest global health threats of our age , and causes around 10,000 deaths each year in the UK alone . <p> It happens when bacterial infections build up a defence against commonly prescribed antibiotics , meaning the bug can no longer be killed off . <p> This means simple procedures such as hernia repairs and cataract operations could soon become deadly , as they often trigger infections for which there may not be an effective treatment . <p> Studies suggest the NHS treats about 150 drug-resistant bacterial infections every day .

@@98741239 <p> Economic Stability paving way for Presidential PollsPosted on May 10th , 2023 <h> Courtesy The Daily News <p> Sri Lanka 's political story has never been short of twists and turns , especially since last year when a leader elected with a resounding majority , Gotabaya Rajapaksa , resigned paving the way for a nominated Parliamentarian , Ranil Wickremesinghe , to replace him . That drama is now set to continue . <p> There was some quiet on the political front last week as the nation celebrated Vesak . These were the first fully fledged Vesak celebrations in five years . Celebrations in 2019 were dampened by the Easter attacks , in the next two years due to the pandemic and last year due to the economic crisis . <p> Another reason for the lull in political activity was the absence of President Ranil Wickremesinghe who was away in Britain , attending the coronation of King Charles the Third . Being of a similar age , both the President and the King had to wait for several decades before reaching the pinnacle of power . <p> Despite the slow pace of political activity last week , there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polls that are being considered are the Presidential Elections that have to be held by October 2024 which , as per current constitutional provisions , can not be expedited to an earlier date . <p> Setting the date for Presidential Elections and General Elections are the prerogative of the Executive President , under the terms of the Constitution . That they would do so at a time that would be to their advantage is an accepted norm . This is what President Wickremesinghe is reportedly keen to pursue . <p> Two former Presidents have exercised this privilege . In 1999 , then President Chandrika Kumaratunga called Presidential Elections a year early , contested and won . In 2010 , then President Mahinda Rajapaksa did the same . Rajapaksa tried to repeat the feat in 2015 but lost to Maithripala Sirisena . <p> Call for early elections <p> Those Presidential Polls were called early Under Article 31 of the Constitution . This allows the President to call for an early election . That too is allowed only after a four-year period of the first term of office and only if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of office . <p> However , the Constitution also decrees that these provisions apply only to an elected President . This is through a caveat to Article 31 which states that a person elected as President by Parliament to serve the remainder of the term of another , is not entitled to exercise the right to an early election . <p> President Wickremesinghe belongs to this category and constitutionally , as of now , he would not be able to call an election earlier than October 2024 , so a new President could be in office by November 2024 , when the President 's current term of office ends . This has created a constitutional conundrum . <p> The matter has been raised and discussed at the highest levels of Government . There is a school of thought that President Wickremesinghe 's popularity is on the rise and that the prospects of being elected at a Presidential Poll are best if the election is held early rather than in October 2024 . <p> This is due to several reasons . The first is the public perception of the President as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tumultuous last days of Gotabaya Rajapaksa 's Presidency . He is credited with restoring the rule of law after a few days of near anarchy last July . <p> Then , the President is also perceived as bringing some balance to the economy . The last days of Rajapaksa 's rule were identified with queues for gas and fuel and power cuts . The economy has not made a complete recovery yet but such shortages are no longer seen and there is a sense of stability . <p> There is also an acknowledgement among the masses that President Wickremesinghe stepped into the breach with no conditions attached when Rajapaksa resigned . The astute politician in him may have seen an opportunity but nevertheless , it was a gamble that other politicians feared to take at that time . <p> Amidst all these reasons why an early Presidential Poll will be best for President Wickremesinghe , is arguably another compelling factor . That is the disarray the collective Opposition and even the President 's partner in Government , the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna ( SLPP ) , finds itself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there was some tangible momentum in favour of the Opposition , most notably the main Opposition party , the Samagi Jana Balawegaya ( SJB ) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna ( JVP ) , now in its latest incarnation as the more inclusive National Peoples ' Power ( NPP ) . <p> As the date first announced for the Local Government elections , March 9 , drew near , that momentum was seized mostly by the NPP . It conducted rallies criss-crossing the country and attracted large and enthusiastic crowds . Its leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake was spoken of as presidential material . <p> The elections never eventuated . The Government has cited a lack of finances to conduct the poll . Several attempts by Opposition parties to compel the Elections Commission to hold the election through court orders have ended in a stalemate . They have now been postponed indefinitely . <p> Opposition parties have been critical of this approach by the Government and the President who are accused of stifling democracy . What the Opposition has found to their consternation is that , with the indefinite postponement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissipated and disappeared . <p> The other factor that is to President Wickremesinghe 's advantage is the absence of a leader of national stature who can mount a challenge to the President . Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is not eligible to contest . Former President Maithripala Sirisena is under a cloud due to the Easter attacks . <p> That narrows down potential serious contenders to Leader of the Opposition Sajith Premadasa and NPP Leader Dissanayake . Premadasa 's leadership credentials are being seriously questioned after he refused Gotabaya Rajapaksa 's offer of the premiership and following internal divisions in the SJB . <p> Premadasa is reportedly facing the prospect of a revolt in his own party . There are reports that a faction would soon join the President by accepting Cabinet portfolios . Even if this group does not constitute a majority of the SJB , it would significantly dent Premadasa 's image as a strong leader . <p> There have even been suggestions that , if President Wickremesinghe succeeds in wooing a sizeable number of SJB MPs to join the Government , Premadasa would have no choice but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being left with a handful of MPs who remain loyal to him . <p> The NPP has a different problem to contend with . It spent much time , resources and finances on the Local Government election campaign , hoping it can win and thereby generate the momentum that would carry it to victory at the next Presidential and General Elections . That has been all in vain now . <p> The NPP realises that it can not indefinitely sustain a campaign for an election that will not be held in the near future . It is struggling to restore public confidence in the party as economic hardships recede . As a result , Anura Kumara Dissanayake is no longer the political hero he was a few months ago . <p> support for President <p> It is no secret that some Cabinet Ministers see their political futures being better under President Wickremesinghe rather than with a SLPP candidate because the party 's popularity is not at its peak . Among them , some have openly indicated their support for the President to be a ' common ' candidate . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been silent on the issue . Among potential nominees , Basil Rajapaksa would have to renounce his United States citizenship to contest . It is doubtful whether Namal Rajapaksa wants to stake a claim when his party is not so popular . <p> For all these inducements for President Wickremesinghe to call for an early Presidential Election , he still has to overcome the constitutional hurdle cited earlier . That can only be achieved by an amendment to the Constitution for which he would require a two-thirds majority in Parliament . <p> Chances are that the President will throw down the gauntlet at the Opposition which has been stridently complaining about the postponement of Local Elections . He could present a constitutional amendment and request that they support it because it would bring early Presidential Polls , no less . <p> This political drama will resume after the President returns to the country . A first step , reports suggest is the replacement of Governors in several provinces , where provincial councils are non-functional .

This would enable Sri Lanka to hold its ground against the predatory Eurobond traders what forced last year 's first ever Sovereign Debt Default . <p> After all , it is not a secret that strategic Sri Lanka 's Default which constitutes a loss of economic sovereignty and policy autonomy is linked to Washington 's economic war on China and its Belt and Road initiative ( BRI ) , for infrastructure and global connectivity , also instumentalizing India and the Quadrilateral Group ( QUAD ) . <p> Remarkably , the Sri Lankan foreign Minister is in Stockholm which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week , as NATO increasingly seeks to move into the Indian Ocean .

@@98800238 <h> By Sena Thoradeniya <p> ( 1 ) Introduction <p> This article was first published in The Island " online edition on March 31 , 2020 during the covid pandemic under the title Dullewa Dissawa and Somana Cloth " . Since a modern myth is invented and spread by some columnists who write to English dailies in Sri Lanka that ( 1 ) the British Colonialists after suppressing the traditional elite in 1818 , have backed a secondary layer which had been subservient to the native chiefs " and ( 2 ) thatthey subverted " the policies of British State particularly in their regions , expressed their resistance to British colonialism " , repudiated colonial authority -- in other words that the Kandyan chieftains who held office under Britishers after the 1848 freedom struggle , opposed British Colonialism in a subtle way . Their main argument supporting this fallacy is pointing out that in some manorial houses floor tiles depicting the portrait of Queen Victoria were laid . If this is an expression of anti-colonialism " , resistance to colonialism " or repudiation of colonialism " the floor tile manufacturers , probably the Victorian tile manufacturers in UK were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they get an opportunity interpret the gun carrying Mara , a Degaldoruwa fresco ? How would do they interpret murals which depict devas wearing necklaces of Christian crosses , horse riding soldiers wearing British helmets and carrying the union jack and a doorway depicting British coat of arms , British crown and Queen Victoria at Ella Temple ? Do these columnists who had photo shoots with Julie Chung along with some other English scribes during the height of the Galle Face charade want to impress Julie Chung that they are anti-British myth makers ? <p> Above ( 1 ) was an Intellectual Myth " invented by the late Newton Gunasinghe ( my junior contemporary at Peradeniya having same party affiliations ) and propagated by his Sociology golayas " . Many myths were invented by them on 1818 uprising and 1848 uprising respectively dubbing the latter as a plebian uprising ; sadly casteism and parochialism ( Moratuwa ) had found a place in their interpretations . <p> The writer thought of republishing this essay to show how some native Chief Headmen acted as slaves of British Colonial Government . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his possession . Many other examples will be given in the second part of this essay to illustrate how Kandyan Chieftains in Central Province , Uva , North Western Province , Sabaragamuwa and Nuwarakalaviya acted as cronies of British colonialism seeking higher ranks and above all else land from the Britishers , some astonishing revelations for the first time ! <p> ( 2 ) Dullewa Adigar and Somana Cloth -- Full Story <p> Searching and reading our own ancient ola leaf literature and documents generated by colonial officials respectively at the Search Rooms of Colombo and Kandy National Archives is a fascinating exercise . Whilst reading some diaries of British Assistant Government Agents ( AGAs ) and Government Agents ( GAs ) of Matale District ( first , administered by an Assistant Government Agent under the Governmenrt Agent of Central Province stationed in Kandy and later by the Government Agent of Matale District ) , I chanced upon the 1891-1895 Diary of Dullewa Dissawa , a native Chief Headman in colonial era . <p> From March 1894 he signed as Dullewa Adigar , may be as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a village in Asgiri Udasiyapattuwa in Matale District . This should not be confused with some other similar village names such as Dulwala or Diwulwala . These diary entries were written in single-ruled over-sized books made of foolscap folio paper much thicker than ordinary writing paper , which were bound with hard covers , in black ink in very beautiful copybook handwriting . ( Dissawe 's were provided with a paid local clerk ) . In this particular diary there is a drastic change in handwriting from July 1894 , may be due to change of original ghostwriter . At the end of each month diaries of Chief Headmen had to be submitted to the AGA/GA for approval . AGA/GA made their comments in red ink . In the case of minor native officers ' failure to submit the diary on the due date or making incomplete or false entries were considered as serious offences subject to punishment varying from fines , interdiction or in the worst-case removal from office . <p> It is not the intention of the writer to focus on Dullewa 's ancestry . Those who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Central Province " . The said Gazetteer , The Ceylon Almanac " , Ceylon Civil List " and the book on Kandyan Office Holders compiled by Kapila Wimaladharma provide information on positions held by the members of the Dullewa family . <p> According to Dullewa 's diary he had functioned as a member of the Provincial/District Committee appointed under Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance ( making inventories of land and movable property owned by Buddhist viharas and devalayas etc. ) , and a trustee of Vidyodaya Pirivena . His diary indicates that his work associated with the Buddhist Temporalities Ordinance was not appreciated at all by the Buddhist priests . He had even instituted legal action against the Nayaka Unnanse of Dambulla temple . <p> For this article I extract certain portions from the diary of Dullewa Dissawa , to describe how he had laboured to find out a Somana cloth fancied by a member of the British Royalty . Somanaya was a woven cloth with beautiful floral designs and other motifs inherent to Kandyan art , worn by males , sometimes used for decorations as a viyan redda ( ceilingcloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2005 I have titled a book containing some of my critical essays as Cheevaraya Saha Somanaya " ( The Robe and the Somana Cloth ) . In my village there was a saying , Cheevare nam Cheevare , Somane namSomane , Cheevarei Somaneidekama behe " . This was an admonition given to young novice monks by their Guru Hamuduruwos and village elders alike . ( Choose either the Robe ( priesthood ) or the Somanaya ( lay life ) ; there can not be a compromise between the two ! ) . <p> I can not say whether any other writer had narrated this story of Dullewa 's futile search of a missing Somanaya . But , in my novel Handun MalKadulla " ( 2016 ) , a lay preacher at Dambulla narrates this story to a group of pilgrims who had come from Patha Dumbara in bullock carts in 1913 , visiting places of worship in Nuwara Kalaviya and Tamankaduwa . The preacher was protesting as he had observed the retinue of an ex- Burmese queen who were visiting Dambulla were asked to occupy some cattle shed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegram from GA Kandy requesting him to meet Governor 's Aide-de-Camp on the 21 . On the appointed day the Aide-de- Camp meets Dullewa along with Ratwatte Banda , the acting Rate Mahattaya ( RM ) of Kalagam Palatha in present day North Central Province . Dullewa was informed that His Imperial and Royal Highness , the Arch Duke of Austria was coming to Kalawewa on sport " ( read as elephant hunting ) on the 7 of January 1893 and halt " at Dambulla for breakfast . A camp " must be put up on the rock of Dambulla and the Arch Duke should be accompanied to the rock temple after breakfast . <p> As instructed Dullewa went up to the temple and selected a spot " for the camp . He remained at Dambulla with the RM and discussed the arrangements to be made at Kalawewa and the assistance required by the RM from him . RM required fruits of different varieties , juggery , dancers from Kandy and Kegalle Districts and cloths and brass lamps to decorate the bungalow . Dullewa advised the RM to take whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his charge as the trustee . On his return to Matale , Dullewa met Aluvihare , the RM of Matale and informed him to send notices to headmen to commence work related to the visit of the dignitary without any delay . <p> Next he goes to Harispattuwa to meet the RM of Harispattuwa and instructs him to send a troupe of dancers and juggery . He met the Basnayake Nilame ( BN ) of Vishnu Devalaya and requested him to send dancers from Alutnuwara in Hatara Korale . At Kaudupelella he met a well-to-do mudalali , a person from maritime provinces and asked him to send different varieties of fruit to Dambulla . In the month of January 1893 , for nearly a week he supervised the construction of the buildings which included thatching and partitioning of stables . He sent an elephant tracker at the request of RM of Kalawewa and other equipment wanted by the RM including carpets . Dancers and carts laden with all what he wanted arrived from Harispattuwa , Hathara Korale and Matale . From Beligomuwa came cart loads of different varieties of coconut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 1893 at 10.30 a.m. the Arch Duke and his party arrived at Dambulla , visited the rock temple , had breakfast at the bungalow erected on the rock and proceeded to Kalawewa . The Arch Duke stayed only for four and half hours ; but preparations for his visit took 48 days ! Dullewa waited at Dambulla for another five days until 12 and learned that the Royal entourage had gone to Kandy . <p> On the following day Dullewa received a letter from the RM of Kandy Kachcheri requesting him to send a particular cloth " used to decorate the ceiling of the camp at Dambulla as His Imperial Highness had a fancy for it . " When inquired from the people who had been with him at Dambulla , none of them were able to give the kind of information he needed . No one had paid any attention to the different kinds of cloths used to decorate the ceiling . Who does so ? Except a colonial master ! <p> From then onwards begins a hazardous journey in every Korale of Matale Maha Dissawa in search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey continued for thirteen days , traversing along dirt roads and bridal paths . He goes to Maningomuwa in Udugoda Pallesiya Pattuwa and Wehera . Learning from the Wehera Village Headman that the cloth in reference was in the ceiling of the portion of the camp built by the people of Kandepalla Korale , he made enquiries in the villages of Wahakotte , Galewela , Puwakpitiya with no avail . The distance he covered that day was 9 miles . <p> Following day at Beligomuwa , a village in the border of Central Province and North Western Province , a chief of silversmiths informed Dullewa that he saw a cloth resembling the one described in one of the ceilings but did not know who had brought it . In the evening while in conversation with the priest of the village temple Dullewa asked whether the chief of the washer men had borrowed the ceiling cloth belonging to the temple . The priest had answered that the chief of washermen obtained his permission to take the cloth to Dambulla but he did not know whether it was taken to Dambulla or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief of washer men in some other village far from there . The priest said that he can show the cloth on the following day . <p> At first , the chief of the washer men had readily consented to give the cloth to Dullewa ; later he said that he could not part with it as it is a very old cloth offered to the temple by the people of Hath Korale . Next day in that far off village Dullewa met the chief of the washer men of the village . But the latter had said that he had not seen the said cloth for the last seven years and the cloth used at Dambulla must have been one borrowed by the RM from the priest at Dambulla . Following day Dullewa went to Dambulla temple and inquired whether the priests had given a fine Somana cloth to decorate a portion of the ceiling . The answer was disappointing . The priests had lent some ordinary old cloths . <p> Thus , Dullewa 's diary entry with respect to the Somana cloth ends without giving us any clue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search the Arch Duke had taken sail from Colombo . <p> ( 3 ) Interpreting the Somana Story " <p> Dullewa Adigar had become a nuisance to his colonial masters mainly owing to his insatiable land claims . Did Dullewa behave with this type of servility to save his position and claim for more land thereafter ? An answer to this question can be found through the pages of S.M. Burrows ' official diary . <p> S.M. Burrows , Assistant Government Agent at Matale in his official diary on April 9 , 1889 , writes that he had a talk with the Government Agent , Central Province ( R.W.D. Moir ) about the position and pay of the Adigar . In 1884 it was determined to revive this high office presumably as an experiment " , with the view of inducing the present holder of it to become a sort of chief of chiefs as a model to Rate Mahattayas perhaps eventually a native AGA . He and his staff are paid over Rupees 3000 per annum as a long memorandum was drawn up for his guidance . He claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in several of these cases he was allowed his claim should fulfill certain definite conditions . He was also made a Forest Ranger . No doubt in old days the Adigar held a very important position . " <p> Having said that Burrows continues that in theory the revival of his position may have been perfect but in practice there is an important flaw . He further writes that in old times Adigar 's head was constantly at stake and was the first to be removed if anything went amiss , in modern times this useful incentive of energy was working and the present holder of the office has made the ingenious discovery that it is possible to draw a large salary and be loaded with honours without doing anything in return . " <p> We can imagine the reprimands Burrows had made to Dullewa in his one-to-one encounters having written such harsh comments in his official diary that was submitted to his superior officer , the Government Agent of Central Province . <p> Burrows sarcastically comments that the Adigar has carried out his programme with great success " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer a letter though he has a paid clerk to help him ; the office file on the subject is full of fruitless attempts to extract diaries as he eventually sent ( after two years late ) are ludicrous exhibitions of incompetence and his example is a very bad one for other Rate Mahattayas and Presidents here for they naturally say ' if he is paid so large a salary for doing nothing why should we do any work " ? ( Presidents mentioned here were Presidents of Village Tribunals ) . <p> Burrows adds that Dullewa has evaded all his duties and yet kept his pay ; he behaved most disingenuously about a large grant of land which was promised him on certain conditions carefully explained to him by me . Instead of attempting to carry them out he slipped into Kachcheri when my predecessor 's back was turned and got the Head Clerk to give him the CQPs " ( Certificates of Quite Possession ) . ( Burrows ' predecessor was H.L. Moysey ) . <p> Burrows concludes that day 's diary entry stating that the experiment " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggests three alternatives ; any one of which is better than letting things go on as they are " . ( 1 ) To abolish the pay of the post altogether and let the rank remain as honorary without duties . ( 2 ) To let the payment of the monthly salary , depend upon a monthly report from this Kachcheri as to how the duties specially assigned by the Governor to the post have been carried out . ( 3 ) To direct him to retire on a reasonable pension . <p> Burrows ' suggestions reduce the Adigar to the level of a village Vidane Arachchi ! ( An arachchi of a depressed " caste and village ) . <p> Was not Dullewa highly rewarded for his loyalty and allegiance to the Crown , for the pains he had taken in search of a somana cloth ? But the diaries of AGAs of Matale report on the contrary . In 1896 May , Burrows wrote , I am still awaiting orders as to what is to be done as regards the Adigar " . He has not done an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur Gordon during the last seven years " . Burrows proposed to remove him from the active list " . In August Burrows wrote , I do not know whether anything will be settled about the Adigar before I leave " . Burrows left Matale in the latter part of 1896 . His successor G.S . Saxton wrote in November , by the way the Adigar went on pension from first instant . I am glad to say .

@@99616234 <h> Ca n't we find a famous personality to celebrate world Yoga Day ? - EDITORIAL <p> World Yoga Day was celebrated across the world on June 21 ( Wednesday ) with Sri Lanka too having many events across the island to mark the occasion . The word yoga is synonymous with most Sri Lankans and there are so many institutes that teach this heath system apart from the many retreats that are advertised here . The big question is whether the Sri Lankan Government sees the potential to use this island and its most beautiful tourist destinations to build yoga centres and couple it with holiday packages . <p> What stands in good stead for yoga is that on World Yoga Day some Sri Lankan ministers were seen hogging the limelight after being invited for the event ; where they also had to take part in doing some asanas ( postures ) . In India , our closest neighbour , yoga is a fad and even most of the top showbiz personalities and top sportsmen and women are into it . Former Indian cricket star Sachin Tendulkar is a good example . But unfortunately in Sri Lanka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give much regard to yoga and fight shy to include it in their daily exercise routine . <p> World Yoga Day was inaugurated in the year 2015 after the United Nations ' General Assembly the previous year ratified a proposal by its member countries to have such a day for this art of wellbeing . <p> The biggest star or politician behind promoting yoga is Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi . This year he was in the United States and joined 135 different nationalities as participants took part in the ninth International Day of Yoga ; setting a Guinness World Record for most nationalities to participate in a yoga lesson . This year 's theme for the event was Yoga for ' The World is One Family ' . The good thing about Modi is that the premier is serious about his yoga and spends time in doing it as part of his lifestyle . " It is a very old tradition , but like all ancient Indian traditions , it is also living and dynamic , " Modi said adding " Yoga is truly universal . " <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasions and being a joke onto themselves because their stiff bodies do n't allow the performing of most stretching postures . If a Sri Lankan parliamentarian can do yoga using proper technique and become a good advertisement for ' World Yoga Day ' that would also underscore the fact that even at a ripe old age a person is fit to be a politician and serve the people . <p> Yoga means ' Yuj ' which translated into layman 's language is unite . Yoga teachers teach us that doing yoga helps us have a closer link with mind and body . Famous Indian yoga teacher B.K.S Iyengar once said , " Yoga cultivates the way of maintaining a balanced attitude in day-to-day life and endows skill in the performance of one 's actions " . It goes without saying that these life skills when developed would also raise the output in production and the efficiency of workers . The good thing about yoga is that unlike a heavy cardio or weight training session in the gym - after a hard day at office- doing yoga instead rejuvenates you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A good number of Sri Lankans are also into yoga and get their basic qualifications in this art of wellbeing by visiting India and getting a yoga certification by an Indian guru . Modern times have made things easier for Sri Lankans because there is the Swami Vivekananda Cultural Centre at the Indian High Commission of Sri Lanka which offers so many courses in yoga . <p> Sri Lankans have their traditional ways of retaining the goodness in food by cooking meals in special ways and maintaining health through the art called angam ( which is a fighting system which also has exercises for the body , mind and internal organs ) . But when these Sri Lankan islanders take a closer look at most good things which have produced results and worked for them over the years , they have had Indian roots or if not have come with ' the blessings of the Indian wind ' . 
@@99616235 <h> Do n't gag whistleblowers , for they are a vital part of democracy <p> Daniel Ellsberg appearing before the US Senate judiciary subcommittee in Washington , DC in 1973 . Photograph : Everett/Shutterstock <p> War is a lie . Terrorism is a lie . The state is an embodiment of lies , damn lies , and statistics . As Winston Smith , the main character in George Orwell 's mind-blowing political novel 1984 , finds out , even dissent is a lie . <p> Can governments that call themselves democratic lie to the people ? Lies and deception are the antithesis of democracy , yet they are part of government . Should conscientious officials who are privy to the lies uttered by governments remain silent if the lies result in devastating consequences ? This question has given birth to whistleblowers . Democracy lovers call them heroes ; governments call them traitors . <p> One such hero was Daniel Ellsberg , one of the world 's famous whistleblowers . He died last Friday at the age of 92 . He became famous after he leaked the Pentagon Papers , which exposed the US government 's lies about the Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Gulf of Tonkin incident , which the US administration under President Lyndon B Johnson used as an excuse to enter the Vietnam War . The US had claimed that two US Navy destroyers were attacked by North Vietnamese forces in the Gulf of Tonkin . The 1964 incident was fake news created by the US . <p> After Ellsberg , who worked as a military analyst on national security issues for the Pentagon and the think tank RAND Corporation , exposed the US lies in 1971 , the then National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger called him " the most dangerous man in America who must be stopped at all costs " . He was privy to the military documents that told a story different from the sugar-coated stories the US government regularly put out to keep in check the growing public disenchantment with the war . <p> With the leaked documents making headlines in the New York Times and other newspapers , a legal battle began in the US Supreme Court over freedom of speech and national security . In what was seen as a victory for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the media had the right to publish the materials leaked by Ellsberg . But the witch hunt continued . In 1973 , the US government filed charges against him , accusing him of theft and conspiracy . The charges carried a prison term of 115 years . The case was dismissed after the defence proved the prosecution 's illegal evidence gathering . <p> After the legal battles were over , Ellsberg became an anti-war activist and remained so till his death , exposing the US government 's lies that had led to the deaths of millions of people , including children and non-combatants , in Vietnam , Afghanistan , Iraq , and other places . <p> Ellsberg is no more , but his legacy lives on . Whistleblowing did not start with Ellsberg . It had a long history . In the United States , the process began in the early years of independence , with ten American sailors petitioning the Continental Congress in 1777 seeking protection from punishment for revealing that a US navy commodore was torturing captive British soldiers . It is heartening to note that in Sri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the protection of whistleblowers , who should be seen as an unseen institution preserving the health of the state and the welfare of the people . <p> Over time , government lies have become more sophisticated , as has been seen in George W. Bush 's weapons of mass destruction claim , which he trotted out to invade Iraq . In a war situation , the side that controls the media gets away with lying . This is evident in Israel 's oppression of the people in occupied Palestine , with the victims -- the Palestinians -- being portrayed as aggressors in most Western media . It is also evident in Ukraine , with almost all Western media outlets blacking out Russia 's version of the war story to authenticate the war propaganda . <p> When governments continue with their lies to wage wars and indulge in corruption , whistleblowers are the only hope we , the people , have to be assured that the government we elect is true to the sacred compact called the social contract . Today , the transparency required of the government is highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a way as to shield their crimes . As a result , we are betrayed by the very people we elect to govern us . <p> Even corruption is covered up on grounds of national security , as was evident in the infamous Yamama arms deal involving the payment of a billion-dollar bribe by British Aerospace ( BAE Systems ) to a Saudi Arabian prince . Citing national security concerns , the then British Prime Minister Tony Blair in the 1990s stopped investigations by Britain 's anti-corruption authorities into the 43 billion sterling pound deal . <p> True , national security concerns require that certain state affairs be kept secret . That is why many democratic states have state secret laws . According to these laws , classified documents are only made public after a certain period of time , usually 20 years . But with the people having little or no means to ascertain whether secrecy or classification is justified in the name of national security , politicians in power tend to abuse secrecy laws . <p> Today , no state can claim to be a true democracy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freest nations hide many things from their people , who are supposed to be the depository of sovereignty according to their constitutions . Usually , national security is their excuse to justify their democracy-killing crime of gagging the whistleblowers . As a result , from a high-security prison in Britain , Julian Assange , the co-founder of the whistleblower website , WikiLeaks , is fighting a battle to save himself from a life sentence in the United States , which sees him as a threat to its national security . <p> Although it is more or less dormant today , WikiLeaks in its heyday exposed what the US should not have done as a democratic state . The website exposed the US military 's excesses in Iraq and Afghanistan . It has released a video that showed a US Apache helicopter firing on and killing several people in Baghdad , including two Reuter journalists . It released some 9000 secret files , which provided evidence that in Afghanistan more civilians have died in US military operations than officially acknowledged . Documents published by WikiLeaks revealed that Guantanamo detainees were subjected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not for WikiLeaks , the world would not have known that the US , which preaches good behaviour to other states , is itself a rogue state . Although whistleblowers are considered a threat to national security , they uphold democracy by exposing the secretive nature of the state . In fact , by exposing lies , they promote the truth in an exercise that will help hold governments accountable and ensure that politicians in power are acting in the best interests of their citizens . The people should not accept whatever the government says without questioning it .

Police media spokesperson SSP Nihal Thalduwa opined that most shooting incidents are acts of revenge . " Many of these people are involved in drugs and organized crimes but a handful cases are personal issues between families . Most of these incidents happen in rural areas .

" There were two guys at the Mulleriyawa Police ; one of them had 28 cases filed against him and the other person had eight cases .

Recently they handed over an indictment for an offense that was committed in 2004 . So what is the message that you give to the society ? " Arsecularatne questioned . <p> Legal experts also opine that several policy level changes including a law to apprehend perpetrators of organized crimes need to be introduced to curb this menace . On the other hand , effective handling of a case and an effective supervision is required to bring perpetrators before the law .

Environmentalists , media , Buddhist monks and opposition politicians surrounded it opposing its removal . GR had to divert the expressway incurring heavy expenses . In hindsight we conclude that this was a part of the grand conspiracy hatched by interested parties against GR . Nobody understood the warning signals . <p> Sudden disappearance of it in the first week of July 2023 , gave a stern warning to environmentalists and those who opposed not only the removal of it but also RW 's moves .

@@100343233 <h> KAMALIKA PIERIS <p> The Tamil Separatist Movement complained loudly that Buddhist temples were being built in the north where there were no Buddhists . They are built on state land and in many instances by the army . <p> In 2011 TNA politicians from Mullaitivu protested against the construction of a Buddhist temple at Bogaswewa near the Sapumalgaskada archaeological site . They claimed that the area traditionally belongs to the Tamil people . TNA 's T. Raviharan said that the area belongs to Tamil people traditionally and it was known as Kachchcalsamalankulam . Tamil people have been given paddy fields and they are cultivating them with water from the Kachchalsamalankulam tank . It is wrong for Buddhist monks to come there to construct a temple in an area which is predominantly Tamil , said Raviharan . <p> The chief monk had secured the help of the army to make bricks using clay from the shrubs in the jungle , continued Raviharan . Trees were being felled in nearby jungle to fire the bricks . However , a spokesman for the temple said that Sapumalgaskada area had been identified as a site of archaeological importance and there were ruins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old and it was wrong to claim it was not a Buddhist site . The bhikkhus had only revived a temple close to the archaeological site , he said . <p> In 2015 there was objection to the building of Sambodhi Vihara in Kokilai , Mullaitivu . . Tamilnet said that Ven.Tissapura Gunaratana had in 2012 got a surveyor from Maharagama to survey three acres , with the ' approval ' of the Divisional Secretary C Dayananda , and started to construct a temple , with the help of the army . <p> However , the property was private land owned by local Tamils , said Tamilnet and the project has displaced at least five families . ( Tamilnet is not sure how many ) . The owners demonstrated , in June 2015 , demanding back their lands . Land Registry officials inspected their land deeds and instructed the Divisional Secretary to issue an interim ban on the construction activities of the vihara . Mullaitivu District Secretariat issued an interim order not to proceed with the construction of the ' Sri Sambodhi Vihara ' until the dispute is solved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land dispute , added Tamilnet . <p> The interim order was ignored . Tissapura thero said that TNA Provincial Councilor Raviharan had threatened him , stop developing the temple and vacate the area . The monk is adamant that he will build the temple here in our land . He has offered money to buy the premises but the owners do not want to sell , reported the media . <p> Ven . Tissapura had other plans for Sambodhi . A tube well was dug at Sambodhi premises and the public come there for fresh water . A pinthaliya was provided for them . Tamilnet says that this pinthaliya was thereafter transformed into a memorial site for two Sinhala soldiers who had died in the Eelam war . <p> The vihara premises will contain a Buddha statue , dharmasala , poya Ge , a two-storied Sangharamaya , a lotus pond and a 10 meter high stupa . A welfare area ' , is also planned with a multi-purpose building , a vocational training centre and a 100 perch model farm to introduce agriculture to fisheries-dependent settlers . <p> The five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library and other facilities . The vocational training centre is to cater the adult women and men . It will be housing a sewing centre for the settling women , a yoghurt production unit , Diveneguma-assisted carpentry and welding workshop and a fertilizer manufacturing plant . The monk is planning to convert the Sinhala Catholics into Buddhism and raise a new generation of the Sinhala occupiers of the north , warned Tamilnet . <p> Another version of the Sambodhi story by Adaalayam Centre for Policy Research in Jaffna , said that a temple is being illegally constructed on land that is partially owned by a Tamil living in the Kokilai region of Mullaitivu District.Security forces arrested this Tamil landowner in 2015 for protesting against the military land grab . <p> Tamilnet complained that Ven . Tissapura was also building another Buddhist temple nearby . Land belonging to the post office , the base hospital , a Hindu temple and a public road have been taken for that temple , said Tamilnet . <p> In 2018 there were 131 sites of Buddhist religious worship in the North , of which 67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viharas are also coming up are Omanthai , Semmadu , Kanakarayankulam , Kilinochchi , Mankulam , Paranthan and Pooneryn .

They must be removed immediately , said MP Raviharan . <p> In some areas , such as Vavuniya , Kilinochchi , and Point Pedro , the military has built Buddha statues within or in close proximity to Hindu temples . Buddha statues have come up in front of the 2500 year old Thirukoneswara Hindu temple in Trincomalee and the Thiruketheeswaram temple . A 67 foot Buddha statue is coming up in front of the Nainai Nagabhooshani Amman Hindu temple , complained Tamil Separatist Movement . <p> The military 's construction of Buddhist viharas in traditionally Tamil areas with no Buddhist population is a preliminary step to the Sinhala-Buddhist colonization of these areas and a re-assertion of Sinhala Buddhist dominance , said Adaalayam Centre for Policy Research , Jaffna . <p> Sinhala colonies , Buddhist temples and Buddha statues are being aggressively constructed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North eastern Tamil homeland , said Tamil Peoples Council . <p> Ever since the end of the war , consecutive governments have accelerated the Sinhalization " of the north and east said Gajan Ponnambalam . <p> Buddha viharas are sprouting like mushrooms in areas where there are no Buddhists said C.V.Wigneswaran . Wigneswaran issued a statement saying stop erecting Buddha statues and Buddhist temples illegally on private lands and in places where there are no Buddhists . <p> Why build a Buddhist vihara where no Buddhists live ? " asked MP Nirmalanathan.Hindus form the largest religious group , followed by Christians and Muslims , with Buddhists in the fourth place . <p> The Tamil political parties have been complaining about the Archaeological Department , Mahaweli Authority , Forest Department , Wildlife Department , Tourist Board and the Defence/Internal Security Ministry dabbling in ethno-territorial politics and impacting the livelihood of Tamil and Muslim people in the northern and eastern provinces , said Kumar David . <p> It is alleged that the Department of Archaeology has been declaring vast extents of land surrounding Buddhist Temples in Mullaitivu and Trincomalee as heritage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these lands . <p> The Tamil Separatist Movement said it had strongly opposed the construction of Buddhist structures in areas with no Buddhists . These protests increased during the time of the Yahapalana government of 2016 . In 2016 , after the Yahapalana government came to power , there were numerous demands for the removal of Buddhist temples , statues , and shrines built in the Northern Province , reported the media . <p> The Tamil Peoples ' Council invited people to join a mass protest in Jaffna on September 24 , 2016 to demand a stop to the construction of Buddha statues and Buddhist temples in areas in the Northern Province where there are no Buddhists . In August 2016 TNA MPs met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe and raised concerns about Buddhist temples and statues being built in the area . <p> The Northern Provincial Council passed a resolution in 2016 prohibiting the construction of Buddhist temples in the north .

@@100343234 <h> KAMALIKA PIERIS <p> The Tamil Separatist Movement has tried to dislodge Sinhala settlements and the accompanying Buddhist temples introduced to the north after the war . In 2009 57 Buddhist families were brought in and settled in Navatkuli . Navatkuli is located 6 km from Jaffna . They were Sinhala families that had been driven out of Jaffna in 1984 and 1990 . <p> There was a fairly large Sinhalese community in Jaffna at the time . The Jaffna Sinhala Vidyalaya had 250 students . Life was pleasant with the Tamils and Sinhalese getting along like one family . Our family had roots in Maniyamthottam and Kankesanthurai and I knew Jaffna district like the back of my hand , " said one returnee , Malkanthi . Eight generations of her family had lived in Jaffna . <p> We are now granted this land and 57 families received around 20 perches each , " said Malkanthi . We came here in 2010 . We gathered all Sinhalese who once lived in Jaffna and those who wanted to live here once again by placing a newspaper advertisement . For three months we stayed at the Jaffna railway station . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a hundred people with me . I lived in a hut for almost a year . Thereafter we received a donation from a Sinhala philanthropist . Later , with the support of the Buddhist priest , who also took up residence here , we started to construct our houses . We live here now without any problem . I have got a 15-perch plot for my son and I am now in the process of applying for assistance to construct a toilet , " says Malkanthi . Sharma , her sister-in-law , who had come for a visit from Anuradhapura , agrees and says she , too , wants to apply for land in Jaffna . <p> But the Tamil public turned against this community . Demonstrations were organized against the settlers , led by Tamil politicians S.Sritharan and Suresh Premachandran , who said this was government-sponsored Sinhala colonization . Navatkuliya Sri Samiddhi Sumana Viharaya was constructed in 2013 . It was promptly bombed . <p> In 2017 the residents wanted to start work on a new stupa.The Chavakachcheri Pradeshiya Sabha refused permission . The Chavakachcheri Pradeshiya Sabha filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was taken up for hearing at the Chavakachcheri Magistrate 's Court . Chavakachcheri Magistrate S. Chandrasekeran ordered the Chavakachcheri Pradeshiya Sabha to permit the construction of the temple 's stupa without any hindrance . Her verdict was publicly applauded by the Sangha . The Magistrate has said that she respects Buddhism even though she is a Hindu devotee , reported Ven . Sooriyawewa Sumedha . <p> We next turn to Gurukanda Raja Maha Viharaya , located in the village of Chemmalai , Mullativu near the Nayaru lagoon . Archaeological Department had found ruins of a monastery . They found remains of a stupa , bricks , roof tiles and pot shards . They dated the temple to Anuradhapura period . <p> Gurukanda had been vandalized . . A new road had been constructed through the middle of the monastery grounds . One stupa had been deliberately bulldozed . It had a diameter of 10 meters and bricks of varying size . However , a new Buddhist temple has been built on the site on top of an ancient stupa . <p> On 14 January 2019 a group of a group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gurukanda Raja Maha Viharaya , claiming that the temple had been built on a land belonging to Hindu devotees . They shouted abuse at the Chief monk Ven . Mihindupura Ratanadevakitti . <p> They demanded the deeds of the temple . The Buddhists could complain to any one they liked but they would not allow the Gurukanda temple to function , they said . They began digging to construct a Hindu temple inside the temple premises.The mob threatened to cause bodily harm to Ven . Ratanadevakitti . If the chief priest disturbed the day to day affairs of the kovil , he would be killed , together with all present there . <p> The mob was so strong that the police found it extremely difficult to bring the situation under control . The intruders attempted to snatch the mobile phones of those who were videoing the scene . <p> The police filed action against both parties for disturbing peace . The police had informed the magistrate that a group had forcibly entered the temple on 14 January 2019 &amp; attempted to lay a foundation stone to construct a kovil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ construction work on Gurukanda vihara to be temporarily stopped . Mullaitivu police were deployed round the premises.The Mullaitivu police dismantled the CCTV cameras installed at the Viharaya . the CCTV system had been installed by a private company as a security measure since the Chief monk did not live in the temple . <p> Director General of Archeology , A B Mandawela summoned before the Magistrate , told court that Gurukanda Raja Maha Viharaya had a history of over 2,000 years with many Buddhist artifacts and an ancient monastery . It definitely was a Buddhist temple . The land on either side of the Kokilai-Mullaitivu road are Buddhist sacred archaeological sites including the Gurukanda Raja Maha Viharaya .. The Commissioner of Archaeology explicitly told the Magistrate it was against the law to build a Hindu place of worship in a place where there was an ancient Buddhist temple . <p> Suren Raghavan had this to say . The boundary of the temple was under dispute . Though the Gazette notification of 2016 said the temple was an archaeological site , the boundary was not mentioned . A problem arose when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the measuring was going on , ' both parties had a debate regarding their historical heritages . " There was an army camp there during the war . They had a set of buildings which they had handed over to the chief priest , added Raghavan . <p> Gurukande Viharaya had been forcibly constructed between 2004 and 2009 when no civilian was permitted to visit the area , said TNA MP Sampanthan in Parliament . More recently an attempt was made to restore that temple . This led to unrest in that area between the people who are all non-Buddhists and the monks who had come there . Upon this matter being reported to the relevant Magistrate , an order was made prohibiting the reconstruction of the temple . Ven . Ratanadevakitti has filed an application in the Provincial High Court in Vavuniya , Sampanthan said . <p> Buddhist monks headed by Ven.Ahungalle Jinananda are proceeding to file criminal charges against TNA 's Raviharan &amp; others too under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( ICCPR ) said Shenali Waduge . <p> The modus operandi of the Tamil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now clear . Place a rival kovil beside any Buddhist temple , ancient or new , which is under expansion in the north . Then rapidly expand the Kovil so that the Buddhist structures get dwarfed . These kovils will be quickly accepted by Buddhists . They will visit these new kovils very readily and emerge happily with ash on their foreheads .

@@100343235 <h> KAMALIKA PIERIS <p> The opposition to Buddhist temples has extended also to cremation of chief priests on the temple premises in the north . Two such protests are on record . <p> The first was in 2017 . In 2017 , a group of 12 Jaffna-based lawyers had gone to courts to prevent the last rites of the late chief incumbent of the Naga Vihara , Ven . Meegahajandure Gnanaratana , being performed at the Jaffna Fort Sports Ground . The restraining order had been sought on two grounds . Permission had not been obtained from Jaffna Municipal Council and secondly , the cremation of bodies could damage the environment . Jaffna Magistrate Katheeswaran did not agree . He refused to issue a restraining order . Last rites were conducted with the participation of the armed forces and the police . <p> Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan strongly condemned the bid to prevent the last rites of the late chief incumbent of the Jaffna Sri Naga Vihara , Ven . Meegahajandure Gnanaratana being performed at the Jaffna Fort Sports Ground.Such a move can not be justified under any circumstances , Minister Swaminathan said , adding that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had averted a major crisis quite rightly turning down a group of lawyers ' plea to prohibit the conducting of the late monk 's last rites at the Jaffna Fort Sports Ground . <p> The second protest was at Gurukanda Raja Maha Vihara in September 2019 . The chief priest of Gurukanda , Ven . Colomba Medhalankara , passed away in Colombo . Neeraavi Pillaiyar Temple promptly filed a police complaint that that if the body of the priest is brought to the Gurukanda temple , while a court case is going on , there will be trouble . <p> Mullaitivu Police informed Magistrate 's Court . The magistrate ordered that the body of the deceased priest should not be cremated or buried in Gurukanda temple , until a final order was granted in the court matter . <p> Court was informed that the Buddhist temple was willing to conduct the cremation ceremony at another location and that the Hindu temple was agreeable to this . Court then ordered that the cremation be conducted at the second location . Maritimepattu Predeshiya Sabha intervened to say that arrangements were made for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Cemeteries and Burial grounds Ordinance . <p> However , a group of monks led by Ven . Galagodatte Gnanasara of Colombo took the body of the deceased chief priest to the Gurukanda temple premises and cremated the body there . The cremation was attended by several monks and took place amidst sadukara from a large crowd . <p> An equally large or possibly larger crowd were there to oppose the cremation , observed the media . Television cameras showed heated arguments . Police were there.A clash occurred and the priest of the Hindu temple was severely injured . A lawyer appearing for the Hindu Temple was assaulted . <p> Several monks spoke to Derana television after the cremation . It is a Buddhist tradition to cremate a monk in the temple premises . If Gnanasara did not go this cremation would not have taken place , they said . <p> Regarding the ownership dispute , the monks told Derana , that Gurukanda is on protected territory . Three acres at Gurukanda belong to the Archaeological Department . Court should be told this . Ven . Polonnaruwe Thilnakara said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind this the monks said . They scolded Yahapalana as well . We sacrificed ourselves to establish these temples . We went into jungles . It is we who looked after Buddhism in the north , the monks told Derana , with emotion . <p> After the cremation Former Northern Province Chief Minister C.V . Wigneswaran , led a protest opposite the Mullaitivu Divisional Secretariat against the cremation in the temple premises while a court decision was pending . Several politicians , both national and localas well as lawyers , civil society activists and the public in Mullaitivu joined the protest . Some , including lawyers , wore black arm bands . <p> The protestors demanded legal action against the cremation . It was violation of a court ruling . Violating a court ruling constitutes Contempt of Court . They demanded the immediate arrest of Galagodaatte Gnanasara and others responsible for cremation . They were extremely critical of Gnanasara thera 's involvement in the matter , and wanted to know whether the country has a separate law for Buddhist monks .

They also protested opposite the Mullaitivu Magistrate 's court . <p> All the lawyers of Northern and Eastern provinces led by Batticaloa Bar Association President K.Narayanapillai boycotted court duties in a black arm band protest outside the Batticaloa court premises . The Mullaitivu Trade Association closed shops and carried out a hartal in support of the demonstration . <p> TNA 's R.

At no time since the breakout of the ethnic conflict in the early 1980s have Colombo and New Delhi been near enough like this to lend the belief that the geopolitics of the region have changed somewhat , for it does seem Sri Lanka has had to disengage itself from the Chinese embrace lately . <p> Having suffered at the hands of the debt trap diplomacy of China and in the aftermath of the serious economic strife that gripped the island last year when the Rajapaksas were forced to unceremoniously exit from power , Sri Lanka may now be looking at a settled future thanks to having learnt some home truths about the cost of friendship with China . <p> In recognising India 's $4bn helping hand as well as that of the IMF through its $2.9bn rescue package , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sri Lanka is indeed looking to reset ties that might help it settle down to an existence nearer normal as India 's closest southern neighbour . <p> The visit of President Ranil Wickremasinghe last week to New Delhi was not of the customary meet-and-greet variety . It also coincided with the Tamils ' celebration of the bicentenary of their arrival on the island . The land bridge he has proposed may take a long time to materialise , but the very fact that it is being sought now carries a clear message . <p> A ferry between Nagapattinam , replacing Dhanuskodi that used to be the hub for transfer to the island but was lost to nature 's fury in the 1960s , and Kankesanthurai in Sri Lanka will only be a revival of an old service , and yet an important link in these changing times of Sri Lanka trying to reverse on the big swing to China courtesy Mahinda Rajapaksa . The four pacts that the countries signed last week are also an indicator of a different kind of future in dealing with an equitable partner in promoting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The shift in Sri Lanka 's outlook may represent the new normal as the pro-India , pro-West President Ranil is in office . But what New Delhi may find difficult to understand is the reluctance of the island to grant rights under the long-proposed 13th Amendment to their constitution that in theory should give the Tamils of the north and east a more equitable access to the development that has taken place in the southern parts . <p> Ranil Wickremasinghe himself may be at a loss here as he would be subject to the winds of majoritarian politics that may not permit the granting of full privileges to the Tamils who have long felt the big north-south divide . There has been little progress in attempts to address the Sri Lankan national question , which Wickremasinghe had hoped to before the nation marked 75 years of independence from the British last February . Devolution of power and the Tamils ' right to local self-determination remain unaddressed . <p> The New Delhi view on Tamil Nadu fishermen being harassed by the Sri Lankan Navy must necessarily be different from how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recurring problem of fishing outside India 's territorial waters and it may fester . But the overall Sri Lankan tilt towards India is to be welcomed in view of the island 's strategic location on the maritime routes to the Indo-Pacific . The new era is much more promising from India 's point of view . <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

When the UNP suffered a humiliating defeat in 1956 , J.R . lost his seat but remained unshaken . <p> JR is still well-known globally for his speech at the San Francisco Peace Conference in 1951 , ( he was Finance Minister at the time ) where he quoted the Buddha -- " hatred does not cease by hatred , but by love alone " . It was only after this speech that the Allies decided to forgive Japan , where JR is revered to this day . <p> Decisive victory <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was less interested in taking up party responsibilities . Amidst all those chaos JR lifted up the UNP from its slumber to a decisive victory in 1960 . But the success was short-lived as the UNP lost to the Sri Lanka Freedom Party ( SLFP ) in the Parliamentary Election held in July 1960 and the UNP had to wait another five years to return to power . <p> Besides his political acumen , JR was a renaissance man , who admired art , culture and other aesthetics and he often assimilated them to the political theatre . For instance , the eulogy he delivered at the funeral of former Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake in 1973 was an emulation of Horatio 's speech in Shakespeare 's Hamlet with a Sri Lankan taste . When J.R said adieu to Dudley by saying " Good night , sweet prince , and flight of angels sing thee to thy rest " , the thousands of funeral gatherers began to weep . Yet his greatest moment was yet to come . <p> It was in 1977 that he reached the climax of his political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Sirimavo Bandaranaike , which marked the literal end of many Leftist politicians in the country . His destiny was a slow one , which expected him to stay patient , but its eventual reward was magnanimous as it brought him to the top of the power . <p> JR changed the Constitution , transformed Sri Lanka 's economy to a market economy and none of those changes stemmed from his political motives . Indeed , they were akin to his long-term expectations whereby he yearned to see Sri Lanka as a State prepared for the challenges of the 21st century . In an era when Internet and IT were unheard of , he wrote " a society based on technology and information awaits us in the future and we must accelerate ourselves to welcome it " . <p> Perhaps JR was the most well-informed President in Sri Lanka . He was a seeker of knowledge and was humble enough to gain it from those who were younger than him . On one occasion , JR read young Rohan Gunaratna 's " Sino-Lankan Connection " before he met Chinese President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gunaratna and appointed him as his Research Assistant . Today , a world-renowned authority on counter-terrorism and strategic issues , Prof. Gunaratna recalls how President Jayewardene allowed him to use his library at Braemar , where Gunaratna was first exposed to the literature on terrorism , which inspired him to study further in the field of counter-terrorism . <p> According to Prof. Gunaratna , more than any Sri Lankan leader , J.R . was well connected to powerful international personalities from political leaders to Army Generals . When the country was in tatters after the JVP 's second insurrection ( 1988-89 ) , he was advised by one of his friends , Major General Richard Clutterbuck , Director Operations , Malaya to focus on eliminating the top leaders of the insurrection and it was after JR retired from politics that this advice was taken seriously . <p> Indelible impact <p> Undoubtedly , Jayewardene made an indelible impact on modern Sri Lanka and that impact would last for generations .

In the early morning sunlight we visited Gadaladeniya and Lanklatilaka and it was late morning when we arrived at the Embekke Devale . <p> Travelling towards Embekke , which is another two kilometres along the same road that winds through lush green fertile paddy fields and the typical rustic Embekke village , we caught a glimpse of an impressive landscape of rural Kandyan setting . <p> Since public transport is not available on the road that we travelled , from Lankatilaka to Embekke , we offered a lift to a boy we saw walking , to attend his tuition class in a nearby place . A villager told us that over 100 families , many of them Muslims , lived in Embekke , most depending on agriculture ( rice , coffee , pepper ) for their livelihood . <p> At the end of a street , in the warm morning sun , we saw the outline of a porch , like a large wooden gate amid a thick flank of evergreen . Its high-pitched flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the entrance to one of Sri Lanka 's finest examples of medieval wooden architecture , the Embekke Devale . <p> We removed our shoes and put them beside the entrance and then climbed , curiously , up the few steps into the porch .

It was carved from a single piece of wood and the cell was kept closed all the time . The second is the Budu Ge ( Image house ) containing a seated Buddha statue with murals , belonging to the Kandyan period . <p> According to the description on the notice-board of the Archaeology Department at the site , it was a Devale of Embekke , dedicated to the worship of Mahasen , popularly known as Kataragama Deviyo . A local deity , Devata Bandara is also worshipped at the site . The shrine consists of three sections , the Garbha ( sanctum ) , Digge ( dancing hall ) and the Hevisimandapaya ( drummers ' hall ) . It is the drummers ' hall that has drawn the attention of visitors to the site , bearing splendid carvings on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to have been built by King Vikramabahu III ( 1357-1374 AD ) of Gampola . It is said that some of the woodwork utilised for the drummers ' hall came from an abandoned Royal Audience hall at Gampola . There is every possibility that the hall had been repaired during the reigns of the Sinhala kings of Kandy . <p> Legend <p> An interesting legend has interwoven with the building of the Embekke Devale . According to this , a Panikkaya named Ragama had been suffering from a skin disease and after making a vow to the Kataragama Deviyo , he had been cured . Ever since he was cured , he travelled to Kataragama annually . However , when he reached old age and on his last visit to Kataragama , he was concerned that he would not be able to travel to Kataragama anymore .

Queen Henakanda Biso Bandara , a consort of King Wickramabahu III also gifted her valuable jewels to the shrine . <p> In the Digge ( dancing hall ) are the sculptured panels of wood which have won fame for Embekke . The skill of the 14th century wood carvers gave life to the scenes they portray with elaborate wood carvings on the many pillars and the roof , apart from the various carvings of swans , a soldier on horse- back , a mermaid , wrestlers , a lion , a dancing girl and mythical creatures , which are considered to be among the finest woodcarvings in the world . <p> Wood carving <p> Having strolled with the pilgrims in the Digge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

We are told that this is called Madol Kurupava , a kind of giant catch-pin , the likes of which we do not have elsewhere in the country . <p> On the corner of the left side of the Embekke Devale is a peculiar structure erected on several monolithic rock slabs with twin rooms with white washed walls , having neither doors nor windows , that are sheltered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be surprised at this odd-looking building .

The Vee-Atuwa of the Embekke Devale is considered one of the most unique architectural features of Sri Lanka . <p> Adjoining the Vee- Atuwa is another small building , used as a kitchen of the Devale .

@@101845236 <h> Time to settle debate on private universities <p> The debate on the establishment of private universities in Sri Lanka has gained traction in recent times , mainly as a result of the exodus of students for foreign universities and colleges . It is no secret that the recent economic crisis has acted as a catalyst in this regard , with some parents fearing for their children 's future if they remain here . <p> Parents are known to go to extreme lengths to fund their children going abroad for studies , from pawning their jewellery to selling the very house they live in . A university course in a Western country could cost as much as Rs.10 million a year , excluding lodging . The costs may be somewhat less in a country such as Belarus , but not by much . Unless a student gets a full scholarship , parents have to spend this much on lecture fees alone . Either way , lodging , food and travel expenses pile up and have to be borne by the student . Of course , these funds have to be remitted in US Dollars or equivalent convertible currency to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves . <p> But if students go through the Education sections of this or any other Sunday newspaper , they will realise that there are plenty of Government and private educational institutions that can offer similar globally recognised courses and degrees at a fraction of the cost . Students sometimes get the option of completing the course in another country . Since gaining Permanent Residency in a country such as Canada , Australia and New Zealand seems to be the goal of most students , these Sri Lanka-based courses can also help qualify for overseas jobs and residency . <p> Saving foreign exchange is often cited as the cause c ? l ? bre of establishing more private universities and indeed it is . Just imagine the savings even if the country saves just US$ 1,000 per year per student , as thousands of Sri Lankan students already study in foreign universities , with more leaving every day . Even more than the financial aspect , local private universities will give the students the option of studying the desired subjects with the advantage of living with their families and acquaintances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only expensive but also carries an element of risk , at a time when racially motivated hate crime is rising in certain developed countries . <p> Multiple benefits <p> Quite apart from saving foreign exchange , private universities can actually help earn foreign exchange by enrolling foreign students . If Sri Lanka has world class private universities , just like Malaysia , Belarus and Australia has , students will be attracted to them especially from Africa and Asia , as food and lodging cost much less here . <p> Moreover , private universities are necessarily job-oriented , unlike some State universities which offer courses that have no relevance in the modern world . It is very difficult to get a job by following these courses -- indeed , Sri Lanka is perhaps the only country in the world to have a so-called Unemployed Graduates Association . Private universities will also address the problem of students ' English knowledge . In most State universities , English is derided as the " Kaduwa " ( English ) . Once these graduates pass out , they have a hard time getting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Even with these caveats , gaining admission to a State University in Sri Lanka is not easy by any means . The Advanced Level examination is very competitive and out of about 100,000 who qualify for university admission , only around 30,000 actually enter the universities every year . It is thus a rare privilege . There should be more educational opportunities for the rest . This is another reason why we need private universities . <p> While private universities and educational institutions offering various courses have gained ground in Sri Lanka without much resistance , there is still a debate over the establishment of private medical universities . The first attempt in this direction was the North Colombo Medical College ( NCMC ) in Ragama , which was taken over by the Government and attached to the Kelaniya University after protests by the Government Medical Officers Association ( GMOA ) and State medical students . The second was SAITM ( South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine ) established by Dr , Neville Fernando along with a state-of-the-art teaching hospital in Malabe . <p> A prudent move <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain political parties and medical students opposed it . However , with the flight of doctors in search of greener pastures and the limited intake of students to State medical colleges , the Government has now decided to establish at least three private medical colleges and several other private universities . The usual suspects are opposing this move again -- but this time , the Government must be firm in its stance , without giving into their demands . <p> This must be established through an Act of Parliament , covered by a National Policy on Education that essentially allows and recognises private universities including private medical colleges . In fact , this is what several of our neighbouring countries have done . <p> For example , in Bangladesh , its Parliament passed the Private University Act of 1992 . Now , there are nearly 100 approved private universities in Bangladesh . In India and Nepal too , legal protection is provided to private universities . <p> In any case , the private universities too should come under the purview of the University Grants Commission ( UGC ) , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for example , someone who has failed all three subjects in the AL should not be able to get into a private university ) and teaching procedures . They can not be treated as ' companies ' as they provide an essential service . This is indeed the case in Bangladesh and India , where the respective UGCs hold sway over all educational institutions . In Pakistan , which has nearly 60 private universities , this role is played by the Higher Education Commission ( HEC ) . <p> In-demand study courses <p> Private university education is important because they offer time-demanded study courses for aspiring students . They are far ahead of the State universities in terms of using modern technology in education . Their curricula are updated using modern Western methods and are revised regularly and promptly , while public universities often lag behind in this respect . Private universities give students the skills required by the job markets which sharpens their fighting edge in the employment market . <p> The main reason for some student organisations ' agitation against the opening of private investments in university education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present free education system in Sri Lanka . <p> If you look at other countries , this line of thinking is completely wrong . State and private universities complement each other . The competition will be among private universities themselves for the rankings and prestige . The final beneficiaries would be the students . Moreover , State universities will also strive to improve their World University Rankings . <p> Most private universities have student assistance schemes to provide financial assistance to eligible students who are experiencing financial hardships which adversely affect their education . They also have in-house counsellers for students who have personal problems . This could be essential for State universities too , which have recorded a number of student suicides recently . Also , private universities will be devoid of aberrations such as ragging , which itself has claimed many students ' lives over the years . <p> Most private universities have a culture of close relationships between teachers and students , unlike state universities . Students are awarded marks for attendance , assignments , quiz , presentation , viva , projects and examination . And some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These factors ensure frequent interactions between tutors and students , which has a positive impact on the learning process . <p> Private universities may not be the only path for salvation -- the State itself has many vocational and other colleges which teach job-oriented subjects . But most parents and students do not know about these opportunities . A full-blown media campaign must be undertaken to address this vacuum . <p> Indeed , the other most important factor is to create more educational and career opportunities for those who leave higher education at both O/L and A/L stages . This can be a combination of vocational , technological and foreign language training , with an eye on overseas jobs . <p> The time has come to end the debate on private universities once and for all . The Government should take a brave decision to establish more private universities regardless of the pressure from trade unions and various parties with vested interests . The abolition of SAITM has cost the country dearly in terms of the number of doctors who would have qualified by now . Unfortunately , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making a huge din over the shortage of doctors . <p> If private universities with established global connections and a reasonable fee structure are given the go-ahead , it will give a new lease of life to the thousands who are qualified to gain admission to State universities , but can not due to intake limitations . <p> This will also save the millions of dollars spent every year by students who opt for overseas education . If at least 50 percent of them opt to stay here and study at private universities , it will be a massive relief for our fragile foreign exchange reserves . Education is a field that does not stand still . It evolves continuously and we have to keep abreast of those developments to give our next generation a better chance .

" The majority of Sinhalese and Tamil students received their education in English-medium schools , many of which were associated with churches . <p> In these church schools , the primary focus was on teaching Christianity and the English language .

He initiated the development of national industries and advocated for commercial education . He was also an early proponent of teaching foreign languages .

These activities created an environment that encouraged students to think creatively and explore their talents . <p> C. W. W.

@@101845239 <h> IORA 's pivotal role <p> It is probably not incorrect to say that the Indian Ocean is the most important ocean in the world , judging by its trade , geopolitical and military significance . <p> As the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute ( LKI ) notes in a 2018 paper , " the Indian Ocean is home to major sea routes connecting the Middle East , Africa and East Asia with Europe and the Americas which facilitate maritime trade in the Indian Ocean Region ( IOR ) , carry more than half of the world 's sea-borne oil , and host 23 of the world 's top 100 container ports including Colombo . <p> The Indian Ocean is a vast expanse , stretching from the Strait of Malacca and western coast of Australia in the East to the Mozambique Channel in the West . It encompasses the Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea in the North , all the way down to the southern Indian Ocean . Along the coasts of this huge geographic expanse are countries that are home to 2.8 billion people . The Indian Ocean 's key sub-regions are South Asia , the Middle East , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean from Sri Lanka in the East to the Comoros Archipelago in the West . The region 's size and diversity explains its geoeconomic and geopolitical importance . From resource-rich Africa and the energy-dense Middle East to South Asia 's labour markets and manufacturing industries , the stability of the Indian Ocean is crucial to the global economy . <p> Sri Lanka has always been a hotspot in the Indian Ocean , thanks to its location at the heart of the East-West shipping lanes . Despite its small size , Sri Lanka has played a very significant role in IOR affairs since its Independence in 1948 . And now , with the impending Chairmanship of the Indian Ocean Rim Association ( IORA ) , Sri Lanka is poised to play an even bigger role in IOR affairs . <p> The IORA is a dynamic inter-Governmental organisation aimed at strengthening regional cooperation and sustainable development within the IOR through its 23 Member States and 11 Dialogue Partners . It includes countries that are politically and socially diverse , such as Australia , Indonesia , Iran , and South Africa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson Mandela and formally established in 1997 , the Mauritius headquartered bloc is firmly committed to strengthening the diplomatic , economic , trade and cultural ties that bind Member States whose shores are washed by the Indian Ocean 's waters . Interestingly , France , which is nowhere near the Indian Ocean , is a member of the IORA through its overseas territories such as Reunion in the IOR . <p> Today , there is a tendency to extend the IOR 's sphere of influence to the Pacific as well , due to their interdependence . This massive region is called the Indo-Pacific . There are growing calls for a " free and open " Indo-Pacific . In fact , individual countries have evolved their own vision for the IOR , as embodied by India 's SAGAR ( Security And Growth for All in the Region ) , a maritime initiative that seeks peace , stability , and prosperity in the region . <p> The People 's Republic of China ( PRC ) , India 's main rival in the region is promoting its Global Development Initiatives ( GDI ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries . India , US and many other countries are keeping an eye on the PRC 's ambitions and projects in the IOR . <p> Certain military and geopolitical developments in the IOR are somewhat worrying for island States such as Sri Lanka and Maldives . The QUAD military and political alliance ( US , Australia , Japan and India ) as well as AUKUS ( Australia , UK and US ) military alliance have flexed their muscles in the IOR , possibly to deter any expansionist plans of the PRC . The PRC , on the other hand , firmly denies any such plans and says it only has peaceful intentions . <p> Sri Lanka must make use of its IORA Chairmanship to ensure that the IOR remains free of conflict and military rivalry . In short , the IOR should be a Zone of Peace , as Sri Lanka has advocated all along . Instead of engaging in military adventurism and expansionism , there are many other ventures that can be pursued for the benefit of all IORA Members . For example , IORA countries should collaborate more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami . There are also reports that the tsunami early warning system in the IOR is now mostly defective . The IORA should pay attention to this issue . <p> We know less about the ocean than we know about the far side of the Moon . This is indeed why IORA countries should undertake maritime scientific research collaboratively to discover more about life in the depths of the Indian Ocean . They should also intensify research on Climate Change , given that many IORA Members are Small Island Developing States ( SIDS ) that can even disappear if the oceans rise by one or two metres . <p> IORA countries should also make people-to-people contact easier by relaxing visa regimes and promoting an ' Indian Ocean Identity ' . After all , the peoples ' of IORA countries share a common ocean and by extension , a common destiny .

@@102913231 <h> Today , October 26 , 2023 , marks the 127th Birth Anniversary of Sir Cyril de Zoysa A legacy of dedication and munificence <p> Sir Cyril de Zoysa was a man of great munificence , who lived in Sri Lanka , once as President of the Senate too . If ever there was a person who throughout a lifetime , cultivated qualities of devotion , discipline , generosity and wisdom , who was endowed with an immensely dignified personality , who displayed uncompromising self-confidence , who was imbued with knowledge and foresight , who was fortified by a full-blown sense of patriotism and keen business acumen , and above all , bearing the character of a most amiable lay Buddhist devoted to the Sambuddha Sasana , who in recent times had fallen from the skies as it were , upon our resplendent isle , such person could be none other than Sir Cyril de Zoysa . Sir Cyril 's birthplace was the historic Welitota in the township of Balapitiya in South Sri Lanka which had earned encomiums as being the land of the valiant . His parents were Solomon de Zoysa , Notary Public and Harriet de Zoysa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education at St Thomas ' College , Matara , Richmond College , Galle and Royal College , Colombo . <p> He was successful at the Cambridge Senior Examination in 1916 , gained admission to the Ceylon Law College , Colombo , studied the Law and commenced his professional career at the Balapitiya Courts . Very soon , he moved to Kalutara Courts and started practising as a Proctor , which was the turning point in his life . The Kalutara Bodhi Premises Sir Cyril , who spied an ancient Bo Tree near the railway line close to the Kalutara Courts made it a part of his routine to visit the place every day in the evenings after Court work , perform the prescribed rites , offer flowers and light little clay lamps as was long the tradition . At this time , this Bo Tree was in an undeveloped and highly unprotected state . The British Government Agent of Kalutara had issued orders that the performance of rites and rituals at the Bodhi premises shall be abandoned . For this reason , the Bodhiya stood alone and deserted . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cyril , ignored such orders and engaged in the performance of the traditional rites and rituals , with added vigour . Seeing this , the Buddhist community rallied around him and fearlessly engaged in worship and homage to the Buddha . Sir Cyril went on to purchase with his private funds the official residence of the white Agent of the Government , which was perched upon the knoll or mound opposite the sacred Bodhi Tree , and also the Kachcheri premises , ( Kachcheri being the office complex of the present-day District Secretary /Government Agent ) . He then commenced the work of constructing a Chaitya or great sepulchral monument , likened to the work of the Great Creator Architect , Vishvakarma , in the Hindu pantheon . For this purpose , he established in 1951 the Board of Trustees of the Kalutara Bodhiya and caused the construction of premises designed to attract and inspire with devotion , passers-by along Galle Road . <p> The Chaitya , with a circumference of 300 feet and a diameter of 95 feet , has the unusual feature of an open space within its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to commence the work of the Chaitya in 1964 , complete it all by January 1974 , place the pinnacle upon the crest of the Chaitya and make this offering to the Maha Sangha . It is with infinite devotion that he invested his wealth , stamina and time in this venture . Today the premises of the Kalutara Bodhi have been transformed into a sacred place of great beauty , attracting honour and respect from millions of Buddhists and non-Buddhists the world over . The Bodhiya indeed represents the prime fruit among all the fruits that Sir Cyril 's wholesome actions have yielded . The Business World Sir Cyril who formed a private Bus Company by the name of ' Swarnapali ' later changed its name to South Western Bus Company and expanded its services from Colombo to Matara , Tissa and Kataragama . At that time , this was the largest private Bus Company in our country . In 1956 when the Bandaranaike Government nationalized bus services Sir Cyril handed over the buses belonging to his Company only after repairing them all and having the tanks brimful with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of public welfare that he handed over to the Government all Depots and Service Centres that belonged to his Company . It was with all goodwill towards public welfare that he started a Handloom Textile Project in the land where his parental home stood in Balapitiya , his birthplace . This gave rise to job opportunities for hundreds of people while it was successful in squirting out top-quality textiles and garments fit for the local market and the foreign market as well . He started several rubber-based industries , rubber being one of the main economic resources in the Kalutara District . This led to the creation of thousands of job opportunities for young girls and boys . He was thus successful in having the country earn a sizable volume of foreign exchange too . Politics and Social Service In the year 1941Sir Cyril became the Chairman of the Urban Council , Kalutara . At a later stage , he was appointed to the Senate which was popularly known as the Upper House . Here he served as Vice President for six years and as President for eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unblemished character in the world of politics , forthright , honourable and dignified , which clearly reflected his political maturity . <p> Sir Cyril de Zoysa who became the Chairman of the Young Men 's Buddhist Association ( YMBA ) took the initiative to construct the YMBA Building in Colombo Fort , using part of his funds too . He ensured that much of the income generated by this Building was used for the provision of services rendered by the YMBA . It was by popular choice that he was called upon to chair a large number of organizations such as the Sri Lanka Law Society , the All-Ceylon Buddhist Congress , the Sri Lanka Scout Association and the Parama Vignaanaartha Sangamaya . He was the founder of Kalutara Vidyalaya and Kalutara Balika Vidyalaya . Sir Cyril organized the Kataragama Kirivehera Restoration Society , became its first Chairman and reconstructed the historic Kirivehera Chaitya . He went on to provide much of the infrastructure required for the sacred premises of Kataragama by building the required network of roads , Pilgrims ' Rests , and Alms Halls . It is along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ancient glory of the sacred Kataragama premises were restored . At this time these sacred premises of Kataragama did not have electricity . The Electricity Board too had neither the capacity nor the means to make provision . At this juncture , Sir Cyril came forward to meet this need . He gifted a generator with sufficient capacity to provide power to the entirety of the sacred premises at Kataragama ; and what is more , he undertook the responsibility of paying for its maintenance . We should never forget that it is due to Sir Cyril 's magnanimity that Kataragama has developed and progressed to this extent . The Amarapura Bhikku Samagree It is to the Most Venerable Madihe Pannaaseeha Maha Nayaka Thera that Sir Cyril first revealed his firm determination that Bhikkhus of the Amarapura Sector , who were organized by way of twenty-two sectors , separately from one another , should come together as one organization . Later on , Sir Cyril himself provided all facilities including transport facilities for Maha Nayaka , Anunayaka and Lekhakadhikari Theras of the Amarapura Sector , who were spread out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this subject . It is as a result of this that the Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Sangha Sabha was formed in 1966 . Accordingly , the massive force and the giant energy that stood behind the chain of activities that comprised the screen behind which the Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Sangha Sabha was created , was none other than Sir Cyril himself . The Government of Great Britain conferred a Knighthood on Sir Cyril de Zoysa who had provided large-scale services in the cause of the Buddha Sasana and also in other fields -- national , religious , social , educational , political etc . This knighthood is the Knight of the British Empire ( KBE ) . Its shortened form in English is Sir and in Sinhala it is Sreemath . This is how Cyril de Zoysa came to be addressed in English as Sir Cyril de Zoysa and in Sinhala as Sreemath Cyril da Zoysa . Sir Cyril who provided such large-scale services lived for 82 years and passed away on January 2 , 1978 . The Present and the Future I hold in high esteem the dedication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other members of the Kalutara Bodhi Trust , who continue unbroken the tradition of providing services in the same manner as Sir Cyril . Chief among such services are the Programme of Training Teachers in the Dhamma Schools ; the Programme of the Annual Provision of Text Books for Student Bhikkhus in all the Pirivenas in the Kalutara District ; the Programme of granting scholarships to Student Bhikkhus preparing to earn the qualification of Praacheena Panditha , in the Districts of Kalutara and Galle ; the Bodhignana Library Project ; Homes for the Aged and Homes for Children . <p> Moreover , the Bodhi Trust gives very generous donations for the development of Viharasthana or residential quarters for monks ; for preserving the good health of monks ; and to subsidize the costs of funeral ceremonies . In the active discharge of all these duties , it is Mr Ashan de Zoysa , a Member of the Board of Trustees , who plays a very active role , on behalf of the Chairman . I see this as a very good sign for the future . I perceive the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zoysa , the present in Deshamanya Ajita de Zoysa and the future in Ashan de Zoysa .

The efforts made by Deshamanya Ajita de Zoysa to uphold the Amarapura Maha Sangha Sabha set up initially with the support of Sir Cyril de Zoysa and to continue the social services initiated by Sir Cyril in the same original way , are most commendable . Furthermore , the Honorary Chairman repeatedly emphasizes the need for the Amarapura Sector and the Rama ? ? a Sector to come together and work in unison . To this end , Ajita de Zoysa acts with a dedication to extend his unstinted support .

May be I am biased since I am in this industry . There are two different ways of promoting it . One way is promoting it through the government saying this is a great vocation . And there is another one as our responsibility as hotel operators and hotel brands to show that this is a great career . There is better example than the Middle East . Back 15 to 20 years ago there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work now is in Dubai . Hospitality five years ago was not a career in Saudi Arabia . It is the highest recruiting industry in the country at present . They made it into a career that people want to get into and I genuinely hope that it will happen in Sri Lanka too . I think there are not two but three options . There is the government promoting it as a career , hoteliers promoting it as a career of choice and then the schools as well promoting it as a career . I personally think it is a great career and love it and I worked in all aspects of it from operation to investment hunting , management to consulting . And each one is completely different to the other . I feel I am fortunate that I have worked in all areas . And remember it is one of the jobs that takes you around the world . <p> QAs we marked World Tourism Day recently , what is the most salient feature that needs to be sustained in tourism industry ? <p> If I talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day all about ? It is celebrating tourism as an industry across the plant . It is about awareness . You know we are physically using the plant . According to the United Nations it figured one in ten people are working in the tourism sector in one way or another . It is strictly awareness about sustainability , how you deal with the people in the industry and how you track talent . It is not tracking the customer all the time . You got to remember there is a human element to this industry as you promote sustainability and think about the future of travel and how we can do it . <p> QThere are also talks about sustainable tourism initiatives like getting rid of single use plastics in hospitality industry . What are the other challenges in this industry ? <p> Yes , we already talk about getting rid of single use plastic and so on . One of the things that we have already talked about is going to underprivileged areas and recruiting people , housing them , training them , feeding them , clothing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promoting sustainable tourism in the community , that 's giving people a future , showing the people that this is a vocation . That is one key area we are focusing on . One of the biggest things in a hotel besides plastics is food waste . What are doing about it ? I am proud to say that we will be the first three hotels in this country to partner with a company and food waste experts who are helping us in our menu planning , and assess how much food actually we have and everything is computerised . Are we cooking too much of one item and the other part is what you do with the food waste . Now we measure it . This is for recycling , this is for cost control this is for inventory control , this is non-waste , not using natural resources of the planet . And then we get the next part when we partner with a local company . We can use that food waster with farmers as composts or feed for animals rather than just throwing it all away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the famers- and compost people in agriculture about what they can do with our food waste so we can re-recycle them . We are the first hotel in the country to partner with a company and control the food waste and now we are speaking to the people involved with agriculture about what can be done with waste rather than just throw it away . I think about such things on world tourism day . What our three hotels want the community to hear is that we are working with the community to enhance it . That is it can be both from an agricultural perspective or from a human element in hiring and training people .

@@103466230 <p> Last month 's protest in Batticaloa by livestock farmers and families of the disappeared against illegal occupation of land in the Mayilathamadu Madhavanai region <p> Livestock farmers and families of the disappeared staged a peaceful protest in Batticaloa last month against land grabbing . The demonstration aimed to address issues related to illegal colonization , government action and inaction and occupation of lands by the Sri Lanka Army . The Mayilathamadu Madhavanai region in Sri Lanka grapples with a pressing and multifaceted issue -- the unlawful occupation of vital grazing lands . Situated on the border of the Batticaloa and Ampara Districts , this region has historically been a lifeline for cattle farmers since 1972 . <p> The illegal occupation by the Sinhalese in 2010 has escalated into a prolonged conflict , causing significant human rights violations and posing a complex and multifaceted challenge that warrants a comprehensive examination . In this detailed exploration , we delve into the historical context , the impact on cattle farmers , governmental inaction , and the political and religious dimensions of this crisis . Mayilathamadu Madhavanai , a vital grazing land for over 200,000 cattle , has been the backbone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers . The region boasts a rich ecosystem with dense forests comprising coconut trees , making it vital not only for farmers but also for sustaining biodiversity . The unlawful occupation has disrupted traditional livelihoods , threatened the fragile ecosystem , and triggered a complex conflict with far-reaching consequences . The illegal occupation has inflicted severe hardships on cattle farmers , ranging from threats , intimidation , and violence to the chasing , damaging , and stealing of cattle . Additionally , farmers ' crops have been deliberately burned , leading to a drastic reduction in milk production from 5,500 to 300 litres per day . This not only jeopardizes the economic stability of the local community but also raises concerns about the region 's ability to recover from the crisis . One of the glaring issues exacerbating the crisis is the government 's failure to take effective action against the unlawful occupation . Despite numerous complaints , the lack of tangible steps has emboldened land invaders and created a climate of impunity . Over 4,000 cattle have been lost to shootings and theft since 2010 , with no perpetrators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government to address the crisis and restore justice for the affected farmers . <p> The unlawful occupation in Mayilathamadu Madhavanai is entwined with complex political and religious dynamics . Some political leaders have faced accusations of supporting land invaders , while religious figures have intervened to protect the rights of cattle farmers . This interplay has heightened tensions between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities , adding a layer of complexity to the already challenging situation . The crisis in Mayilathamadu Madhavanai has broader implications for peace and development in Sri Lanka . The conflict has eroded trust between communities , hindering reconciliation efforts . The degradation of the region 's ecosystem also jeopardizes sustainable development , threatening the country 's overall economic progress . Addressing this crisis is not just about resolving a localized issue ; it 's about fostering peace , rebuilding trust , and ensuring the long-term development of the nation . Understanding the legal context of the Mayilathamadu Madhavanai crisis is crucial to finding a sustainable resolution . Historical records from the 1930s , belonging to the Department of Forestry , confirm that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ documentation in 1978 under the Accelerated Mahaveli Authority further verifies its pastoral designation . However , the illegal occupation by Sinhalese settlers , in blatant violation of a Supreme Court order in 2022 , continues unabated . The legal confirmation in 2021 that the land is designated for grazing should have paved the way for effective measures to reclaim the occupied land . Regrettably , despite a court order issued to the Mahaweli Development Authority on 2022.07.06 , tangible actions remain elusive , leaving the cattle farmers in a perpetual state of uncertainty . Farmers have faced severe injustices , with no substantial action taken by authorities , including the Police Department , Forest Department , and Mahaweli Authority . Over a 13-year period from 2010 to 2023 , farmers lost over 4,000 cattle to shootings and theft , highlighting the dire consequences of governmental inaction . The crisis in Mayilathamadu Madhavanai is emblematic of the broader political challenges facing Sri Lanka in its post-war transition . The country grapples with issues such as land rights , reconciliation , and sustainable development . The Mayilathamadu Madhavanai crisis exposes the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play a significant role in perpetuating the crisis . Accusations of political leaders providing support to land invaders contribute to the entrenchment of the issue . The reluctance to act may be attributed to a lack of political will or capacity , further deepening the challenges faced by cattle farmers in the region . <p> The involvement of religious figures adds another layer of complexity to the Mayilathamadu Madhavanai crisis . Some monks and government officials have been accused of supporting the activities of unlawful settlers , intensifying tensions in the region . Former Eastern Province Governor Anuradha Yahampath and certain religious figures have been reported to be involved in renaming villages for illegal settlements and attempting to set up a Buddhist temple in the pasture ground area . Religious tensions are intertwined with the broader ethnic divide , with the crisis causing mistrust between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities . Such dynamics contribute to the complexity of the issue , making it essential to address not only the immediate crisis but also the underlying social and political fractures . The Mayilathamadu Madhavanai crisis has far-reaching implications for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , particularly the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil populations , has been severely eroded . The failure to address the grievances of the affected Tamil cattle farmers contributes to a narrative of injustice and discrimination . A comprehensive resolution to the crisis is not just about reclaiming grazing lands but also about rebuilding trust , fostering understanding , and promoting coexistence . Efforts to address the crisis must be embedded within broader reconciliation initiatives , acknowledging the historical injustices and working towards a more harmonious future . Addressing the Mayilathamadu Madhavanai crisis requires a comprehensive and multi-faceted approach . The following recommendations are crucial for a sustainable resolution that addresses the immediate concerns of cattle farmers and contributes to the broader goals of reconciliation and development : Immediate Eviction and Restoration : The government must take swift and decisive action to evict illegal occupants and restore the grazing land to cattle farmers . This involves a comprehensive assessment of the extent of illegal occupation and a strategic plan for reclamation . Compensation for Losses : Cattle farmers should be adequately compensated for the losses incurred during the unlawful occupation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the emotional distress caused by the conflict . Prevention Mechanism : Establish a robust mechanism to prevent future land invasions . This involves increased security measures , regular monitoring of grazing lands , and collaboration with local communities to report any suspicious activities promptly . Reconciliation Initiatives : Collaborate with religious leaders and civil society organizations to promote reconciliation and understanding between the majority Sinhalese and minority Tamil communities . This may involve interfaith dialogue . In conclusion , the Unlawful Occupation Crisis in Mayilathamadu Madhavanai is a deeply entrenched and multifaceted issue that demands urgent attention and sustainable solutions . The historical significance of this region , serving as a crucial lifeline for cattle farmers since 1972 , underscores the severity of the challenges faced by the community . The unlawful occupation by the Sinhalese in 2010 has not only disrupted traditional livelihoods but has also led to severe human rights violations and an intricate conflict . <p> A comprehensive resolution is not only about reclaiming grazing lands but also about rebuilding trust , fostering understanding , and promoting coexistence . In essence , addressing the Mayilathamadu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakeholders . The recommendations put forth aim to not only rectify the immediate concerns of the affected cattle farmers but also contribute to broader goals of reconciliation , sustainable development , and lasting peace in the region . The urgency of the situation can not be overstated , and decisive actions are imperative to rectify the injustices faced by the Mayilathamadu Madhavanai community . 
@@103466231 <h> RAND Corporation explains why the West is hard on Russia and soft on China <p> G7 Foreign Ministers ' meeting in Tokyo on November 8 , identified Russia as the principal security threat and not China <p> Russia is a more immediate and more proximate military threat to US national security than China is . But that can be countered <p> For the G7 countries , the primary security challenge comes from Russia rather than China , the Joint Statement issued after their Foreign Ministers met in Tokyo on November 8 shows . The G7 comprises Canada , France , Germany , Italy , Japan , the United Kingdom , the US , and the European Union . A note published by the US think tank RAND Corporation explains why the West is getting harder on Russia and softer on China . The Joint Statement of the G7 Foreign Ministers severely criticised the Russian invasion of Ukraine and threatened to impose harsh sanctions on Russia . But it was softer and accommodative in its approach to China . On Russia , the statement said that the G7 's " steadfast commitment to supporting Ukraine 's fight for its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to standing by Ukraine " for as long as it would take " while increasing economic pressure and imposing " robust sanctions and other restrictions on Russia . " The G7 would reinforce its coordination on sanctions to restrict Russia 's access to critical goods and technology . It would take further action to prevent the evasion and circumvention of measures taken against Russia . In order to reduce the revenues that Russia extracts from its exports , the G7 would accelerate mutual consultations on energy , metals , and all non-industrial diamonds , including those mined , processed or produced in Russia . The G7 pledged to reduce its reliance on Russian energy so that Russia is no longer able to weaponise its energy resources . The G7 reiterated its call to third parties to " immediately cease providing material support to Russia 's aggression , or face severe costs . " It said that any use of chemical , biological , or nuclear weapons by Russia " would be met with severe consequences . " The statement further said that Russia must cease its aggression and bear the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compensation for the damage caused to Ukraine . <p> The G7 reiterated its commitment to holding those responsible to account under international law . It would support the efforts of international mechanisms , such as the International Criminal Court , in bringing the accused to book . <p> Accommodate China <p> In sharp contrast to the line on Russia , the G7 took a softer and more accommodative line on China . The Joint statement said : " We stand prepared to build constructive and stable relations with China , recognizing the importance of engaging candidly and expressing our concerns directly to China . " " We act in our national interests . We acknowledge the need to work together with China on global challenges as well as areas of common interest , and call on China to engage with us on these issues . " " Our policy approaches are not designed to harm China nor do we seek to thwart China 's economic progress and development . We are not decoupling or turning inwards . " But at the same time , the G7 said that it recognizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a view to enabling sustainable economic relations with China , and strengthening the international trading system , we will continue to push for a level playing field for our workers and companies , " the statement said . The G7 said that it would address the challenges posed by China 's non-market policies and practices which distort the global economy . It will counter " malign practices , such as illegitimate technology transfer or data disclosure . " The G7 pledged to protect certain advanced technologies that could be used to threaten its security , but " without unduly limiting trade and investment . " The G7 expressed " serious concern " about the situation in the East and South China Seas . It strongly opposed any unilateral attempts by China to change the status quo by force or coercion or disregard of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea ( UNCLOS ) . <p> On Taiwan , the G7 called for a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues . But it reaffirmed its commitment to the " One China " policy , which is a major concession to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " meaningful participation in international organizations , including in the World Health Assembly and WHO technical meetings . " Not to forget human rights issues in China such as the treatment of Uyghur Muslims and Tibetans , the G7 called upon China to uphold human rights and respect the Sino-British Joint Declaration and the Basic Law , which enshrine rights and freedoms and a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong . The G7 also called on China " to act in accordance with its obligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and not to conduct interference activities , aimed at undermining the security and safety of our communities , the integrity of our democratic institutions , and our economic prosperity . " <p> RAND Corporation Explains <p> A piece written by James Dobbins , Howard J. Shatz , Ali Wyne for the US think tank RAND Corporation explained why the US looks at Russia as a greater menace than China . The authors describe Russia as a " well-armed rogue state that seeks to subvert an international order it can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portrayed as " a peer competitor that wants to shape an international order that it can aspire to dominate . " " Only Russia has attacked neighbouring states , annexed conquered territory , and supported insurgent forces seeking to detach yet more territory . Russia assassinates its opponents at home and abroad , interferes in foreign elections , subverts foreign democracies , and works to undermine European and Atlantic institutions , " the authors say . In contrast , China 's growing influence is based largely on positive measures such as trade , investment , and development assistance , the authors point out . " These attributes make China a less immediate threat but a much greater long-term challenge , " the authors say . <p> " In the military realm , Russia can be contained , but China can not . China 's military predominance in East Asia will grow over time , compelling the US to accept greater costs and risks just to secure existing commitments . " <p> Real Challenge is Geo-economic <p> But the real challenge for the US is in the field of geo-economics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in geo-economics that the contest for world leadership will play out . And " It is in the domain of geo-economics that the balance of global influence between the United States and China has begun shifting in China 's favour , " they add . As of 2017 , China 's economy was the second largest in the world , behind only that of the United States . Russia 's was 11th . Russia 's military expenditure is lower than China 's , and that gap is likely to grow . Russia has poorer economic prospects , and is less likely to dramatically increase its military power in the long term , the authors say . However , Russia is a more immediate and more proximate military threat to US national security than China is . But that can be countered . The authors recommend that in the security sphere , the US should continue to hold the line in East and South East Asia against China . And in the economic realm , the US should compete more effectively in foreign markets , persevere and strengthen international norms for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those norms . <p> " Given China 's efforts to take technological leadership in the long term and the potential advantages that such leadership brings , the United States also needs to improve its innovation environment . Measures could include greater funding for research , retention of US-educated foreign scientists and technologists , and regulatory reforms that ease the introduction of product and process improvements into businesses and the market , " the authors suggest . In response to the challenge from China 's Belt and Road Initiative , they say that the US " should move to secure its own preferential access to the world 's largest markets , the industrialized countries of Europe and Asia ; assist nations in increasing connectivity with the world economy ; work with partners to ensure more transparency in China 's Belt and Road projects ; and increase support to U.S. exporters and investors .

" <p> William Shakespeare wrote in his play Julius <p> Caesar : His life was gentle , and the elements So mixed in him that nature might stand up and say to all the world , this was a man . " <p> The late Gamini Weerakoon <p> Much hackneyed as they may be , these enduring words of the Bard of Avon aptly describe veteran journalist Gamini Weerakoon who breathed his last on November 11 , 2023 . His funeral was held at Borella Kanatte on Sunday , November 12 . Gamini Weerakoon , known to his friends and colleagues as Gamma , was an integral part of Sri Lanka 's English journalistic realm for more than five decades . He entered journalism as a news reporter and gradually rose from the ranks to retire as Editor . He served in many capacities such as reporter , sub-editor , feature writer , news editor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eventful career . Until the very end , he was in harness as a journalist by writing the weekly column titled Doublespeak for the Sunday Times . Though his entry into Journalism was through Lake House Gamma spent the greater part of his journalistic life at Bloemendhal Road with Upali Newspapers . It was there that he made his mark as the editor for more than two decades . The Island of November 13 , 2023 , published an editorial titled When Great Oaks Fall about the former editor . The editorial sums up Gamini Weerakoon 's contribution to Journalism concisely . Here are some excerpts -- <p> When Great Oaks Fall Fondly known as Gamma to his fellow scribes , Weerakoon left Lake House in the early 1980s to join the team Upali Wijewardene handpicked to launch The Island . He played a key role in crafting a new brand of journalism , which quickly gained immense popularity . He succeeded Vijitha Yapa as the editor , and his was a memorably long innings in journalism . He elevated the quality and effectiveness of Sri Lankan journalism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " Gamma excelled in editorial writing . He wrote beautifully , forcefully , and persuasively , and his no-holds-barred editorials were simply out of this world ; they were loaded with facts and figures , which he clinically analysed with wit and humour thrown in for good measure ; they contained very powerful messages that naturally made the conceited rulers of the day furious . The Island became a marked target as a result . " <p> " The Island bore the brunt of the fury of violent politicians who acted with impunity , but Gamma was not deterred . He would harden under pressure as all good journalists usually do . It was not occasionally that Gamma had a brush with those in authority . He had the pugnacity of a pugilist and readily pitted himself against the pompous moneybags and self-important politicians , but he was a kind-hearted gentleman , whose integrity was never in question . " " Having cut his teeth on journalism during the hot metal printing days , Gamma shepherded The Island into the digital age . He was a multifaceted personality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself to international affairs , politics and economics , as a prolific writer . " " He tenaciously campaigned for media freedom . Gamma did not officially label himself as a media trainer but he mentored quite a few journalists during his UNL days , and many of them have joined other publications or pursued careers in media-related fields . Veteran scribes who have been enriching journalism for decades are like great oaks that leave lasting voids when they fall . Gamma was unarguably one of them . " <p> Revived Memories Gamma 's demise revived memories of those happy days at Bloemendhal Road for me and several other former Island journalists . Even as we communicated with each other about Gamma , a few asked me whether I was going to write about him . I said that I was working on a political article and that I may write about Gamma later on . My friends wanted me to write on Gamma this week itself . One said " You wrote so many articles about politicos . You must write about Gamma and about yourself . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close , no ? " That clinched it . I shelved the article I was working on . This week 's article is all about Gamini Weerakoon . Gamini Weerakoon came into my life 42 years ago in 1981 when I joined The Island as a Staff Reporter on November 16 . As stated earlier he was known popularly as Gamma derived from his name Gamini . However , Gamma is the third letter of the Greek alphabet and also denotes the third in a position , order or class . Gamma Weerakoon was the third in the editorial hierarchy of The Island when I joined the newspaper . The first two were the Editor Vijitha Yapa and Deputy Editor Dalton de Silva . Gamini Weerakoon ranked third as the news editor . However , Dalton de Silva quit early to be the Reuters Bureau Chief in Colombo . Gamma functioned as both News Editor and Acting Deputy Editor for some time prior to being appointed formally as Deputy Editor . Later he succeeded Vijitha Yapa as Editor . I have worked under him as a journalist in his three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the outset , I would like to relate the circumstances under which I started working for the Island in 1981 . I was then a journalist for the Tamil Daily Virakesari . Although I was a staff reporter at the Editorial in Colombo , I had been stationed in Jaffna since July 1981 . This was because the Virakesari 's veteran Jaffna correspondent Sellathurai had been hospitalized with a serious ailment . Since Jaffna was of crucial importance to a Tamil newspaper , I was sent there to hold the Fort . The Sunday Island was launched in October 1981 . The Daily Island was to be launched on November 16 . The paper was looking for a journalist to report from Jaffna as a staff correspondent . My friends Ajith Samaranayake and Ravindran Casinader , who had begun working for Sunday Island had recommended my name . I was already acquainted with Vijitha Yapa when he was the media liaison officer at the Greater Colombo Economic Commission ( GCEC ) headed by Upali Wijewardene . So I came down to Colombo from Jaffna for an interview at Upali @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a life-changing one . I was interviewed by Vijitha Yapa and Gamini Weerakoon . They wanted me to work as the staff correspondent for the paper in Jaffna . I declined the offer and said that I wanted to work in Colombo and not Jaffna . At that point , Gamma got up abruptly and started leaving but Vijitha continued to talk to me and asked me what I wanted to do in Colombo . Weerakoon tarried at the door and told Yapa " What 's the point in wasting time Vijitha , we want someone in Jaffna but he does n't want to be there . So we better look for someone else " . But Yapa replied " That was our idea but he has another idea . We 'll try and work something out " . Gamma just shrugged his shoulders and left but Vijitha continued to engage with me . The result was that I ended up working for The Island in Colombo instead of Jaffna . This was all due to Vijitha Yapa 's accommodative flexibility . Though Gamma was reluctant to take me on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both Yapa and Gamma wanted me to concentrate on Tamil affairs in writing for the papers . I was hesitant as I feared my copy may be altered due to political reasons . Both assured me that would not happen as long as I reported the facts accurately . I agreed to do the Tamil round . I plunged into work and began enjoying my entry into English journalism . I relocated from Wellawatte to Kotahena to be within walking distance of Upali Newspapers . With rising armed militancy , the Tamil round in news reporting became turbulently exciting . I worked hard and wrote many news stories . Many of them were the lead stories . Gamma as news editor was pleased and began to rely on me very much . <p> Peninsula , not Island One day he joked " My friends are saying the paper is not The Island but The Peninsula because your by-lines are dominating the front page . " I reminded him jovially that he did not want to hire me in the first place . He responded by saying that he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing the Jaffna stories from Colombo now . He added as an afterthought " I did n't know you were an Old Thomian then " . Gradually Gamini Weerakoon and I became very close to each other . Even though we had different political views there existed a bond of friendship between us that baffled many . Gamma in many respects was an enigma . <p> School by the Sea Gamini Abhaya Weerakoon was born on 19 March 1941 . His family was residing in Mt Lavinia then and young Weerakoon had both his primary and secondary education at the school by the sea . It was as a Thomian that he acquired his lifelong pet name Gamma derived from Gamini . He was a member of the triumphant rugby team of 1961 captained by Tony Sirimanne . Gamma was a utility player in the pack and played in several positions such as lock , prop , second row and wing forward . Among fellow teammates were Wilhelm Koch and Maurice Fairweather . I believe Gamma won a few field events in the athletics too . He entered the Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never completed his degree . Gamma told me once that he engaged in all types of activity on campus except academic pursuits and was notorious for cutting lectures . This was corroborated by a cousin of mine who was Gamma 's contemporary at varsity . ( My cousin too did not get his degree ) . <p> Undergrad to Journo The transition from undergrad to journo was related to me by Gamma himself . When he reached a dead end as a BSc student , Dr Neelan Tiruchelvam known as Neelan came to Gamma 's aid . Neelan took Gamma to the then Law Faculty Dean Prof T. Nadarajah who kindly facilitated a transfer for Gamma to the Law Faculty . Unfortunately , his new avatar as a law student did not last long There was an illness resulting in a throat operation due to which Gamini Weerakoon 's voice got affected . Though it improved greatly later , Gamma was embarrassed in the initial stages . As he told me once " I wanted to be an articulate advocate like GG or Colvin making thundering arguments in my powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , I thought there was no point in becoming a lawyer " . Gamma began exploring other possibilities . Journalism beckoned ! Gamini Weerakoon had displayed a flair for writing at school . He was recruited as a reporter in 1966 by the legendary Denzil Peiris the then editor of The Observer published by Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Ltd . ( ANCL ) aka Lake House . It is the practice of newspapers to allocate specific areas or spheres for reporters to cover - apart from general assignments- as part of their journalistic duty . <p> Campus Round The second half of the sixties in the 20th century was a period of youth unrest and student turbulence globally . Sri Lanka known then as Ceylon was no exception . The United National Party ( UNP ) Government under Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake was in power then . The Education Minister was the controversial IMRA Iriyagolla . There were only two universities one in Peradeniya and the other in Colombo and the Education Minister was in charge of schools as well as universities . There was much friction among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ student unions were highly politicised and inclined towards the Left . The recent undergrad Gamma was assigned the higher education or campus round to cover as a reporter . It was a very wise and appropriate decision by the editor . Gamma 's campus contacts were huge and wide . Besides he was able to saunter around varsity precincts like an undergrad . The result was a wide range of news stories many of them scoops and exclusives . Gamini Weerakoon made his mark as a reporter . He also realised that his life 's vocation was journalism . Apart from the campus round , Gamini reported on other matters including general politics . He also served as a court reporter and Parliament affairs reporter at times . He wrote news features too . After a short stint at subbing , Gamma became News Editor . In 1973 Lake House was taken over by the United Front Govt led by Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike . There were drastic changes and Gamini became the Daily News news editor . <p> Beira Romance Meanwhile , there was romance in the Lake Beira @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake House journalist Rajitha Unantenna . Rajitha 's father was PB Unantenna , a member of Parliament representing the Hanguranketa constituency in the Central Province . PB Unantenna had been elected from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party ( SLFP ) in the 1970 elections . He had earlier contested in 1960 and 1965 and lost . The newlyweds took up residence right across Lake House at Regent Flats near the Regal theatre . Their only daughter Surangi was born . It was then that Gamma bought his famous orange-coloured Volkswagen I think . <p> Lake House Changes In July 1977 the UNP led by Junious Richard Jayewardene came to power in a landslide victory . However , Lake House was not given back to the rightful owners although JR himself was related to the Wijewardene family . In 1978 , Kotte MP and incumbent speaker Anandatissa de Alwis was appointed Minister of State ( This was a cabinet post different to the present Ministers of State ) . The State-owned media came under his purview . Once again there were changes in Lake House , Veteran journalist and the then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Incidentally , Anandatissa de Alwis was Clarry 's brother-in-law .

What happened thereafter will be related in the second and final part of this article .

@@103816237 <p> The scandal of the 19th century , beyond the English invasions &amp; genocides , beyond the wilful English destruction of complex irrigation systems -- which the English correctly recognized as forming the solidarity &amp; solidity of the ancient village &amp; its gamsabha -- beyond all this , was the English fragmentation of land , especially the Temple Lands . So recalled SBD de Silva , whose unparalleled scholarship inspires this ee archive . These vast holdings , he observed , could have provided the basis for an even more-coordinated modern and efficient agriculture .

The problem with this allegation is that Brigadier Salley was not even in the country . <p> Interestingly , Channel 4 declined to appear before a Commission of Inquiry set up by incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe .

The LTTE ideologists in Australia are quite vociferous and several Australian MPs have openly expressed their sympathies with the separatists .

@@104362230 <h> Beware of Greeks Bearing Gifts - EDITORIAL <p> Last week , U.S. Special Representative for Racial Equity and Justice , Desir ? e Cormier Smith was in Lanka . During her time here , Ms. Smith met Malaiyaha Tamils - up country Tamils - civil society groups , and government officials to reiterate the U.S. Government 's support to help advance the human rights of members of marginalised ethnic communities in the country . If it were not so sad , the agenda of Ms. Smith might have sounded funny . US involvement in rights issues the world over has spelt disaster for the countries in which they intervened . During the final days of World War II the US nuclear bombed the civilian cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , causing over a hundred thousand civilian deaths within a space of minutes . <p> The US forgot Human Rights . It was a convenient excuse to live test the nuclear bomb . The people of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were simply guinea pigs - things used for experimentation . Claiming it was intervening to protect the rights of the people of Vietnam , the US used chemical weapons such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agricultural lands in that country . Over 2 million Vietnamese civilians died as a result of US ' support ' . Large parts of its countryside were scarred by bombs , defoliants and laced with land mines . In Afghanistan , US intervened on the pretext of helping expel Soviet troops from that country . Initially it covertly armed and trained the Afghan Mujaheddin fighting Soviet occupation . The reality : Afghanistan is a treasure trove of huge deposits of copper , iron , marble , talc , coal , lithium , chromite , cobalt , gold , lapis lazuli , gemstones , and more , which the US continues lusting after . <p> According to the Brown University 's ' Costs of War ' , US involvement in the conflict left Afghanistan massively impoverished . Ninety-two percent of the population faces some level of food insecurity . Three million children are at risk of acute malnutrition . Some regions face famine . Around half the population is living on less than $1.90 per day . At least 70,000 of those killed were civilians . <p> Today the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the false claim of defending Israel . UN Special Rapporteurs have confirmed that the present actions of Israel in Palestine are genocidal in nature . They have also accused Israel of practicing apartheid in the Palestinian territories Israel illegally occupies . Euro-Med Human Rights Monitor reveals , 23,012 Palestinians had been killed by Israel since 7 October in air and artillery attacks on the Gaza Strip . This number includes 9,077 children . Hundreds of children remain trapped under the rubble . The total number of child deaths is likely to exceed 10,000 . <p> The ongoing Israeli attacks have left over 18,000 Palestinian children injured . Dozens more have suffered amputations , and hundreds more have suffered severe burns to various parts of their bodies . Worst , Israel has cut all water , electricity and medical supplies to Gaza . Yet the US refuses to call on Israel to stop its genocidal campaign , and has vetoed a debate in the Security Council calling for a ceasefire . Instead it provides Israel lethal armaments to continue the massacre . <p> It is in this shameful background that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? e Cormier Smith was in Lanka to help advance the human rights of members of marginalised ethnic communities in our country . We have many unsettled problems ; examples are the three decade-long ethnic conflict and the more recent Easter Sunday bombings .

Some religious leaders have been calling for an independent international panel to further investigate the Easter Sunday bombings . <p> Knowing the sequence of disasters which follow US involvement in any conflict or problem situation , we need to be extremely careful on whom we invite to intervene in local issues . Whatever the shortcomings of a local investigation , it is far better than bringing more covert operatives into the country .

@@104362231 <h> Authoritarian Austerity in Global Context <p> Economies are shaped by politics , and development is intrinsically linked to democracy . With over fifty countries in the Global South facing severe debt problems , what does the future of democracy and development look like in these countries ? This was the theme of a workshop organised by the International Development Economics Associates ( IDEAs ) network and the Faculty of Economics , Chulalongkorn University , in Thailand , titled ' Democracy and Development in Less Developed Economies ' . With over a dozen economists from Asia and Africa , this was an effort to consider the possibilities for substantive democracy with egalitarian policies . <p> In this column , I draw on my presentation at the workshop where I argued about the political shift in Sri Lanka , away from the authoritarian populism of the Rajapaksa regimes towards an authoritarian austerity that characterises the Wickremesinghe-Rajapaksa regime . The governments of Mahinda and Gotabaya Rajapaksa combined authoritarianism with populist appeal and largess , including hand-outs to their social base . However , the current government under the watchful eye of the IMF only offers austerity , but with the promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and broader attacks on labour . <p> Sri Lanka 's dependent economic structure was for long determined by colonialism and post-independence by a neo-colonial global order . However , the politics and policies of some national regimes provided the space for engagement to defend and demand social welfare programs and redistributive initiatives for working people to withstand exploitation , dispossession and economic crises . Which economic discourses should leftist economists challenge to confront the current neoliberal onslaught , and what alternatives should they generate to address the current crisis ? <p> International Framing <p> The concept note of the IDEAs workshop was reflective of our context in Sri Lanka : " The last few decades have seen low and middle-income countries ( LMICs ) being subject to two kinds of experiments . In the economic realm there has been a consistent and widespread experimentation with neoliberal polices - in some instances , and on occasions imposed by external agencies like the IMF and the World Bank , backed by the advanced economies , and in others openly embraced by domestic elites looking to drive inequalising growth riding on foreign capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an unequal international regime and an extreme dependence on volatile capital flows into these economies is a common feature . Extreme volatility and periodic crises have not reversed this tendency , though on occasion governments elected to power , on platforms appealing to the victims of neoliberalism , have attempted to moderate ( even if not abjure ) austerity and raise social expenditures , including on social protection . But the fundamental structural features of neoliberal regimes remain largely unchallenged . <p> What is remarkable is that many of these countries still function within or have switched to the framework of Parliamentary democracy , even though the quality of that democracy and the fairness of elections are in question in some of these contexts . On the other hand , many countries function with authoritarian governments . In some contexts , authoritarianism is the means used to protect elites and sustain extremely inegalitarian and crisis ridden neoliberal regimes . However , the debilitating and destabilising consequences of neoliberalism have resulted in recent decades in the overthrow of some of these authoritarian regimes by protest movements . Yet there appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In many parts of the Global South , especially in Africa , the hopes raised by political liberalisation have been dashed , to some extent , by the socially regressive consequences of economic liberalisation and globalisation . " <p> Indeed , Sri Lanka has been no different . Even though the tremendous protests of July 2022 chased away an authoritarian President , within weeks another authoritarian President was installed by the former President 's allies in Parliament to ensure their survival and reinstate the neoliberal economic trajectory . This illegitimate government uses the Prevention of Terrorism Act to suppress protests , indefinitely postpone local government elections , maintain a repressive order by tear-gassing protestors , and threaten to enact more laws to curtail rights and freedoms . <p> Governance and Corruption <p> The irony of the current political and economic dispensation in Sri Lanka is that despite the lack of legitimacy of the government in power , and it 's blatantly anti-democratic actions , the IMF and World Bank are congratulating the Government for taking forward reforms to address issues of governance and corruption . Although contradictory , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they legitimise a rule by experts that are aligned with the interests of the ruling class and to the detriment of working people 's democratic participation in determining their future . <p> This is the case with the IMF 's Governance Diagnostic in Sri Lanka , which is the first of its kind in Asia , and now resulting in new laws . These are part of the proposed sixty new laws and amendments over the next year as mentioned in the Budget Speech for 2024 . They consist of a whole array of repressive and dispossessing legal enactments including an Anti-Terrorism Act to curtail dissent , a Public Finance Management Law ensuring austerity with the state barred from providing relief even amidst economic shocks , and land laws that dispossess farmers while commercialising agriculture . <p> These laws reflect an ideological attack claiming that state-policymaking can not be the domain of democracy . They reify experts and the so-called methodological individualism , where communities , social institutions and the collective concerns of the citizenry are disregarded . Only the interests of market-oriented private institutions and individuals as consumers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of March 2023 and the World Bank Country Partnership Framework of June 2023 , which frame Sri Lanka 's economic policies for the next four years with clear benchmarks and programs . <p> Neoliberal Crisis and Alternatives <p> Neoliberalism itself is in crisis , as evident from economic crises and the rise of overtly racist regimes , including in the global centres of power . And in Sri Lanka , it is going to be virtually impossible to return to the economic trajectory from 2010 to 2019 , with market borrowings and speculative investments in infrastructure and urban real estate to generate even fictitious economic growth . <p> In this context , my presentation sought to look at the historical changes in regimes since Independence . I use the concept regime to mean both different regimes of accumulation such as the import-substitution development and particular ruling regimes such as an " intermediate regime " consisting of different classes . In the past some of those regimes provided greater space to demand reforms favourable to working people . However , some members of the IDEAs network , including Prof. C.P. Chandrasekhar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical questions and responses . They pushed me to think about the distinction between the state and a regime in power as well as the changing role of the middle classes in supporting authoritarian populist regimes . The discussion included whether to focus on heterodox macroeconomic policies ignored by policymakers or substantive campaigns for universal education and healthcare . Indeed , these are much needed debates on the path of social change in this time of crisis . <p> In any event , the authoritarian austerity strategy of the IMF and the Government are unlikely to work , as resistance is bound to increase . However , this austerity push will do a lot of damage along the way , and may even create the conditions for fascism with a backlash . Thus leftist economists have the urgent task to expose these policies . Furthermore , there is also the larger task of constructing alternatives acceptable to broader constituencies and coalitions . I would also argue that this has to start with social welfare relating to public services and self-sufficiency in the food system . <p> These alternatives have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked to the international order within which we have to work . However , under the hegemony of global finance capital backed by the IMF , World Bank and neoliberal experts , polarising processes of unequal global development continue with anti-democratic means . And when it comes to resistance , there are few signs of the political leadership that led to the Non-Aligned Movement during an earlier era . What we need now is more work , engagement and solidarity by progressive intellectuals , trade unions and social movements in the Global South to place larger questions of freedom and equality on the international agenda . 
@@104362232 <h> Indo-Sri Lanka Grid Connectivity -- Its Pros and Cons <p> The Electricity Bill is officially published in the Gazette and is yet to be presented to the Parliament . This article restricts to Indo-Sri Lanka Grid Connectivityfacilitated by the proposed law and its impact on Sri Lanka . <p> Motives of the States <p> On 22nd October , President Ranil Wickramasinghe disclosed that India 's electricity system would be connected with Sri Lanka 's electricity system . The Power and Energy Minister also expressed views on plans to connect the grids of the two countries by 2030 . Sri Lankan High Commissioner to India , Milinda Moragoda , in his 27-page Integrated Country Strategy ( ICS ) for Sri Lanka Diplomatic Missions in India for 2021/2023 , highlighted on grid connectivity between the two countries . Hence both governments act with one mindset on this matter . <p> Segregation <p> The preamble of the Bill details the need to reform the existing institutional framework of the Electricity Industry by designing it to attract new investments . Accordingly , the activities of the Electricity Industry currently vested in a single government-owned entity would be segregated by the incorporation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law , the Ceylon Electricity Board Act , No.17 of 1969 shall stand repealed . The activities relating to hydro-electricity generation , thermal electricity generation and renewable energy generation , which are presently vested with the Ceylon Electricity Board , shall ( within six months from the date of the Speaker 's certification of the Bill ) be re-structured and vested in entities incorporated under the Companies Act , No.07 of 2007 i.e. : - " <p> ( a ) A company to take over the hydro-power generation assets of the Ceylon Electricity Board ; ( b ) A company to take over the coal power plant owned and operated by the Ceylon Electricity Board as well as Lanka Coal Company ; ( c ) A company to take over the thermal generation assets of the Ceylon Electricity Board ; ( d ) A company to take over the wind power plant owned and operated by the Ceylon Electricity Board ; ( e ) A company to take over the functions of the Ceylon Electricity Board relating to the development , maintenance and operation of the physical infrastructure that makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) A company to take over the functions of the Ceylon Electricity Board relating to generation scheduling , commitment and economic dispatch of generating plants and functions relating to the planning of future electricity and transmission demands ; ( g ) Separate companies to take over the functions of the distribution divisions of the Ceylon Electricity Board ; and ( h ) Such a number of companies as shall be required for managing the residual functions of the Ceylon Electricity Board " . <p> The wholesale electricity market shall be made fully autonomous and competitive . The National Systems Operator shall be responsible for the operation of the wholesale electricity market . It will be a public company incorporated under the Companies Act , where the SL Government holds 100% of its shares . The regulator of the electricity industry will be the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka . The National Transmission Network Service Provider ( a public company where the government holds more than 50% of shares ) would be responsible for the maintenance of the National Transmission Network ( National Grid ) of Sri Lanka . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of advising the Minister on formulating the National Electricity Policy . A secretariat named the Power Sector Reforms Secretariat would be established to implement the reform process . <p> Grid Connectivity <p> The Bill for the first time introduces the definition of " Regional Market " to mean " the electricity market that is in operation outside the territory of Sri Lanka and within the South Asian Region " . The National Transmission Network Service Provider can ( upon a request by the National System Operator ) connect with the regional transmission networks with the approval of the Cabinet of Ministers . The new law permits for procuring electricity in bulk from the suppliers of the regional markets and engaging in electricity trading with such markets . These and several other clauses in the Bill authorize Grid connectivity with India ( the closest electricity market operational outside Sri Lanka ) . <p> Competency for Grid Connectivity <p> The proposed law will formulate the legal framework of the domestic electricity industry . Unfortunately , the bill carries no practical mechanism for interconnectivity and coordination between the different entities created in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important administrative issues such as the accountability of the officials-in-charge of such entities , the majority being Companies . Hence , it is difficult to trace a line of responsibility through the scheme of the act , especially for any issue having national or regional impact . On the contrary , such entities are enjoying immense autonomy to operate , only subject to the conditions of the relevant licenses . This fragile system is no way near in competency to trade with the world 's third largest producer of electricity , India , which is governed by a strong and well-coordinated legal framework . <p> Grid Connection ; In Whose Favour ? <p> Sri Lanka should be mindful of the power generation deficit between the two countries . Like for any other commodity , the country that produces more takes the advantage of the grid connection . India presently exports electricity to Bangladesh , Myanmar and Nepal . <p> A study conducted by the national laboratory of the U.S. Department of Energy 's Office of Energy Efficiency &amp; Renewable Energy operated by the Alliance for Sustainable Energy , LLC ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the projected impact of power system operations for 2025 of cross-border electricity trade between India and Sri Lanka revealed that the National Security of Supply , a concern specific to Cross Boarder Energy Trade , is related to the willingness of a country to rely on external agents for their electricity supply . With no non-technical barriers to trade , Sri Lanka could potentially rely heavily on imports to meet domestic electricity needs . Analyzing the total amount each country would import across the Direct Current tie each year in energy and as a fraction of that country 's annual load ( on statistics in 2018 ) the study finds that Sri Lanka would import 3.2 TWh , accounting to 14% of its annual electricity demand . Referring to the annual totals , the report states that the load met by imports in any one period can be as high as 25% . <p> The report further states , " However , the DC tie also creates new operational and national security risks . While the DC tie can help address contingencies in Sri Lanka , this service is dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie also helps Sri Lanka meet 12% of its annual load in the medium hydro year , raising Sri Lanka 's reliance on imports " . <p> Counterproductive Purpose <p> Accordingly , the new law moves away from self-sufficiency of electricity generation and introduces a new norm of reliance on importing electricity to meet domestic needs . This trend would discourage the government from taking interest in expanding power generation capacity , resulting in a deviation from that responsibility . On the other hand , the Bill is not addressing any of the currently identified issues faced in the domestic industry . These include policy inconsistencies , the non-implementation of a long-term-generation plan , inefficient energy use by industries , unsolicited projects , limited renewable energy projects , non-scientific tariff policies , etc , which could conveniently be addressed within the scope of the existing law by removing elements of corruption , inefficiency and placing correct people at correct places . Experts have opined that this law would degrade the standards and efficiency of the domestic industry . Therefore , who truly are backing the proposed law remains a mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Under the 13th Amendment , development , conservation and management of sites and facilities in the province for the generation and promotion of electrical energy ( other than hydro-electric power and power generated to feed the national grid ) is a provincial council subject . The operative impact of the new law has to be considered with other MOUs that SL had entered with India , such as that entrusting to Indian investments the developing of the Eastern Province . The Bill permits for private power generation plants that could be built within specific provinces . <p> It further enables the National Transmission Network Service Provider for interconnection by transmission assets built by private investors to the National Grid of Sri Lanka on a non-discriminatory basis . Experts in the field opine that such privately owned transmission lines , though could legally be considered as part of the National Grid are technically capable of operating as separated power lines . This paves way for all three operations , i.e. generation , transmission and distribution to take place at the provincial level . This is the opposite of what India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grids to the National Grid . <p> Hence , in the backdrop of the 13th Amendment , and with Indian interest in making Trincomalee a power hub , Indian investments in the N-E provinces , and dependency on Indian electricity imports , the proposed law adds another threat to the Unitary State and National Security of the Country . Grid connectivity would also have a serious impact on the Economic Sovereignty of the People . The present government has no mandate obtained from the people to execute such activity .

How has your experience in Sri Lanka been ? <p> A : Both professionally and personally , I had the most memorable time of my diplomatic career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the High Commissioner has been an absolute honour . My tenure here coincided with a critical time for Sri Lanka . I say this with great satisfaction that the close friendship between India and Sri Lanka has proved its mettle . I leave Sri Lanka with the sense that India-Sri Lanka ties are poised to scale new heights . Personally , I found the people of Sri Lanka to be extremely warm and hospitable . The affinity between our peoples made me feel at home wherever I went in the country . I thoroughly enjoyed my tenure here . I would like to believe that during this time , India and Sri Lanka have been able to create new pathways for cooperation . They also decided on a roadmap for the future . <p> Q What are the most striking commonalities between the two sides ? <p> A : I think the commonalities are many . After all , India and Sri Lanka are civilisational twins . Our relationship is very aptly described with the Sinhala word Sahodara , meaning brothers from the same womb . There are remarkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , literature , arts , etc . We share history and heritage , and are bound to have a common destiny . We also have commonalities in our aspirations . To me , among the most striking commonalities are the shared values of democracy and diversity that both our peoples celebrate . We have demonstrated that democracy delivers . We have seen that progress and the empowerment of citizens go hand in hand . <p> Q How would you look at the trajectory of bilateral ties during your term here ? <p> A : Overall , I would say that the trajectory has been positive . We have broken new ground and there is significant potential to further expand our cooperation across areas . The Virtual Bilateral Summit of 2020 between our two Prime Ministers was a milestone in laying a roadmap for the cooperative agenda for the prosperity of the people of both the countries . The formidable strength of the India-Sri Lanka partnership has been demonstrated in the recent past . Sri Lanka received its very first consignment of COVID-19 vaccines made in India under India 's Vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roll out of Sri Lanka 's vaccination programme ahead of schedule . In early 2022 , when Sri Lanka suffered its worst economic crisis since Independence , India mobilised an unprecedented assistance of over USD 4 billion for food , fuel , fertilisers and currency support to help the people of Sri Lanka . India was the first country to provide financing assurances needed by the IMF to help Sri Lanka . India also played a key role as the co-chair in the Official Creditors Committee in reaching an understanding with the Sri Lankan government on the terms of debt restructuring . <p> Our bilateral ties were further consolidated during the visit of President Ranil Wickremesinghe to India in July 2023 . The Joint Vision statement adopted by our leaders lays out the path to shared prosperity with connectivity as the key enabler . When I talk to the Sri Lankan people , whether in cities or villages , I feel that they see in India a dependable partner and a reliable friend . Mutual trust and goodwill as well as vast opportunities afforded by India 's sustained high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take off . <p> Q There have been a lot of engagements in the economic sphere in the recent past . How has economic cooperation between the two countries deepened during your time ? <p> A : In the last few years , economic and commercial ties have deepened and have become the centre-piece of the India-Sri Lanka bilateral partnership . India has emerged as Sri Lanka 's largest trade partner , largest investor and the biggest source of tourist inflow into the country . Despite global headwinds , Sri Lanka 's exports to India have grown year on year . We have resumed the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement ( ETCA ) negotiations , interactions between our trade and industry bodies are closer and more frequent . Indian companies are keen on Sri Lanka and know that Sri Lanka is open for business . There have been some big ticket investments coming in from India , such as the West Container Terminal , solar and wind project in Mannarand Pooneryn of about 500 MW , and the ITC Ratnadeepa Project at Galle Face . Amongst the various notable achievements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to mention specifically the signing of the lease agreements for the Trincomalee Tank Farms which had been pending for 20 years and cooperation in renewable energy projects . <p> Q Several connectivity initiatives were announced during the visit of President Ranil Wickremesinghe to India in July 2023 . Where do we stand on these initiatives ? <p> A : The India-Sri Lanka Economic Partnership Vision jointly adopted during the visit of the President of Sri Lanka to India in July 2023 is centred on connectivity . Both Governments are working together to transform this vision into reality . As a result , the ferry service between Nagapattinam and Kankesanthurai was launched in October 2023 . Productive discussions have been held between the Governments on the connectivity corridor , multi-product pipeline and power grid connectivity . For greater digital connectivity , Lanka Pay from Sri Lanka and NIPL from India will soon be ready to launch a QR based payment system in Sri Lanka benefitting Indian and Sri Lankan tourists . <p> Q What happened to the India-Sri Lanka ferry service ? <p> A : Given the high demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the leadership for an uninterrupted ferry service , both governments are taking steps to select private entities for the operation of the **27;362;TOOLONG ferry service . Similarly , discussions are being held to develop relevant infrastructure at Rameswaram and Talaimannar for commencing ferry services suspended for the last four decades . <p> Q What measures could be adopted to address the on-going fishermen issue , despite attempts being made to resolve the matter for decades ? <p> A : India remains committed to resolve the persistent fishermen issue to our mutual satisfaction . As livelihoods of fishermen on both sides are involved , it has to be addressed in a humanitarian manner with the involvement of all stakeholders including the fishermen communities on both sides . The Government of India has adopted a multipronged approach to resolve the issue , including various initiatives for Indian fishermen to switch over to deep sea fishing . Further , pending the long-lasting solution , India is striving to bring benefits of scientific research and expertise for the commercially sustainable development of fisheries in Sri Lanka so that the benefits can directly reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a perception in Sri Lanka that the implementation period of Indian projects in Sri Lanka is considerably long . Your thoughts ? <p> A : Let me share with your readers that India 's development partnership portfolio with Sri Lanka stands at over US $ 5 billion , including both grants and Lines of Credit . The Indian government 's developmental assistance projects are entirely based on the priorities set out by the government and the people of Sri Lanka . These projects are diverse , both in terms of their subject areas and geographical reach . India is perhaps the only bilateral partner with development projects in each of Sri Lanka 's 25 districts . India 's projects have been well received for their tangible impact on people 's lives , their transparent approach and their implementation in a manner that supports local economies . The assistance specifically focuses on capacity-building , human resources development , uplifting of weaker sections as well as infrastructure development . <p> It is noteworthy that despite disruptions owing to the COVID-19 pandemic and the economic crises , Indian government-assisted development projects continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upgrading of the Railway Line from Maho to Omanthai , the supply of buses for public transport , the supply of SUVs to the Ministry of Public Security . And all this is while India assisted Sri Lanka with USD 4 billion , with no strings attached , to ensure that the people of Sri Lanka could face the challenges that had arisen . Additionally , I would like to underline that GOI-assisted projects are for the people of Sri Lanka and by the people of Sri Lanka . They are implemented via the Sri Lankan government 's concerned line Ministries and local agencies . As and when the concerned Ministries revise the needs and accordingly the scope of the project , we try to quickly adapt and deliver as swiftly as possible in response to the evolving requirements . <p> Q We see that India has been undertaking several steps to deepen the ties in the sphere of Buddhism . Could you elaborate further on some of these steps ? <p> A : Buddhism imparts an ever present vibrancy to the India-Sri Lanka relationship . Prime Minister Modi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibited the same . In 2015 , he visited the Jaya Sri Mahabodhi temple . In 2017 , he was the Chief Guest at the UN Vesak Day celebrations in Colombo . In the Virtual Summit in 2020 , he announced a US $ 15 million grant of assistance for the protection and promotion of Buddhist ties between our two countries . We recently signed an MOU with US $ 10 million for solar electrification of temples in Sri Lanka under this grant . Some other recent steps taken to deepen our ties in the sphere of Buddhism include exposition of the venerated relics of Lord Buddha from Kapilawasthu in Sri Lanka , and the exposition of relics from the Waskaduwe Vihara in India in October 2021 . The inaugural flight to the Kushinagar Airport in India was from Sri Lanka . India has organised special pilgrimage trips for Sri Lankan Armed Forces personnel and their families to Bodh Gaya . <p> A : Well , the approach to our defence ties with Sri Lanka is premised on India 's philosophy of Vasudaiva Kutumbakam , the world is one family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by our policy of " Neighbourhood First " . Just as it is natural for us to ensure that our efforts for peace , prosperity and progress be for the region , we also seek to ensure that the region remains secure . This security depends upon working together as partners to face both conventional and non-conventional common challenges . Sri Lanka is India 's closest maritime neighbour and a key partner in the Indian Ocean domain . The engagement with Sri Lanka in the defence and security segments is all-encompassing , cutting across the supply of military equipment , joint exercises , high level visits , the deployment of Indian instructors and training teams , staff talks , goodwill visits , etc . In fact , you would like to recall that the Indian Naval Submarine , " Vagir " made its maiden port of call to Colombo earlier this year . Thousands of people including school children , scouts , guides , members of the NCC as well as officers from the Sri Lanka Navy and their family members visited the Submarine , which became famous as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trust which continues to be the focal objective of our defence and security cooperation , placing peace , progress and the prosperity of our peoples always at the first place . Maintaining regional stability , curbing smuggling networks and preventing terrorism and extremist threats in the maritime neighbourhood are common priorities spurring the deepening of naval cooperation . Regional security cooperation initiatives such as the Colombo Security Conclave have also contributed to joint preparedness . Maritime information exchange arrangements are also enabling prompt shared action against illegal activities in the Indian Ocean region . To sum up , actually we see the security of India and Sri Lanka as mutual and indivisible . India is secure when Sri Lanka is secure . <p> Q India offers numerous scholarships to students and training opportunities to civilians and military personnel . Could you please shed more light on these schemes and their benefits ? <p> A : Correct . India offers over 700 scholarships for students across school level , undergraduate , masters and research programmes . More than 200 of these are fully paid scholarships and fellowships for students to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 402 fully-funded slots annually under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation ( ITEC ) Program to officials in the Sri Lankan government and also to other citizens . ITEC offers short term training programs in technical and professional disciplines to enhance skill sets and employability . On the defence side , more than 1200 personnel across the army , navy and air force are trained in India each year . Not sure if you know , more than 50 percent of the total defence training slots offered by India are reserved for personnel from Sri Lanka . It is the training programmes that help deepen the connectivity between the youth of our countries . It is these young minds that will chart the path forward for our countries , and the relationship . <p> Q How does India view Sri Lanka 's overall approach to ties with China ? Is security an important concern in this regard ? <p> A : India 's relationship with Sri Lanka stands on its own and does n't depend on third party countries . Sri Lanka 's relations with any third party country are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's relationship with Sri Lanka -- which is sui generis .

@@104362240 <h> CB Governor makes sense of what predictability is for those who complain of its lack <p> Says predictability is n't what people think it is , rather it is the price stability <p> Applauds people who endured hardships to achieve what is possible today in an end-of-year lecture <p> Issues dire warning to those who ponder backtracking from the reform process <p> Central Bank largely credited for conquering runaway prices at record time <p> For businesses and investors consistently concerned about the lack of predictability in tax rates and interest rates , Central Bank Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe had a straightforward <p> Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe <p> response -- what they perceive as predictability may not align with reality . During a public lecture last Friday aptly themed ' ' Sri Lanka 's Forward March Looking Past The Economic Crisis , ' Dr. Weerasinghe said he often hears businesses complaining about the uncertainty regarding increasing tax rates and the fluctuating direction of interest rates . <p> The seasoned economist clarified that predictability in the economy does n't align with the perceptions of most businessmen and investors . Instead , it lies in maintaining stability in prices . In other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 6 percent range for the next 10 years is what guarantees predictability . " What many people and industrialists say is that our policies are not predictable . They complain about the constantly changing tax rates , exchange rates and interest rates and ask how they can invest in such an environment , " Dr. Weerasinghe said . <p> " My argument is that , that is not what predictability is . What we need to have instead is stable inflation . Predictable inflation is what predictability is all about . If you can say with certainty that the inflation will remain at around 4 to 5 percent in the next 10 years , that is where the policy predictability lies , " he added . However , he said in order to maintain price stability which is the bedrock of an economy and the primary objective of any Central Bank , policy makers may have to tweak the tax rates , exchange rate , interest rates and other elements from time-to-time as nowhere in the world that all these policies stay still for many years . <p> Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curbing runaway inflation in Sri Lanka and reducing it to single-digit levels from nearly 70 percent in September of last year . The headline inflation in November came in at 3.4 percent from a year ago , according to the Colombo Consumer Price Index , the Central Bank 's preferred inflation gauge . The Central Bank has projected medium-term inflation to hover around 5 percent , driven by the dissipation of base effects from last year and the anticipated impact of the increased Value-Added Tax rate starting from January next year . While inflation has slowed and stays at benign levels , the prices continue to remain at sharply elevated levels amid sharp depreciation of the currency and higher taxes . <p> Inflation measures the rate of increase in the prices of a basket of goods and services in an economy compared to levels from a year ago . A decrease in inflation indicates that prices are still rising , although at a slower pace than before , rather than the prices themselves retracting from previous levels . Therefore , in order to re-establish the economic wellbeing of the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last two years due to the red-hot inflation , Dr. Weerasinghe said the country needs to grow at least by between 4 to 5 percent annually for a sustained period . He stressed that tough and painful policy reforms that are currently being implemented are a necessary bitter pill to restore stability and restart recovery towards achieving an accelerated growth . <p> He thus made it an opportunity to applaud the people who endured enormous hardships during this painful reform period to bring the economy to where it is today . While Dr. Weerasinghe was delivering his lecture last Friday , the Census and Statistics Department released Sri Lanka 's third quarter GDP data which showed a 1.6 percent growth , ending the nearly two year-long contraction , kindling hopes that the country could now look past the worst . However , he emphasised that this does n't mean everything is perfect , as there is still much work to be done in areas such as foreign debt restructuring to achieve a sustainable level of foreign debt . <p> Most importantly , staying committed to the reform programme in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme is crucial , he highlighted . Sidestepping , he warned , would bring disastrous outcomes far worse than what the country went through . " We may not survive the next crash , " he cautioned , issuing a dire warning to those who might be contemplating on deviating from the reform agenda under a future government .
