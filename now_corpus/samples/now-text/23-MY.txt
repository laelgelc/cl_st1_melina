" If I have to teach someone who claims to be a startup , about technology , then they are in the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Add to this the roughly 60 startups 1337 Ventures has invested in and the many corporates and public sector agencies that have engaged Bikesh to help them run various startup and innovation focused programs , and you begin to appreciate his impact . <p> But it is not a journey that he would have preferred to have taken . <p> Like most startup founders , the game plan has not worked out as smooth and quick as envisioned <p> " The idea when I started in 2012 , was to run an accelerator , and take small bets on those that we liked , using the profits generated from my training company , iTrain . Simple right ? " <p> Instead , in those early years , he was coming across founders who were simply not ready to handle the cold and hard reality of building a startup , both before and after raising funding , nor in telling their story when applying for government grants , or when pitching to investors not short of options to bet their money on . <p> Alpha Startups pre-accelerator , solving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government to fill the gap , Bikesh launched his own intervention , the Alpha Startups pre-accelerator program ( the founder quoted in the beginning of this article , is an alum ) . The 10 day course is spread over 5 weeks with assignments that have to be done , or else one is kicked off the program . <p> Run as a physical program , the pandemic became the jolt that Bikesh needed to really scale its impact . <p> " I was actually already thinking in 2019 that this was getting tiring and discussing with the team of the possibility to move it online . And then the pandemic hit and we did and it was open to anyone in the world since location did not matter anymore . " <p> But it was still rough going as old habits die hard , even for a seasoned investor and mentor like Bikesh who constantly exhorts founders to change and adapt . <p> " We broke our backs when we moved Alpha Startups online because we were still running it like it was physical , meaning we spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did their assignments etc . It was just wrong , " he admits . <p> Out of this painful experience came the realization however that it was time to adopt a survival of the fittest mentality . " I think Malaysia is at the stage where we have good founders and knowhow . So , Alpha Startups , since mid 2020 is now an online only pre-accelerator program that anyone can go through and pick any of the modules they want to learn . And , when they are ready , they can join our weekly Tuesday pitch sessions , " says Bikesh . <p> Teaching in his DNA , and , getting suspended <p> If you 're wondering why Bikesh wanted to run an accelerator before making his startup bets , well , that 's because he has teaching in his DNA . <p> A computer science graduate ( external program ) from Universiti Sains Malaysia in 2004 , Bikesh , who taught himself coding in his early teens thanks to a PC his dad bought him , had a sweet side gig helping final year diploma and degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entry systems for small business . He had set up a company with a course mate , Adrian Lim , who pursued a corporate path after graduating and today is Partner at a Big 4 firm in Kuala Lumpur . <p> " This was when I realized I had a natural flair for breaking down problems and showing people how to get things done . This led to me launching iTrain in 2005 after graduating , with Eric Ku , a fellow course mate who used to work in the computer lab . " The focus initially was on teaching Microsoft based programmes before gradually expanding to over 20 different programs today that range from the technical to digital marketing to design thinking . <p> And yes , Bikesh got suspended once from using the lab as he refused a login access , preferring to bypass his way in . Bypass he did , suspended he was , from the lab . " I was a trouble maker la , " he laughs . <p> Alpha pre-accelerator was no magic bullet <p> But Alpha Startups was no magic bullet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bikesh a better pool of startups to invest in , but he quickly realized that just cutting that first cheque of RM50,000 and hoping his fledgling investments could go on to raise more money to give themselves a chance to meet their potential , was not working . <p> And having made around 60 investments over the past 10 years of which 1/3 have failed , there have been lessons aplenty over the years . <p> Highlighting the key ones , he acknowledges the mistake of the early days investing in tech founders who can build the product . It was a comfortable choice for him , coming from a tech background himself . " But what we learnt is that if you ca n't sell it , then what 's the point , " he says . He started investing in teams that were not just core tech but had business skills as well . <p> The second key lesson was the importance of having access to capital to let you ride out the inevitable rough patches and sustain for the long haul . " We had to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right for our investees , " he says . <p> Especially in the early years , he saw promising companies he invested in , close down because they could not sustain themselves long enough to turn the corner or raise follow-on funding . " We did not have the access ( to corporates ) , angel network , nor Equity Crowd Funding then . And we did n't have the means to take more risk ourselves , " he said . Sometimes , all they needed was a soft loan to tide them over a rough patch , " but I was n't able to help them , " he says , ruefully . <p> Bikesh saw good companies he invested in fail because they could not raise quick funds or get loans to tide them over unforeseen rough patches . 2019 however , brought a change . The steady growth of 1337 Ventures had created greater access to funding -- he had built an Angel Club ( stands at over 250 angels from three countries and has done 20 investments ) and was licensed to run an Equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emergency loans from 1337 Ventures itself . " We would give them a 0% loan that they can later pay back or convert it to equity . " This emergency financial lifeline came in especially handy during the pandemic . <p> Pandemic spotlights unique value proposition of 1337 Ventures <p> The pandemic also brought into sharp focus , the strategic value that 1337 Ventures brought to the table for the startups it invests in and the corporates that regularly seek Bikesh 's help around their innovation goals . His latest collaboration is with RHB Bank which will launch an ASEAN accelerator this month . <p> Working with corporate partners over the past eight years , Bikesh saw the mismatch , akin to magnets with like poles repelling each other . Startups , with unproven technology and no corporate reference customer and flimsy financials just can not meet the minimum hygiene levels demanded of corporate vendor compliance . It was a story Bikesh saw being played over and over . <p> But the pandemic accelerated the urgency for corporate innovation , digitization with corporates wanting to work with startups , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could survive long enough to deliver . " But they trusted me , " says Bikesh , and asked for his help to identify who could be the right partners . <p> To be clear , Bikesh was not favoring startups he had invested in when making this match . <p> But this is where all those founders that came through Alpha Startups gave Bikesh a good picture of what solutions were in the market and he was able to match startups to corporates to run proof of concepts ( POCs ) to ensure the solutions could solve corporate problems . <p> This still was n't enough to solve the hurdle of vendor compliance . But , Bikesh now has the inside track on which startups are able to deliver successful POCs and go on to win jobs from the corporates . <p> " This gives me access to startups that have shortcuts to growth via these corporate partnerships , " he says , adding , " It also makes it easier for me to go to VCs and angel investors to invite them to invest with me into these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distribution channel and corporate customer base to work with . " <p> An investment made into these startups by 1337 Ventures thus becomes the green light for the corporates to engage with startups as fear over their sustainability recedes . <p> With the country aspiring to create five unicorns by 2025 , Bikesh strongly believes that Malaysian corporates have to play a key role here . " You can not leave this to chance . You need a formula and I think this is the way to build unicorns . If any startup wants to have a fighting chance to build something at scale , it has to be with our local giants , right ? They have the customer base that is going to get you in the door , that allows you to build a track record that you then take regional . " <p> The search for mini-me 's <p> While Bikesh feels the Malaysian startup ecosystem has come a long way since he joined it a decade ago , the gap in early stage funding still exists , in his opinion . " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if you do n't have the funnel , then what 's the point ? " <p> Which is why he is staying in the early stage funding level and is excited to launch a US$3.4 million ( RM15 million ) founders fund in 1Q23 that will see successful tech founders as investors and with Suresh Thiru ( pic ) , a former co-founder of JobStreet as the co-GP ( General Partner ) of the 1337 Alpha Fund 1 . <p> It will cut cheques starting at RM50,000 , to RM150,000 and up to RM500,000 to be lead investor in a pre-Series A round . " Startups never had that level of clarity to access funding , until now , with us , " he says . " Keep your eyes on the prize and on building an amazing product . Let us take care of the funding path in the early stages up to pre-Series A , " he says , with the possibility of going up to Series A eventually . <p> The target is to invest RM5 million a year for three years . His pitch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mini-me 's , join me to make this happen . " <p> But Bikesh expects more than just funding . Well aware of the importance of mentors , his investors will have to act as mentors as well , with a special incentive set aside for those who show higher commitment in mentoring and guiding the startups invested in . <p> Purpose over passion <p> Identifying a sense of purpose as being the most important characteristic of founders who have successfully raised funding versus those who failed to , Bikesh surprises himself when he realizes this characteristic applies to him as well over the period he has built 1337 Ventures . <p> Surprised at the question on his key learnings , he tries deflection first . " I learnt I had no time to pause and reflect on my 10 year journey . " Getting serious , he reflects , " I have learned that it 's not easy to build something of this magnitude . It 's hard , especially when you do n't have enough people that have done it here . How do you even do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> This lack of mentors to guide him when he started is one of the things he reflects most on . " I wonder where I would be today , what I could have achieved if I had a mentor back then , " he muses . <p> He could n't go into any program , there were no grants to get one started and there was no one to teach you the shortcuts to bypass stuff and avoid falling on your face . To avoid contracts that you did n't know how to look at , causing you to lose money , time and hope . <p> Today , Bikesh has become that mentor that he wished he had , that resource person who can shorten your journey , that battle hardened founder who has absorbed all the arrows , so that you do n't have to . " So , that 's my give back to the ecosystem . I have access . I know the corporates , the CEOs , I have their trust . And , it 's easy for me to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't have access , " he says .

@@96244236 <p> Touch ' n Go has officially launched its new Enhanced Touch ' n Go Card , which can now be purchased either at selected retail locations nationwide or via the TNG eWallet app . The card , which comes in a minimalist pink and blue gradient design , was initially offered for sale at the company 's official outlet last week and was even scalped at nearly double the price compared to retail . <p> Utilising near-field communication ( NFC ) for mobile reloads , the Enhanced card is priced at the same RM10 as the original Touch ' n Go cards , although LRT and MRT stations have recently started selling the old cards for RM5 plus a RM10 top-up . Ordering via the eWallet app incurs a RM5 shipping fee and a two-card limit for each purchase ; while you can make multiple purchases , each one will come with its own shipping fee . There 's no limit on physical over-the-counter purchases . <p> UPDATE:Some users ( including a few in our team ) have experienced orders disappearing on the eWallet app , despite payments going through . Touch ' n Go says it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> The Enhanced version essentially enables top-ups to be made via an NFC-enabled smartphone -- which is offered on most smartphones today , including iPhones -- and the eWallet app , bypassing physical reload locations . The new card also comes with improved encryption for better safety , the company says . <p> Each new card needs to be linked to the app by holding the card to the back of your phone for five seconds , after which you may use the app to check their balance or perform reloads , again by holding your card to your phone . As Touch ' n Go points out , you are still limited to a maximum of five TNG cards that can be linked to your app , including Enhanced versions . <p> As with the old cards , the credit balance on the Enhanced variant is still separate from the eWallet ( not combined ) , although it too can be linked to the eWallet using the PayDirect function . Non-PayDirect transactions will still deduct money from the card 's balance . <p> " We 're so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressing the most common pain point for users of our cards -- reload inconvenience . With this enhanced card offering , our users can now choose to obtain a card that they can reload anytime or anywhere from their Touch ' n Go eWallet app on their mobile phones . There will also be no reload surcharges levied for the use of this service , " said group CEO Effendy Shahul Hamid . <p> Although physical reloads have been made largely obsolete for road users thanks to the PayDirect function , the new Enhanced card will still be useful on the North-South Highway ( which , strangely enough , does not support PayDirect ) and at a vast majority of parking lots ( only a handful of malls currently utilise PayDirect for parking payments ) . <p> Hopefully , this means there will be fewer instances of cars being parked up at tolls because drivers need to walk out to the reload counter . Of course , public transport users will also benefit from the Enhanced card , as buses and trains still deduct from the card 's balance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upgraded cards is limited due to the global chip shortage and TNG expects demand to be high , so stocks may run out quickly .

Making government information and practices open to public inspection should give everyone equal access to government spending , procedures and contracts , " he said . <p> He noted that a FOI Act can also compel public officials to carry out their functions and exercise their discretion within the limits set under the law , as such discretionary power would be " prone to abuse " if the criteria -- for how the discretion is applied -- is not disclosed to the public . <p> As a whole , he said access to information would help the public hold public authorities accountable for their actions , and encourage better informed and more productive debates , while also helping in public interest litigation or court cases . <p> " Access to official information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public sector bodies are seen as being open , " he said . <p> Chin pointed out that Malaysia , however , currently has the Official Secrets Act ( OSA ) 1972 , which generally disallows the disclosure of any classified information for any purpose -- however noble the intention is -- unless it is declassified by the proper authority . <p> Chin noted that the OSA was initially introduced to fight any attempt by civil servants to carry out spying , but said this law was amended in 1986 to widen its scope to criminalise all types of communication of official secrets . <p> He said the OSA in Malaysia has " glaring " departures from the original spirit of the UK law it was modelled after , pointing out that the UK version requires the prosecution to prove certain ingredients for the offence of unauthorised disclosure while the Malaysian version applies indiscriminately to anyone involved in the chain of communication of classified information . <p> He noted that the OSA " covers all types of disclosure of any classified document , no matter how trivial or unrelated it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and also creates a " strict liability offence " under Section 8 where the intention of the accused person is irrelevant . <p> He noted that the OSA 's Section 16(3) also presumes that unlawful communication of classified information was done for purposes prejudicial to national interest unless proven otherwise , saying this is not in line with criminal justice as the prosecution should have the burden to prove the communication is damaging to the national interest . <p> He said the OSA 's Section 16A states that a certificate from a minister or public officer in charge which certifies certain information as official secret will be conclusive evidence -- that the information is an official secret -- and that this shall not be questioned in any court . <p> Stopping the courts from reviewing such certificates may lead to " arbitrary " use of Section 16A due to the lack of checks and balances , he said , noting in comparison that such a ministerial certificate in the UK is subject to judicial review by the courts . <p> Among other things , Chin said public interest litigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' review of administrative actions -- can help promote good governance . <p> With some judges taking a strict and narrow approach and other judges a more liberal and less rigid approach in deciding whether one has legal standing to bring a public interest case to court , Chin said the rules on locus standi or legal standing should be relaxed to allow public interest cases to be filed on behalf of others . <p> " Public interest litigation plays a critical role to maintain the rule of law and enhance access to justice for disadvantaged groups under public law . <p> " Consequently , the court should relax further the rules on locus standi in public law to permit any public or interested party acting bona fide with a view to vindicating the cause of justice to make application on behalf of others or a particular class of people , if that other person or class of people can not come to court to get relief for some reason , " he said , noting there would be a gap in public law if public interest litigation is prevented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

He did not name these political figures . <p> " Political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest -- directly encroaches upon the functions and duties of the attorney-general and the court , " he said , describing the unconstitutionality of such behaviour as leading to a " grievous erosion of justice " and attacking the integrity of the attorney-general and judiciary . <p> Chin said : " SLS condemns any act of politicians seeking for an intervention by the prime minister in an ongoing matter before the judiciary at all material points . " <p> " It is pertinent to note that there have been instances in the past where politicians have been admonished , some even charged for such actions to interfere as these actions are considered abuse of power and a misfeasance of public duties , " he added . <p> Chin said politicians are actually attacking the courts ' independence when they call for interference in the courts . <p> " The acts of politicians in recent history openly discussing calls for interfering with the judiciary in legal actions erodes faith in the judiciary and are deeply damaging to the rule of law in Malaysia . This sort of behaviour is tantamount to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Politicians should not be making scurrilous remarks which only serve to perpetuate misgivings and suspicion amongst the people towards our judiciary . <p> " The time has come for politicians to understand their roles in perpetuating and strengthening the rule of law including the doctrine of separation of powers instead of turning Malaysia into a legal pariah where rule of law is not sacrosanct whenever they utter unjustifiable statements , " he said . <p> Chin said the judges ' duties are to dispense justice according to the law and not according to " individuals or political parties " . <p> Having noted that Malaysia values the separation of powers between the executive , legislative and judicial branches of government as they provide checks and balances against each other , Chin highlighted the importance of judges being able to independently exercise their powers " without any intrusion from individuals , entities or political parties " . <p> Chin said SLS had on June 17 , 2022 held its first-ever peaceful march named the " Walk for Justice " with over 100 Sabah lawyers from the Damai Community Hall to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Walk for Judicial Independence in support of the judiciary which was facing relentless attacks . <p> Chin made these remarks in his speech at the Opening of the Legal Year ( OLY ) 2023 of the High Court in Sabah and Sarawak which was held in Miri , Sarawak today .

The AAS did not specify what these two provisions should be amended to instead . <p> The other two proposed changes are to the Federal Constitution 's Article 122B " to remove the privilege of the prime minister in advising the Yang di-Pertuan Agong on appointment of judges to the Federal Court , Court of Appeal and High Court " , and to " improve the composition " of the JAC upon feedback from stakeholders including the attorney-general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JAC 's composition to be reflective of Malaysian society . <p> A copy of Gurvir 's speech was also made available to Malay Mail . <p> The SLS and AAS are counterparts in Sabah and Sarawak to the Malaysian Bar which is a professional body representing lawyers in Peninsular Malaysia and the federal territories . <p> Currently , the JAC Act 's Section 5(1) states that the JAC is to have nine members , including Malaysia 's four top-ranking judges , a Federal Court judge appointed by the prime minister , with the remaining four to be appointed by the prime minister -- after consulting the Malaysian Bar , AAS , SLS , attorney-general and state attorney-general . <p> The JAC 's functions include selecting those who are qualified to be judges for the prime minister 's consideration . <p> But after the JAC goes through the process of selecting suitable candidates for judges and submitting its report to the prime minister , the prime minister can request for two more names to be selected and recommended to him for his consideration when it comes to the top four judicial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Court of Appeal level , based on the existing JAC Act . <p> After accepting any of the recommended candidates , the prime minister then advises the Yang di-Pertuan Agong over their appointments to the positions . <p> The Institutional Reforms Committee ( IRC ) in 2018 had said it planned to recommend changes to the JAC 's composition and judge selection process , pointing out that the submission of names to the prime minister and his right to request more names in a way enables him to reject candidates . <p> In November last year in conjunction with his chairing of the 260th meeting of the Conference of Rulers , the Negri Sembilan Ruler proposed the removal of the prime minister 's role in appointing the five members of the JAC and to let the Malaysian Bar , AAS , SLS and parliamentary select committee made such appointments instead . -- Malay Mail

@@96897235 <p> Involving youth in agriculture would require certainly more than just providing workshops , consultancy or grants . <p> ALTHOUGH food security received considerable emphasis in Budget 2023 , it made no specific mentioning of connecting youth with agriculture . The Young Agropreneur Programme ( Program Agropreneur Muda , or PAM for short ) , launched in 2014 to supplement the National Agrofood Policy 2011-2020 ( NAP1.0 ) in closing the gap of youth participation in the agro sector , appears to be another programme that could have been worked better towards achieving the desired outcomes and impacts for the nation . <p> The emphasis on youth participation in agro sector sounded even louder in National Agrofood Policy 2021-2025 ( NAP2.0 ) among its set of objectives , action plans and key indicators . Although the specific mentioning of PAM may not be found in NAP2.0 , its emphasis on young entrepreneurs indicate that a similar program will continue to be implemented under the 12th Malaysia Plan ( 12MP ) ( 2021-2025 ) . <p> Indirect support exists such as funds that may be allocated to banks such as AgroBank to encourage business venture by youths via financing facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2023 should have considered specific allocations so that youth-related initiatives under NAP2.0 could be more directly supported.While continuation of a programme does not necessarily mean prior success , continuous emphasis does indicate that the need remains relevant -- even more so if prior targets were not achieved . Thus , it is important to look back and evaluate the current status so that we can make changes towards achieving the intended targets . <p> As per what EMIR Research insistently advocates , an impactful programme must be designed by applying **27;939;TOOLONG model ( Figure 1 ) . In other words , when policymakers embark on an initiative , they must convince us , the public , that there is a solid basis in the form of empirical evidence and an established body of scientific knowledge to believe that spinning out an amount of resources on specific outputs will result in the desired outcomes and intergenerational impacts . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Speaking of the PAM , the desired immediate outcome for this programme is the increased share of youth participation in the agro sector and the number of successful entrepreneurs whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern technology . <p> Consecutively , these outcomes are expected to bring greater intergenerational impacts on Malaysians in form of greater Food Security as well as other spillover effects such as more developed and complex industry ( as application of modern technologies would naturally boost demand for its local production ) , reduced food prices and increased disposable income for an average Malaysian consumer ( which should stimulate demand for other products and , therefore , overall GDP growth ) , and reduced overall unemployment and specifically youth unemployment . However , unfortunately , after almost a decade of PAM , Malaysia faces exactly the opposite -- great food insecurity ( food security crisis even ) , shrinking overall industry in terms of its breadth and depth , increasing unemployment and specifically youth unemployment and underemployment , and recent shrinking middle class and increasing B40 ( which many economists and policymakers speculate could even be said to be B60 by now ) . <p> This is not surprising , because it is also difficult to find in official government documents by the relevant agencies the detailed outcomes and impact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outputs only . Even more immediate outcomes such as number of young entrepreneurs , who , as a result of this programme has started a successful business and increased their income . The intended outcome of increased share of youth participation in the agriculture industry is also not seen . <p> However , there are some information on the number of those who have been registered for the programme over the years , number of those who have been given training/consultancy , number of workshops conducted , number of the grants disbursed -- all of these are only inputs and outputs . <p> NAP2.0 document did not include such important outcome and impact statistics specifically regarding the PAM or similar programmes , and the lack of data on the outcome and impacts could be interpreted as a sign of poor uptake of the programme i.e. , results are insignificant . In fact , an adverse outcome is observed . NAP2.0 reports overall decrease in employment in agro sector and that limited youth participation in agro sector is acknowledged as a problem of the sector ( thus indirectly suggesting inefficiency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inputs , it has been reported that the PAM under the 11th Malaysia Plan and in support of NAP1.0 resulted in the approval of grants and loans worth RM126 million , and said to have helped 6,969 young agropreneurs in starting and growing their agricultural activities . However , we have not found more information to understand the outcomes and impacts of these expenditures and activities , aside from some anecdotal evidence of some success stories . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> On the other hand , there are several worrying indicators on the status of the issue i.e. , lack of youth workforce in the agro sector , by observing key facts and figures . As reported : <p> In 2015 , it was reported that only 15pc of the workforce in the agro sector were youths . Specifically , it was estimated that the youth participation in the agro-food sector was at 15pc of the number of members registered with the Board of Farmers ' Organisation . <p> In 2016 , only 4.2pc of tertiary graduates considered a career in agriculture . <p> In 2019 , around 10.6pc ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malaysia are part of the agricultural workforce . The agriculture workforce experienced a decline of 0.5pc compounded annual growth rate ( CAGR ) between 2010 and 2019 , at the backdrop of a 2.7pc increase in CAGR of the overall workforce in Malaysia . <p> There is a clear shift in interest from the workforce , resulting in the insufficient succession from the youth as a replacement for the existing generation of farmers causing the workforce in the agro sector to continue to decline . <p> There is also a poor perception of the agro-food sector . There is a prevailing perception among youths that the agriculture sector is a labor intensive sectors with low returns . <p> The PAM , like many other similar programmes , as a pure example of " Input-Output " culture prevailing appears to place the main emphasis on workshops , training , consultancy , and grant distribution which , as we already know well , are linked to producing workshop-preneurs , grant-preneurs and their likes instead of agro preneurs . Therefore , to ensure that public funds are spent properly the programmes need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcomes and impacts for the many . In fact , PAM originally intended to facilitate soft loans , ease land rent , and provide other facilitation needed . <p> In NAP2.0 , this is relatively more comprehensive and proactive . For example , the core policy strategy and action plan 3 under strategy 1 ( " Attract and Retain Young Talent " ) involve the rebranding of the agro-food sector with modern and smart agriculture , creating an optimum industrial workforce resource through graduate integration into the " real " work environment through internships and apprenticeships , targeted education and innovation competition , and the development of new management models to improve productivity . This is aligned with what EMIR Research mentioned in past articles in making agriculture " sexy " again . <p> As said , as far as mentioning all the right things and ensuring the latest buzz words and trends , Malaysia 's policy documents rarely fall too short . Our challenge is always implementation and sustainable execution . One of the greatest obstacles in ensuring a proper implementation is the absence of structural reforms therefore overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as specific intervention programmes continue to suffer from the governance problems such as corruption , inconsistency in policies and their implementation ( due to conflicting interests not necessary aligned with the national interests ) and potential leakages and mismanagements . <p> The are other existing and persistent issues to get the interest of the youths . As reported in NAP2.0 , there are : <p> Participation constraints for youth aggropreneurs . Strict regulations coupled with a less conducive environment results in low participation of young agropreneurs in the agro-food sector . Young agropreneurs also face the challenge of applying for loans . Other challenges include high start-up costs , cumbersome " red tape " or strict regulations preventing the entry of new agropreneurs as competitors in the market . <p> Increasing awareness and implementation of widespread mechanisation in the agro sector . Youths need to move up the talent supply chain as low-skilled , mechanical and repetitive labour work could be vastly automated . This is evident as despite the decrease in employment , it has been reported that the overall agrofood employee productivity increased from 2010 to 2020 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques through mechanisation and automation for food production activities . <p> Income and productivity non-competitiveness in the agro sector : It has been reported that the annual GDP per employee in the agriculture sector is RM63,345 , which is less than manufacturing ( RM121,944 ) and services ( RM82,488 ) . Furthermore , on average , agricultural workers earn low or uncertain income compared to the average national income . In 2018 , the average income for agricultural workers was reportedly RM1,865 , whereby the national average was RM3,087 . Additionally , the subsector saw the average monthly income decreased between 2015 and 2017 even though it saw an increase in prior years ( 2010 to 2015 ) , indicating a shrinking value generated in the industry . <p> Involving youth in agriculture would require certainly more than just providing workshops , consultancy or grants . To be able to effectively address such an issue the national agricultural policy should include at least the following initiatives/action plans : <p> Institutionalise the **27;968;TOOLONG framework as a solid basis for intra-ministerial / intra-agencies co-operations and interventions ; <p> Localise or redirect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food supply chains for critical-self-sufficient ( CSS ) items ( this is to protect local entrepreneurs from external supply-chain shocks ) ; <p> Create a single national supply chain management data platform for CSS-designated food items ( to eliminate the issue of the middleman and monopolies ) ; <p> Set the universities that have land as national flagship universities to spearhead research and collaboration with a focus on AgriTech , circular economy and regenerative agriculture principles ; <p> Ensure land availability for agricultural activities : limit land ownership while introducing rent ceiling and permanent rental contracts for small farmers ; <p> For the AgriFood flagship universities align key performance indicators with the number of research that reaches the commercial stage ; <p> Provide critical infrastructure and services for moving food around from farm to market ; <p> Ensure that children from the school or even from the kindergarten level are introduced to the concept of 4IR agriculture for them to learn that there is nothing 3D ( dirty , difficult , dangerous ) about modern agriculture but it is fascinating and exciting . This is what is successfully done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Singapore where government begins to inculcate change they want to see in society a few years down the road through curricula from kindergarten to universities . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Certainly , the future of the agriculture sector is the youth . Producing highly skilled food agri-techpreneurs at scale is one of the major trends among the countries that exhibit stellar performance in the Global Food Security Index . And this also includes taping into the pool of massive youth unemployment that Malaysia has . After all , Malaysia has massive youth unemployment and underemployment , vast unutilised/underutilised land ( and for modern farming , it does not necessarily need to be fertile land as modern farming can be done in polybags and a completely controlled environment ) and captive market demand ( our food import is massive every year ) . <p> All we need to do is too pull these key ingredients together into a sound strategy done right -- with the clearly set **27;997;TOOLONG links and metrics . <p> - Dr Rais Hussin and Dr Margarita Peredaryenko are part of the research team at EMIR Research , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on rigorous research .

One fresh from nearly two decades of MotoGP competition with not only the Riders ' , Team and Constructors ' title from MotoGP , but with the World Superbike championship crown as well . <p> The other , with a long racing heritage , freshly back in the paddock with not only the factory team but a newly formed satellite team as well . We are referring to Ducati and Aprilia , strutting their stuff at SIC with new racing machines , new aerodynamics packages and in some cases , new riders . <p> Francesco Bagnaia , Ducati Lenovo Team <p> As per last season , Ducati dominated the Winter Test grid with the factory and three satellite teams while Aprilia turned up with the Factory Racing team as well as the Cryptodata RNF Racing team . Speaking to RNF Racing Malaysian team principal Datuk Razlan Razali , he told paultan.org the Aprilia RS-GPs being ridden by Miguel Oliviera and Raul Fernandez are essentially from the last race @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some upgrades in terms of aerodynamics and some other parts but they are the same bikes as used by the factory team , " said Razlan .

Meanwhile , team mate Fernandez , also transferring over to RNF Racing from Tech 3 , posted a 1:58.710 , leaving the duo comfortably mid-pack in terms of timing . <p> The Aprilia factory team , having spent the first two days of Winter Test overshadowed by the satellite team , finally got their act together on day three , with Maverick Vinales posting a 1:58.03 while Aleix Espargaro came in sixth fastest on the day with a 1:58.307 . <p> Franco Morbidelli , Monster Energy Yamaha MotoGP <p> This was enough to make Vinales third fastest man on Sunday evening as proceedings drew to a close .

The other Japanese factory team , Monster Energy Yamaha MotoGP and running without the backup of a satellite team for the first since forever , could only manage a 1:58.943 from former world champion Fabio Quartararo . <p> It should be noted 20 of the 22 riders on the MotoGP grid this season posted sub 1:59 lap times , outliers being Takaaki Nakagami of LCR Honda Idemistu and Augusto Fernandez of GasGas Factory Racing Tech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The truth of it is Winter Test is more for the factories and riders , since test times are not reflective of racing season performance . <p> Fabio Di Giannantonio , Gresini Racing <p> However , the three days of testing at SIC did show many factories are taking aerodynamics seriously with lots of wing and spoiler shapes on display . As Aliex Espargaro said during the press conference , " we tried today two spoilers , one gave me more corner speed , the other made me very fast on the straight . If we can combine both then we will have a strong package this year . " <p> As it stands , despite Ducati being all conquering in 2022 , this year 's crop of riders are all showing confidence , despite Quartararo saying he has mixed feelings about his Yamaha YZR-M1 despite starting testing with new tyres , declaring the tyres " a disaster .

These half-distance races with half-points on offer will have no bearing on the starting grid for the main grand prix . <p> As for the race season which begins in Portimao , Portugal on March 23 , expect Bagnaia to fend off challengers for the world champion 's crown , with his strongest challenge coming from Bastianini . Based on form at Sepang , it can be expected Marini of VR46 might upset the apple cart , as well as spoilers from the likes of Maverick and the not to be ruled out Marquez . <p> Coming with diverse and extensive experience in heavy engineering , Mohan enjoys making anything with wheels go fast , especially motorcycles .

In Germany , the Polo starts from 20,830 Euros , while the Golf starts from 31,145 Euros , so they 're right in the sense that a production ID.2 would be priced around a specced up Polo . <p> Go one step up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts from 43,995 Euros , so 25,000 Euros is a significantly more affordable price point , making the ID.2 closer to being a true people 's EV . <p> The Volkswagen ID.2all Concept measures 4,050 mm long , 1,812 mm wide and 1,530 mm tall , with a wheelbase of 2,600 mm . The wheels on this concept are 20 inchers wrapped with 225/40R20 tyres . <p> Unlike the ID.3 , ID.4 and ID.5 which are all built on MEB but are rear wheel drive in their single motor forms , the ID.2 will be the first MEB vehicle that will have its single motor at the front . In its most specced up form , the ID.2 's motor will be able to output 226 PS , and have a range of up to 450 km on the WLTP cycle , but no battery kWh size has been mentioned so far . Volkswagen quotes a 10% to 80% charging time in approximately 20 minutes . The 0-100km/h sprint can be done in under 7 seconds , but top speed is limited to 160 km/h likely due to gearing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Golf in an electric future , and to make the connection to the iconic nameplate they say they have given the ID.2 a C-pillar design that is a throwback to the iconic Volkswagen Golf Mk1 . <p> Any Golf owners here ?

@@97567232 <p> There are a few nameplates in the car world that can be considered iconic . There 's Porsche 's 911 in the sports car world and BMW 3 Series in the premium compact segment . Japanese stalwarts Corolla and Civic are strong in Asia and North America , and the European equivalent of those is the Volkswagen Golf with over 35 million units sold since 1974 . <p> These models have grown to be household names and have come to define their segment over many generations , spanning decades . People love these cars and are loyal to them . Some pass on their affection for the marque to the next generation , which creates more new stories for the old names . <p> At the heritage corner of the paddock were a collection of Golfs starting from the Giugiaro-penned original Mk1 . In this gallery , you 'll see a clean Mk1 GTI , an Mk1 Cabriolet , an Mk2 GTI , a bright yellow Mk3 , my favourite Mk4 ( has to be in the boring yet perfect silver , like the Mk1 Audi TT ) and the Mk5 in GTI and R32 variants . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous generations ? While not accounted for in the official display , the car park was filled with the Mk6 and Mk7 Golfs ( mostly GTIs ) driven by VW club members and dealers , and the two most recent editions are a common sight on our roads , so they 're not terribly missed . <p> We 've enjoyed a couple of heritage displays throughout the years of attending launches of cars with famous nameplates , but this is easily the most diverse bunch I 've seen . Usually , stock or near-stock examples ( or stock-looking ones ; we do n't know what 's lurking beneath ) are chosen to best represent the original design , but that 's not the case here . <p> My guess is that perhaps , it 's hard to find stock old Golfs because most owners would have modded them to be more sporting -- it 's from this family that the original hot hatch came about after all . <p> As such , let 's enjoy this very real-life representation of the Golf family . Check out the lowered stance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my rims , are those Speedlines ? ) , the mega exhaust on the yellow Mk3 , the subtle ABT styling of the Mk4 and the Mk5 R32 in a rather unconventional look -- green body , Japanese alloys . <p> Having to do this post reminds me of the series we did on the Golf through the years , six years ago .

Technically great cars overall with very few weaknesses . <p> Keen to see some Mark 8 on the roads in KL soon .

Well done VW for sharing this heritage collection <p> Looking closely and these are all RHD models , Germany is LHD country so their heritage collection are prolly LHD models .

@@97567236 <p> After nearly four years and over 70,000 units on the road , the Proton X70 has finally received its first minor change ( MC ) , giving it mild styling tweaks and a new engine option to go with them . No , this is n't a facelift in the conventional sense , even though its twin , the Geely Boyue , has gone under the knife twice in China ( Boyue Pro/2022 Boyue and Boyue X ) since the Malaysian version was launched back in 2018 . <p> First , we 'll need to talk about pricing , which has been adjusted upwards . The 2022 X70 is available in five variants , starting from the 1.5 Standard at RM93,900 ( up RM4,000 ) and rising up to RM105,500 ( up RM4,500 ) for the 1.5 Executive . Making a return since it was dropped in 2020 is the Executive AWD retailing at RM111,300 , while the 1.5 Premium with most of the bells and whistles costs RM117,900 ( up RM4,800 ) . <p> The Premium X remains at the top of the lineup , now named simply the 1.8 Premium and costing RM6,000 more at RM121,800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sales and service tax ( SST ) exemption valid until the end of the month . A five-year , unlimited-mileage warranty and five times free labour for servicing comes as standard with every purchase , as before . <p> Even though there are n't any wholesale aesthetic upgrades , there 's still plenty of things to talk about here . There 's a new powertrain , after all , which is the main focus of the MC . So , let 's get straight to it . <p> X50 engine on most models , lower outputs but less weight <p> The engine is a known quantity , especially to owners of the smaller X50 . That 's because the 1.5 litre turbocharged three-cylinder engine has been carried over -- here , it 's offered exclusively in direct-injected TGDi form , but even this high-output version is slightly less powerful than the outgoing 1.8 litre four-pot . <p> Power is rated 7 PS lower at 177 PS at 5,500 rpm , but the key stat is torque , which has fallen some 45 Nm to 255 Nm , made between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be noticeable in everyday driving conditions because peak twist is made 250 rpm lower down , and the 43 kg saved by dropping one cylinder should also help make up some of the deficit . <p> We say some , because the new X70 takes three tenths of a second longer to get from zero to 100 km/h , accomplishing the century sprint in 9.8 seconds . On the plus side , the company is claiming a seven per cent improvement in fuel economy , which to most buyers will be a more important consideration . <p> Three-pot engines are n't exactly the last word in refinement , but the new mill , developed in collaboration between Geely and Volvo , gets a sound-insulating polyurethane engine cover to ensure the X70 's whisper-quiet driving experience remains undimmed . It 's also locally assembled for the first time , built at a new plant in Tanjung Malim -- ahead of it being offered in more Proton models in the future . <p> Click to enlarge <p> Buyers hankering for the older 1.8 litre turbo four-cylinder will be please to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned earlier , it will only be available in the most expensive variant . It produces the same 184 PS at 5,500 rpm and 300 Nm of torque between 1,750 and 4,000 rpm . <p> As before , models receive a seven-speed wet dual-clutch transmission , introduced on the locally-assembled CKD model back in 2020 . Another product of the Sino-Scandinavian collaboration , the gearbox has been retuned in the 1.5 litre models to suit the new engine but is untouched in the 1.8 Premium . <p> Drive is sent to the front wheels , although you can once again get all-wheel drive as an option , brought back in response to customer feedback -- particularly those in East Malaysia . It 's still limited to the mid-range Executive variant , however , meaning that the all-paw model misses out on the Premium 's all-important driver assistance features . More on that later . <p> Now that we 've gotten the sole big change out of the way , we can talk about the few aesthetic changes that have been added , which are little more than colour changes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the components that were previously matte grey ( the Infinite Weave grille bars , front bumper corner " rings " , rear number plate garnish and decorative rear skid plate ) are now finished in gloss black . <p> The sole exceptions are the chin spoiler at the front and the inserts for the air curtain inlets , which have been painted in a brighter matte silver . Meanwhile , the surrounds for those inserts are painted in gloss black instead of body colour , while the door mirrors are finished in metallic Quartz Black -- both of these have been carried over from last year 's SE . <p> Finally , there are the two new wheel designs , both lifted from the Chinese-market Boyue Pro . The intricate 19-inch alloys on the 1.5 and 1.8 Premium are familiar and come from the SE , but the 18-inch rollers for the Executive have not been seen in Malaysia before . The Standard , on the other hand , rides on the same silver 17s as before . <p> The changes are even more minor on the inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . The gently undulating dashboard , tall centre console , prominent grab handles and flat-bottomed steering wheel all remain , as do the standard-fit seven-inch instrument display and eight-inch infotainment touchscreen -- the latter hooked up to the Geely Key User Interface ( GKUI ) with " Hey Proton " voice control . <p> Stepping up to the 1.5 Premium adds a hands-free function for the tailgate and nets you brown Nappa leather upholstery , a power-adjustable passenger seat with " boss " switches , four auto up/down windows , additional voice control functions ( including for the windows ) and a nine-speaker Kenwood sound system . Just like the old Premium X , the 1.8 Premium gains a panoramic sunroof , but it also receives security window tint . <p> Safety-wise , the X70 comes as standard with six airbags and stability control ; as before , only the Premium models can be had with advanced driver assistance systems ( ADAS ) . The suite is unchanged and includes autonomous emergency braking , adaptive cruise control , lane departure warning , blind spot monitoring , door opening warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SUV continues to lag behind the X50 , which can be had with Level 2 semi-autonomous driving features such as lane centring assist . <p> As always , we have a spec-by-spec breakdown of the available kit , which is as follows : <p> The 2022 X70 is available in the same colours as before , with Snow White and Jet Grey offered across the lineup . Oddly , Armour Silver can be had on all but the Executive AWD , while Cinnamon Brown can be picked from the Executive AWD onward . Ruby Red and Space Grey are exclusive to the Premium variants . You can read our review here , and browse full specifications and equipment on CarBase.my . <p> After trying to pursue a career in product design , Jonathan Lee decided to make the sideways jump into the world of car journalism instead . He therefore appreciates the aesthetic appeal of a car , but for him , the driving experience is still second to none . <p> The design is so dated by now , such an eyesore . Proton resting on their laurels by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geely model 's already gone through significant changes is even more disgusting . <p> Beauty is in the eye of the beholder .. Metal sheet is superficial . The ckd came with a dct change , and this Mc comes with new engine . I do n't view these two as insignificant change . On the contrary much better than bumper or tailight change . And the sales number speak for itself <p> Aikon on Jun 07 , 2022 at 7:58 am I 'm guessing they could intro the 1.5 to supplement the 1.8 . Like the X50 which has 2 performance levels , the separation could be 1.5 for lower X70 variants and with a maybe slightly lower entry price too . The 1.8 could be reserved for top variants . <p> Abuhden . Are we also not part of the world facing global shortage &amp; inflation ? Oh waiii I remember u once said our car prices most expensip in the world but then Thai car prices even higher that ours so base ur logic Thailand must be on the Moon or Mars . Real stupido again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.8L Premium it is basically the same but discouraging others to purchase the later which is more expensive . Genuinely you should have included the 1.5L Hybrid option here in Malaysia while just removing the 1.8L altogether since the 1.5L is now proudly manufactured here in Malaysia and also using Petronas ( GF6A ) Engine Oil . <p> Also there may be False Advertising on your product presentation where you mention " Long Lifetime " namely 110,000km timing belt of the 1.5L compared to the almost no maintenance and also Long Lifetime of the timing chain in the 1.8L . <p> Friendly reminder that the 1.5L 1477cc TL3 177PS 255Nm engine configuration is now being replaced by the 1.5L 1499cc TL4 181PS 290Nm engine configuration in China ( see Binrui Cool ) . Not only does the new 1.5L TL4 benefit from the same 1401-1600cc road tax and 1401-1650cc car insurance brackets as the old 1.5L TL3 , but it also produces comparable power to the original 1.8L 1799cc TL4 184PS 300Nm engine configuration which sits at the more expensive 1601-1800cc road tax and 1651cc-2200cc car insurance brackets . Our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pre-facelift design whilst the Chinese Boyue has gone through several extensive facelifts ( Pro , X , ' 22 ) and is about to be replaced by an all-new 2nd generation ( FX11 ) ... <p> The new 1.5L TL4 engine is 4 cylinder whilst this TL3 in X70 is still the old 3 cylinder engine . Now Malaysia is the primary dumping ground of the Chinese old tech , but the rakyat thought it is new Volvo engine and still willing to pay the premium prices . Not to mention the design is of the 6 years old 1st gen one . Poor Malaysian . <p> Geely has launched a new 1.5T 4 cylinders engine producing 181ps and 290nm which is almost on par with the 1.8 output but lower road tax and lower fuel consumption . It is quite risky to buy the 3 cylinders X50 and X70 now because in another 2 or 3 years time Geely may phase out the 3 cylinders and fully replaced with 4 cylinders . The second hand value of 3 cylinders of X50 and X70 gon na be really horrible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 cylinders 1.5T in future ? Likely not since 4 cylinders 1.5 is in mass production in China now and 3 cylinders engine is less cost effective to be produced if quantity do n't justify . IMO 3 cylinders 1.5T may stop production in few years time . Otherwise it is just too expensive to spend money on R&amp;D on 4 cylinders but not fully utilised . <p> I though proton want to replace all x70 engine with 1.5 liter engine , now its look like they want to sell all the unsold 3 pot cylinder to us and make 1.8 liter more premium . So why the change ? Did they said 1.5 liter more advance/better than 1.8 liter ? <p> Hopefully Paultan.Org team do comparison video between this new model and older model . Putting down the improvement of the X70 in article like this does n't help much in telling comparison . Maybe a video side by side two new model and old model would distinguised which is new , which is not . To me , look like the same though.Thank You Paultan.Org <p> Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an assessment or correction so that Proton can make their car quality standards better than before ? Okay , a lot of people do n't like it , but is it because of our mentality that Proton is now slower to make new products ? Do n't they lose a lot of money because they produced models and end up losing money ( before working with Geely ) and again having to ask for a bailout from the government ? <p> I would be happier if " Minor Change " was more about improving quality than the existing " big changes " ( Ridiculous , after all it 's " minor " is not " major " , yet people think " MC " is " Major Change " ) , honestly Proton should be careful next time to make new Products , what segment which customers like and whether it can sell a lot . Hey , after all , the facelifted saga , iriz , and persona actually improve the quality of these models <p> They also have to increase revenue first before they will make a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebadge / rebage engineering from Geely ) and I hope that too ... <p> And the problem of spare parts , argh I 'm tired about this problem over and over again hahaha .... but like it or not , my suggestion , Proton should have to localize most of their components ( manufactured in Malaysia ) by 90% , and I hope this can fix the spare parts problem that has been facing for more than a year . Besides , the problem is that sending spare parts from China is definitely a complicated process , and as a result of Covid 19 ( Yeah , and China 's recent problem with Covid in Shanghai ) , logistics has fallen apart , not only Proton but also other car brands ... <p> Wow ... 2022 has been a tough year for Proton ... i hope one of the management 's of Proton read this comment ... so that they can improve themselves , and hope that next year they will be better than before

The fourth-generation TM model is available in 2.4 MPi 2WD petrol and 2.2 CRDi AWD diesel forms , both of which come in Executive and Premium variants . <p> Let 's start with the most important piece of information , pricing . As revealed earlier , the petrol models are priced at RM169,888 for the Executive variant and RM189,888 for the Premium , while the diesels retail at RM191,888 and RM211,888 respectively . All prices , valid until end-June , are on-the-road without insurance , inclusive of a five-year , unlimited-mileage warranty and three-year/50,000 km free servicing . <p> The variants are identical across both powertrain options , which include a 2.4 litre Theta II MPi naturally-aspirated petrol engine that delivers 172 PS at 6,000 rpm and 225 Nm of torque at 4,000 rpm . Power is sent to the front wheels via a six-speed automatic transmission . <p> The 2.2 litre R CRDi turbodiesel , meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 440 Nm from 1,750 to 2,750 rpm . It is mated to a new eight-speed automatic and Hyundai 's HTRAC variable all-wheel drive system capable of sending up to 35% of torque to the rear wheels ( 50% in Sport mode ) . <p> The new Santa Fe certainly cuts a distinctive figure , with a more assertive design compared to its handsome-but-milquetoast predecessor . At the front , there are dual-tier headlights that can now be found on other Hyundai SUVs like the Kona and Venue , with a slim row of LED daytime running lights up top and larger main units underneath . There 's also the brand 's latest Cascading Grille . <p> Along the side , you 'll find squared-off wheel arches accentuated by black cladding and prominent lines around it , while a simple character line stretches from the headlights to the wraparound two-piece tail lights . The indicators and reverse lights have been cast off into the bumper , where you 'll also find swathes of black plastic and a large silver protective guard . <p> Inside , there 's a sweeping three-tier dashboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the slim air vents in the middle and the rest of the switchgear down below .

@@97796232 <h> A card that punches its supposed weight-class . <p> It 's been a hot minute since AMD 's Radeon RX 7000 Series lineup made its debut and from our review of the RX 7900 XTX , we clearly saw the appeal of the card as an alternative to NVIDIA 's GeForce RTX 4080 , and rightly so .

It is still based on the same RDNA3 architecture , fabricated from TSMC 's 5nm process node . Instead of putting on its silicon eggs in one massive chip , much like NVIDIA 's Ada Lovelace design , the GPU core is also flanked by a handful of 6nm multi-chiplet design cores that aid and help take some of the load off the main core . <p> Of course , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower 2000MHz base clock and 2400MHz boost clock .

Again , the carbon copy terms comes into play here -- like the XTX , this card wears the same all-black cooler shroud from the front , along with the industrial-inspired backplate that could 've been taken off an excess piece of sheet metal , used in automobile manufacturing . <p> In true AMD fashion , you 'll find the red three-line accent located at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the heatsink 's fins individually , and right next to the dual 8-pin PCIe power ports . Yes , just like the XTX , the XT is also an exercise in performance-per-watt for Team Red , unlike the RTX 40 Series , which actually requires an entirely new 16-pin PCIe Gen5 port to run . <p> Unlike the XTX , however , the reference 7900 XT does n't actually have any RGB LED built into it , so if you 're one of those gamers that enjoy having rainbow vomit cycling just out of the corner of your eye , you may want to consider custom-cooled solutions for this GPU . If you are n't bothered by the allure of the 16.7 million colour spectrum and favour performance over aesthetics , then this card more than serve that purpose . <p> As for the ports on this 7900 XT , AMD has standardised it : one HDMI 2.1a port , two DisplayPort 2.1 with Ultra High Bit Rate ( UHBR ) of 13.5Gbps , meaning that this card is able to support 8K resolutions at refresh rates as high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is also a USB-C port that can also be used as a DisplayPort 2.1 port , as well as support for AV1 encoding and decoding . <h> Testbed <p> Then as now , my testbench remains the same as before . By that , I mean I am testing the 7900 XT with the Ryzen 9 7950X , 32GB DDR5-6000 RAM , and the same ASUS ROG Crosshair X670E Hero motherboard . Because the testbench is also AMD-based , it means I am able to take advantage of the chipmaker 's Smart Access Memory ( SAM ) technology . <p> For comparison 's sake , I will be listing the 7900 XT 's performance metrics alongside the 7900 XTX and the RTX 4080 FE , given that the card is technically supposed to be on par with the latter . <h> ADVERTISEMENT <h> Benchmarks <p> In the spirit of playing catch up , the 7900 XT shows that as powerful as this GPU is -- and really , it is powerful -- it is clearly on the ascending path of an incredibly steep hill of flagship dominance , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In nearly all tests , both synthetic and real-world , the card really feels as if it was comfortably settled with the idea of third place . <p> In 3DMark , the only time the 7900XT ever overtakes both the XTX and RTX 4080 was with the Fire Strike test , which is still an impressive feat in and of itself , but even then , it simply outpaced its own sibling by a mere 800 points average . In Unigine Superposition , the reality of it playing catch quickly sets in once again , and that continues throughout the real-world gaming benchmarking portion of this review . <p> Again , I say that the 7900 XT plays 3rd place in nearly all the titles on my list , but there are a handful of games where it overtakes the other two cards . Borderlands 3 , Control , and Deus Ex Mankind Divided ( DXMD ) , in this case , are the titles where the card actually shows a better average framerate in both 1440p and Full HD resolutions , and to my surprise , it actually outperformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same title , however , you can actually see how close it was in 1440p against its sibling , to the point that any difference is actually negligible . <p> In all fairness , however , the 7900 XT clearly is n't horrible in pumping out the framerate , not by any measure of the description . It 's important to remember that some of these titles are also ray-tracing capable and can be a little bias in the upscaling technology that supports it . Case in point , Cyberpunk 2077 is clearly more geared to take advantage of NVIDIA 's DLSS 2.0 Super Resolution and DLSS 3 technology , while older games like Watch Dogs Legion simply lack the support for AMD 's own FidelityFX Super Resolution ( FSR ) . Turn the feature off and run said titles through traditional rasterisations , and the framerates will very obviously and quickly shoot up . <h> Temperature And Power Consumption <p> As for the thermal management of the 7900 XT , it is a bit odd that the card had a slightly higher average idling temperature , especially since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When running at full whack , it certainly runs cooler but unfortunately , the RTX 4080 here still takes the crown for thermal efficiency . <p> Thermals notwithstanding , the situation appears to look the same for the 7900 XT when it comes to its performance-per-watt . When left alone , the card is pulling 25 watts than the XTX and RTX 4080 but again , draws less and even matches Team Green 's own card in power consumption when put to the task . <h> Conclusion <p> With a base SRP of US$899 ( RM4064 ) , the AMD Radeon RX 7900 XT is still a damn sight cheaper than the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4080 and despite its expectedly lower-tier performance metrics versus its green counterpart , this card is very obviously and clearly still able to till the field that is 4K resolution . And all it requires is two 8-pin PCIe connectors . <p> Yes , I am fully aware that in most gaming scenarios , the card can barely stay above the 60 fps mark but that 's mainly because I am running each game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just dumb down a couple of settings in-game to boost the framer count , but personally , I 'm a gamer that favours a balance between graphics and performance , hence my choice of presets during my in-depth reviews . But make no mistake , the 7900 XT is still a very powerful card and again , if you 're the kind of person that can do without the ray-tracing aesthetics , then trust me : this will go like a bat out of hell .

@@97992238 <p> The Lotus Eletre fully electric SUV has been sighted by paultan.org reader Alfred Lim , in what appears to be the Bukit Jelutong area in Selangor . Shown here in yellow , as was the case at its global unveiling in March last year , the Eletre has been confirmed for arrival in Malaysia , and it will do so in three variants -- the 603 hp/710 Nm single-motor Eletre and Eletre S , as well as the 905 hp/985 Nm dual-motor Eletre R. <p> We now also have a date for the battery-electric SUV 's local unveiling , and that is April 13 , which is next week , as posted on the Lotus Cars Malaysia Facebook page with the accompanying silhouette of what should be that of that of the Eletre . <p> The fully electric Eletre is around the size of a Lamborghini Urus , which , given its bodystyle , wears a not entirely dissimilar shape as well . The base Eletre and Eletre S are powered by a 112 kWh battery that feeds a single rear-mounted motor producing the aforementioned 603 hp and 710 Nm of torque , propelling the tall Lotus from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2.2 seconds while top speed is 258 km/h ; its claimed WLTP range is 600 km . <p> The top Eletre R variant features dual motors with does 0-100 km/h in just 2.95 seconds while the 80-120 km/h gap is done in under 1.9 seconds . Top speed for the Eletre R is 265 km/h , and its claimed WLTP range from the same 112 kWh is 490 km . In all variants , an 800-volt architecture enables a 10-80% quick charge capability in just 20 minutes , described simply as via a DC connection . <p> Word we have received on Eletre pricing in Malaysia is that even the top Eletre R variant will not breach the RM1 million threshold , even with all options selected . Indicative pricing for the base of the range is therefore even lower , and is said to be from RM630k , thanks in large part to the EV duty incentives currently in play in Malaysia . <p> For those with the funds ready , the Lotus Eletre appears to be good value considering the performance on offer , and it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our sources , the Eletre has collected more than 100 orders as of last month despite no prior marketing activity by Lotus Cars Malaysia ( LCM ) . <p> Open roads and closed circuits hold great allure for Mick Chan .

@@97992239 <p> Last year 's Emira may have kickstarted the Lotus revival , but this is the car Hethel aims to rake the money in with . After decades of prototypes and falsedawns , the company has finally revealed its first ever SUV -- the all-electric Eletre . <p> Lotus calls this an electric hyper-SUV , a label that entails a certain level of performance . To that end , the Eletre will be offered with all-wheel drive with twin motors and a power output " from 600 hp " , enabling the car to get from zero to 100 km/h in under three seconds before reaching a top speed of around 260 km/h . <p> The car will also be available with a battery capacity of " over 100 kWh " , providing a range of around 600 km on the WLTP cycle . It will support up to 350 kW of DC fast charging power , putting in 400 km of range in just 20 minutes , while a 22 kW onboard charger will allow relatively fast AC charging . <p> The Eletre is the first of three " lifestyle " electric vehicles from Lotus , built on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its construction for optimum rigidity . The 800-volt electrical architecture enables the aforementioned high charging speeds and features an integrated high-voltage power distribution system . <p> Lotus said it has committed to " outstanding dynamic performance " by placing skateboard-style battery and motors low in the car , delivering a low centre of gravity . The electric motors also integrates the controller and reducer to make the entire unit smaller and lighter , while a five-link rear axle , air suspension and adaptive dampers all come as standard . Buyers can also specify an active ride height function , rear axle steering , active roll stabilisation and torque vectoring via braking . <p> On the outside , the Eletre gets a low-slung ( for an SUV , anyway ) body with cab-forward proportions , short overhangs and a short bonnet that Lotus says is reminiscent of its trademark mid-engined sports cars . Other design cues include the L-shaped LED daytime running lights with sequential indicators ( the main headlights are hidden in a blacked-out section lower down ) , an upswept window line and an in-vogue black roof . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car , incorporating the slim , full-width taillights . <p> Aerodynamics play a big role in the styling of the Eletre , just like on the Evija hypercar . While there are no big tunnels for the air to flow through , Lotus says there is a " porosity " to the design , with details that include a slot in the grille that leads into the bonnet vents . Air is also guided through ducts aft of the front wheels , the D-pillars and the rear of the car . An active rear wing ( ? la Porsche Cayenne Coup ? ) is also fitted . <p> Elsewhere , there 's an active grille shutter at the front with distinctive triangular petals , along with flush door handles , a power-retractable charging port door on both front fenders , mirror-replacing side-view cameras ( in markets that allow them ) , and a split rear spoiler that is claimed to reduce weight . On a big electric SUV ? Surely not . <p> Break out the measuring tape and you 'll see that the Eletre is a very big SUV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the side-view cameras ) and 1,630 mm tall . In fact , it 's almost as long as a short-wheelbase Mercedes-Benz S-Class , as is its wheelbase of 3,019 mm . It 's no wonder it rolls on massive optional 23-inch two-tone alloy wheels , which come with carbon fibre aero inserts and hide ten-piston front brake callipers and carbon ceramic discs . <p> The Eletre also beats its stablemate the Polestar 3 in incorporating lidar sensors , and these are also retractable for the first time on a production vehicle . These are located at the top of the front and rear windscreens and over the front wheel arches , working with additional cameras on the side stalks to deliver enhanced autonomous driving capabilities . <p> Inside , the Eletre features a minimalist interior with a layered horizontal dashboard that leads into the door cards , along with a tall " floating " centre console . A massive 15.1-inch OLED centre touchscreen dominates the cabin , which retracts when not in use and is equipped with a game-inspired interface that showcases a 3D model of the car ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions with just three taps . <p> This large display sits in between two slim screens for the driver and passenger , with the former being further supported by an augmented reality head-up display . While every function can be operated either through the infotainment system or voice control , certain functions are duplicated using physical switches . The car also comes with Range , Tour , Sport , Off-Road and Individual drive modes . <p> Particular attention has been paid to material choices , with the use of microfibre on the major touch points and wool-blend fabric upholstery that is said to be 50% lighter than leather . The carbon trim is made from the edge trimmings from carbon fibre production , compressed in a resin for a marble-like finish . Four- and five-seater layouts will be made available , the latter adding a nine-inch infotainment touchscreen . <p> As standard , the Eletre is fitted with a 15-speaker , 1,380-watt KEF Premium sound system , with a 23-speaker , 2,160-watt KEF Reference system available as an option . Also part of the options list is a panoramic sunroof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for remote functionality via a smartphone app and the ability to purchase new features as they become available . <p> The Eletre will enter production later this year at a new plant in Wuhan , China , with deliveries due to kick off next year for the Chinese , British and European markets .

" <p> What is the century of humiliation ? Why does it matter to China and what is its relevance today ? The term has become a commonly mentioned concept in Chinese political discourse which is used to evaluate the country 's past in the early modern era . China is depicted as having suffered existentially at the hands of foreign powers , which " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an era of national decline . The discourse of humiliation is used to draw a contrast with the current " revival , " as the ruling Communist Party frames it , in China today . <p> The century of humiliation is understood as the era when foreign colonial powers subjugated , coerced and exploited the declining Qing Dynasty , forcibly opening up China in order to economically exploit and attain political influence over it . The period is typically considered to have begun with the opium wars of the mid-1800s , whereby the Qing 's refusal to import opium from British India led to war , which ended with the signing of an " unequal " Treaty of Nanking . This not only forced British trade interests on Chinese ports , but also annexed Hong Kong island . <p> The opium wars were followed by many other conflicts directed against Beijing , including the forcefully created " treaty ports " that were quasi-colonial annexes where foreign law was applied over Chinese law , and atrocities such as the 1860 burning of the Old Summer Palace occurred . The impact of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China and led to the birth of new revolutionary ideologies which sought to revive the country , one of which became the Communist Party . On obtaining power following the 1927-1949 civil war , the Communist Party framed itself as the driving force of China 's revival and modernization , and the " humiliation " of the past as a backdrop to the rebirth of the country bringing the country to where it is today . <p> In doing so , China 's leaders consider American attempts at containment of the country as an effort to impose a new century of humiliation . US efforts in blockading the rise and development of China through military encirclement and technological embargoes and sanctions are designed to prevent it from overtaking the US as the world 's largest economy . This naturally draws comparisons in China to the old foreign aggression against it . The US does not want China to do well , it wants to politically and economically dominate it to its own advantages , but it has only hardened the political resolve in Beijing that the failures of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be an independent world power , in itself , immensely raises the risk of war and conflict . Beijing is not seeking hegemony , as some Western commentators choose to portray it , but is nonetheless seeking to restore what it deems its rightful status following its national decline in the past . China does not want sagas such as the opium wars to ever be repeated , and in doing so is likely to accelerate its own military development and size in a bid to deter the US and its allies . Critical to all this is that Taiwan remains an unresolved legacy of what Beijing perceives to be part of the century of humiliation . <p> The Japanese annexed the island from the mainland in 1895 , and China sees the reunification of that territory as its right , and sees attempts to block such reunification , such as those by the US , as an effort towards a new humiliation . This means that the political stakes attached to the future of Taiwan are significant . Therefore , is it wise to try and push China to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , are very much aspects of China 's own national confidence . For example , its success in the Korean war of 1950-1953 is heralded , from the Chinese perspective , as the end to the century of humiliation , and the rise of China as a modern power in the world . Attempts , either deliberately or unintentionally , to " humiliate " China again is inherently dangerous , because it involves trying to corner a nation that does not want to be cornered and is strong enough to fight back . Every effort should be made to cooperate and co-exist with a rising China , as opposed to trying to suppress it . At this stage of China 's rise , it 's clear that in economic and military terms it is not to be underestimated , and in turn attempting to relive the era of " humiliation . " Any attempt to add a new legacy of Western powers imposing their will on China wantonly , may prove to be a huge error . WRITER -- Timur Fomenko -- RT

@@98381232 <h> The State of the Nation : Extension of retirement age inevitable but tough on government , say economists <p> THE debate over a recent call to extend the retirement age of employees in Malaysia to 65 remains heated , with proponents suggesting there is little choice in the matter given the average retiree 's paltry savings and greater life expectancy and naysayers side-stepping the issue . Objective voices point to the constraints , particularly Putrajaya 's inability to shoulder the additional expenses for the huge public sector . <p> Last week , the Malaysian Association of Social Protection Contributors ' Advisory Services ( SPCAAM ) urged the government to raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 for employees in both the public and private sectors who choose to continue working , to ease the economic strain on both the individual and the nation , although mainly the former . <p> Citing data from the United Nations Population Division , which shows a 50% increase in global life expectancy at birth for both sexes from 46.5 years in 1950 to 71.7 years in 2022 , SPCAAM said ageing folk struggle financially upon retirement and that extended employment for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually done on a contractual basis , tends to give rise to exploitation . <p> In ensuant statements , the Malaysian Employers Federation argued that extending the retirement age to 65 could heighten the rate of youth unemployment and lead to a decrease in human capital in the future . <p> Meanwhile , the Employees Provident Fund ( EPF ) , responding in part to another report , refuted speculation of a cash crunch building up in the retirement fund and that an amendment of the EPF Act prevented retirees from withdrawing their savings . <p> SPCAAM subsequently said " certain business groups " failed to address the core of the issue , being the social and economic plight of the elderly . When contacted by The Edge , the Ministry of Human Resources declined to comment on the matter . <p> Advocating for a further extension of the retirement age is not new . For civil servants , the retirement age was raised from 55 to 56 in 2001 before being increased to 58 in 2008 and 60 in 2012 , unleashing considerable consternation even then . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned 65 years and above , many advocated for a similar increase as well as passing a Senior Citizen Act in preparation for our transition to an ageing society , " Monash University Malaysia School of Business Prof Dr Niaz Asadullah , who is also the Southeast Asia lead at the Global Labor Organization , tells The Edge . <p> To this end , Women , Family and Community Development Minister Datuk Seri Nancy Shukri said last Friday that the Senior Citizens Bill , whose purpose is to protect the rights of the elderly , is expected to be presented next year . She added that the ministry was in the midst of reviewing the National Action Plan for Senior Citizens . <p> " Demands for a flexible labour market that boosts labour force participation across the elderly population have further intensified in the context of post-pandemic recovery efforts . Considering everything , an increase in the retirement age is inevitable , " Niaz continues . <p> " I would however advocate for gradual adjustment by 2030 instead of a sudden increase from 60 to 65 years -- similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 62 in 1999 and avoiding any big changes over the next 20 years . <h> ' Can the government afford it ? ' , civil service workforce a major concern <p> " Previous governments have side-stepped questions arising from a longer life expectancy . I do not know how long these issues can be avoided , " says Malaysian Institute of Economic Research ( MIER ) senior fellow Dr Shankaran Nambiar . <p> Economists whom The Edge spoke to agree that an extension of the retirement age is needed and inevitable , but point to the foremost constraint preventing its implementation -- Putrajaya can ill afford it . <p> " For one , the treasury does not have the money to pay for the public sector 's salaries until age 65 . It has to address the future generations too at a time when the unemployment and underemployment rates are threatening to soar , " remarks Asia Europe Institute professor of economics Datuk Dr Rajah Rasiah . <p> He says that even though the present unity government has shown strong people-leaning policies and an orientation towards accountability , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the red . <p> " I believe Malaysia 's revenue-gross domestic product bottomed out at 10.5% of GDP in 2022 , which is the lowest among Southeast Asian economies . The government has substituted the issue of extending the retirement age with handouts by offering the hardcore poor RM2,500 + RM600 and a smaller amount for those above the poverty line , " says Rajah . <p> " In fact , the government raised the poverty line income in its Budget 2023 . This is clearly better than allowing the public to draw down further from their EPF accounts , which is savings meant to support them in their retirement years . Under these circumstances I do not think the government is ready to raise the retirement age to 65 . " <p> He believes that Putrajaya is better off tackling the nation 's anxiety over the rising cost of living by imposing stringent measures on corruption and monopolies , and ensuring that subsidies reach only those who qualify for them . <p> The economists believe that extending work life could mean fewer recruits for Malaysia 's already swollen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when their career advancement opportunities are limited . <p> Note that RM58.2 billion -- or 38.4% of the total operational expenditure of RM151.6 billion -- that went towards remunerating public sector workers in 2010 , ballooned to a whopping RM114.9 billion , or 52.3% , in 2021 , according to the Fiscal Outlook and Federal Government Revenue Estimates 2023 . This is expected to hit RM119.8 billion , or 44% of the total operational expenditure , this year . <p> " The federal authorities should therefore review , discuss and debate the full range of alternative retirement and re-employment provisions in parliament and at various public forums . The proposed measure need not be limited to a mere increase in mandatory retirement age , " says Niaz . <p> He emphasises that Malaysia 's accelerated transition to a high-income nation requires an active labour force while ensuring the social security of workers in and outside the formal economy . <p> " The proposition for changes related to the retirement age has to be framed in the larger context as one that is simultaneously pro-business and worker-friendly . Only after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition that creates responsible re-employment provisions for elderly citizens , " he says . <p> To this end , advocates have stressed that retaining experienced and healthy workers can help maintain productivity levels and save costs by reducing the need to hire and train new employees , while creating opportunities for active ageing and reducing financial insecurity later on in life . <h> Responsible institutional provision for old age employment <p> According to the World Bank , Malaysia 's dependency ratio of 43 in 2021 pales in comparison with that of advanced countries such as Japan , the UK and the US , which range between 53 and 71 . <p> The dependency ratio is a demographic measure of the financial pressure on the working population in a country . The higher the ratio , the more non-workers there are relative to the number of workers . <p> " The figure for Malaysia , though not yet alarming , is projected to increase to 50 in two decades . Besides , this is just one of the indicators . We need to account for other factors such as fertility rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an advanced stage of population ageing , owing to rapid fertility decline and one of the highest life expectancy rates in the world , " says Niaz . <p> The nation across the Causeway tends to be regularly referenced for its provision of employment for the elderly . Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong has reportedly said that by 2030 , the current retirement age of 63 will be extended to 65 , and re-employment from 67 to 70 . <p> For context , Singapore 's current relatively higher retirement age of 63 is aligned with the country 's changing demographics . The government 's National Population and Talent Division in its annual Population In Brief report last September estimated that one out of every four citizens will be aged 65 and above by 2030 . The number of citizens aged 80 and above has increased by more than 70% from 2012 to 132,000 and make up 3.7% of the population today . <p> Similar ageing trends are seen in other Asian societies such as Japan and South Korea , as well as G7 nations -- Canada , France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US -- which also record low fertility rates , United Nations data shows . <p> Niaz explains that unlike Malaysia , Singapore does not have a mandatory retirement age . Instead , under its Retirement and Re-employment Act ( RRA ) , Singapore 's employment laws ensure opportunities for continued employment of older workers where employers are required to offer re-employment to eligible employees . <p> " This is as long as the employees are in good health and fit to perform their jobs . This is a good example of responsible institutional provision for equal employment opportunity in old age , " he says . <p> " In fact , many other economically advanced Asian countries such as Japan and South Korea are considering either adjusting the retirement age upward and/or instituting labour reforms to facilitate re-entry into the workforce in old age . " <p> June 2022 data provided by the Department of Statistics Malaysia ( DOSM ) shows that the composition of the population aged 0 to 14 years dipped to 23.2% from 23.6% the year before , while the population aged 65 and above increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 to 64 years ) rose from 69.4% to 69.5% in the same period . <p> " Going by the United Nations ' definition , Malaysia has become an ageing society where the older age population increases every year , " says DOSM . <p> Despite being a relatively young nation , Malaysia is in the same boat as many of its much older friends in grappling with the greying of its citizens amid lower birth rates . <p> " The government would be well advised to extend the retirement age . The post-retirement savings that people have is deplorable . Encouraging people to work beyond 60 will help alleviate some of the costs going into public healthcare , " says Nambiar.

RM100k <p> Hyundai has finally revealed pricing and packaging details for the 2022 Hyundai Santa Cruz , the compact pick-up truck that was first revealed in April . The " Sport Adventure Vehicle " made in America for Americans starts from US$23,990 ( RM100,513 ) , which the company says is an attractive entry point for target buyers . <p> The unibody Santa Cruz -- a faithful reproduction of the similarly named concept from 2015 -- shares the same platform as the current Tucson SUV . It comes with two 2.5 litre engine options , both paired with eight-speed automatics . The standard engine is a direct-injection naturally aspirated one with an estimated 190+ hp and over 245 Nm of torque , paired with a conventional torque converter gearbox . <p> There 's also a turbo option ( estimated 275+ hp , over 420 Nm ) with a dual-clutch gearbox and steering shift paddles .

The Sport setting gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rear wheels . <p> Towing capacity is surprisingly strong for such a small truck -- the Turbo AWD can pull 5,000 pounds ( 2,268 kg ) , which is a fair bit more than the Ford Maverick with the top 2.0 litre EcoBoost turbo engine and optional 4K Tow Package ( 1,800 kg ) , and even more than a Jeep Gladiator Rubicon . <p> Speaking of the Ford , that 's the Santa Cruz 's also-unibody compact truck rival . The more traditionally-styled Maverick starts with 2.5L hybrid powertrain with total system output of 191 hp/210 Nm . The 2.0L Ecoboost does 250 hp/378 Nm , and AWD is only available with the turbo . The Maverick is priced from just US$19,995 ( RM83,834 ) , but the Santa Cruz is likely to be better equipped from the base . <p> Also available across the board are rear 60:40 flip-up lower cushions ( versus one-piece ) , rear occupant alert , driver attention warning , lane keeping/lane following assist , intelligent speed limit warning and leading vehicle departure alert .

@@98527238 <h> Oh dear , the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5 will look the same yet again <p> Those of you who have seen reports of the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 5 allegedly getting a massive new cover screen might have been looking forward to a similar far-reaching redesign for the larger Z Fold 5 . Unfortunately , several new renders from OnLeaks published on Smartprix show that the upcoming foldable will continue with largely the same design for the third year running . <p> It 's obvious that the Z Fold 5 borrows key inspiration from the Z Fold 4 , itself a derivative of the Z Fold 3 . The tall , slender form factor ( when closed ) is unmistakable , and even though the publication claims the new phone is actually shorter at 154.9mm tall , the 0.2mm reduction will hardly make a difference to how cumbersome it will be to use one-handed -- especially since the unchanged 67.1mm width will still make for quite a cramped cover screen . <p> Also recognisable is the pill-shaped camera bump on the back , housing the main , ultra-wide and 3x telephoto cameras . Samsung has at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , likely to make room for larger image sensors . Hopefully this means the Z Fold 5 will finally share its main camera with the S Ultra series for the first time , in this case the excellent 200MP unit from the S23 Ultra . <p> The biggest difference between the Z Fold 4 and the Z Fold 5 will , of course , be the hinge . Samsung looks to be taking inspiration from Oppo , Honor , Huawei and the rest of the foldable market by moving to a teardrop-folding screen , which not only makes the phone fold flat ( eliminating the gap near the hinge ) but also results in a significantly shallower crease . The device will also be thinner at 13.4mm , whereas the Z Fold 4 tapers from 15.8 to 14.2mm <p> Otherwise , the specs should be largely identical and include a 6.2-inch cover screen and a 7.6-inch inner display , both AMOLED with 120Hz adaptive refresh rates ; the inner display is expected to be significantly brighter than the current model 's 1,200-nit peak .

Farmer Chris Achter would then speak with a representative from South West Terminal , with the rep then proceeding to send him a picture of a contract , along with a message asking him to confirm the flax contract . Achter only responded with a thumbs up emoji ? ? . <p> According to the contract sent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Achter to South West Terminal by November 2021 . However , by the time November rolled around , Achter did n't send the flax over to South West Terminal , and by then flax prices had risen too . This let to a dispute between them , with the South West Terminal rep highlighting previous contracts confirmed via text message , while Achter says he sent the thumbs up ? ? only to indicate that he had received the contract , not that he was agreeing to it . <p> Eventually , the dispute led to a court case . The judge though was on the side of South West Terminal , stating that in his opinion the signature requirement for the contract was met when Achter sent the thumbs up emoji ? ? . Justice Timothy Keene wrote : <p> " This court readily acknowledges that a ? ? emoji is a non-traditional means to " sign " a document but nevertheless under these circumstances this was a valid way to convey the two purposes of a " signature " -- to identify the signator and as I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flax contract . <p> I therefore find that under these circumstances that the provisions ... have been met and the flax contract is therefore enforceable , " -- Justice Timothy Keene <p> Eventually , Achter would be ordered to pay CAD82,000 ( RM286,027.30 ) due to not fulfilling the contract . Keene was also quick to dismiss the argument that by allowing the thumbs up emoji to mean accepting a contract that it would open up the flood gates for ' all sorts of cases ' when it comes to interpretations of various emojis such as the fist bump ? ? or the handshake emoji ? ? . Instead , he says that the courts should not stop the tide of technology , with the rise of the use of emojis ' the new reality in Canadian society ' .

At the moment , all ISPs are regulated by the MCMC and they must adhere to any instructions to block access to certain websites which the MCMC deemed to be offensive or inappropriate . <p> With the latest statement from the MCMC , it raises concerns about the internet freedom in Malaysia . Are telcos now required to conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both fixed and mobile broadband providers ? <p> For example , if telcos are aware that its users have fallen victim to scams or have been receiving offensive content on Facebook , WhatsApp and Instagram , are they now required to block access to these Meta platforms ?

What happens if a user uses a VPN service to access a harmful website , will the telcos be held responsible as well ? <p> As highlighted by the MCMC previously , Malaysia lacks the necessary policies and framework to regulate content platforms hosted overseas . After failing to tackle Facebook scam ads , impersonation and inappropriate content , the MCMC said it will take legal action against Meta as there 's an increasing public concern about scams and Meta 's response has been unsatisfactory . <p> While Australia has drafted a new law aimed at addressing the spread of misinformation and fake news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take a consistent and proactive engagement approach with the relevant social media platforms . <p> As highlighted repeatedly , Meta behaves in a manner where it prioritise revenues over user safety .

Without strict regulations and policies , there 's very little motivation for Meta to prioritise online safety of Malaysians . <p> Ultimately , who should be responsible for content ?

Did you know that it takes a minimum of 3 murders by 1 person for them to be deemed a serial killer ? <p> Such is the case for 7 year old , Amarjeet Sada who has since gained notoriety as the world 's youngest serial killer.Do note that this article contains graphic content and details of bloody murder of minors so skip away if you do n't think you 're able to stomach it . <p> With that , let us delve into chilling details of his crimes and the shocking revelations that unfolded during the investigation . <p> Fact 1 : Early Signs of Deviance <p> Born in 1998 in Bihar , Amarjeet was raised in an extremely poor family .

He then brutally bashed her head in a nearby forest and buried her . Amarjeet was only 7 years of age when he first killed . <p> Fact 3 : A Disturbing Confession <p> The family soon took notice of the disappearance of the little girl . Not long after , Amarjeet Sada confessed to murdering his own cousin . Despite how shocked some members of the family were , they decided to keep it under wraps as it was a family matter and did not report the crime . This was proven to be a serious mistake as young Amarjeet went on to kill again , with the murders not even a year apart . <p> Fact 4 : The Second Victim -- His Sister <p> Not long after the first murder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a winter afternoon , he lifted her from her cot and strangled her to death .

But his parents made the same mistake and hid him , pleading with the neighbors not to tell the truth . <p> Fact 5 : The Capture <p> In 2007 , Amarjeet claimed his third and final victim -- a six-month-old baby girl named Khushboo . <p> He was walking around the neighborhood school when he noticed an infant inside a baby stroller .

His lack of fear or remorse stunned the officers . <p> Fact 7 : The Diagnosis <p> Psychologists who evaluated Amarjeet described him as a " sadist " who derived pleasure from causing harm to others . Diagnosed with a conduct disorder , he displayed alarming tendencies even at such a young age . <p> Fact 8 : Juvenile Detention and Release <p> As Amarjeet was a minor at the time of the murders , he was sent to a juvenile home and kept in isolation .

What do you think of this gruesome case ? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section . <p> May the victims rest in peace and their families continue to have strength to live their lives .

@@100845234 <p> Muhyiddin Yassin 's disgraced son-in-law , Muhammad Adlan Berhan , appears to have fled the country in May . Instead of condemning the act , or at least pretend to ask his son-in-law to come back to prove his innocence in court , former backdoor Prime Minister Muhyiddin has instead issued a " no comment " statement . It 's not rocket science that Mr Adlan had been ordered to run away . <p> The Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission ( MACC ) Chief Commissioner Azam Baki confirmed that besides tracking down 48-year-old Adlan , the authorities are also hunting down 69-year-old lawyer Mansoor Saat . Both fugitives were linked to a scandal involving irregularities in the registration , recruitment and biometric storage of foreign workers in the country . <p> As a result , the MACC has asked the Immigration Department to freeze the passports of the two men , as well as seeking the help of Interpol in tracking down the two crooks . Apparently , the graft busters were forced to take the action after attempts to contact both individuals failed . If indeed Muhyiddin 's son-in-law was innocence , why fled the country in the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's attorney denies that his client has fled Malaysia to escape questioning from the anti-corruption agency . However , the half-baked denial invites more questions than answers when attorney Baljit Singh Sidhu said Adlan will return home only if he is not persecuted . Going by the silly logic , every criminal could use such excuse to run away and escape prosecution . <p> Hilariously , the half-past-six lawyer also claims that his client has the right to travel and will protect his rights and liberty from being taken away . In truth , a passport belongs to the country that issued them . Therefore , the Malaysian government can freeze or cancel the passports of any suspected criminal , effectively ending the so-called rights and liberty to travel abroad . <p> A crook like Muhyiddin 's son-in-law has no rights , let alone liberty , to demand that he is allowed to travel unrestricted.Just like former PM Najib Razak 's partner-in-crime Jho Low , whose passport was cancelled following a request by the MACC to the Immigration Department , Adlan can not hide abroad while claiming innocence and refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despicable Jho Low too was never arrested and never called by the MACC for a meeting or to assist in any investigations before he fled the country . Yet , the whole world knows he is a fugitive who ran away from prosecution for his involvement in the 1MDB scandal.Hence , Muhammad Adlan is a fugitive like Jho Low -- hiding in a foreign country for fear of being sent to prison . <p> If Adlan is clean and has nothing to hide , he should return home immediately and bravely face the judiciary system , and not using the freezing of his account as an excuse to accuse the MACC of harassment and persecution . After all , MACC chief Azam Baki was appointed under Muhyiddin administration . Is Adlan trying to say that the MACC was fair and clean only when his father-in-law was in power ? <p> Obviously , he had decided to run away after being ordered to do so . And the man who told him to temporarily hide in overseas was Muhyiddin himself.But why did the ex-premier tell his son-in-law to abscond ? It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to avoid of stall investigation over Adlan 's corruption and money laundering on behalf of Muhyiddin . <p> On January 5 this year , the MACC arrested a chief executive officer of a private company . The 42-year-old man -- Adam Radlan Adam Muhammad -- was detained over his role as " middleman " in brokering government projects related to Covid-19 stimulus packages worth RM92.5 billion ( US$21 billion ) in exchange for bribes . He turns out to be Muhyiddin 's right-hand man . <p> A former chief executive of Maju Assets Sdn Bhd , Adam is also Segambut divisional leader of Muhyiddin 's political party -- Bersatu ( Malaysian United Indigenous Party ) . The best part is Adam is the cousin of Muhyiddin 's son-in-law , Muhamad Adlan Berhan , who in turn was involved in several scandals as part of a web of Muhyiddin cronies of corruptions . <p> Adlan married to Muhyiddin 's daughter , Nabilah , who is a shareholder of Agathistwo Jia Sdn Bhd , a company involved in the scandalous RM1.2 billionNIIS ( National Integrated Immigration System ) concession .

However , the " failed project " , awarded to YTL Communications , has been plagued with slow internet access and problematic Frog VLE , which could easily be replaced with Google Classroom . <p> Now , the MACC is investigating the possible abuse of power in the award of contracts for Muhyiddin 's son-in-law in the NIIS project , which could lead to the former prime minister charged and jailed . So , crooked Muyiddin is facing two scandals -- money laundering in the RM92.5 billion Covid-19 stimulus packages and corruptions in the RM1.2 billion NIIS projects . <p> Actually , the RM5.7 billion Jana Wibawa is the third scandal involving Muhyiddin.But during his questioning , Muhyiddin has pointed his fingers at his self-appointed finance minister Tengku Zafrul . He argued -- " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed by Zafrul to help Bumiputera contractors during the Covid-19 pandemic " . <p> Adam Radlan 's involvement in Muhyiddin 's web of cronyism , nepotism and corruption was exposed after Muhyiddin-led Perikatan Nasional coalition failed to form a government post 15th General Election . And this is precisely why the power-hungry and corrupted ex-PM desperately wanted to return to power by hook or by crook -- to " cover up " the skeleton in the closet . <p> But the biggest problem was his son-in-law 's key role in the RM1.2 billion NIIS ( National Integrated Immigration System ) scandal . The MACC had begun investigating the case years ago and basically has established the money trails which could easily implicate Muhyiddin if his son-in-law talks like a canary . So , in order to keep Muhamad Adlan 's silence , he was told to flee and hide . <p> Muhyiddin 's , whose given name is Mahiaddin , plan was to hide his son-in-law at a secured location and hopes opposition Perikatan Nasional could win big in the upcoming six state elections . Only with Muhyiddin returning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped . Muhyiddin knew that once the trial starts , all his past dirty wheeling and dealing would be exposed . <p> In the same breath , it also suggests the Perikatan Nasional chairman lacks confidence that the opposition can grab Selangor , Penang and Negeri Sembilan from Anwar-led Unity Government . Otherwise , Muhyiddin would not have told his son-in-law to run away as it could backfire spectacularly due to perception that Adlan was the ex-premier 's bagman.

Cheyne . <p> " Gibbons in the wild can be quite resilient , but they need trees . That is where they get all their food from . If you take away their home , then there will be no gibbons , " she said . <p> According to Gibbon Conservation Society ( GCS ) founder Mariani Ramli , 37 , these " true forest farmers " act as seed dispersers , contributing to forest regeneration and maintaining the health of their habitat . <p> " They help keep the forest healthy . When they keep the forest healthy , we will not have as many floods and they are the farmers that help give us food , especially for the people who live near the forest . The forest is like a pharmacy to them where they get their medication , " said Mariani , who is better known as Bam . <p> Cheyne suggested the creation of canopy bridges could be a potential protection solution as these structures will allow gibbons and other arboreal animals to safely cross the forest without encountering humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful in many other countries and can help protect gibbons from electrocution and road accidents . <p> " These canopy bridges are very successful in Singapore for langurs , for gibbons in China , Vietnam , India and Indonesia and orangutans in Sabah , " she explained . <p> While the idea of canopy bridges has been floated , Bam pointed out that more support and interest from various authorities such as wildlife protection societies , rescue centres , local communities and government are needed to implement them effectively . <p> Gibbons are renowned for their unique singing , a complex communication method that shapes their social interactions . -- Photo from Facebook/Gibbon Conservation Society <p> Gibbons in the pet trade : A complex challenge <p> One of the most pressing issues in gibbon conservation is the illegal pet trade and the complexity of the problem lies not only in the capture of these primates , but also in understanding why people keep them as pets . <p> " Frequently , individuals acquire gibbons as pets , often isolating them from their families and confining them to cramped enclosures , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do people opt to keep gibbons as pets ? Why not opt for more appropriate companions like cats or dogs that are domesticated and well-suited for human interaction ? " Cheyne said , adding that gibbons are social animals and designed to thrive in their natural habitat . She said that illegal wildlife traders have large international networks , but it all starts locally . <p> " In the context of Malaysia and Indonesia , the ease of purchasing gibbon species online underscores the gravity of the situation . The sale of gibbons from these regions to destinations like Belize , Europe , or the United States exacerbates the problem , " she said . <p> She added that efforts to combat this problem require a holistic approach , including better training for wildlife departments , improved rescue centre facilities , and a clear understanding of wild gibbon populations . <p> " It 's making sure that gibbon will be able to survive in the wild , " Cheyne emphasised . <p> Gibbons are renowned for their unique singing , a complex communication method that shapes their social interactions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social behaviour . It 's their language . They use it for communication between adults and with other gibbon families . The distinct songs signify not only their territorial boundaries but also their emotions and interactions with other gibbons , " Cheyne said . <p> Each gibbon species has its own song , and within that , the males and females have their version of it . <p> " Also , it 's how they find mates and flirt . When gibbons are not yet paired , their songs are their personal calling cards to find a mate . When two individuals are starting to possibly like each other , they will start to coordinate the singing a little bit , even if they 're not together . <p> " Also , the song can travel up to 3km , so they have a wide range of choices . It is one of the most fundamental parts of their social behaviour , " she said . <p> Young gibbons typically learn by imitating their same-sex parents , much like humans learn to talk by copying their parents and others but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they miss this crucial learning opportunity . -- Photo from Facebook/Gibbon Conservation Society <p> Cheyne added that in the wild , the young gibbons may take longer because they do n't compete with the adults and they usually begin singing at around four to six years old , harmonising with the adults but not directly competing with them . <p> " Whereas , in rescue centres , learning to sing can happen more quickly due to less competition . However , to be confident that a young gibbon has properly learned to sing , it might take until they are about six or seven years old . Researchers can track their progress by recording their singing and analysing their song development over time to determine if they have mastered their species ' language , " she said . <p> However , Bam said the challenge lies in encouraging young gibbons raised in captivity how to sing like wild gibbons . <p> Young gibbons typically learn by imitating their same-sex parents , much like humans learn to talk by copying their parents and others but when gibbons are taken into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning opportunity . <p> " Just as humans need to learn from their family and peers to communicate effectively , gibbons need to learn from other gibbons to sing properly . <p> " It 's quite challenging , especially for gibbons that have mental trauma from their time with humans . Some have even been sexually abused . Besides , young gibbons taken from the wild to be sold as pets often lose the opportunity to learn their complex songs from their parents , " said Bam , who oversees the rehabilitation of gibbons at GCS . <p> ibbons ' status as an endangered and protected species under the Wildlife Conservation Act 2022 underscores the urgency of conservation efforts . -- Photo from Facebook/Gibbon Conservation Society <p> Importance of rehabilitation <p> Rehabilitation can be a long and delicate process with the duration varying from five to 15 years , said Cheyne , reflecting on the unique challenges these animals face due to their history of human interaction . <p> The rehabilitation centre 's task is to encourage gibbons to relearn their natural behaviours and limit human interaction as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ultimately , to provide gibbons with the opportunity to be as close to their wild counterparts as possible . <p> " Rescue centres like the one Bam is involved with do n't just offer temporary solutions .

Even after release , continuous monitoring ensures the gibbons ' safety and success in their natural environment , " said Cheyne . <p> The positive outcomes achieved by the GCS , like the transformation of the male , White-Handed Gibbon baby , Axel , who was born on June 29 to parents Ebony Coley at the Malaya Gibbon Rehabilitation Project in Raub , Pahang exemplify the potential of dedicated rehabilitation efforts . <p> " His parents Ebony and Coley were kept as pets but then they were rescued .

It was worth it . When I asked where the stock came from the man operating the stall said he obtained them from Bau . At another stall , there were varieties of the fruits , big and small and I suspect they came from Serian which reminded me some beautiful moments enjoying the durians belonging to one Mr Chai ( now deceased ) from Serian next to Kampung Kakai in 1986/87 when we were invited to his house by the roadside on the Serian/Kuching road for a durian treat .

But perhaps this is still an early season , thus the fruits are sold for some hefty prices . One has to wait for two more weeks for a better bargain . <p> I recall my last trip to our durian orchard at Bila Dua in the Melupa River basin in Saratok was in 1992 . We came in three cars from SMK Julau , Julau in Sarikei Division with the trip comprising three couples involving me and my spouse plus two other couples who were also teachers in the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kedap , some 22 km from Saratok town and fetched my elder brother Jon and his two sons to lead the trip . <p> Then we proceeded to Nanga Assam School at middle Melupa River basin where we parked out cars and walked to dad 's birthplace Munggu Embawang longhouse a short distance from the school where we fetched an uncle , Nyiring Jembu , my father 's younger brother ( now deceased ) who led us along a jungle trek , taking about two hours to Bila Dua in upper Melupa . Halfway , we stopped by Letung Naga the site where my late dad saw a dragon flash while tapping rubber at their plantation by the lakeside circa 1926 when he was just a 16-year-old . This story was written by me in this column earlier titled ' Dragon by day , Keling by night ' . <p> So upon reaching Bila Dua we made a quick tent out of wood and leaves quickly .

So our dinner consisted of some fish and the barbequed mouse-deer . There was flush of strong wind rendering a good falling moment for the durian fruits . <p> Uncle Nyiring and my brother Jon had a good time sharing the ripe durians together with ' cap langkau ' liqour and laughing loudly without any worry at all . None of us joined them doing such a potentially fatal combination . But my brother had done it many times before and telling uncle Nyiring he had nothing to worry about .

Sebirung is a shared communal area comprising four durian valleys namely Rajang , Tukak , Lusing and Lemayung . The three of us went to Rajang Valley but were later joined by four others who were communal owners of the shared property . All of us stayed inside tent of wood and leaves that were already built earlier by another group who had left . This was expected at the shared property and accepted each other .

According to the sharing act , these should be gathered and put together with the other fruits found by others in the common pool . <p> However , we two the naughty culprits opted to hide a few fruits far away from the dropping zone and hid around four big ones to be collected later after the shared items were divided . We succeeded but the jungles had eyes and ears . I had to pay for my sin a year later when I was stung by a hornet called ' Menaning ' , the second most dangerous of the stinging insect .

There are restrictions one need to consider such as prohibition from saying anything when smelling perfume in the jungle because this could be due to the presence of a third party around you . One is also prohibited from burning salted fish because the smell could draw in insects and reptiles as well as wild animals . <p> My last trip to Sebirung Valley was in 1972 before sitting for the School Certificate examinations . I had to miss a day or two of school as a Form Five student in SMK Saratok due to being away in the durian excursion .

@@102277231 <h> Targeted subsidies to ease rakyat 's burden <p> MANY governments all over the world have their own social protection programmes to alleviate hardships faced by their citizens , notably those from the lower and middle-income groups . Some examples of these social protection programmes are direct cash transfers , price control ceilings for essential goods , subsidies for fuel and electricity , and health and education sectors . <p> In Malaysia , subsidies have been part and parcel of the economy for many years , so much so the rakyat expects the government to continue providing them . The rakyat have become accustomed to subsidised services and products . It 's as if subsidy has become an inalienable right . <p> As the government grapples with getting its finances right , trying to balance its revenue and expenditure , there have been calls for the current subsidy system to be reformed . One of the key reforms is to move away from the current costly blanket mechanism that benefits everyone , including high-income earners who are certainly not in need of any assistance , to a more targeted one which focuses on the needs of the low and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim during the mid-term review of the 12th Malaysia Plan . Further details are expected to be announced during the Budget 2024 presentation on 13 October 2023 . <p> Here are some questions and answers with Dr. Yeah Kim Leng , Professor of Economics and Director of Economic Studies Programme at Jeffrey Cheah Institute on Southeast Asia at Sunway University and Member of the Advisory Committee to Finance Minister ( ACFIN ) to provide a better understanding of the issues at hand : <p> 1 . How big is the subsidy bill in 2022 and what is the projected figure for 2023 ? <p> In Malaysia , the government has long subsidised basic goods and services . These subsidies are intended to lessen the burden on vulnerable groups . Among other things , they include subsidies for rice , flour , cooking oil , chicken and eggs , electricity , petrol , diesel , cooking gas ( LPG ) , healthcare and education . <p> Subsidies do not actually make the cost of the items cheaper . What happens is the user only pays a fraction of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is borne by the government . The portion that is borne by the government is what we refer to as subsidies . <p> Herein lies the problem . Our subsidy bill , which includes social assistance , has been growing over the years . If you can imagine , in 2008 , our subsidy bill stood at RM35.2 billion . As of 2022 , this had grown to RM67.4 billion . This is almost a two-fold increase . <p> Subsidies in 2022 accounted for nearly 4% of Malaysia 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) -- the value of goods and services produced -- and made up approximately 23% of the government 's operating expenditure . Basically , almost a quarter of all government 's operating expenditure is used solely to provide discounts on some of the items the rakyat buys , rather than on things that may potentially be more productive for the nation . <p> We could also be using this on development expenditure , which is crucial for nation-building in economic and social development initiatives such as education , healthcare , social housing and public transport . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government 's revenue in 2022 was RM234 billion , subsidies consumed almost one-third of that . This means , for every ringgit that the government collected , 30 sen went to subsidies . <p> The government has forecasted RM58.6 billion in subsidy payments for 2023 . Despite being lower than the amount allocated for 2022 , it is still a huge number . Needless to say , this is n't sustainable . <p> 2 . Why ca n't the government continue with what they have been doing for so many years and why it is no longer sustainable ? <p> Let 's pause and take a hard look at our current financial position . The fact of the matter is Malaysia has been spending more than it earns in all but five years since 1970 . That 's 48 years of deficits . Running a deficit budget means the government has to borrow . Hence , as at end 2022 , the total government debt is RM1.08 trillion . And that 's excluding government guarantees provided to numerous government-owned entities , which if included would push the total government liabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trillion ? The amount is equivalent to the size of the Malaysian economy . Or divide that by Malaysia 's population of 32 million , that 's equivalent to RM46,875 debt for each and every one of us . <p> Having a huge debt is a burden to the government 's financial position . In 2022 , the cost to service government debt amounted to RM41.3 billion and exceeds what is spent on health , education , transport and housing put together . Moreover , nearly 30 percent of the interest payments ends up in foreign hands . <p> Source : Bank Negara Malaysia <p> RM41.3 billion is also equivalent to 20% of tax revenue . In other words , for every ringgit that the government collects , 20 sen goes towards paying the interest on the debt alone . Paying interest is not productive as it does n't generate any spillover impact to the economy . <p> 3 . What are the big items that the government subsidises ? <p> The government subsidises many goods and services . Our rice , which is being sold at RM2.60 per kg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the hospital will cost only RM1 . Primary and secondary education are free for citizens . Studying a Bachelor in Medicine and Bachelor in Surgery ( MBBS ) degree in University Malaya will only cost RM 14,990 for the whole programme -- among the lowest in the world , although it should be noted that this too is partially subsidised by the government . <p> If we extend this concept further into the realm of education , the government has also provided subsidy -- although it is not called as such , in the form of Rancangan Makanan Tambahan ( RMT ) , Bantuan Makanan Asrama , Bantuan Makanan Prasekolah , Skim Pinjaman Buku Teks , Bantuan Awal Persekolahan , Biasiswa Kecil Persekutuan to our children . <p> These are just some examples . The actual list of subsidised goods and services would be even longer.However , these subsidies do n't account for the majority of our overall subsidy bill . <p> The biggest chunk of our subsidy expenditure comes from fuel and electricity subsidies . Together , these two items accounted for RM60.6 billion , or over 90% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel ( diesel , petrol and cooking gas ) alone came up to about RM50.8 billion ( or 77% ) , while our electricity subsidy amounted to RM9.8 billion ( or 14.8% ) . What does this mean for the rakyat ? <p> Put it this way : with RM60.6 billion , the government could potentially have built the equivalent of 700 schools or 120 hospitals per year . Try to imagine what a difference that would have to the country -- especially those in rural areas . <p> 4 . What is wrong with the current blanket subsidy mechanism ? <p> The problem with some of the subsidies in Malaysia , such as our fuel subsidy , is that they are blanket subsidies . This means everyone , regardless of socioeconomic background , benefits from these subsidies . <p> The problem is blanket subsidies benefits those users who consume the most . For example , it was previously disclosed in Parliament that the T20s are getting more than their fair share of the fuel subsidies . They only make up 20% of population but they enjoy 35% of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Income Group under SSA <p> To understand why , a more well-off family is more likely to have two to three vehicles or more and therefore use more fuel , as opposed to a less well-off family , who will probably only own one motorcycle . <p> For example , RON 95 petrol costs RM2.05 per litre at the petrol stations , with the government subsidising about RM1.50 per litre of the actual cost . This simply means a motorcyclist or a delivery rider , from the lower income group , who consumes 100 litres a month will only get RM150 in subsidy while a well-to-dofamily with two to four cars consuming 1000 litres a month gets to enjoy RM1500 in subsidy . <p> So , it begs the question , who is actually benefitting from these subsidies ? And which one of the two is more deserving of the government 's support ? <p> Then there 's the problem of unwanted leakages . How often do we see on social media examples of foreign cars coming into Malaysia to fill up on RON-95 ? This is because the petrol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Therefore , not only are our subsidies inefficient , but we are also subsidising foreigners . We also see in the news cases of diesel and cooking gas smuggling . <p> Source : **26;246;TOOLONG <p> This problem is n't just confined to fuel subsidies . Let 's take the example of electricity . Since prices are kept artificially low , we tend to overconsume or waste electricity -- for example , by keeping our aircons on all-day long . There is also no incentive for firms to invest in energy-efficient equipment . This is probably not the path we want to go down -- considering fuel used to generate our electricity is increasingly being imported as well as recent concerns over global warming . <p> For electricity , the government has already started to implement targeted subsidies to heavy users whereby domestic households who use more than 1,500 kWh a month , will be imposed a 10 sen per kWh surcharge . <p> 5 . What are the alternatives to blanket subsidies to assist vulnerable groups ? <p> As mentioned earlier , blanket subsidies benefit everyone regardless of socioeconomic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the burden of the rakyat . <p> One good example is cash transfers . When we remove unproductive blanket subsidies , there are significant savings to the government 's coffers . A portion of it can be returned to the rakyat in the form of cash transfers . And we empower the rakyat to use it according to their needs , rather than confine it to the selected products and items that the government has been subsidising . <p> The other way to achieve this is through targeted subsidies , whereby only certain vulnerable groups are allowed to continue buying at a subsidised price . A good example that we can see is the public transport discount that we provide for senior citizens . <p> However , the problem with this is that we confine the subsidy only to that product/service rather than empower the rakyat to spend on what they need . To use the previous example , a senior citizen who does not use public transport will not be able to enjoy the subsidy . But this is still much better than providing blanket subsidies . <p> Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subsidies effectively , systems and supporting infrastructure will need to be put in place to ensure there is no abuse ; these systems in turn will require maintenance and periodic upgrading . In short , enforcing targeted subsidies can have significant implementation costs . <p> 6 . Does this mean that the government will remove all subsidies ? <p> I ca n't speak for the government , but that said , I do n't think it needs to remove all subsidies . <p> However , given the current economic situation of the country , reform of subsidies is something that urgently needs to be done . I believe that subsidy reform should focus more on items such as petrol , diesel , cooking gasand electricity as they account for more than 90% of the total subsidies . <p> Let 's see how this would apply in the case of fuel subsidies . A good way to manage the impact of a possible fuel subsidy reform would be to maintain the Automatic Pricing Mechanism ( APM ) , which has been in place since 1983 . The APM helps to set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location , whether it be in Tanjung Malim or in Bangsar . <p> Therefore , should we proceed with fuel subsidy reform , the APM can be used to manage petrol pump prices in the event of global oil price volatility . This is essentially what we call a " managed float " . <p> 7 . How much savings is expected to be made if we move away from blanket subsidies . How will the rakyat , notably the low and middle-income benefit from this measure ? <p> Let 's put this into perspective . In 2022 , we spent six times more on blanket fuel and electricity subsidies ( RM60.6 billion ) than on education ( RM10 billion ) and a whopping 14 times more than on health ( RM4.4 billion ) . <p> Source : Bank Negara Malaysia <p> In fact , if you total up what we spent on economic and social initiatives , which not only includes education and health but also other initiatives such as social and community services , agriculture and rural development , and housing ( this works out to RM23.6 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we spent on our fuel and electricity subsidies . <p> Needless to say , the rakyat would benefit more if our fuel and electricity subsidies were diverted to other economic and social expenditures . <p> 8 . Would n't removing subsidies on petrol , diesel and electricity cause inflation and the prices of many other goods to rise ? <p> On the impact on inflation , yes , as an economist , I would not deny that reforming the subsidy system will induce inflation . Many scholarly articles will attest to that . <p> However , there are ways to manage the impact of inflation caused by subsidy reform . One of the ways is what I mentioned earlier , which is to use a managed float pricing mechanism ( or APM ) to standardise our fuel prices . <p> Secondly , enforcement needs to be ramped up . The government already sets ceiling prices of certain essential goods and services . We need to ensure that these ceiling prices are adhered to . There needs to be a way for the public to play a part in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hikes or smuggling activities in the case of diesel and cooking gas . <p> More importantly , as has been rightly pointed out by the Prime Minister on many occasions in the past , we must find a way to cushion any inflationary impact especially on vulnerable groups . This move is in line with the MADANI framework , specifically under the Compassion core value . <p> Therefore , as I mentioned earlier , a mechanism should be introduced to enable the vulnerable sections of our society , such as children and the elderly , to continue to be given some form of support through a better social assistance scheme , whether in the form of direct cash transfers or subsidies to access government facilities . <p> The intent is always about easing the rakyat 's hardships , and more importantly to lift them out of poverty and at the same time providing them with security while still maintaining their dignity . At the end of the day , the bigger agenda is to help people to transform their lives by creating a staircase of opportunities , to enable them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible citizen , it is incumbent upon us to work with the government to find a way to restore the economy to a stronger footing in order to leave behind a prosperous Malaysia for our children .

@@102422230 <h> Mitsubishi Pajero EVC -- JKR 's EV conversion detailed <p> The just concluded International Electric Mobility Showcase held in KLCC had no shortage of displays centred around electrification , but none stood out quite like this one did , simply because it looked quite out of place amidst all the modern elements on call . <p> Your eyes do not deceive you . That 's a 1994 Mitsubishi LO49 Pajero , and a public works department ( JKR ) unit at that . Decked out in a yellow and grey exterior scheme in the past , the vehicle used to be a common sight in the 90s . Of course , more than three decades on , it is now nothing more than a legacy , of a time gone by . <p> So why then was this particular vehicle on show at the National EV Pavilion area of the event ? Well , that 's because it 's an electric vehicle , or rather one converted into an EV by the department . It 's actually the second such vehicle of the type to undergo the conversion into an EV , the first being a low-powered proof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the entire project being completed in 41 days . <p> This one , known as the JKR EVC 2 , scales the tech up , essentially commissioned to answer a few questions , from gleaning in-depth knowledge about conversion aspects to looking at the viability of converting the government 's fleet of old internal combustion engine ( ICE ) vehicles to electric ones . As it turns out , the project has also helped to define policies , providing valuable information for the EV conversion ( EVC ) guidelines being drafted by the road transport department ( JPJ ) . <p> Some notes about the Pajero EV . Its diesel mill has been replaced by a 90 kW ( 120 hp ) permanent magnet synchronous reluctance motor which offers around 60 to 65 kW of maximum continuous output and 235 Nm of twist . With power sent to the rear wheels , the EVC 2 has a maximum speed of 120 km/h and accomplishes the 0-60 km/h run in 17 seconds . <p> The electric motor is juiced by a 58.36 kWh LiFePo4 ( lithium iron phosphate or LFP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel range of 200 km . Charging is via AC only , with a 6.6 kW onboard charger getting the battery from a zero to 90% state of charge in around eight hours . <p> The battery , which sits at the rear of the vehicle , weighs 400 kg , essentially making it a like for like replacement for the discarded engine and other hardware at the front , with the weight being redistributed to the back of the car . There 's around 75 kg of additional weight , brought about by electrical components ( motor , inverter , DC-to-DC converter ) , and the suspension has been suitably modified . <p> Work on the car began on September 12 last year , with the project involving a number of parties , including JKR 's mechanical and electrical department teams as well as those from collaboration partners EMAR Technology , UniKL , BateriKu , Vector Labs and Celcom . <p> Initial work -- from October to December -- consisted of the removal of the Pajero 's engine and doing up the bodywork , including painting the car . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design was undertaken , and from March to mid-June , component installation and system integration work was carried out , with running trials beginning after that . <p> Incidentally , though it is a prototype , WDP 4161 is fully road-legal , with the department being given a two-year approval to run the vehicle as a R&amp;D testbed by the JPJ . Interestingly , the road tax -- which is of course zero -- for the EVC 2 is vaild all the way to 2027 , suggesting that road legality for it could extend all the way to then . EV conversions are currently not legal but authorisation can given by the JPJ in special cases , such as for demonstrators or testing . <p> While interesting , the initiative to convert the Pajero is also intriguing , given that the department is associated with the construction of roads and government infrastructure , and EV conversions are well off the scope for it . Why then , was the question posed to Megat Zuhairy Megat Tajuddin , former engineering director of JKR , the man behind the electric Pajero . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JKR builds roads and government buildings and infrastructure . Yes , that 's our core business , but one of our roles is also maintaining the government fleet , and given the country 's aim of working towards a low-carbon footprint , it is only natural to look at ways to electrify the government 's vehicle fleet , " he said . <p> " Back in 2021 , the department was asked to see how it could assist with that aim . From the JKR perspective , I thought of how we could improve the infrastructure of providing EV chargers in government buildings or in areas involving public roads , " he said . <p> At that point , Megat said he needed an EV to understand the requirements . " I did not have the budget to buy a new car , but we found several partners , one of which was looking into EV conversions , and so we decided to explore that avenue , " he said . As for the choice of the Pajero , it was pretty much ordained . " When I requested a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of old Pajeros that it was willing to provide for the project , " he explained . <p> While it started off as an exercise to deliver an EV for determining infrastructure requirements , the project quickly became larger than the vehicle , evolving into an aim to make sure that EV conversions were viable and feasible in Malaysia . " Although it started out as an internal project , we have now been called to be part of the national EV initiative as a member for process and procedure , " he said . <p> Besides aiding the establishment of conversion guidelines , he said it has also opened the road for new opportunities , especially for the country . " One is that in order to carry out conversions to required regulations , it is necessary to ensure that those who are doing that work are competent , " he stated . <p> As such , training becomes crucial , and so the idea is to eventually establish certification for workshops , starting with JKR 's own workshops . " This will provide a model or reference for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public , " he said . He added that conversions would also benefit local component manufacturers , as parts will surely be needed for the activity . <p> The cost of the Pajero conversion ? Around RM150,000 , which does n't make for a good business case , but with scale this can easily be halved and eventually trimmed further , Megat explained . " Of course it has to have economies of scale . Doing one is not feasible , but go into thousands and it will adjust . The larger picture is how it will benefit local component manufacturers , " he said . <h> Anthony Lim <p> Anthony Lim believes that nothing is better than a good smoke and a car with character , with good handling aspects being top of the prize heap . Having spent more than a decade and a half with an English tabloid daily never being able to grasp the meaning of brevity or being succinct , he wags his tail furiously at the idea of waffling - in greater detail - about cars and all their intrinsic peculiarities here . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine conversion workshops but the waiting list could take up to years due to its specialization and scarcity . I think this could work in Malaysia to complement the sale of new EVs . I 'm sure many car owners here do n't mind replacing their petrol engine to an electric motor as long as they can keep their car . This is a highly specialized field that can be explored and expanded to create skilled job opportunities in our automotive industry . 
@@102422231 <h> NanoMalaysia REVIVE initiative -- will EV conversions of ICE cars be legalised in Malaysia in the near future ? <p> In an earlier report on the NanoMalaysia Energy Storage Technology Initiative ( NESTI ) programme , it was mentioned by the ministry of science , technology and innovation ( MOSTI ) that the Enabling Mobility Electrification for Green Economy ( EMERGE ) programme by NanoMalaysia has received funding from the Strategic Research Fund under the Malaysia Grand Challenge . <p> One of the initiatives under EMERGE is the Rapid Electric Vehicles Innovation Validation Ecosystem ( REVIVE ) , which was created to focus on the " conversion of regular engines to electric engines . " The Bernama report did n't provide additional information on this specific matter , but it can be assumed that this involves converting cars that use an internal combustion engine ( ICE ) to feature a fully electric drive system instead . <p> To recap , under the Road Transport Act 1987 , Section 6(1) states that it is unlawful ( i.e. , illegal ) to use a motor vehicle which " does not comply with the rules as to construction , weight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description of motor vehicle to which such motor vehicle belongs . " <p> This is pretty straightforward , as it means if your car does n't conform to its original specification , it ca n't be used on public roads . However , the department can provide authorisation to cars that are built for special purposes like testing , which is something we 've seen in the past like EV Innovations ' MyKar that is based on a Honda Jazz . <p> Meanwhile , Motor Vehicles ( Construction and Use ) Rules 1959 , which received a revision in the form of the Motor Vehicles ( Construction and Use ) ( Amendment ) Rules 2011 , saw the addition of rules 9A and 9B . These state that a motor vehicle can not be constructed unless it has received prior approval of the director general . Again , it 's pretty direct , indicating you ca n't build a car on your own unless you have been given the approval to do so . <p> This includes electric motor vehicles that must meet certain specifications when it comes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ installation -- electric motorcycles must meet the MS 2413 specification as well . Other requirements for an electric motor vehicle include bearing a clear , distinct and untampered motor serial number and chassis number ; have a maximum design speed exceeding 50 km/h ; and have a climbing capability exceeding 20% gradient . <p> With the slight exception mentioned above , the general public ca n't simply put an electric motor into their existing ICE cars and drive them on public roads . However , could the REVIVE initiative we talked about at the start pave the way for EV conversions of ICE cars to be legalised in Malaysia ? <p> This could be a reality , although it will certainly require government bodies to work together and establish necessary standards for such conversions as well as rule amendments . A proper way to validate ICE cars that have been converted to EVs is also important , given that EVs run on high-voltage systems and require critical safeguards in the event of an accident . <p> Realistically , converting an ICE car to become an EV requires a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This wo n't be something that the average car owner is capable of , but companies set up specifically and certified to carry out these conversions are feasible . <p> Depending on the impact of the REVIVE initiative , there could come a day where you can bring your ICE car to an approved company and have it converted to run on electric power . What are your thoughts on this ? Is this something worth exploring to promote the adoption of EVs in Malaysia ? <h> Gerard Lye <p> Originating from the corporate world with a background in finance and economics , Gerard 's strong love for cars led him to take the plunge into the automotive media industry . It was only then did he realise that there are more things to a car than just horsepower count . <p> The EV ownership culture should not begin only with the purchase of factory built EVs , but also with the conversion of old ICE vehicles to electric power . At least , such conversions will give the technically inclined more educational &amp; career opportunities . <p> Unlike in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professionally trained , expensive they may be , here would you put your life for a bawah pokok pomen to convert it ? Do remember these EV are dealing with huge KW of DC electric power which is fatal . There must be certain standards for conversion and must be done at JPJ approved workshops and by certified installers . <p> Alan , you 're the one who first mentioned about under-the-tree-mechanics over here , not me . If EV conversions are allowed in Malaysia , there will be local companies that offer such services after obtaining the necessary approvals , and then would n't there be job opportunities for those who are interested in this ' new ' line of business ? <p> In well regulated countries there are no such things as bawah pokok pomen . If authorities allows it , who to stop an unlicensed pomen from offering superduper cheap conversions vs a proper job done at authorised centers ? Do n't kid yourself , we live in Malaysia not UK . Things that are doable in UK could be dangerous to us , like going around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first comment I 've posted here for this news article does not mention ' bawah pokok pomen ' and yet you some how think that I would have a ' bawah pokok pomen ' do an EV conversion . Please share with the other readers here on how you had come to such a conclusion . <p> You presume quote : such conversions will give the technically inclined more educational &amp; career opportunities much the same way one would presume tint installers &amp; accessories shops will give the technically inclined more educational &amp; career opportunities . <p> Imho converting old ICE cars to EVs on a large scale is another one of those ideas which sounds good in theory , but terrible in practice . Just like solar powered cars . <p> For regular cars , the cost of converting , safety testing and re-homologating will probably exceed the value of the car itself . It only makes sense for those classic and collectible cars , which are rare or worth millions ... most of them are just for show and rarely driven anwyays . <p> However , ICE-to-EV conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if manufacturers are forced to future-proof their new ICE cars with the option for EV conversion later on . But then all customers have to subsidize the cost for the few which actually care enough or have the money to upgrade in another 5 or 10 years . <p> Imho the best future-proof solution for old ICE cars is still going to be biofuels of some sort . Most ICE engines since the 1980s can be tuned or modified to accept at least 5 percent ethanol blend . Even Proton 's old CamPro was tuned to accept E20 biofuel ( 20% ethanol , 80% petrol ) in Thailand . Malaysia has ample palm oil production for biofuel , and since the EU is trying to ban palm oil ... <p> Anyway imho , in the near term it 's better if governments could invest in cleaner and more sustainably-sourced biofuels , in conjunction with incentives for new xEVs and Euro 6 engines , as opposed to ICE-to-EV conversions or banning ICEs altogether ... the ultimate priority should be making the national electricity grid more carbon neutral ( while also minimizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converting to EVs at all , if most of our electricity keeps coming from hydrocarbons anyway ... <p> A typical B segment car servicing &amp; spares for 10 years would still not eat up that high PLUS petrol . And you still have n't factor in battery replacement by the time you reach 10 years . Another downside to EV . <p> If the old internal combustion engines , like the ones in the classic Mini or the old 1st gen Range Rover pictured in the article above , are getting more difficult &amp; costly to repair &amp; maintain , EV conversion can be an attractive alternative to the owners , especially if the condition of the body and chassis is still OK . Cost wise would depend on the owners ' own comparisons with the cost of replacing their old vehicles with newer internal combustion engine powered vehicles or new electric powered vehicles . <p> Old cars are inherently unsafe for usage , having outmoded crashworthiness and best be preserved as is , modern ICE engines are built to last , 10 years is nothing in terms of cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 10 year usage and these are made known to public .

@@102447232 <h> Unburdened by the past -- really ? <p> One of US Vice-President Harris ' perplexing statements is about urging that one should just ignore one 's past actions and their impacts and carry on as before . -- AFP photo <p> US Vice-President Kamala Harris has the penchant of coming up with perplexing statements . <p> One such statement was : " We have the ability to see what can be , unburdened by what has been , and then to make the possible actually happen . " <p> Some of her admirers are so enamoured by this , ascribing to it a zen-like comparison , like the Buddhist ' koan ' , the paradoxical anecdote that defies simple logical interpretation . <p> Much like the mind-bending riddle , ' the sound of one hand clapping ' . <p> So taken was Harris by her own collection of words that she reused them ( with slight variations ) several times at different occasions . However , the key words that caught my attention are " ... unburdened by what has been ( the past ) .

It led to their profound political and economic development on the one hand , and the underdevelopment and devastation of the rest of the world on the other . <p> Despite the fact that the Global North is predominantly Christian , the concept ' unburdened by the past ' is rather un-Christian . <p> The phrase ' sins of the fathers ' appears in a number of the books in the Bible . The phrase is linked to the sin of breaking the ' 10 Commandments ' and the consequences of such sin passing through the generations . <p> The children of those who sin do , in fact , inherit the seed of sin , in other words -- the inter-generational consequences . The Book of Exodus ( 20.5 ) expressly said : " ... For I , the Lord your God , am a jealous God , punishing the children for the sin of the parents to the third and fourth generation of those who hate me .

In the street of Hanoi , I came across a few limbless men . They carried placards that read : " For the Americans , the war ended in 1975 , but not for us . " <p> In April this year the British newspaper , The Guardian , carried an article headlined ' The 50-year fight to clear US bombs from Laos ' . The journalist interviewed a team of brave people . They are members of the bomb-clearance charity , the Mines Advisory Group ( MAG ) . <p> As part of its operation in the Vietnam War ( 1964-1975 ) , American pilots flew 580,000 attack sorties over Laos , then a neutral country but suffered the fate of being contiguous to Vietnam , the site of the war . <p> There was an average of one planeload of bombs every eight minutes for almost a decade . <p> By the time the last US bombs fell in April 1973 , a total of 2,093,100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Laos , a country of just seven million people , retains the dubious accolade of being the most heavily-bombed country in the world per capita .

There were 63 accidents in 2021 alone . <p> Yes , Laotians are still being killed and injured as a result of a conflict that ended five decades ago . <p> Indian analyst , commentator and historian Vijay Prashad laid it out plainly and bluntly in his speech at the Glasgow UK , Climate Justice Coalition People 's Summit in November 2021 . <p> The Summit was on defining ' Environmental Justice , Climate Change and the Connection of Pollution to Colonialism ' . <p> I quote liberally and in parts : " When I walked the streets of cities like Glasgow , the second most important city in the UK ; beautiful buildings , beautiful streets , a gorgeous city .

There are dozens of such videos floating around on the Internet . I am sure many of us would have seen some of them . <p> The scene : a college 's big celebration in a stadium -- band playing , students marching , dignitaries making rousing speeches .

In fact , these companies are so flush with cash that they are capable of paying off their debt instantly . <p> Even though it may seem that Amazon has a lot of total debt , its earnings before interest and taxes ( EBIT ) can cover its interest expense nine times over , thus making its debt unthreatening . <p> As the technology sector continues to consolidate , smaller and unprofitable companies would either go down under , or get acquired by the larger companies . <p> Adding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong moats and pricing power , these factors mentioned above would further hinder the ability of smaller companies to disrupt the industry . <p> Furthermore , while these big tech companies are listed and mainly operate in the US , they have a global business model , making them more resilient even if a specific country or region is experiencing slowing growth . <p> Lastly , the products and services offered by these big tech companies are deeply entrenched in our everyday lives , ranging from consumers to corporates . It would be difficult to imagine how the world operates without Google , Microsoft Office or Amazon Web Services . <p> Meanwhile on the social media front , humans are deeply connected to one another on services like Instagram and continue to communicate on WhatsApp , making Meta a stronghold in today 's world .

With its early years of manufacture focused upon small cars , vans and work trucks , its breakthrough with mass-producing a new engine design came nearly 50 years after the company 's founding . <p> Mazda 's first rotary engine-powered model , the Cosmo Sport 110S was unveiled on May 30 , 1967 . However , it was in 1961 that Mazda licensed the then-new engine design from NSU Motorenwerke -- the Wankel engine was named after German engineer Felix Wankel , who was an engineer at NSU . <p> Motorsports fans may remember the quad-rotor 26B engine-powered Mazda 787B which , at the hands of Volker Weidler , Johnny Herbert , and Bertrand Gachot , won the Le Mans 24 Hours race in 1991 .

There was also the Premacy Hydrogen RE Hybrid , which paired an electric motor with the dual fuel-capable hydrogen rotary engine . <p> A generator converted the engine 's output to electricity , which then drove an electric motor to drive the wheels . This series hybrid system grew the hydrogen fuel range to 200 km , while maximum output grew by 40% , according to Mazda . Like the RX-8 Hydrogen RE before it , the Premacy Hydrogen RE Hybrid was also leased to government bodies and energy companies , in 2009 . This would also later spawn a range extender EV model , which added a high-voltage battery in place of petrol . <p> Mazda is n't counting on past glory and legacy models such as these to keep the rotary engine alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engine design was sighted following the unveiling of the RX-Vision concept at the 2015 Tokyo Motor Show .

@@103085233 <p> Following its global debut in September this year , the all-new Subaru Crosstrek has now gone on sale in Japan . The name may be unfamiliar to us because we know the crossover as the XV here in Malaysia , but it is n't for customers in North America . <p> Previously known as the XV Crosstrek in that part of the world , Subaru has dropped the ' XV ' moniker since 2015 , and for the third-generation model , it simply went with a single global nameplate , the Crosstrek . <p> In its latest form , the Crosstrek measures 4,480 mm long , 1,800 mm wide , 1,575 mm tall and has a wheelbase spanning 2,670 mm . That makes it slightly longer than its predecessor by 15 mm and with a decreased height by 40 mm , although the width and wheelbase remain identical . The ground clearance is a relatively off-road-friendly 200 mm . <p> Along with the revised dimensions , the crossover , which is built on an updated version of the Subaru Global Platform ( SGP ) , also sees an evolution of its design . The profile is a familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleeker headlamps that are visually connected by a trim piece running across a larger hexagonal-shaped grille . <p> The fog lamp surrounds are also made more prominent , while the side surfaces have been tidied up to have less creases . As per convention , there 's cladding over the wheel arches and rocker panels , the former with air extractor vents on the front . As for the rear , the brand 's signature C-shaped taillights replace the blocky units of the past , while the lower apron receives rugged-looking trim in matte black . <p> Inside , the Crosstrek follows in the WRX 's footsteps by adopting a portrait-format infotainment touchscreen that integrates the controls for the climate system . Measuring 11.6 inches diagonally , the display is flanked by vertical air vents on the simpler dashboard that retains an analogue instrument cluster and a familiar steering wheel . <p> On that mention , the Crosstrek gets just one engine option in Japan , which is a FB20 2.0 litre naturally-aspirated flat-four that is augmented by a 48-volt mild hybrid system . The latter consists of a 4.8-Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MA1 electric motor rated at 13.6 PS ( 13.4 hp or 10 kW ) and 65 Nm of torque . <p> The electric motor is sandwiched between the FB20 and Lineartronic CVT , with the entire system providing outputs of 145 PS ( 143 hp or 107 kW ) at 6,000 rpm and 188 Nm at 4,000 rpm . Based on the WLTC standard , the fuel economy rating is 16.4 km/l for the front-wheel drive variant and 15.8 km/l for the all-wheel drive . <p> That 's right , the Crosstrek is available as a front-wheel drive model in Japan , which is a little unusual given Subaru 's Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive is the default for powertrains on most of its cars . One reasoning for providing a FWD powertrain is likely as a cheaper alternative for customers in the country . <p> The base Touring trim with FWD costs 2.662 million yen ( RM86,716 ) inclusive of Japan 's 10% consumption tax , while the AWD version goes for 2.882 million yen ( RM93,883 ) .

@@103085234 <p> The facelifted Subaru XV was launched in Malaysia in December , sporting a mildly updated look and several new features , including some much-needed safety equipment . Now , we have a full live gallery of the refreshed second-generation crossover , allowing you to pore over every detail . <p> As previously reported , the new Subaru XV is priced at RM139,788 for the 2.0i-P EyeSight variant , while the car you see here , the GT Edition , goes for RM146,788 . Both figures are on-the-road without insurance and include the full sales and service tax ( SST ) rebate for locally-assembled CKD vehicles ( valid until June 30 ) , as well as a five-year/100,000 km warranty . <p> Whichever variant you plump for , you 'll get an unchanged FB20D 2.0 litre naturally-aspirated , direct-injected flat-four engine , producing 156 PS at 6,000 rpm and 196 Nm of torque . As before , the mill is mated to a Lineartronic CVT and Subaru 's trademark symmetrical all-wheel drive .

This likely explains the RM8,000 premium over the outgoing model . <p> As far as facelifts go , the XV 's is relatively minor , adding a bunch of **26;497;TOOLONG visual changes . These include a revised front bumper with L-shaped corners , a new grille mesh , a very slight headlight redesign and revamped 17-inch two-tone alloy wheels . The GT Edition adds front and rear bumper spoilers and deeper side skirts , plus silver trim and the same unique 17-inch rollers as before ( the petal-like design is identical to the Thai version 's , but they 're an inch smaller ) . <p> The Impreza-derived interior and its XV-specific orange stitching has been largely untouched , but Subaru has seen fit to add an eight-way power-adjustable driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auto brake hold .

The latest generation of Subaru 's soft-roader Impreza drops its XV badge and is now known as the Subaru Crosstrek globally . <p> The Subaru Crosstrek name is of course not new to the model , as it was called by either the Crosstrek or XV names with previous generation cars , but Subaru has now decided on Crosstrek as a single name . <p> A large 11.6 inch vertical touchscreen takes the focus of the new Crosstrek 's interior , though the instrument panel in front of the driver continues to use analog meters for the speedometer and RPM meter , with the only digital portion being a small multi-info display in between them . <p> Flanking the vertical touchscreen are hardware buttons for AC temp and audio volume , but we do note that AC fan speed now has to be controlled digitally . That 's one thing we usually wish to have hardware controls , but at least the volume is still a physical knob . <p> Subaru says the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is said to prevent vehicle swaying motions from being transferred to the head . In addition , the seat mounting structure has been changed , now with the seat rails attached directly to the body instead of using a bracket . Subaru says this increases mounting-connection stiffness and improves vibration damping while reducing seat sway . <p> Subaru only mentions one engine option in its press release -- a 2.0 litre e-Boxer , which is a non-plugin hybrid model . Does it mean the Crosstrek will only be available as a hybrid ? Or will it continue to be available with a 2.0 pure normally aspirated model like how it has been sold as in Malaysia ? <p> The 2.0 litre e-Boxer system puts an electric motor in between the internal combustion engine and the Lineartronic CVT . No specs for system output has been provided for now . But if it is a development of the previous gen 's e-Boxer system , then it should be using a 48V battery . BTW just to point out , e-Boxer is not the same as the XV plug-in hybrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of active safety , Subaru 's EyeSight system now adds on a wide-angle mono camera to work together with the existing EyeSight stereo camera . Subaru says the wide-angle mono camera allows better recognition of pedestrians and motorcycles to allow initiation of pre-collision braking in a wider range of situations , such as at intersections , thanks to its wider field of view . <p> Are you an existing XV owner ?

Overall , I 'm fine with the size as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boot space is too small . It 's about the same size as a Golf or CX3 but physically , it 's a much bigger vehicle . This new Crosstrek could have fixed that shortcoming but it looks about the same , but I 'll wait for the actual car to be here to confirm that . <p> And personally , they went overboard with the plastic cladding in weird shapes trying to make it look different . Fortunately , that can be hidden by choosing the diamond black paint ... or whatever name they called this very dark gray paint . <p> Everything sounds and looks great except the front cabin . I though the center console ( two-tiered screen ) of the current model is ugly until I saw this new version with the 11.6 ? touchscreen . What an ugly design ! ! ! What is Subaru thinking ? !

Comparing space size lah , plastic here there lah , air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take it to some winding road aka Genting and Menora Tunnel climb and you will see how this XV shine ! ! . The asymmetrical 4WD and Boxer engine is UNBEATABLE in terms of handling compare to other SUV . NO , please do n't bring in Sedan car to compare ! ! <p> I 'm existing XV owner here , having is for more than 4 yrs . Let make it simple . Subaru best part is handling . Worse part is low quality parts . From new car the till 4xxxx km the coiling coil need to replace . The seat control panel broken . The door did not close fit . Need to slam the driver door bit hard . The AWD is the best , the tyre did n't swap front and rear but 4 tyre marks fading very equally .

The engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boot is small but the rear leg room is spacious . If cruising more than 120km/h it won ; t go faster enough as you wish .

Touted as a luxury segment adventure-tourer , the LXP Orioli counts its equipment , technical features , choice of materials and attention to detail as its plus points , with a focus on performance both on- and off-road . <p> Power for the LXP Orioli comes from a new 931 cc , inline three-cylinder , developed entirely in MV Agusta 's Varese , Italy , plant . With the engine weighing 57 kg , the LXP Orioli gets 124 hp at 10,000 rpm and 102 Nm of torque at 7,000 rpm , with 85% of torque available at 3,000 rpm . <p> The engine is contained in an alloy perimeter frame with removable sub-frame , coupled to an aluminium alloy swingarm .

@@103273238 <h> Carro Care Body and Paint centre will respray your car with techniques refined by a Japanese spray master <p> Over the past few months we have been occasionally running promos for full car respray service at Carro Care 's Body and Paint centres in USJ and Ulu Tiram , Johor . In fact , there is a current promo running up to the end of September where you can do a full respray of your car from just RM2,250 , which is a 25% discount off the normal list price . <p> Of course being the enthusiasts that you are , some of you really love your cars and would not want just any random person tackling something as big as a repainting job , so there have been some questions posed on social media such as who is running the show at the body and paint centre , and if they are experienced enough to do the job . <p> So today we would like to introduce Jumpei Yamamoto , who leads the team over at the Carro Care Body and Paint centres . Yama-san , as he is referred to affectionately by his staff , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spray paint techniques . <p> Yama-san 's resume , as we found on Linkedin , is an impressive one . He has been in the painting business for 25 years and he specialises in auto repair . <p> He has accumulated a wealth of experience at companies like Mitsubishi Motors , Rock Paint Co . Ltd. and even as a Japanese civil servant teaching painting techniques for the Advanced Technical College Painting Course . Yes , under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health , Labor and Welfare , he has served as a chief examiner for national qualifications in Japan . <p> He proudly says " I have 10 years of experience as a painting teacher all over Japan and I have never heard of a Japanese person with an experience like mine . " <p> A full car respray job starts with body work . Before a car is repainted , the body needs to be perfectly smooth . The Carro Care team uses a paint thickness gauge to measure the thickness of the paint . They also carefully examine the body for defects , which they mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the problem areas to be smoothed out so the expert painters can apply paint without issue . <p> Once the examination is complete , any imperfections , such as dents and dings , are knocked out as much as possible until the body is level . In areas that can not be completely smoothed out , putty is used to level the car body by filling in cracks and dings . <p> Now , to ensure the surface is fully even , a primer is applied as the undercoat for the paint . The surface is then dry sanded which removes excess material and rust to create a perfectly smooth finish . Dry sanding is superior to wet sanding as it uses no liquid which is crucial as moisture can react with paint during and after application , creating imperfections like bubbles . Not even deep scratches will remain after a professionally done dry sanding process . <p> Nippon automotive paint is used for the painting process . But first , the colour has to be produced to specification , be it the original car 's colour or the owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team must first complete colour matching . This is done by mixing small amounts of paint and comparing them to the requested colour . This is done repeatedly until the test batch perfectly matches the requested colour . Only then does our expert produce an entire batch of paint for application . <p> This is an important step in the process , especially if you are doing accident repair . If it is not done properly you might get a front end of a car that has a completely different colour as the rest of the car . Like Yama-san says in one of his Linkedin posts , with practice , anyone can paint . But I will paint it as it was originally . I will recreate the original . <p> First , the base coat prepared earlier is applied , Next , a clear coat is applied to protect the base coat from scratches and UV light . At each stage , the painters move steadily and smoothly to ensure an even layer is applied to the car . <p> To maintain strict quality control and ensure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars , ensuring that every car is spray painted to perfection . <p> We have seen Yama-san 's team 's work in person , and perhaps you might have as well . If you were at the EVX 2023 electric vehicle expo earlier this year , you might have noticed an orange BMW X4 at myTukar 's booth . The X4 was not wrapped , but instead it was fully repainted to the new orange colour . Many were attracted to the car 's beautiful paint job and some even offered to buy it on the spot . Orange is a good colour for the X4 as it gives an image of an X4 ' GTS ' , since the M3 GTS is orange . <p> If you plan to keep your car longer , giving it a brand new coat of paint can make you fall in love with it all over again because it will look like it just rolled off the assembly line .

@@103497231 <h> The more affordable tablet does n't quite match expectations . <p> Last month , Samsung introduced its new Galaxy Tab S9 FE lineup , which is a stripped down and relatively affordable alternative to its flagship Tab S9 series . To get the price down , the company had to cut some corners , but it did maintain the premium look of the original lineup and then some . The question is , are the sacrifices worth the smaller price tag ? <h> What Am I Looking At ? <p> The one I 've been tinkering with over the past couple of weeks is the bigger Plus variant , which sports a 12.4-inch 2560 ? 1600 LCD display with a refresh rate of only 90Hz . It runs on Samsung 's in-house Exynos 1380 chipset and can be configured with up to 12GB RAM and 256GB of storage with a microSD card for storage expansion . Connectivity-wise , the Galaxy Tab S9 FE supports Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 , as well as 5G if you get the cellular model . <p> On the camera side , it has two 8MP cameras on the back made up of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses a 12MP front shooter within the horizontal bezel . Powering it is a massive 10,090mAh battery with support for 45W charging . For protection , the tablet comes with a dust and water resistance rating of IP68 . It also ships out with a regular S Pen but you should know that it does work with the S Pen Pro , which is sold separately . <h> What 's Good About It ? <p> The Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus has a very premium-feeling build , with a solid metal chassis and flat edges for an industrial design . As for the display , its bezels are thicker than I would like but overall , it does n't have any noticeable impact on my daily usage . The display can get as bright as 720 nits , which is n't the brightest but more than good enough for indoor usage . <p> As someone who only uses a tablet to watch YouTube videos and scroll on social media , this device can last quite a while . I can comfortably go a solid three days without charging it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking of watching content , the speakers of the Tab S9 FE are fantastic ; it gets loud , not too bassy , and outputs clear vocals , which is great for watching shows on it . <p> Along with the high-quality speakers , the horizontally-placed selfie shooter makes video calling quite pleasant . Personally , I 'm really glad this horizontal camera placement trend is catching on for tablets because I think I speak for everyone when I say that it 's the most natural orientation for this form-factor when making video calls . <p> The free included S Pen is remarkably fun and undoubtedly useful , coming with pressure and tilt sensitivity as well as a button to activate its function menu . There are , of course , embedded features that let you quickly take notes by just double tapping while holding down the action button , even with the screen turned off . <p> For convenience , you can magnetically attach the S Pen to the back and even on the left and right sides of the tablet ( or the top and bottom sides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnetically charges when you attach it to the back and it 's orientation-agnostic , meaning it does n't matter if the tip is faced towards or away from the cameras . <h> What 's The Catch ? <p> It 's no surprise that there 's going to be a significant difference between the 120Hz AMOLED panel in the Tab S9 lineup and the 90Hz LCD display used for the Tab S9 FE series . 90Hz just does n't feel nearly as smooth , especially for a screen this big , and the lack of deep blacks means that cinematic shots in movies do n't look as good , which is important for a supposedly premium content-consuming machine like this one . <p> To get even more persnickety , the display feels a bit rough for some reason . I had some folks compare using this tablet with the touch display on phones and it was agreed that it 's just not as smooth . I found that to be the case personally as I kept gravitating towards using the S Pen over my fingers because it did n't feel very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the issue of handleability . I 'm not sure where the extra weight came from , but the Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus is 46g heavier than its Tab S9 Plus counterpart , despite sporting the same-sized display and battery . This makes the tablet quite difficult to hold for long periods and it means that a stand is a necessary accessory . It does n't help that the magnets holding the pen are n't very strong , with the pen easily detaching and falling off whenever I pick up the tablet . <p> I experienced several issues with the software , as most people using Android tablets will tell you . In Samsung 's case , there were several instances where the animation would stutter , which does n't actually impact the performance overall but it does make the tablet feel cheap at times . The company did roll out an update that seemed to fix this issue temporarily , but the bug eventually returned . <p> Another software problem I encountered was with the charging of the S Pen . Unlike certain tablets from other brands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ status of the stylus when its attached to the back and while a battery indicator is supposed to pop up if I hold down the action button while it 's charging , I could n't get this function to work even after several attempts . <p> While I 've given Samsung a lot of credit for the camera placement , the quality of those camera sensors is nothing to brag about . While the front snapper is relatively acceptable for video calling and the like , the rear shooters are just a noisy mess and the low quality is apparent when you 're looking through the cameras on a large display . <h> Should I Buy It ? <p> The Samsung Galaxy Tab S9 FE Plus looks great and is definitely well-built , but the compromises the brand made to get it to this price point has made it difficult to recommend . While most people likely wo n't care that much about the rear camera quality on a tablet , the flaws in its software are something that ca n't be ignored . This could potentially be improved with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy a product based on how it performs as it ships . <p> Additionally , the substandard display panel and infuriatingly weak magnets for the S Pen are a constant reminder that this device is Samsung 's economic offering of sorts . And with a starting price of RM2,799 for the Wi-Fi only model , it 's not exactly in the affordable category either . My two cents : you 're likely better off getting a more powerful tablet at a similar price point or coughing up a bit more for an iPad.

Such children would typically show the court that their non-Malaysian mother 's country of origin 's embassy had certified they do not have passports from those nations , with the outcome then depending on the court 's evaluation of the facts and laws on a case-by-case basis . ) <p> Civil society groups who advocate for stateless persons in Malaysia have highlighted the importance of Section 1(e) as a safeguard to prevent more individuals in the country from becoming stateless . <p> Today , DHRRA said the deputy home minister 's explanation of the proposed removal of Section 1(e) to prevent alleged " misuse " by groups such as illegitimate children " does not hold water as this law is not applicable if one already has another country 's citizenship " . <p> " This reasoning is not only unfounded but also misguides the public 's perception of the issue of statelessness , " DHRRA 's director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pointing out that those who are already citizens of another country would not be able to be recognised as Malaysian citizens under Section 1(e) . <p> " Secondly , the government should treat all children equally , regardless of whether they are born inside or outside of wedlock , when determining their eligibility for citizenship . Malaysia is one of only two countries globally that discriminate against men in passing their nationality to children born out of wedlock , " DHRRA added . <p> Based on the Malaysian government 's interpretation of the Federal Constitution in court cases , children born in Malaysia can not automatically be Malaysians even if they have Malaysian fathers , if their father was not married to the non-Malaysian mother at the time of the child 's birth . <p> " This law has long been a source of statelessness , and it needs reform .
