To African Americans , they are testaments to the horrors of the transatlantic slave trade . But to many Ghanaians , they are significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Fort Metal Cross embodies all of these meanings . It served the British , primarily as a fort for holding , trading goods and slaves , but after the slave trade was abolished in 1808 , it was used variously as a police station , a post office and a telephone exchange . <p> In 1983 , the Ghanaian government turned it into a museum and a guest house , which suited local traditional elites because the proceeds from visitor fees , though modest , were shared with the local chiefs . <p> However , his goal has always been to enhance the site for tourists who want to visit a " British castle in West Africa " -- complete with a restaurant , a conference centre , a swimming pool , a classical garden and chalets modelled along the architectural motifs of the fort . <p> To realise this vision , he had to clear the land around the building , which meant relocating local residents to 150 new homes on a nearby hillside . Additionally , Fidler graded the road to nearby Busua and built a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some friends from the UK , he also constructed a school for children near the fort . All of this , Fidler insists , was done with his own money , and always with the blessing of local chiefs . <p> But while Mr. Fidler 's efforts to redevelop Fort Metal Cross have satisfied some people in Dixcove , others are miffed about what he has done . <p> Some villagers who spoke to the paper indicated that Mr. Fidler used a slingshot to hurl stones at people defecating at the shoreline of the castle , despite the fact that there are few toilets available in that neighborhood . <p> The fishermen of Dixcove have registered complaints about the way Mr. Fidler enclosed the site with fences and a rock wall . They claim that , in 2011 , the rock wall obstructed attempts to save five fishermen whose boats capsized in the harbour . <p> The sub-chiefs of Upper Dixcove have also noted that Fidler refused to open Fort Metal Cross for a full day during the annual Kundum Festival . But most importantly , the locals feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the castle site . <p> Fidler is saddened to hear that he has become a scapegoat for the demise of fishermen at sea . He personally witnessed two of the fisherman drown during the storm and is adamant that his sea defenses did not impede rescue efforts . And as for the fences , Fidler has stated that he built a wall around the castle only to prevent people from defecating on his land . <p> Moreover , he has noted that there is currently no chief in Dixcove and that the priests and chiefs have not observed the Kundum Festival for years . <p> Today found out that Mr. Fidler also has another set of grievances to contend with from his leasors . Mr. Barth Acheampong , Public Relations Officer of the Ghana Museums and Monuments Board , has stated plainly that Fidler has violated the historic integrity of Fort Metal Cross .

But most significantly , the Monuments Board argues that Fidler 's renovations have damaged the archeological ' buffer zone ' around the castle . <p> Mr. Fidler , however , disputes these claims . He has stated that he raised the Union Jack because Fort Metal Cross was built by the British , and that he always raised the Ghanaian flag to accompany it . Though he describes himself as a " keen Christian , " he has stated that the presence of the African Gateway Chapel in the fort was only temporary . <p> And as for new construction around the fort , Fidler states that he is astonished to hear that he violated his agreement because the blueprints for the project were approved by the Cape Coast office of the Monuments Board . <p> Some tourists are also concerned with what is happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man is living in the castle is distasteful for some , as is the way that Fidler has modeled the hotel chalets on the crenellated ramparts of a former slave fort . But Fidler asserts that if he had not taken steps to preserve Fort Metal Cross it would have become " another ruined monument , " and that tourists who visit the fort appreciate what he is doing . <p> Nonetheless , Mr. Fidler 's hold on the lease of Fort Metal Cross is tenuous . Currently , the Monuments Board is refusing to accept his monthly payments . The stage is now set for a potential legal battle , as Mr. Fidler has vowed to fight any attempt to nullify his lease .

How does the whole scenario play out in light of International registrations of aircraft and protocols like the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment commonly referred to as The Cape Town Convention ( aircraft equipment ) of which the United States has ratified ? In the US , the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) has been designated as the entry point at which information required for registration in respect of airframes or helicopters pertaining to civil aircraft of the United States or aircraft to become a civil aircraft of the United States are to be transmitted . <p> Trustee and Lessee partnership in the US <p> One would like to know what all this hullabaloo about trustship and lessee is all about and how does it play out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trustee owns an aircraft on behalf of an entity or individual . The trust is established as an extension of the true owner , also called the trustor or trust beneficiary . The trustee acts for the beneficiary and the aircraft is titled and registered in the name of the trustee . This relationship is often called an owner trust because the benefit of the trust and all assets go to the true owner of the trust . It is important to note that this structure has been approved by the FAA and , because of the documents that are filed , the FAA is well aware of the identity of the beneficiary . So in the case of N604EP , federal aviation records show the plane is held in a trust by the Bank of Utah . Bank of Utah acts as a trustee for investors like Engineers and Planners ( E&amp;P ) who have a financial stake in the plane . Benefits of Trustee and Lessee partnerships Trusteeship aids international investors like E&amp;P to obtain FAA registration . It is a very flexible and readily accepted vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A trust is easy to establish and can be completed in two or three days ; it can be undone just as easily . It is a vehicle designed to simplify certain aspects of aircraft ownership , and for many international investors and business entities , it is by far the easiest and cheapest way to obtain FAA registration . Owner trusts may be established for a variety of purposes , including FAA registration , structural purposes , simplification purposes or convenience . One of the main reasons for establishing a trust is that a foreign citizen , limited partnership or other party which does not qualify for FAA registration on its own can use a trust to get a valid registration for its aircraft . The FAA is a desirable registry , is widely accepted and generally assures a higher resale value for aircraft that remain US registered . Many foreign parties operate aircraft within the US , and many foreign investors own aircraft being leased to or otherwise operated by US carriers . These situations will necessitate some sort of accommodation for registration purposes , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accomplish this . FAA records reflect the trustee as the titled and registered owner , rather than the true owner or beneficiary , which makes it more challenging for a third party to determine who really owns the aircraft . A trust can be used to maintain FAA registry for a short , long or indefinite period of time . It is commonly used to export an aircraft or to have refitting done before export .

For an American registered aircraft to fly into Iran , the Lessee or operator will normally require under United States law , prior approval from the Treasury Department 's Office of Foreign Assets Control , the federal government 's primary enforcer of sanctions against Iran . This will have to be done to avoid violating a complicated patchwork of rules governing trade . If E&amp;P or the Trustees did not seek the authorization from the department , then it could possibly face some sanctions . There is also another complication involving the need for clearance from the US Commerce Department , since of this particular aircraft is powered by engines made by General Electric a US company and as part of the whole sanctions package , require prior authorization for US-made parts to touch down on Iranian soil .

Presidents both past and present have at one time or the other utilised commercial transport and chartered aircraft for official travels abroad .

How much was expended as operational cost in terms of the charter , fuel , overflight and navigational charges , per diem and lodging for crew , catering and airport parking and handling charges ? Did the money come from the consolidated funds and does it not raise issues of conflict of interest ? Why were other Ghanaian operators like AWA and Starbow not given the opportunity to bid in such a proposition ? Or as usual it was a case of sole sourcing ?

@@1871239 <h> Who answers to 2016 NPP flagbearership roll call ? <p> Even before the new national executive take a foothold over affairs of the New Patriotic Party ( NPP ) , there is already an indication that the contest for the flagbearership of the party will be exciting , controversial and keen . <p> Before the national executive could declare the ground rules for the flag-bearer race slated for the latter part of this year , three candidates have declared their readiness for the contest . <p> A couple of others have either hinted of participating in the contest or indicated by their actions that they are lacing their boots to contest . <p> The two-time flag bearer of the NPP , Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo , who went into " hibernation " after the Supreme Court ruling on the 2012 election petition , has again declared his intention to run . <p> Arguably the most popular candidate of the party and frontrunner in the race , Nana Akufo-Addo , on his return from the UK , engaged in broad consultations and announced to the media : <p> " I will contest the party 's ticket for the 2016 presidential election . We have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work ; I feel physically , emotionally , psychologically , spiritually and patriotically strong enough to remain in front line politics . " <p> The NPP , with Nana Akufo-Addo as the flag bearer , managed 49.32 per cent in 2008 and 47.74 per cent in the 2012 elections . <p> Mr Alan Kyerematen , a Trade Minister in the Kufuor regime who has , on two occasions , given Nana Akufo-Addo a run for his money in the contest for the flagbearership , has also hinted of contesting again . <p> Mr Kyerematen , who ran against Nana Akufo-Addo in 2008 and 2012 but failed , intends making a third attempt at the flag-bearer slot . Despite the fact that he lost the last two presidential primaries and that his margin of loss increased from some 32 per cent in 2007 to 19 per cent in 2010 , he is confident of making a good showing this time round and has called on party delegates to consider a moderate as the NPP 's flag bearer for the 2016 elections . <p> Dr Kofi Konadu Apraku , also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nana Akufo-Addo 's 2008 campaign and Director in charge of Intelligence and Security for the 2012 Nana Akufo-Addo Campaign , has also declared his intention to contest for the slot . <p> This will be his second attempt . He contested the 2007 presidential primary of the NPP that elected Nana Akufo-Addo for the 2008 presidential election and got 19 votes in a contest with 16 other presidential aspirants . <p> Prof. Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng who also contested in 2007 and 2010 told the Daily Graphic that although he had not declared his intention yet , he would not make a formal statement on phone . <p> Mr Stephen Asamoah-Boateng , one-time Minister of State whose name popped up during discussions on likely candidates of the NPP for the 2016 elections , told the Daily Graphic that he would make his intention known in the not-too-distant future . <p> Mr Kofi Osei Ameyaw , a Deputy Minister in the Kufuor regime and MP for Asuogyaman , has also hinted on various media platforms that a young person must be the face of the NPP in the next election and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the delegates . <p> Although Mr Isaac Osei , the MP for Subin and candidate in the 2010 flag-bearer race , has not spoken formally on the issue , some of his aides have indicated that the Subin MP will have a shot at the slot again . <p> Super delegates ' conference <p> There is no denying the fact that the NPP is heading towards a full-blown flag-bearer contest ahead of time . <p> Party insiders are predicting that many more aspirants will declare their intention to contest the flag-bearer race of the party for the 2016 elections . According to the rules of the party , if more than five aspirants declare their intention , the party will organise a super delegates conference to prune down the number to five . It is recalled that 17 aspirants filed to contest the flagbearership of the NPP in 2007 , while five candidates contested in 2010 . <p> For presidential primaries , the Electoral College of the NPP is wider and seeks to represent a larger proportion of the Ghanaian electorate . <p> The constitution of the party also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national executive will organise a delegates conference to elect a flag bearer within 24 months of a national election . <p> The 24-month time frame has become necessary , since time is needed to heal wounds and for the winner to reconcile with those who will lose the contest and also offer the party and the elected flag bearer ample time to organise and prosecute an effective campaign for elections . <p> The NPP traditionally attracts between 40 and 44 per cent of popular votes . But in view of the requirement of 50 per cent plus 1 of voters to win a presidential election , the party will need to attract floating voters to win the 2016 general election . <p> Intemperate language <p> Already , after the party 's national delegates congress in Tamale , there is a media war among people perceived to be supporters of Nana Akufo-Addo , Mr Kyeremanten and Dr Apraku . <p> Some pundits are predicting that the flag-bearer race will be controversial , with some of the contestants throwing mud at one another . <p> While those on the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead the party to victory in 2016 , those in the Kyeremanten and the Apraku camps believe Nana Akufo-Addo has outlived his usefulness as the NPP flag bearer . <p> Dr Apraku says he wants to be the flag bearer of the NPP because he can provide a crucial difference -- attract floating voters . <p> In a statement to the Daily Graphic , he stated : " We do n't have enough votes to win the elections ourselves and so invariably whoever is selected has to be the one who is capable of balancing and attracting floating voters . " <p> Mr Kyeremanten believes that the party , at this current stage , needs to present a " modest " person as flag bearer for the 2016 general election . <p> He further explained : " When I talk about understanding the voter psychology , we should not look at this in a negative sense . Maybe Ghanaians are looking for somebody who has a moderate disposition , has maybe a certain orientation which Ghanaians are interested in . It could be anything . " <p> According to Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauge the mood of what Ghanaians wanted in a President , since that would help the NPP elect someone who would be accepted by the voter population When the Daily Graphic reached Mr Asamoah-Boateng , he stated : " There is nothing wrong with interested parties declaring their intention to contest the flag-bearer race of the party " but cautioned that " it is not time for flag-bearer contest " . <p> He challenged the newly elected NPP executive to immediately restructure the party from the grass roots , polling stations and constituency levels before going ahead with the flag-bearer contest . <p> But that suggestion has been strongly criticised by some members of the party , especially sympathisers of Nana Akufo-Addo , who argue that there is not much time for the NPP to go through this long-winding process . <p> In their view , it should be possible for the party leadership to come up with a timetable within three or four months for the party to organise a congress to elect a flag bearer for the 2016 polls . <p> They dismissed suggestions that the party was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be strengthened at the polling station level and insisted that the party 's representatives at the polling station levels rather needed education on electoral rules . <p> Avoid verbal wars <p> Considering the intemperate language and tone of the claims and counter-claims by some presidential aspirants , party insiders have called for restraint and calm , saying , " The in-fighting is very disturbing for the future of the NPP . " <p> Party members have , therefore , been urged to exercise emotional restraint towards those who have declared their intention or are yet to declare their intention to contest the flag-bearer slot . <p> Nana Akufo-Addo himself has told his followers to avoid verbal wars with internal opponents . <p> " I appeal to all NPP supporters to remain calm and focused and desist from actions that undermine the unity of the party , " he said in his Easter message to Ghanaians . <p> " In particular , I urge all NPP members who support my bid to lead the party for the 2016 elections not to be provoked by comments or actions and be dragged into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to victory . This is but a contest among members of one family , the Great Elephant Family . We must , therefore , be guided and guarded constantly by an uncompromising sense of unity , fellowship and greater purpose , " he implored NPP members . <p> Electoral plight of NPP <p> The recently elected 10-member national executive of the NPP , under the chairmanship of Mr Paul Awentami Afoko , has promised party members to prepare for government and political power . <p> But the party must come to terms with the hard reality that the 2016 elections are not going to be easy . <p> The NPP must never underestimate the herculean task ahead of it going into an election with a sitting president . For the NPP to make any headway in the 2016 elections and wrest political power from the National Democratic Congress ( NDC ) , as promised by its new executive , there must be reconciliation , unity of purpose and all hands must be on deck . <p> Already , some schools of thought have opined that the NPP is losing its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 2008 and the 2012 presidential polls . In 2008 , Nana Akufo-Addo lost the run-off by about 40,000 votes .

Significantly , the votes of the NDC in both NPP " World Banks " of the Ashanti and the Eastern regions have increased substantially . This means that NPP votes in the Eastern and the Ashanti regions are declining steadily . <p> The party is also facing difficulty making good in-roads in the Brong Ahafo , Central , Western and Greater Accra regions . In the parliamentary polls , the NPP performed poorer in 2012 than in 2008 . In 2008 , it got 128 Members of Parliament and had 123 in 2012 . <p> This is the election story of the NPP as it gets ready for Election 2016.

@@1879233 <h> Devaluing the Ghanaian traditional marriage <p> Many happenings give cause for worry about the ease with which we throw away our good values and traditions that give us our identity as Ghanaians . It may take a different discourse to discuss fully , the factors that prone us to negative cultural adaptation at a fast rate . <p> Adoption of Cultural Waste <p> It is a fact that , global interaction has created a world of cultural evolution among nations but in our situation , the many years of subservient relationship with our colonial and slave masters had eroded our traditional safeguards against the adoption of cultural waste that are dumped on us . One long lasting negative effect of slavery and other forms of foreign domination had been the remnants of slave mentality that manifest in identity crisis and the tendency to look down on our social values and everything about us including hating our God-given black colour . <p> Unfortunately , our education has served the enslaving purpose of our colonial past and created a lot more elites who pride themselves in how they have adopted the lifestyles of the slave masters . The reference to these elites as " Colonial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their colonial master indicates the depth of the identity crisis . Disappointingly , education , which should liberate us , has become an enslaving tool . <p> The disorientation tends to prone us to easy adaptation to Western cultures even when what we are adopting has no linkage with our heritage or we do not seem to understand its foundation.Examples abound to buttress my assertion . History teaches us that the slaves of old , fought against the imposition of foreign names on them by their slave masters . In our time , we regard the use of foreign names as prestigious . Some people shamelessly pride themselves in the fact that they and their children can not speak any Ghanaian language but rather speak foreign languages like English . Can one imagine an American President or British Prime Minister who occupy the highest office of their respective countries unable to communicate in English ? <p> The Ghanaian traditional marriage has suffered the same fate just like all other good things that gives us identity as a people . Our Traditional marriage has been devalued and subordinated to Western marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colonial masters . <p> The Ghanaian Traditional Marriage <p> The family constitute an important economic and social unit of every society . Different cultures and social groups have unique marriage rites , which fits their traditions and heritage . <p> Each culture has its unique marriage ceremony to reflect its family values . The Western culture operates a Nuclear family system where the family is composed of the father , mother and children . In the Ghanaian context , the family has a broader meaning beyond father , mother and children . Even members belonging to the same clan who are spread all over the country consider themselves as belonging to the same family . It is difficult to define the borders of the Ghanaian family . A German friend who lived with my family for some time asked me to explain who was a member of my family and their relationship with me . He got confused when I kept introducing different relatives as my father , my mother , my sister and so on . His confusion was about the number of people in my house at any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mothers , fathers and an unending list of sisters , brothers and children . It was a difficult question for me because in our Ghanaian situation , my mother 's sister is not my aunt as in English language but my mother and my father 's brother is not my uncle as in the English language but my father . Though I have two biological children , it would take a lot of courage for me to explain to an outsider , my relationship with all the young people who live in my house especially when students are on vacation . <p> The Ghanaian Traditional Marriage reflects our broad definition of family . When a man and woman decide to marry , they have to inform their parents who would inform the larger family members . The Ghanaian traditional marriage is regarded as a marriage between two families and involves a lot of consultations , negotiations and due diligence among the families of the would-be couple . <p> The Wikipedia defines wedding as the ceremony in which two people are united in marriage and by that definition , the Ghanaian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important part of the Ghanaian traditional wedding is the " Knocking " which literary connotes the man 's family knocking at the doors of the family of the would-be bride to inform them of the marriage proposal . It is only when the " Knocking " fee , which is usually a symbolic small amount and drinks has been accepted by the woman 's family that the family of the would-be bridegroom could announce the marriage proposal . In effect , the " Knocking " stage is what could be described as " ENGAGEMENT " in the Ghanaian traditional wedding , which connotes betrothal or a promise of marriage between a man and woman . <p> It is a common practice that the traditional marriage rites which involves payment of dowry , gifts to parents , uncles and brothers of the would be bride etc are discussed and concluded between the two families before the day of the traditional wedding . The two families undertake due diligence and background checks to resolve all misunderstandings before the wedding day . Payment of dowries and gifts from the family of the groom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agreed by the two families . It is important to note that though the Ghanaian marriage transaction involves direct engagement of the families of the would-be bride and groom , their consent especially the consent of the would-be bride is highly respected . On the day of the traditional wedding , the father of the would-be bride asks her daughter whether her family should accept the dowry and all the gifts presented by the man 's family with the objective of asking her hand in marriage . It is only when the bride consents to the family 's acceptance of the gifts three times that the traditional marriage is contracted . This aspect of the Ghanaian traditional wedding is an important safeguard against forced marriages and it takes place in the presence of all well-wishers at the traditional wedding after the would-be bridegroom had been introduced to the public . <p> The Western concept of family consists of the father , mother and children . In the Western marriage , ENGAGEMENT is a promise of marriage between the two people to be married and marked by the presentation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony.The Western marriage is devoid of the detailed and more complex consultations and negotiation involving the two families as happens in the Ghanaian traditional marriage . <p> Consequences of Multiple Weddings <p> Judging from the rich cultural content of the Ghanaian traditional wedding , the network of social relations that are created and the social support built around marriages , it comes as a surprise that its social importance had been devalued to " engagement " which denotes casual relations . Religion and identity crisis as to who we are have reinforced the ignorance and the low esteem for the Ghanaian traditional wedding . <p> Throughout history , anytime a group of people imitate other cultures without understanding and proper reasons to do so , they end up incurring avoidable cost that serves no purpose . The misunderstanding about the value of the Ghanaian traditional wedding has made marriage very expensive for young people . Would-be couples undertake the traditional wedding , which they ignorantly describe as ENGAGEMENT after which they go to court for the ordinance marriage and then end it with a societal Western type of Wedding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weddings - the traditional Ghanaian wedding which is a requirement for all the other weddings , the court wedding and the Western type of wedding , which has become the norm . <p> It is a pity that young people have to go through grave financial difficulties in planning traditional weddings , court weddings and the Western-type of weddings only to start their married life with debt that could be avoided . The situation is worsened by the increasing commercial interest of Wedding Planners , which had unleashed competition among young would-be couples in the Western wedding . Young couples go to any extent to have big Western- type of weddings that would be the talk of the town for a long time . Ignorance they say could be very expensive . <p> It should be possible for a couple to bless their marriage after the traditional wedding based on their Christian beliefs . With proper understanding , a couple could have a simple blessing as part of the traditional wedding or during a normal Sunday church service . Indeed , what we refer to in Ghanaian parlance as ENGAGEMENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WESTERN WEDDING is in fact , blessing of the traditional marriage based on the Christian beliefs of the couple . <p> The church has an important advocacy role to play in educating Ghanaians especially the youth to realise that Ghanaian traditional wedding is not ENGAGEMENT . This would save the youth from expensive Western-type of weddings . The avoidable expenditure associated with marriage and weddings is contributing to the phobia of some young people for marriage and the increasing rate of divorce . My problem is not only about the expensive nature of the weddings today but the bigger issue is that marriage rites help to define who we are .

However , I take consolation in the fact that I have been a professional teacher and lecturer for the past 44 years , with 10 years ' teaching stint in Ghana , 11 years in Nigeria , and 23 years in Zambia . As a citizen of the global village , I think I am qualified to partake in this great debate of finding ways and means of delivering quality instruction in mathematics and science to our pupils , students and tutees in the primary and secondary schools along the length and breadth of Ghana . This quest , no doubt , will not only benefit Ghana in particular , but also it will benefit the whole world in general , as now we live in an era and arena of a global village , with unavoidable interdependencies . <p> In this paper , an eclectic and holistic approach will be adopted to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and undercurrents . <p> Having spent 7 years teaching students at the International School of Lusaka ( ISL ) , I have been widely exposed to international schools ' curricula , such as the Cambridge IGCSE and the International Baccalaureate ( IB ) , on both of which programmes I was privileged to teach Business Studies , Business and Management , Economics , Social Studies , and the Theory of Knowledge . I also had the wonderful opportunity of mentoring and supervising IB students for their Extended Essays ( EEs ) in varied disciplines such as Geography , History , Economics , Business and Management , Islamic Studies , World Literature Essay , and Physics . <p> At ISL , we had tutors and tutees from more than 69 countries worldwide . We used to have workshops for teachers every Wednesday to brainstorm and engage in academic discourse on facets of pedagogy and best practice . It was at such fora that I came across great concepts such as the units of enquiry , backward design , enduring understandings , multiple intelligences of Howard Gardner , six hats of lateral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other concepts . <p> I think nature has greater things to teach us out there in the wild ( going on excursions and undertaking educational tours ) than we can ever know of , sitting under the canopy of the cosy closets of classrooms which to some kids and teenagers are no different from prisons . This is why lots of Physical Education ( P.E ) , extra-curriculum activities , Community Service , and Field Trips are good for our young ones whose bloods are hot and cuddling , yearning for action/activity-centred learning opportunities .. <p> The great African-American naturalist , George Washington Carver , alluded to the fact of learning from nature in his writings . What prevents an historical excursion to the pyramids in Egypt , which excursion incorporates scientific and mathematical lessons in carbon dating , geometric lessons in Pythagorean triple , trigonometric fundamentals of angles of elevation and depression , Euclidean prime numbers , the papyrus reed and the science and history of paper making , lessons in myths and legends of the Nile in literature , multi-disciplinary aspects of tourism and its impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its damaging effects on tourism , threats posed to historical artefacts by plunderers , and the menace of population explosion , need for eco-tourism , threats to tourists by terrorists , statistical records of terrorist incidents and tourist arrivals , among others . Such an eclectic and inter-disciplinary approach will greatly interest all students , and will leave no child behind . <p> Thus , learning should be integrative , eclectic , pragmatic , and real ; challenging , interesting , and it should be in an overarching and cross-disciplinary manner . This will tax teachers to be versatile and multi-disciplinary at the early stages of education , up to the middle years of junior secondary school . <p> It is interesting to note that some of the great thinkers of our world came from strong religious and moral backgrounds , as well as from the world of philosophy . Here , I have in mind the French mathematician , Rene Descartes , the English theologian and mathematician , Thomas Robert Malthus , Sir Isaac Newton , William Shakespeare , Adam Smith , among others .

His stint at the Weights and Measures section of the Swiss Postal Services made him gain deep insight into issues of precision as well as relatedness of concepts . Up to today , I myself find it hard to define the concept of time , though Einstein gave us some idea . What is time ? Is time finite , discrete , and continuous , in a continuum or an independent variable of nature ? <p> Switzerland is a laidback country which is noted for its infatuation with conservatism , strict adherence to time management , and a rigour for precision . All these qualities are needed in the disciplines of science and mathematics . Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would perhaps not have made much impact on the world . He emigrated to the USA where he taught at Princeton University , and he gifted the world with his famous theory of relativity . <p> The Switzerland example , and Einstein 's association with her , teaches us that time , place , circumstance and discipline are ingredients needed to succeed in the sciences and mathematics . Religion , moral mores , and knowledge of philosophy prepare people to view life through refined lenses . Some people may argue that religions create divides , dogmas , stereotypes and parochialisms . This may be true to some extent . A broader view of religion and an open mind provide the discipline needed for one to think deeply outside the box , leading to the spirit of enquiry , discovery and exploration . Without religious faith , there is no self-identity and no basis for existence . Descartes once said , ' I think , therefore I am .

After all , all the great universities of this world such as Oxford ( c.1096 ) , Cambridge ( c.1209 ) , Bologna ( 11th Century ) , Harvard ( 1636 ) , Paris ( 1150 ) , Yale ( 1701 ) , the University of London ( Jeremy Bentham c. 1836 ) , Princeton University ( 1746 ) , among many others worldwide , sprouted out of religious orders as they were all started by priests and philanthropists , who presumably had higher ideals and visionary ideas . <p> A Nigerian , Dr Philip Emeagwali , is world famous for his fastest mathematical calculation in history because after his basic education in Nigeria , he went to the USA to pursue his master 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Ghanaian physicist and mathematician , went to the UK in the 1950s for his A Levels , and subsequently for his master 's degree from the University of London .

If Allotey had not had a solid basic education in mathematics and the sciences in Ghana at Ghana National College in Cape Coast ( the student pioneers in the 50s ) , he would not have made those stupendous gains when he went to study abroad . <p> The point being made here is that the examples of Einstein , Emeagwali and Allotey provide us an insight that a solid basic foundation in the sciences and mathematics is all it takes to take off and explore on one 's own . Besides , adversity , the fear of God , and morally correct behaviour are ingredients for success in the sciences and mathematics . Great scholars of the past emerged from obscurity , humble beginnings , and situations of great deprivation .

Without sounding racist or culturally-biased , we can say that the Chinese , Indians , Pakistanis , Sri Lankans , Moslems , and Arabs are excelling in schools and colleges in the First World because of their cultural beliefs , ways of life , and closed and strict family values . <p> That fact notwithstanding , empirical evidence evinces the fact that all human beings are equally endowed with creative genius at birth , the sense of wonder and imagination , and that circumstances of birth or heredity , the physical built and natural environments , circumstances of adversity and affluence , all juxtaposed , can be seen to impact and impinge on the blossoming or dimming of those naturally-endowed gifts .

As it were , he averred that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locke gave us the concept of ' tabula rosa ' or a blank white sheet of the mind at birth , on which the process of education makes an imprint , for good or for evil . <p> What is education ? The Shorter Oxford Dictionary defines education as the process of leading learners and tutees to discover , or bringing out something from obscurity . The word education is said to be derived from its Latin root of ' educare ' . Education here means formal education dispensed in a structured manner , in a school system which has a curriculum and assessment criteria to follow . Education aims to develop the mind , body , and soul of the individual in a holistic manner . In the UK and most Western countries , there is unfortunately now an imbalance in this trilogy or trinity , as undue emphasis is placed on developing only the mind and body , neglecting the spiritual component ( cf. Sakyi , 2000 ) . The same logic applies to the Ghanaian scenario . <p> It is a sad and tragic tragedy of monstrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools worldwide is being relegated and sacrificed on the altar of human rights and expediency . Such a sorry state needs urgent mitigation and intervention . Indeed , it is the very reason why other nationalities are excelling in schools and colleges in the sciences and mathematics in other parts of the world . Take Hong Kong or Singapore for example . Lack of discipline is consuming us Ghanaians in every facet and faculty of life . See our excellent footballers who fail at the World Cup in Brazil , not for want of trying or lack of ability and skills , but because some of them and their managers and handlers are not disciplined . Why can not we go for the best handlers in the world , irrespective of their nationalities ? It boils down to greed , lack of exposure , among other variables . The onus now lies on our educational policy makers and administrators to rethink and reform our educational system so that the spiritual and moral aspects of education are shored up and given proper attention . Otherwise , we shall produce malformed beings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard work and ambition . ( cf. supra/infra Sakyi , 2000 ) <p> There is also the need to shift away from rote-learning and the current exam-centred educational system in Ghana , which produces robotic products who can not solve problems or apply their knowledge to creative endeavours . If the focus is shifted away from rote-learning for exams , then we will have reflective students who will reflect deeply on the meaning of life , and begin to realise their reason for existence , our common humanity , and our commonality as humans with three main quests to satisfy , namely , the mind 's crave for sound knowledge or the truth , the body 's crave for healthy nourishment , and the soul 's craving for atonement and unity with nature , humanity and our creator . This approach can lead to a sound basis for take-off into the realms of excellence . That should form a watershed for breaking new grounds in the teaching of mathematics and science in Ghanaian schools and colleges . <p> Religious and moral dogma are what many fear , judging from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past horrible horrors . But those are past and gone , and we have moved on , and have to move on . Religious education could be incorporated into social science , or in strictly religious-based faith schools , Religious and Moral Education ( RME ) should be taught as one of the core subject areas . This should require some legislative reforms to reflect the composition of our national populations . Religious and Moral Education should be seen as a pillar , and vehicle for greater achievement in mathematics and the sciences . <p> Teacher selection , training , supervision and career development should also be done in a high quality manner . To have more science and mathematics teachers , special incentives should be created for them . The training of teachers should impart to them the skills of character training , and managerial skills of instilling strict discipline in schools . Now is he time to professionalise the teaching fraternity , by licensing them and applying strict rules and procedures of teacher oversight and gate-keeping . We need a long term strategic plan in all facets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future competitiveness as a nation . ( cf. see Competitive Advantage of Nations by Michael Porter ) <p> 3.0 STEM AND 3Rs Education <p> In our school days in the 50s and 60s , the emphasis was on 3Rs of proficiency in Reading , Arithmetic and Writing . We had mental drills with caning in schools . Students memorised the multiplication tables , periodic tables , formulae , poetry , among others . These are the basic ingredients of education which are even relevant today . Some aspects of these are still relevant as they were then . However , an integrative approach can be used to teach these 3Rs by incorporating into them science and mathematical concepts . The acronym STEM stands for Science , Technology , Engineering , and Mathematics . ( **27;0;TOOLONG ) <p> We will need a paradigm shift to incorporate the STEM logic in our schools . Our teachers and school administrators have become engrossed in eking a living for themselves from the harsh economic times , so much so that they pay scant attention to educational reform and pedagogical issues . Science , Technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of GDP growth . Therefore , we need to invest heavily in these areas , through investment in human capital and infrastructure . We need deliberate policies to incentivise our teachers and accelerate the growth of these educational vectors . In the 60s and 70s , UNESCO liberally funded science education in Ghana , and I remember using a UNESCO-published science book authored by Sam Adu Ampomah , the late one time Headmaster of GSTS in Takoradi . That was also the time we had the Entebbe Mathematics Project ( EMP ) of the New Mathematics , which was introduced in schools and colleges in Ghana , with heavy input by Professor Abbiw Jackson and Professor Kofi Nti . <p> STEM are the core subjects which every student needs in the 21st Century to survive . I will like to tweak it a bit by making it STEEMS , with the addition of English and Social Studies or Social Science . We need to pay attention to the English Language aspect because it is the vehicle for our thought-processes and global communication . This applies more to the non-first language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this age of ICT fads , because we need to balance and manage the human-machine interface , to avoid creating hermits , recluses and unsocial beings . We need to refine our communication skills <p> However , we could add non-STEMS optional vocational subjects such as Metalwork , Bricklaying , Carpentry and Joinery , Fashion and Design , Physical Education , Art , Graphics , and Painting , among others . In this age of massive youth unemployment , our schools should help create budding entrepreneurs so that they can be useful to themselves after graduating , by becoming employers instead of employees . These vocational subjects require basic science and mathematics in their daily applications . We would want to replicate the success stories of the Richard Bransons , Bill Gates , Anita Broddicks , Nkulenus , Amoahs , Awuahs , Azumah Bandas , Swanikers , Agambilas , Mahamas , Donald Trumps , and Warren Buffets of this world in our Ghanaian schools . <p> This is where the teaching of mathematics and the sciences should emphasise hands-on practical training for immediate application to wealth-creation and commercial ventures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pollution and global warming can be given as projects in the communities for students to research on , and devise solutions . In that way , they can discover market gaps and niches , even before they graduate . Learning will then not be perceived as a neat and linear process , but rather as a convoluted process of problem-solving , with the need for approaching issues from multi-dimensional perspectives . <p> The 3Rs should help every Tom , Dick and Harry to be able to draw up a business plan or proposal , and keep proper books of account . Our students will be able to communicate properly with stakeholders , and come up with critical thinking skills in assessing business cases , through research . Science and Mathematics will be deployed as practical tools for interpreting the world , and providing the means of sustenance . Our future farmers and artisans should have strong rudimentary foundations In mathematics , with emphasis placed on teaching basic concepts of fractions , logic , equations , sets , number systems , ratio , proportion and percentages , spatial relations in plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rudimentary trigonometry . These are the basics for developing bigger ideas later on in life . At the least opportunity , teachers should point out in lessons , the practical applications of what their learners imbibe in science and mathematics . <p> 4.0 IMPORTANCE OF THE HUMANITIES TO SCIENCE AND MATHEMATICS <p> We should understand that we can not become great scientists or mathematicians if we neglect the humanities . It is from our legends , folklore and fairy tales , fables and local lore that we draw great inspiration , and also find some identity , and above all , provide some sanity to a humdrum life . These stories and lore awaken our imagination and our creative instincts , which in the end , help us to visualise abstract concepts in mathematics and science . Homer 's epic stories of the Illiad and Odyssey , Sophocles dramas , Shakespeare 's plays and Charles Dickens and Jonathan Swift 's fiction , kindle in us the spirit of adventure , passions to triumph , and emotions to feed our souls on . I would here point out that whilst putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lose sight that the teaching of classics is on the wane worldwide , and it should also be a matter of great concern , because critical thinking skills can be acquired in studying the classics , our local Ghana Languages , despite the need for a lot of rote learning there . <p> The study of the classics and literature sharpens our intellect , provides us entertainment , and relaxes us to be able to tackle more strenuous work in mathematics and science . In the humanities , our children have their consciousness aroused to be able to revel in the abstract world of the perfect absolutes of Plato . Aristotle taught us how to discriminate and classify phenomena ; using some agreed taxonomic criteria . John Locke gave us the idea of being precise in our definitions . Thus , through inter-disciplinary studies , we can help our students to be creative , and to see the relationships linking all knowledge as a holistic whole , instead of seeing knowledge as existing in discrete compartments or atomised as stand-alones . In college back in the mid-60s , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were tops in French , History and Ghanaian Languages . <p> 5.0 GLOBAL TRENDS IN EDUCATION <p> The teaching of science and mathematics in schools should have a fresh approach of thematic studies , units of enquiry , project work , peer learning , team teaching , community-based learning , internship , backward design , and enduring understandings , among others . We could modify the Socratic question-and-answer method , or use Montessori 's play way methods in the teaching of mathematics and science . <p> We should encourage our students to participate more often in the Olympiads and Science Fairs . We should engage the corporate world so that they tell us the aspects of science and mathematics which they need in the world of work , so that teaching these subjects can be made more relevant to the demands of the labour market . Science and mathematics learnt in abstraction become meaningless , unless the learner perceives a direct link to the real world of work , life , and living . <p> Thus , school counsellors should hit the ground running to know the fortes of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to equip them for their future careers . The era of massification of education in straight-jackets , and one-size-fits-all , is long gone . Rather , we should be thinking along the lines of mass-localisation and mass-customisation . I will recommend strongly that henceforth , first , each class should have two teachers to reduce the heavy workload of teachers in large-sized urban schools , second , to create jobs , and third , to enable students be assessed properly . <p> Learning abstruse formulae in mathematics and complex concepts in science puts off many a learner if they do not see their immediate applications in the real world of those arcane formulae . Perhaps , a few loony learners can excel in learning elegant and convoluted formulae for the sake of self-fulfilment . The old school believe in the learning of theory for its own sake . This is the point of departure between them and the modern school of thought who think that what is learnt should have immediate practical application to human problems , and not for the purpose of passing exams . <p> We now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as cell phones , computers , and social media networks such as Facebook , Twitter , Linkedin , Whatsapp , Twoo , Picbum , MyZamana , Youtube , among others . These can be strategically canalised into whipping up the interest of our young learners who are infatuated by these fads . We can make our young ones cannibalise their fads by using them for devouring knowledge through knowledge sharing on these social media ! Instead of being threats , we should turn them around to become strengths . <p> Countries such as USA , Germany , Sweden , Canada , Finland , Japan , Singapore , Hong Kong , and South Korea have long overhauled their school curricula , and have some of the best educational systems in the world today . They have taken best practice from around the world and localised content and delivery . China took the novel approach of sending out their students to the best schools and universities in the world . India indigenised their curricula and made their teachers write localised textbooks for their students . What do we see in Ghana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but my own sampling of some of them shows that they are below par in terms of content quality . This is particularly so in subjects such as English , ICT , and Mathematics . I was horrified when I went through my daughter 's BECE ICT textbook and found the material belonging to the age of the dinosaurs ! The content was anachronistic by say 20 or 30 years ! <p> With heavy state subsidy of education , Indian students have always excelled in the sciences and mathematics because of easy access . They have fierce competition among themselves , and their parents and sponsors invest a lot of time and money in education . Furthermore , they are not bogged down by the mountain of so many strictures of human rights and rigmarole which stifle education in the UK , for example . There is therefore the need in Ghana to revisit the Education Act and some of the restrictive ordinances and statutes which inhibit the development of education . Ghana is not an island as she is globally connected in the global village , so we need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to break out of their cocoons , or let down their hair a bit by bending backwards to embrace change . <p> When the former USSR saw that they were behind in the science race to space , they launched an aggressive science , technology and mathematics education drive in the 50s and 60s , during the Cold War . Their aim was to upstage the Americans by having a fast-paced industrialisation . However , they neglected the arts and humanities and that spelt doom for them because they ended up producing robotic people with little understanding and appreciation for the subtleties and finesse of the arts and humanities . <p> In Germany , they put a spin on practical education by adhering to a rigid progression in the school system , and not fast-tracking any student . Their Technikons and Arbiturs produced middle class artisans and mechanics needed in large numbers in their industrial estates . They allowed a lot of Turkish and other immigrants to come in to fill the gap in the labour market . They made it compulsory for their students to acquire practical vocational skills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic and theoretical training in schools and colleges . Thus , they had a binary or parallel educational system which combined praxis or practicum with theoretical knowledge . <p> In the USA , education is made practical through internship and close collaboration with the corporate world . Education is integrated into the world of business and work . Learning is made flexible through the credit system . The corporate world sponsors a lot of research and they generously fund educational enterprises . They offer students opportunities to research and proffer solutions to industrial problems . Special education for child prodigies and physically , mentally and emotionally-challenged children are all well-catered for in the USA . However , I must say that I am not a great fan of the American educational system because of their disparate and unstandardized educational system , which to say the least , looks chaotic from the point of view of an outsider , especially at the pre-tertiary level . Howard Gardner 's concept of multiple intelligences forms the basis of their education system , whereby every child is recognised as having strengths in certain knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by twining our schools with the corporate world to make education job market relevant , and realistic . <p> Howard Gardner 's multiple intelligences concept is a pedagogical method which recognises that no child is a write-off because we are differently endowed ; therefore education should be inclusive rather than exclusive , with no child left behind . The concept of multiple intelligences recognises areas of intelligence as spatial or motor intelligence , logic , music , aesthetic or creative intelligence , linguistic intelligence , emotional , and social intelligence . All these are innate , and it is the duty of educators to unearth the forte of each child . Once the particular strength of a child is known , then that strength can be used as a platform to introduce themes in mathematics and science in that forte area , which will be pleasurable to the student . <p> For example , one of my former IB students at ISL ( International School of Lusaka ) , was a Physics major , but he had a strong passion for music , especially playing the guitar . He also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I partially supervised was on the resonance of the different guitar strings made from different materials such as cat gut , metals , among others . Thus , he blended his passion for music with his science focus , and he achieved an excellent grade . Of course , he was an exceptionally-talented chap with leadership and excellent social networking skills . <p> This informs us that for a successful delivery of the teaching of mathematics and science in schools , we should devise eclectic , innovative , flexible and interesting methods which are overarching , inclusive , and iconoclastic . Teachers and learners have to think outside the box by traversing into untravelled roads and territories . We can not forget that the Ghana is a multicultural society , which poses many challenges to teachers in the teaching of science and mathematics . African children may find the culture of meeting deadlines deadly , a child from a Muslim home may not like Darwin 's theory of evolution , a prude homestead may object to teaching sex education in schools to their children , among many other examples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn knowledge upside down by using revolutionary methods for 4 year olds to engage in units of enquiry on thematic topics such as pollution , globalisation , and human-animal conflict , conservation of fresh water resources and their management , the ecological system , among others . Parents are normally involved in the presentations made by their young kids . <p> Thus , there is the whole engagement of the school learning community in the education of the child . This is an insight which I gained whilst teaching at ISL . Children could be made to learn in groups so that they engage in peer group learning , and sharing ideas , through a process of mutual bonding . Through collaboration , they reinforce the learning process through learning by association , recall , practical assignments , and project work . <p> The teaching of science and mathematics should not be done in isolation but rather in association with other subjects such as history , music , drama , art , literature , social studies , among others , in a cross-disciplinary manner . For example , in history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science geniuses such as Francis Bacon , Isaac Newton , Turing , Tim Berners Lee , Bertrand Russell , Aldous Huxley , Halley , Marie Curie , Stephen Hawking , Robert Dawkins , Isaiah Blankson , Alvin Klutse , Francis Allotey , Yanney Ewusi , Ashittey Ollennu , Konotey Ahulu , MacBaganlurin , Thomas Mensah , L.P. Baffour , Mawusi Dake , Erbynn , Oti Boateng , Omaboe , Phillips , Adzei Bekoe , Addai Mensah , S.I.K.O Odoom , among others can be brought to light to whip up the interest of children in the sciences and mathematics . They can pick up their role models from there . <p> Of greater importance is the need to impart to our students the facets of knowledge acquired from knowing about the Theory of Knowledge ( TOK ) , which is incorporated in the IB curricula but not found in the London and Cambridge A Level curricula . TOK broadens the minds of students and helps them know the sources of knowledge . It also helps them to develop their critical thinking faculties . Alongside TOK , they should be exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Bono . In addition , all students should be made familiar with the scientific method associated with people such as Lakatos , Thomas Kuhn , Karl Popper , Wiggenstein , and Francis Bacon . <p> The ideas and methods of psychoanalysts such as Freund and Carl Jung can be explored to understand thinking faculties in the conscious and unconscious state , and then efforts can be made on how to impart knowledge correctly , given challenges such as neuroses , psychosis , gender differences , social disparities and otherliness of some tutees . Special Education should be enhanced so that geniuses who are challenged mentally , socially and physically can be assisted . <p> With such understanding of psychoanalysis , educators will be better positioned to deliver quality and inclusive education to all , with no child left behind . The phobia of mathematics , the stereotyping which goes on with gender streaming in the study of mathematics and science will have to be dealt their death knell . Psychotherapy will need to be applied to those whose minds have been blocked by wrong mental images and stereotypes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue mathematics and sciences to higher levels . <p> 6.0 BACKWARD DESIGN AND ENDURING UNDERSTANDINGS -THE USA PERSPECTIVE <p> In backward design , educators in the USA make students realise their goals , objectives , assessment criteria , among others , from the onset , even before the learning process begins . It is also called understanding by design . In that way , all in the school learning community are put in the bigger picture so as to elicit maximum cooperation and support . <p> Thus , a compact or social contract is signed with everybody involved , so that they are aware of some concrete deliverables within a given timeframe , and at a specified cost , quantity , and quality , in terms of knowledge and skills acquired by students , contact hours put in by teaching staff , the quality of teaching aids prepared , numbers and percentage of students who pass summative and formative assessments , among others . According to the website , authenticeducation.org , backward design is a framework for improving student achievement . <p> It further deepens the student 's understanding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading to effective student self-reflection . Backward design was developed in the USA by Grant Wiggins and Jay McTighe . According to other authorities , this method of backward design leads to enduring understanding , by students asking essential questions on a topic . The enduring understanding lasts throughout their life time because they would have carried away with them the bigger picture which will stay with them long after they have learnt a topic . That way , students gain deeper understanding and greater enlightenment . Thus , the dangers of the so- called " **25;29;TOOLONG " syndrome , associated with rote-learning in Ghana are overcome . <p> 7.0 CONCLUSION The quest for excellence in the teaching of mathematics and science in schools is not only a problem in Ghana as it is also a global issue . We can not bury our heads in the sand and pretend that all is well . Experience of teaching in international schools is an eye-opener , in that one gets to know that the IB Diploma programme is far richer and pragmatic in content and delivery than our own JHS and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Level curricula , which are bookish and examination-oriented , and are being phased out in the UK ( see Vision 2030 of the Royal Society launched on 26 th , June , 2014 ) . Exam-based education such as our current BECE and SHS exam systems encourage rote learning or parroting , rather than building the foundations for critical thinking and developing entrepreneurial skills . Radical changes have to be introduced in the teaching of mathematics and science in Ghanaian schools . That will require reforms in the education statutes and ordinances . Attention should be paid to reviving Religious and Moral Education in schools across Ghana . Efforts should also be made to accept and deploy the use of social media in our schools as a means of grabbing the maximum attention of our young 3YK students who are obsessed with the new ICT fads and gadgets . We should rapidly embrace change . Finally , some recent concepts which have been adopted in the USA , Scotland , and Australia include the STEM approach ( Science , Technology , Engineering , Mathematics , ) , TIMES approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understandings , multiple intelligences , units of enquiry ( IB ) , project work , inclusive education , community-based learning , and integrative and holistic approaches such as thematic teaching .

" Pastoral communities in arid and semi-arid lands of Kenya depend on livestock for their livelihood . Mobility is a key strategy used by pastoralists to efficiently utilise available resources , notably pasture and water . However , this strategy is being interrupted by a vicious cycle of livestock rustling hence the need for the introduction of the creative way to tame the vice , explained Dr. James Kariuki from the ministry of agriculture , one of the overseers of the project . <p> The project leverages the available telecom and ICT infrastructure as it uses the GPS tracking devices which are inserted in the cows ' rumen . Mobile phone and internet penetration in Kenya currently stands at 77.2 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of mobile phone and internet penetration , it is believed that the improvement of ICT infrastructure has contributed hugely and these are the same infrastructure that the initiative is leveraging on for its success . The project dubbed Electronic Livestock Identification and Traceability ( ELITS ) entails usage of a Rumen Radio Frequency Identification Device ( RFID ) bolus that contains a microchip which is encased in a ceramic capsule . <p> The RFID is inserted into the reticulum of an animal using a bolus gun . The bolus confers a unique animal identifier number that is read using a reader and entered into a central computerized data base . The bolus does not affect the health of the animal since it 's an inert chemical . " The code on the bolus can be received by any radio receiver and therefore if the herds are stolen , a famer reports the case to the central data units through the anti stock theft and the code in question is blacklisted and the search commences , " explained Dr. Kariuki . According to him the data base units are stationed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counties in the country . The chip embedded in the bolus emit a signal and the radio receiver detects it and incase the signal is weak the receiver is connected to a directional antennae . The receiver can track over a distance of 15 kilometres . <p> The bolus battery strength can last for over 5 years and Dr. Kariuki noted that this is the estimated life span of the pastoralists ' herd . " We researched and found that the pastoral communities mainly keep their animals for about 3 to 4 years a period after which their livestock are deemed ready to sale off for beef purpose . " The bolus is re-usable and for economical purpose it 's advisable to insert it in one or two of the lead cows in one 's herd . The technology is already in use through the trial stages in Laikipia ranches and it will retail for about $5 . <p> " Livestock plays multiple roles in the lifestyle of pastoralists in Kenya , notably as livelihood sources , socio-cultural and religious functions , and asset and security against risks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by providing milk and meat , the basis of traditional social relations , e.g. payment of dowry ( from the groom 's family to the bride 's family ) during marriage or compensation of injured parties in tribal feuds , symbol of prosperity and prestige , store of wealth , and security against drought , disease and other calamities . Therefore there is need to safeguard the communities ' source of livelihood which we hope to achieve using the project , " explained Dr. Kariuki . <p> Cattle raiding in Kenya is often viewed in the legitimizing context of tradition , climate change and resource conflict , but increasingly it has much more to do with organized crime meeting a rising demand for meat , and fueling political violence .

" With 80 percent of the country 's population engrossed in agriculture , we aim to reach over 7 million farmers annually with our integrated information and communication technology ( I.C.T ) approach that brings in a total shift from the traditional extension service delivery that was time consuming and reached a few farmers , " explained Wanjohi James assistant director in the E-extension department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new approach are leveraging on the advances that have been gained in the ICT sector in the country to help empower more farmers . The mobile phone and internet penetration that stands at 77.2 percent and 63 percent respectively is what the E-extension programme is hinged on . It is estimated that over 20 million Kenyans access internet and there are over 30 million mobile phone users in the country figures that can help in succeeding the E-extension service because some of these internet and mobile phone users are farmers . <p> The E-Extension programme , which was launched late last year , is designed to help foster food security through adoption of smart modes of mass communication to reach to the farmers . The project has seen over 654 E-Extension agents trained and equipped with the necessary technological gadgets . The agents are positioned at the ward level and 5000 agents more are expected to be enrolled through the inclusion of the County governments into the programme . " We are equipping our E-Extension agents with a laptop and a smart phone to help them empower the farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents reach out to farmers through a combined approach which can be through mobile , video trainings , WhatsApp messaging tools among others . The aim is to have as much impact as possible in order to uplift our farmers and that is why we are encouraging all these combined approaches . " <p> The diverse needs of farmers in the country have also contributed greatly to the introduction of the E-Extension project . Kenya has farmers who are not dealing in uniform crops and therefore require diverse information depending on the crop or animal one if rearing . Initially the farmers expected the extension officers to be jack of all trades a fact that was not possible . As a result the ministry has introduced farmers agricultural websites that have tailored made information on specific needs of the farmers ranging from market information , Pests , seeds , among others . Using this information from the online sites , the extension agents are expected to revolutionize agriculture in the country . Some of the leading partnership websites that the E-extension agents are using to educate the masses include www.nafis.go.ke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sites are now helping the extension officers empower farmers with write ups and instructions from them . They also give the farmers skills to find the information and answers they need and facilitate their networking locally , regionally and even at a global stage , " noted Wanjohi . <p> There are other programmes under the project which include E-clinic forums and text and video messaging to exchange information between the farmers and the agents . Kariri Wangeci an E-extension officer serving farmers around Limuru explained that with most farmers having the now affordable smart phones , E-clinic programs have been very successful . " We have specific days outlined for visits to different markets where farmers come with their inquiries either on video on the phones or physically bring the affected crops . " She acknowledges that through these forums , she has been able to offer practical solutions to many farmers and at the same impact positively on their farming ventures . <p> " Some of the farmers even send me inquiries through WhatsApp messaging thus saving the cost for farm visits and helping educate more farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a specific disease , the farmers can share the information at the grass root level and help disseminate it to masses through the multiplier effect , " explained Wangeci . <p> According to Wanjohi , the deepening of ICT is a blessing and will help transform agriculture in the country with their new integrated approaches to extension services . " We believe that E-extension will help in transformation of extension service into pluralistic , demand driven decentralized value chain and market driven by giving farmers information needs localized and customized which is adapted to local users . " Similar E-extension services have also been adopted in Uganda with National agricultural advisory service ( NAADS ) introduction of national farmers free call center service . The farmers get access to the call centre by calling 0800230100 which is toll-free.

@@1879239 <p> Ghana is emerging as a competitive destination for business despite recent economic challenges facing the West Africa Country . The government of Ghana has successfully created the momentum that has the potential to spur growth and bring the country back on the path of impressive growth and prosperity . <p> Maintaining this momentum depends on the country fostering inclusive growth . One lever for change is the opportunity presented by education and literacy . Education can enable high potential but disadvantaged people to participate effectively in the national and global economy . <p> Education of the Girl Child presents a dynamic opportunity for female youth to build sustainable careers and livelihoods <p> However , one of the major barriers to female access to education has been found to be inextricably related to menarche and its attendant challenges . In fact , a good number of female school children fail to report to school when they are in their menses and hence poor performance and increased likelihood of drop out . The incidence of drop out of the girl child from school is also related to the incidence of early marriage and its known consequences . <p> It is in recognition of the importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl and the combat against early marriage that the Dutch Government in partnership with the Government of Ghana with support from United Nations Children Fund ( UNICEF ) is currently implementing a program that is focusing on behavioral change with the aim of increasing educational opportunities for girls who are currently out of school . Apart from cultural and social norms which enhance the likelihood of the girl child staying out of school , it has been shown that difficulties associated with menstruation present a major barrier to access and any intervention that is intended to eliminate this barrier deserves the support of informed and well-meaning Ghanaians . <p> Background ; Increased education of girls in developing contexts is associated with a number of important positive health , social , and economic outcomes for a community . The event of menarche tends to coincide with girls ' transitions from primary to secondary education and may constitute a barrier for continued school attendance and performance . Following the MRC Framework for Complex Interventions , a pilot controlled study was conducted in Ghana to assess the role of sanitary pads in girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolgirls between the ages of 12 and 18 from four villages in Ghana participated in a non-randomized trial of sanitary pad provision with education . The trial had three levels of treatment : provision of pads with puberty education ; puberty education alone ; or control ( no pads or education ) . The primary outcome was school attendance . <p> The total improvement through pads with education intervention after 5 months was a 9% increase in attendance . After 3 months , providing pads with education significantly improved attendance among participants . The changes in attendance at the end of the trial , after 5 months , were found to be significant by site over time . With puberty education alone resulting in a similar attendance level . <p> Conclusion ; This pilot study demonstrated promising results of a low-cost , rapid-return intervention for girls ' education in a developing context . Given the considerable development needs of poorer countries and the potential of young women there , these results suggest that a large-scale cluster randomized trial is warranted . Trial Registration <p> This is an open-access article distributed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which permits unrestricted use , distribution , and reproduction in any medium , provided the original author and source are credited . <p> Funding : The study was funded by Templeton College , the John Fell Fund and Green Templeton College - all at Oxford University . Pads were supplied by Proctor and Gamble . No supporter of the study had any influence over the publication of any results . The funders had no role in study design , data collection and analysis , decision to publish , or preparation of the manuscript . <p> Competing interests : The authors have read the journal 's policy and have the following conflicts : pads were supplied by Proctor and Gamble . This does not alter the authors ' adherence to all the PLOS ONE policies on sharing data and materials . <p> Narok , Kenya : An initiative that seeks to provide all secondary school girls in Narok County with a year 's supply of sanitary pads has been put in place by Narok Deputy Governor Evelyn Aruasa . <p> Aruasa says all 10,556 girls in the 94 secondary schools in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sh9.6 million shillings . <p> Speaking to The Standard in her office , Aruasa said the move has been informed by the need to boost girl education , which she says is still low in the county . <p> " Many school going girls keep missing school during their menses . Because of poverty , most use pieces of dirty rags , cotton wool , leaves and paper . Some even wash and recycle . These practices expose them to diseases and discomfort , " she said . <p> She expressed optimism that the initiative will raise the girls ' academic performance , restore dignity and self-esteem . <p> The deputy governor said this will guarantee access to safe affordable , convenient and culturally appropriate methods of dealing with menstruation . <p> PARTNERS APPEAL <p> " Reports from the Ministry of Education indicate that several girls have dropped out of school because of the stigma associated with the inability to have sanitary pads . This , in the long run , restricts the girl from accessing education , " she said , adding that in Narok over 70 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She appealed to partners to come on board so that the programme can be extended to benefit girls in primary schools . <p> She warned that Kenya 's endeavor for gender parity by 2015 or the Millennium Development Goals ( MDGs ) will remain unattainable if the girl child is not retained in school . <p> " Narok is mainly a patriarchal society and thus , as a county , there is need to do something that will see girls compete favorably with boys . The first step in empowering women is by making sure they are in a position to compete with her male counterparts in school , " she said , adding that Narok becomes the first county to launch such an initiative . <p> SET ASIDE <p> In the 2012/2013 financial year the Government set aside Sh300 million for the provision of free sanitary towels to 568,925 needy girls between Classes six and eight . The amount was , however , slashed to Sh99 million the following year . <p> According to the United Nations Children 's Fund 2007 report , a girl in primary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loses approximately 18 weeks out of 108 school weeks . A girl in high school ( four years ) loses 156 learning days which is equivalent to almost 24 weeks out of the 144 weeks of school . <p> Several other studies across Africa have confirmed the relevance and indeed need for free sanitary pad as an intervention . Indeed the practice is enjoying massive support in Kenya , Botswana , Rwanda , Uganda , and the likes . <p> The proposed Project would support the Government 's Community Day Senior High School program through two components : ( i ) Support to Increase Access with Equity and Quality in Senior High Schools ; and ( ii ) Management , Research and Monitoring and Evaluation . Component 1 : Support to Increase Access with Equity and Quality in Senior High Schools ( Total costs including contingencies : US$140.1 million ) <p> Component 1 uses a results-based financing ( RBF ) modality . Disbursements up to a capped absolute amount will be made against specific line items in the Education sector annual budget , referred to as eligible expenditure programs ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of specified results , as measured by disbursement-linked indicators ( DLIs ) . A matrix of indicators has been developed to measure performance annually and monitor the results achieved ( Annex 1 ) . Policies and interventions to be supported are grouped into two pillars : ( i ) increasing access with equity ( geographic , gender , poverty , etc. ) ; and ( ii ) improving quality of selected low performing SHS . Pillar 1 : Increase Access with Equity ( Total costs including contingencies : US$125.1 million ) : The objective of this pillar is to improve access to senior secondary education and improve equity in underserved districts and provide scholarship to students from low income families , especially girls . The SEIP is expected to finance results of the Government 's priority program to expand space through the construction of new senior secondary schools in underserved areas , rehabilitation and expansion of existing low performing schools and through support for SHS attainment of disadvantaged students . The Government plans include new construction in the 14 districts where there are no current operating public SHS . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population compared with available school capacity ( effective demand ) combined with district level poverty indicators , an additional 9 districts have been identified for new construction . The ultimate objective is to create new spaces for those demanding seats in SHS and to fill these spaces with new students coming from previously underserved communities . In addition to new schools , this pillar would focus on improving existing SHS , particularly those with capacity for expansion , demand for SHS places , poor learning outcomes , drawing on a needs assessment which will determine level of deficiency ( bathrooms , science labs , computer facilities , etc. ) and scope for upgrading . Approximately 125 existing schools would be supported . This pillar will improve the Government 's targeting of resources to support increased access by further supporting scholarships to students from low income families , especially girls . <p> Given the operation 's focus on under-served areas and promoting access with equity , disbursement will be linked to indicators ( DLIs ) that measure increases in seat availability in targeted locations for new construction and increased utilization in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Targeting resources for students from low income families , especially girls in underserved communities would further strengthen equity reforms . Therefore , the release of International Development Association ( IDA ) credit funds will be linked to achievement of the following DLIs : ( i ) selection based on targeting of school expansion in underserved districts ( DLIl ) ; ( ii ) increase in new seats utilized for SHS students in underserved districts ( DLI 2 ) ; ( iii ) increase in utilized seats in existing selected low-performing schools ( DLI3 ) ; and ( iv ) increased enrolment in selected SHS for students from low-income families , especially girls ( DLI4 ) . Pillar 2 : Improve the quality of education in selected low-performing Senior High Schools ( Total costs including contingencies : US$15 million ) : The objective of this pillar is to improve the quality of SHS , with a focus on mathematics and science education in selected low performing schools " . The SEIP would also strengthen school management , leadership and expansion of ICT in the 125 selected low-performing schools . In order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's program to : ( i ) strengthen school management , leadership and accountability ; ( ii ) target interventions to improve the quality of science and mathematics education ; and ( iii ) introduce School Performance Partnerships ( SPPs ) based on School Performance Partnership Plans ( SPPPs ) to capture quality improvements . The SPPs would develop mutual accountability between school management and the District Education Oversight Committee ( DEOC ) to improve learning performance with the commitment from government agencies to provide the necessary resources and the responsibility of schools to implement quality improvement activities with verifiable outcomes . In addition to school-based quality inputs , training and financing , this pillar will support the systematic collection and publication of school data for stakeholders to make informed decisions about SHS selection , and for MOE/GES to make informed decisions about planning and financing SHS . <p> The focus on mathematics and science subjects is aligned with the Government strategy to encourage these program areas throughout all education levels . The expansion of ICT wireless connectivity would also allow strengthened science , mathematics and other subject education through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to an education portal1 2(i-campus) where teachers and students can utilize multiple online resources that are expected to support improved teaching and learning . ICT will be used for intensive in-service support to teachers to improve content knowledge as well as lesson plan preparation , teaching and learning aids , and videos on good teaching practices and classroom management . The portal could also serve as a platform for knowledge exchange with national and international networks and for participation in relevant discussion forums . The SEIP is expected to provide connectivity to 125SHS . <p> As an intermediate result , completion rates in the targeted schools would be expected to increase . A longer term impact would be an increase in student achievement in learning outcomes ( as measured by performance in the WASSCE ) which is also a year 4 DLR . For this pillar , release of IDA credit funds would be linked to the achievement of the following DLIs : ( i ) annual publication of School Performance Report ( DLI 5 ) ; ( ii ) School Performance Partnerships ( SPPs ) in 125 beneficiary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved learning outcomes in targeted selected schools ( DLI 7 ) . Component 2 : Management , Research and Monitoring and Evaluation ( Total costs including contingencies : US$15.9 million ) : This component aims to strengthen the implementation capacity of the MOE and GES and its related implementing agencies and assist them to achieve the objectives of the Government 's SHS strategy . This component will support monitoring and evaluation ( M&amp;E ) , coordination , planning , communication , financial management , procurement , and safeguards . In addition it will support an active and evolving research agenda to continue to inform government SHS policy , particularly with regard to financing , social targeting , quality initiatives , teacher rationalization , and curriculum relevance . This component would complement implementation of the program pillars with ongoing analyses , strengthening data collection for school mapping , and establish priorities for new construction , renovations and maintenance . The establishment of a web platform for school reporting and real time monitoring of all SHS implementation activities would enhance and strengthen the Education Management Information System ( EMIS ) and school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ results . In addition , funding will be provided to support the independent verification of disbursement linked indicators and results . Support would also be provided to help the MOE to design and realize policy reforms , including piloting and evaluating innovative approaches . This component would finance training , recruitment of short and long-term technical experts , procurement of goods needed for specific activities , and incremental operating cost . <p> The pads distribution falls under the component of equity in access and a scholarship package to high potential but deprived students to enable access secondary education with less difficulties . <p> Conclusion <p> From the above lyrics , one can conclude that the minority and sections of the media have demonstrated stuck ignorance on the relevance of this excellent intervention . It reflects the extent to which minority legislators are detached from community development issues since all committed and well-meaning partners in development are unanimous on the relevance of such an intervention and would gladly support any initiative that would remove barriers to access to education for the girl child . <p> Distribution of sanitary pads in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue of low attendance and increased dropout rate amongst females and to contribute to positive social outcomes for the girls and their communities . The initiative is well thought out one and holds the potential to address the serious problem of gender inequity in the development agenda of this country . It has the unique capacity to provide increased chances of employment to girls who face barriers to employment and end up as head porters or kayayes as the case may be . <p> The reaction of the minority is out of ignorance . A good number of girls in Ghana do not attend school when menstruating . <p> It is highly recommended that the government scales up this program to support more deprived girls and also endeavour to provide changing facilities such as separate male and female facilities at schools since lack of changing facilities also hinders menstruating girls from going to school .
