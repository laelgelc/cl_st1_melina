A long overdue paradigm shift in astrobiology may overshadow them all . <p> We are aliens <p> A dark secret lies deeply buried in our DNA . We are all aliens - made up of cosmic genes , from cosmic bacteria and viruses that drifted down to us in comet dust and meteorites through the depths of space . Recent studies have shown that a single drop of ocean water contains over 10 million individual viruses . An estimated total of 1031 ( 1 followed by 31 zeros ) viruses exist on Earth at any time , and if these are strung end to end they would span distances that are measured in millions of light years ! Such viruses appear to have controlled the evolution of life on the Earth from the first microbes brought here by comets to all life -- plants , animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer and Fred Hoyle over three decades ago is slowly but surely drifting into the domain of certain knowledge . Its final acceptance as the correct world-view will usher in enormous scientific and societal changes . <p> Earth-like planets galore <p> Astronomical observations using the NASA Kepler Space Telescope launched in 2009 have recently revealed that over 100 billion habitable Earth-like planets could exist in the Milky Way system , the galaxy of stars to which our planetary system belongs . And our most powerful telescopes can count well over a hundred billion similar galaxies grouped into clusters and super-clusters throughout the entire observable Universe . It is becoming increasingly difficult now to maintain that life can in any way be confined to Earth . In the cosmic context this planetary home of ours is a diminutive speck of " dust " in a universe that is simply bursting with planets , stars and galaxies . Clear and unequivocal evidence of our cosmic ancestry grows by the day , but alas we have chosen to ignore it for too long . Continuing to turn a blind eye to this evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our species . <p> An Earth-centred Cosmos <p> Some half a millennium ago Aristotle 's idea of a universe centred on the Earth ( enunciated in the 4th century BC ) was deeply entrenched in the West . Copernicus ' 1543 refutation of this geocentric world-view was vigorously disputed and challenged for over a century . New observations of planetary motions that contradicted this point of view were ignored , and people holding contrary views persecuted and punished in various ways . The Italian scientist Giodarno Bruno who proposed the existence of a multiplicity of inhabited worlds was burnt at the stake in 1600 . Galileo Galilei was convicted of heresy in 1633 and held under house arrest in 1633 . Needless to say such a strict reign of authority that persisted for over 150 years stifled the progress of science through most of the Middle Ages . Blind adherence to a doctrine ignoring all evidence is the surest recipe for cultural stagnation . Eventually through the diligent labours of Johannes Kepler , Tycho Brahe and Isaac Newton the medieval period of stagnation finally came to an end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orbiting quite an ordinary star , the Sun . <p> Earth-centred biology <p> In this article I point to an extension of the Aristotelean viewpoint that is still threatening to cripple science , biology and astrobiology in particular . Whilst the ideas of an Earth-centred universe were abandoned by the dawn of the 17th century , modern ideas of life continue to remain firmly Earth-centred . Life in the form of bacteria is posited , without any evidence whatsoever , to arise de novo in a primordial ocean from organic molecules that were supposedly generated in situ on the Earth . <p> This point of view might have been considered tenable until recently when the earliest microbial life on Earth was believed to occur a half a billion years after the surface had cooled . It could then have been argued that a long enough period remained for an organic soup to brew and for life to somehow originate . However it has now been discovered that the oldest evidence of microbial life on Earth is contained in rocks ( discovered in Western Australia ) that formed 4.1 billion years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombardment . The possibility of a terrestrial primordial soup is now squeezed out of the geological record making it most unlikely that life could have originated on the Earth . <p> The Theory of Panspermia <p> It is far more probable that the impacting comets brought the first micro organisms to Earth from the external cosmos . This is precisely the theory of cometary panspermia that the present writer and the late Sir Fred Hoyle had proposed more than three decades ago . In a long series of books and articles in scientific journals we first cited astronomical data and calculations that pointed to the widespread prevalence of freeze-dried bacteria and viruses throughout the universe . We next challenged the time-hallowed thesis of life 's terrestrial origin on the grounds of its utter and hopeless improbability . A much publicised metaphor used by Fred Hoyle in this context was that the origin of life from organic chemicals on the Earth was less probable than a tornado blowing through a junk yard leading to the self-assembly of a Boing 707 ! <p> Cosmic Viruses and Evolution <p> We also argued that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evolution leading to plants , animals , humans required a continuing input , albeit sporadically , of viral genes from the external cosmos . Darwinian evolution was then relegated to a less important role of sifting out best-fitting life forms ( vis a vis survival in the terrestrial environment ) from a range of outcomes determined by viral ingress to the Earth . On this picture major genetic shifts leading to the emergence of new species , classes and orders did not arise from the accumulations of favourable copying errors as hitherto believed but from the incorporation of whole new suites of cosmic genes . The game of dice leading to the emergence of species and gene diversity was played out not on our tiny planet Earth -- a mere speck of dust in a cosmic context -- but over a vast cosmological scale , over aeons of time . We argued that evidence in support of this theory existed in ample measure already in the 1980 's . We adduced evidence from genetics as well as epidemiology of certain viral pandemics in support of our claim . A lecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1980 , by the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation concluded thus : <p> " Throughout our long history as a thinking species we have always been loathe to accept a theory of the world in which we ourselves did not occupy a central and most important pace . The view that the Earth was the centre of the solar system was held for centuries , and was abandoned only with great anguish .... <p> Likewise , the same Copernican-style revolution must be applied to life . Life , with its extraordinary subtlety of design and its intricate complexity , could only have evolved on a scale that transcends the size of our planet , the size of the solar system , even perhaps the size of the entire galaxy ......... " <p> Scarcely two weeks later on April 15 , 1980 Fred Hoyle concluded a public lecture in Cardiff thus : <p> " Microbiology may be said to have had its beginnings in the 1940s . A new world of the most astonishing complexity began then to be revealed . In retrospect I find it remarkable that microbiologists did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penetrated had of necessity to be of a cosmic order . I suspect that the cosmic quality of microbiology will seem as obvious to future generations as the Sun being the centre of our solar system seems obvious to the present generation . " <p> Evidence continues to grow <p> These prescient comments set the stage for further exploration of our grand cosmic hypothesis in the decades that followed . After the lapse of more than a generation , progress towards fulfilling Fred Hoyle 's prediction might seem slow . This is not because supportive evidence for the theory of cosmic life has in any way been lacking , but rather due to the operation of a process of censorship of what is still a " forbidden hypothesis " . Life originating outside the Earth , and evolving mainly through the agency of external inputs , continues to be fiercely resisted by practitioners of orthodox science . With the body of supportive evidence getting stronger by the day , however , this resistance can not continue much longer . <p> From within astronomy itself new data concerning interstellar dust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced by us throughout the 1970 's and 1980 's . Most recently , examination of comets have yielded a vast body of data that is exceedingly difficult to reconcile without microbial activity . Last year the Rosetta Space Mission to a comet ( Comet 67P/C-G , to give its technical name ) discovered ample evidence of life processes releasing streams of organic molecules . <p> Evidence denied <p> Since 2001 the collection of material from the stratosphere using balloons flown to heights of 41km has shown ample evidence of microbes . The height of 41km is well-known to be far too high for clumps of micro organisms to be carried up from the ground , except possibly at times of major volcanic eruptions , and then they remain there only very briefly . We interpreted this data as evidence of a continuing ingress of comet-borne microbes , but this has been the subject of vigorous refutation and debate . Contamination is the favoured rebuttal of critics , but this is exceedingly unlikely in view of the precautions that were taken in the experiment . <p> Likewise the growing evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comets and meteorites that reach the Earth ) has been vigorously disputed . Recently , the Polonnaruwa meteorite that fell in 2013 was found to have unambiguous signs of microbial life -- far too uncomfortable for the critics . Most recently , in a desperate effort to maintain the orthodox theory , it has been alleged that the poor subsistence farmer who discovered these stones fabricated them in a high-tech factory ! No stone is left unturned when it comes to devaluing or denigrating data that point to our alien cosmic origins . One hears the constant refrain which is clearly irrelevant in the present context : an extraordinary hypothesis demands extraordinary evidence to defend it . <p> Medical evidence <p> The most relevant biomedical impact of this hypothesis related to epidemic diseases of plants and animals . When we first proposed the theory of viruses and bacteria falling to Earth from comets the possible link to pandemics came to the fore . A close study of the patterns of pandemics of viral diseases revealed that in some cases , eg. influenza , person to person spread of an endemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic instance of the 1918/1919 influenza pandemic that claimed over 20 million lives worldwide , the first outbreaks of a lethal strain appeared on the same day in Boston and Bombay . Before the advent of air travel this was of course impossible on the basis of person-to-person transmission . In more recent outbreaks of influenza and also other diseases ( eg Zika ) lethal new strains appear to follow from a recombination event involving a new RNA segment being added to an already circulating virus . The new segment according to this theory comes from space . <p> The idea of biological evolution driven by virions from space has been amply supported by the discovery of viral sequences ( retroviral sequences similar to HIV AIDS ) in the genomes of humans and other primates . The evolution of humans culminating in Homo sapiens sapiens ( modern Man ) has according to this theory been accompanied and driven by a long series of viral pandemics that introduced new genes along the evolving line which was balanced on a razor 's edge between survival and extinction . There seems little doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crucial role in biological evolution . <p> Alien genes discovered in the octopus <p> If a single discovery is to serve as a watershed in the journey to accepting our cosmic origins , it is a recent study of two related species the squid and the octopus . The squid has an antiquity in the geological record that goes back to the great metazoan explosion of multi-celled life 540 million years ago . The octopus apparently branches out from the squid line about 400 million years ago , presumed to evolve from an ancestral squid . Recent DNA sequencing of the squid and octopus genomes has exploded a bombshell . The squid contains a very meagre compliment of genes adequate to serve its modest survival needs . The emergent octopus , on the other hand , has over 40,000 genes ( cf the human has only 25,000 genes ) and many of these genes code for complex brain function . Others code for a highly sophisticated camouflage capability including rapid switches of colour . The octopus is incredibly more complex in structure and performance than its squid predecessor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function come from ? They were not present in the ancestral squid or in any other living form that existed on the Earth at the time . The clear implication is that they came from outside the Earth -- external to terrestrial biology . <p> Taking account of evidence from many disparate disciplines -- astronomy and space exploration , geology , biology , genetics and epidemiology -- there can be no question that alien life invaded the Earth 4.1 billion years ago and still continues to do so .

' <p> * The ' loser ' received nearly 3 million more votes than the ' winner ' . Of course , for some Americans who believe they live in a democracy , perhaps the ' loser ' needed to have 10 million more votes than the ' winner ' for their ' psychotic break ' . <p> * The day before the 2016 election , mainstream media were close to certain that Hillary would win ( New York Times , 85% ; CNN , 91% ; Huffington Post , 98% ) . This prognostication failure has further shattered what was left of trust for mainstream media authorities . <p> Added Levine : " While science provides us with no monolithic explanation for a ' psychotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who have had this experience is a horrific ' double-bind ' . An example : A sexually abused child is told by the family member abuser : " It 's now too late for you to escape , because I will deny it and nobody will believe you " ; and the child is left with the choice between continuing the sexual abuse or denouncing the abuser , an action the child believes will result in the child being accused by family of lying and/or the child held responsible for destroying the family . And so this unresolvable dilemma overwhelms the child . <p> " The lesser-of-two-evils choice -- especially when the two choices are both extremely evil -- is a double-bind of sorts . " <p> In Levine 's view , Bernie Sanders put his 12 million primary voters and other supporters also in a double-bind .

Given Clinton 's history , Sanders had good reason to believe that Clinton as President would likely betray campaign promises and simply blame failure on the Republicans . But rather than choosing Nader 's path , Sanders suppressed the reality of Clinton , and asked his supporters to do the same . <p> Many Sanders supporters could not shed the reality of Hillary Clinton 's anti-progressive history and that the Democratic Party establishment had sabotaged Sanders ( who the polls showed had a much better chance than Clinton of beating Trump ) ; and these supporters lost faith in both Sanders and the electoral process and did not vote -- a political-self psychotic break of sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A major issue for Trump supporters was ' crony capitalism ' , but well before Trump took office , he orchestrated the Carrier deal of tax breaks for jobs , which was so obviously a betrayal that even Sarah Palin decried it as ' crony capitalism ' . That has not been Trump 's only pre-inauguration betrayal . <p> Trump repeatedly promised to ' drain the swamp ' , Levine reminded readers . " The epitome of the ' swamp ' is the revolving door between the US government and Goldman Sachs , yet Trump 's nominees for his administration include former Goldman Sachs employees Steve Mnuchin for Treasury Secretary and Gary Cohn for National Economic Council . It 's now become increasingly clear that Trump appears to be well on his way to creating the most putrid swamp ever , as he nominated for cabinet positions six of his donors as well as several establishment politicians ( for example , Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell 's wife Elain Chao as Transportation Secretary ; 20-year US Senator Jeff Sessions for Attorney General , and others ) . <p> The focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the financial promises that Trump -- who they believe to be a ' warrior businessman ' -- will grow the GDP at a fantastic rate , and that this along with deregulation and corporate tax breaks will result in a return of high-paying jobs . For this group , the future holds another likely shock . Should corporations accrue more cash , recent history has shown us that they do not hire more workers at higher salaries but instead spend this cash on stock buybacks ! <p> On an individual level , wrote Levine , ' psychotic breaks ' routinely go two ways . If one is lucky and has support , one can emerge from this altered state with greater clarity of one 's true self . Or one can become permanently labeled as ' seriously mentally ill ' . <p> So , with America 's societal-political psychotic break , it is quite possible that a few more million people will emerge with clarity about the truth of the American sham democratic political system that validate the late great American stand-up comedian , social critic , actor and author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats in charge , average Americans have no f**king influence on government policy ! <p> Or , opines Levine , this societal-political ' psychotic break ' can result in further deterioration , " transforming the US from ' friendly fascism ' and bullshit hypocrisy about democracy to violent , boot-in-your-face fascism where truth tellers are driven underground , way underground .

Barely a few weeks after Hansie Cronje was sacked as South Africa 's captain in 2000 , the Proteas were touring Sri Lanka and as Cronje 's successor , it was he who had to deal with the mess . <p> When South Africa hosted the ICC World Cup in 2003 , Shaun aggressively pushed for the inclusion of his idols Allan Donald and Jonty Rhodes in the squad , despite the two players reaching the twilight of their careers . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made a miscalculation of the Duckworth Lewis chart that resulted in South Africa making a first round exit from the competition . Despite being South Africa 's most successful captain ever , Shaun was sacked soon after the World Cup . <p> Sunday Island caught up with Shaun Pollock , still South Africa 's most successful bowler in Test and ODI cricket ( 421 Test wickets at 23 and 387 ODI wickets at 24 ) . In this interview , he recalls taking over the captaincy at a difficult time , highs and lows against Sri Lanka , World Cup debacle and lots more . <p> Here are the excerpts . <p> Sunday Island : Your first series as South Africa 's captain was in Sri Lanka and obviously it was during a tough time as you took over soon after Hansie Cronje was banned for life for match fixing . Talk us through those tough moments . <p> Shaun Pollock : It was a difficult one for me under those circumstances . I remember my first press conference as captain happened in a Colombo hotel . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So there was Pakistani media , Sri Lankan media and South African media . That was a bit of an eye-opener . I answered all those tough questions . Then to captain the team in a foreign country in conditions that are totally different to what we are used to , was another challenge . We did pretty well I thought . We lost the first Test in Galle heavily , but bounced back to win the second one in Kandy . It was an exciting game . The last Test was at SSC and it was Arjuna 's farewell game as swell and it was drawn . It was nice to have a turnaround in that series after a massive defeat in Galle . Obviously it was very tough to play Murali on those conditions . It was a massive challenge . <p> Sunday Island : But you had captained the ' A ' team to Sri Lanka a few years prior to that and that experience would have helped . <p> Shaun Pollock : Yes I remember touring Sri Lanka in 1994 with the ' A ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But our skills were n't that good at that point . We were still learning about our games . You take all the information , but you do n't take too much out of that . When you start playing for South Africa only you develop as a player . I had played for five years by the time I captained the Test side . It was a challenge for us . As South Africans we are looking at attacks based on fast bowlers . Not much spin . We only had Nicky Boje as spinner on that tour . <p> Sunday Island : You lost the Galle Test by an innings and the significant thing about that game was Sri Lanka were 145 for no loss at lunch on day one with Sanath Jayasuriya unbeaten on 96 . <p> Shaun Pollock : Galle is a bit of a fortress for Sri Lanka is n't it . That 's a surface which obviously turns a lot . Many of the overseas teams that come to Sri Lanka struggle in Galle . You guys tend to dominate in Galle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His style was attacking all the time . We had a plan for him . We thought the best way to get him out was with the new ball in the first session . That did n't work . When the spinners came on he just smacked them all around the park . <p> Sunday Island : The second Test at Asgiriya was closely contested . Sri Lanka chasing 177 were 130 for four and needed only 47 . Jonty Rhodes then pulled off a blinder to dismiss Arjuna Ranatunga for 88 and the Sri Lankans collapsed after that . You won by seven runs . <p> Shaun Pollock : We have self belief as a South African team . If we get the slightest sniff , we fight hard . I remember Jonty 's outstanding catch to dismiss Arjuna . We managed to get a couple of wickets then and it was an amazing turn around . It was very exciting to win a Test match in Sri Lanka . To turn that game in Kandy coming from behind was a superb memory . I remember Nicky Boje bowled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Test wins . <p> Sunday Island : Talk us through the World Cup game against Sri Lanka in your home town Durban where you had to win to qualify for second round . But the game ended up in a tie . <p> Shaun Pollock : It was a nasty one . Had we won that game , we would have been through to the second round . It was very painful . The game was tied and we were out of the World Cup . The thing with rain is that you have no idea when it 's going to come and how long it is going to last . For us it was very disappointing as it was our own World Cup . I must say that we did n't play great cricket throughout that tournament as well . It was very disappointing . <p> Sunday Island : Did you feel hard done by when Percy Sonn sacked you as captain . They say you never swear , but apparently on that occasion you did ? <p> Shaun Pollock : Well they make decisions when there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where everyone had expected us to do well . People think that certain decisions had to be made . I thought I had done a very good job . I also thought that I had a huge role to play moving forward . But it was n't to be . They decided to make a change . It was a bitter pill to swallow for me . In life you hit these curve balls and it 's all up to you as to how you deal with it . You need to put all that behind you and move forward and that 's the key . <p> Sunday Island : Let 's talk about South Africa 's tour to Sri Lanka in 2006 . In the first Test Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene put on a World Record 624 run stand . You missed that game , but returned to play the second Test which was closely contested . <p> Shaun Pollock : I stayed at home for the first game for the birth of my second daughter . I came back for the second Test at P. Sara Oval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a back pain . I could n't bowl for the rest of the Test match and tried bit of off-cutters and different variation to see whether I could be effective . It was an exciting game . Sri Lanka won that game by one wicket . We put down a few catches as well . It was another exciting game that I have been involved against Sri Lanka . <p> Sunday Island : Obviously , Sri Lanka have struggled in all their tours to South Africa . What they should do to compete well in these conditions ? <p> Shaun Pollock : You never had three out and out fast bowlers who consistently play for your side . That 's a big challenge you guys are facing . There are some skillful bowlers in the current squad . But they are raw . These three guys can play a part going forward . Spin wise they do n't get conditions that suit spinners here . Murali did okay here . But Herath has struggled a bit . Spin is the impact the Sri Lankans rely on to win and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sunday Island : Do you intend to be involved with the game in a coaching capacity in future ? <p> Shaun Pollock : I like to spend lot of time with my children . My daughters are ten and 13 . Coaching could be an option later down the line . I could do some coaching in Durban where I stay . But doing something day in and day out moving out of Durban does n't excite me. 
@@16397234 <h> Galle Lit Fes 2016 <p> January 14 , 2017 , 7:24 pm <p> I write this on 11 January just before I leave for the Galle Literary Festival now having a longer name including that of the sponsor - the Fairway Galle Literary Festival - with the head of the organization very much everywhere . I will share impressions , happenings , literary pickings with you , my reader , on Sundays 22 and 29 after I return to my humdrum life on the Jan.15 . This time around , I am sure to be happier and more in it since family and friends will be in Galle , scattered somewhat since one felt the price of the hotel we booked was too high and another wanted her son to be closer to the sea . I am having more friends in the group too -- real soul mates . It 's who you go with that enhances any event . I remember being all by myself at the earliest GLFs . Then last year , after the revival of the Festival , there were four of us spending the entire duration of the Festival in Galle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw back reminiscence of the GLF ? Lots of answers come crowding the mind but pinpointing one impression I would say it is the ambience of the days spent going from one literary session to the next from Hall de Galle , the Maritime Museum and other venues . And what do I mean by ambience ? The dictionary defines it as " The character of a place or the quality it seems to have " . That is just what it is in Galle . It is the air you breathe , the scenes that meet the eye , the smell of the sea , the green of the mara trees and coconut palms , the apparent tranquility of the fort and the history of arrival of foreigners and colonization of this long-ago well known trading sea port . <p> Yes , it 's the atmosphere of the Fort , usually rather sleepy and laid back but now awakened and bustling with activity and people -- young , old and all casual and easily relaxed . It 's the surroundings and feel of the outside area of the Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by young persons making music and of course Dilmah tea in several flavours , iced and hot and given free . You have no time to relax since you have to get to the next session . <p> Most memorable sessions <p> Of all the sessions at the HSBC Galle Literary Festival , and they were excellent , the one I considered best in terms of topic , subject matter covered , speakers and what they had to say was Duet . Spotlight on India : from Midnight to Millennium on Indira Gandhi . Admittedly I am an Indophile but critical faculties were awake . And this I must state emphatically : the success of the session and the capture of audience interest and sustaining it was largely due to the moderator of the session -- Jayantha Dhanapala asking the most relevant questions and leading the session on successfully . <p> Nayantara Saghal , well in her eighties , needs no introduction . Daughter of Vijayalakshmi Nehru and Ranjit Sitaram Pandit , she is author of several books , the first being Prison and Chocolate Cake -- 1954 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this she wrote very critically of her cousin as prime minister , particularly during emergency rule under her tenure . <p> Dr Katherine Frank was born and educated in the US . She has three acclaimed biographies to her name : those of Lucie Duff Gordon , Emily Bronte and Mary Kingsley . Frank gave as her reason for writing the biography of this powerful Indian woman : " Indira Gandhi 's story is not available in the west . I decided to write about her to bring her life to a larger audience . " <p> Mark Tully and William Darymple have been invited speakers at several GLFs and I look forward to the sessions as they are often on India , Old India , the India of the Raj and even before of the Maharajahs . Tully 's presentation was titled East meets West , and as the programme noted , ex BBC correspondent and author Mark Tully discussed his new book which focuses on what India can teach the West . " ... he gave unique insight into the life of the subcontinent . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith in his religion ( Christianity ) further strengthened by seeing the commonality of different religions . He believes Karma plays a part in life . He says he has come back full circle to religion with firmer faith and he is writing on religion now after all he 's authored on the subcontinent . <p> William Darymple kept the audience in the Hall de Galle enthralled with his The Last Moghul . With the aid of slides he traced the decline of the Moghul Empire and the days of the last Emperor . A very interesting point he made was that when the British lived in India as traders ( East India Company ) they integrated well with the Indians , most taking Indian wives and treating them with respect and affection . But when they ruled the subcontinent they were uppity , to say the least , and cruel . With conquest came racism , intolerance and conversion of the Indian , where possible , to the Christian faith alongside a trampling of Hinduism and Islam and setting one against the other . <p> He traced the passage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dates and significant events like when in 1815 the entire city of Delhi with the Red Fort was destroyed . He spoke in detail of the uprising of the sepoys and the flight of the last Emperor Zaffer during a total eclipse of the sun in the afternoon when the fleeing Emperor handed over the relic of the Prophet 's hair , thus symbolically relinquishing his empire . Thus ended the magnificent Moghul Empire . It began with Barbur 's arrival in Delhi 332 years previously and reaching its zenith with rulers like Akbar the Great . The lineage came down direct from Genghis Khan . <p> Deepika Shetty interviewed Kiran Desai .. The main points that emerged from the interview was that Kiran Desai laboured on her Booker Prize winning novel , The Loss of Inheritance , for seven long years and one further year on seeing it through publication . Taking to writing had been going contrary to her mother 's advice . Anita Desai , an experienced novelist , warned this daughter of hers that creative writing brings pain and hardship and she 'd better go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went into science studies but soon enough diverted to writing classes . <p> Unveiling the Woolf ! Ashley Halpe discussed the latest biography of Leonard Woolf with the biographer herself -- Victoria Glendinning . Glendinning , apart from being a well known biographer , is also a broadcaster , critic and novelist and President of English PEN . She was awarded a CBE in 1988 . She is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and holds honorary doctorates from no less than four British universities including York . She has written biographies of Elizabeth Bowen , Edith Sitwell , Rebecca West and Vita Sackville-West and won many literary prizes including the Whitbread Biography Award . She was very informal and during other sessions sat with the audience and so it was a very pleasing shock to know the woman seated next to you was this well known biographer . She as completely unpretentious and friendly . <p> Other high points were listening to Picor Iyer and Vikram Seth , again Indians but Iyer lives in Japan , moving there from California when his house as completely gutted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meditation . Iyer spoke about his traveling with the Dalai Lama ; the inspiration he derived he could transfer to his listeners . I have just completed reading an Equal Music by Vickam Seth where he says in his note that music to him is as important as speech . Born in West Bengal he was educated in India and then joined the Universtity of Oxford , earning his doctorate in economics in Stanford . He is equally a poet as he is a novelist . He spoke to us at a GLF on his traveling by from China , through Tibet , to India . His mother is the first woman Chief Justice in the high court of Delhi . <p> I have not given dates , even years , in my reminiscences of past GLFs . They are not important . I 'm looking forward to much inspirational sessions this time too .

@@16397236 <h> Yahapalanaya 2017 -- A Dismal Anniversary <p> January 14 , 2017 , 7:23 pm <p> by Anura Gunasekera <p> The MP for Kurunegala , Mahinda Rajapaksa , has announced a wish , intent and threat , a three-in-one package for the New Year . Perhaps it is also a resolution ; that is to topple the existing Sirisena/Wickramasinghe coalition and to establish a new government . Its composition and contours have not been defined but it is a certainty , that the new regime he is contemplating will be totally controlled by him , even if he does not have an official position in it . <p> Mahinda Rajapaksa , by nature , inclination and habit is given to making vainglorious statements . Purple rhetoric has been his political stock-in-trade , whether talking about confronting real and imaginary enemies , improving the economy , ushering in a golden era for the nation , offering a fair deal and equitability in the treatment of the minorities and combating corruption ( the noise in the background is the derisive bray of equine laughter ) or any other question of national importance . However , to give the man the credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 30 years of war , making good on his assurances . As for the rest , it was mostly insincerity and actorish posturing . <p> Leaving aside the customary Rajapaksa mendacity and his yet unrealized dream , let us focus on the ugliness of current political realities , especially the unraveling of the " Yahapalanaya " covenant . <p> " Yahapalanaya " was a concept , a vision , a promise for a better tomorrow , an assurance extended to a despairing public , a last straw that disillusioned millions collectively clutched at . But the painful truth is that a concept and a vision and an assurance do not become a reality unless there is content , action and delivery of stated objectives . Of the last there were many noble statements but they still occupy the limbo of unachieved goals . <p> On the Yahapalanaya agenda were the restoration of genuine democracy , re-engineering of the economy and the curtailment of wasteful expenditure , total freedom of expression for the press and other dissenters , without fear of official reprisal as a response to the exposure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the implementation of measures for genuine reconciliation , the impartial investigation of allegations of mega -- corruption of the previous regime and the re-investigation of serious crimes , especially politically motivated murder , shelved or otherwise sanitized by the Rajapaksa regime . <p> Before the " Yahapalanaya " could even gird its loins , the waste from the Central Bank Bond scandal hit the proverbial fan ; the inept and transparently biased damage control operation only served to smear the odour on every surface , incriminating all actors in the drama and their patrons beyond the possibility of sanitization . Whilst CB Governor Mahendran was eventually removed no credit accrues to Yahapalanaya , as this action came as a reluctant and belated response to overwhelming external pressure , and not as an immediate and spontaneous internal acknowledgement of a massive financial impropriety . <p> Despite this early fiasco , in the first year there was reason for hope . The Right to Information Bill was passed and despite its detractors , it is still a commendable achievement . Major financial improprieties were under official scrutiny and other crime investigations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revisited . Questioning of alleged wrongdoers became a daily drama , paraded ostentatiously before an expectant public . The Baratha Premachandra murder case was concluded , with former MP Duminda Silva being among those convicted ; in the Rajapakse regime Silva 's exoneration would have been a certainty , even if the case had been concluded . <p> Then came the bombshell of the President 's castigation of the investigative bodies , resulting in the Bribery Commissioner herself becoming the most high profile casualty in the criminal investigation process ; in this writer 's view , the biggest body blow to Yahapalanaya , delivered by its chief architect . <p> On another side , the inefficiencies in the management of the economy and the implementation of political strategy have been nothing short of comical . There was the farce of the first Yahapalanaya budget , with Minister Ravi Karunanayake blustering before the public , his face covered in egg , defending a budget document which was systematically dismantled from the very moment of its presentation . Official statements on major issues made by high-profile government spokesmen , particularly by Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereafter , by another high-profile representative . The lack of cohesive policy and the cracks within an uneasy alliance were being exposed with a cruel clarity . <p> Amongst the most contentious issues the government now needs to resolve are the accords with regional powers . The CEPA agreement , now presented to the public as ETCA with , supposedly , the harmful elements of the former excised , is yet to be clarified to the satisfaction of its critics . The government assures that Indians will only be employed in IT and skilled occupations in the Dockyard . The immediate and logical question is : why can not locals be trained to do those jobs ? When the state is unable to resolve the daily unlawful intrusion of Indian fishermen in to national waters , how will they manage an Indian entrenchment on land , underwritten by a bi-lateral agreement ? <p> More serious than the Indian involvement is the extent of the Chinese incursion . Undeniably , those two sterile projects , the Hambantota harbour and the Airport , have been foisted on this government as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ease the consequent debt burden on the nation . The question is : has the government 's anxiety to throw the deformed baby out with the bath water totally clouded their view of the ground realities ? Or have they decided to ignore public opinion ? <p> How will the government alienate 15,000 acres from Hambantota for Chinese occupation , without causing massive disruption to local life ? Hambantota is largely rural , with fishing , agriculture and related occupations being the main sources of income generation for its inhabitants . This contemplated land area will carry forest reservations , villages , schools , farmland , paddy land , grazing for cattle , water ways , inland water bodies and places of religious worship . What is the state strategy to compensate local citizens for the loss of all these facilities and resources ? What will China do in this land area ? What are the new industries they propose to set up ? What impact will that have on the environment and local society ? If new employment is created , what proportion of locals will they employ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by much larger countries , all with economic and military power , greater than its own by an order of magnitude . Whilst maintaining mutually beneficial economic and political ties with them is an imperative , Sri Lanka has to take the utmost care to ensure that it does not enter in to asymmetrical agreements of long duration with a super power as , eventually , the damage to national interests will be irreparable . Once entrenched , the super power will not relinquish its hold unless staying on is detrimental to its own interests . It will only ask for more . National interest will not even be a consideration in their calculations . We have to bear in mind at all times that we do not have the wherewithal , to exert economic , political or military force to evict an undesirable occupant from our soil . <p> The government is yet to provide a workable solution to the demands in the North , a highly emotive national issue , without alienating the Sinhala south . It is yet to address the issue of the disruption caused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yet unresolved , with the GMOA arraigned solidly behind the IUSF in their demand to nationalize the private medical college . The protests at Hambantota are taking an ugly turn and whilst we can be fairly confident that there will be no repetition of the Rajapaksa suppression of dissent with the killing of unarmed protestors , as in Rathupaswela , continued dissent by citizens against major state initiatives can eventually crystallize in to a concerted move against the state itself . <p> Over time , all governments lose allure , credibility and , in the course of democratic process , are unseated . Mahinda Rajapaksa lost despite having as a lifelong credit balance , the victory over the LTTE . This regime , and its principal actors , have no such fall back resource and will either survive or perish , entirely on the merits of achievements during its tenure . What is deeply worrisome to its supporters is that the present regime seems to be fast losing touch with its base and the realities of the conditions which brought it in to power . One has to remove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly privileged background and a congenital inability for empathy , he has never understood or listened to the voice of the ordinary man . But inexplicably , President Sirisena , very much a man of the people , appears to have distanced himself from both the forces and the assurances which catapulted him in to power . <p> The only other alternative to this regime is a return to Rajapaksa rule . Mahinda Rajapaksa does not have any solutions to the problems the present regime is grappling with , many of them the results of his own misrule . He has demonstrated beyond doubt that he has no understanding of macro-economic concepts and protocols of governance , and that he has no regard for constitutional restraints on unethical rule . However , he understands political ground realities and is an expert at exploiting discord and intra-party fissures . What is in power is an unnatural cohabitation and all Rajapaksa has to do is to keep public attention focused on its inadequacies and glaring inability to read popular opinion , whilst selling to the masses his evangelical brand of patriotism . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , the disintegration of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe alliance and the opening of the door for the re-creation of the sordid Rajapaksa past .

Warakagoda Dhamasiddi Gnanarathana Thero <p> by Kumar David <p> The good news is that the six subcommittees ( Fundamental Rights , Judiciary , Finance , Law &amp; Order , Public Service and on Centre-Periphery Relations ) have submitted their reports ; all good work and if the exercise keeps on track this constitution could be much better than its predecessors of 1972 and 1978 . It is not often that one has an opportunity to congratulate our MP 's ; so well done ! This piece deals with the main points ; Dr Jayampathy Wickremeratne has a 70 page softcopy tabular comparison of the existing and proposed versions . <p> First a worrying claim about President Maithripala Sirisena carried by The Indian Express ( PK Balachandran : " Sri Lankan constitution making process hits a serious snag " ) on Jan. 3 : <p> " President Sirisena told the Buddhist high priests that he would once again consult the masses on the constitution , setting aside the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an exhaustive island-wide survey . On Sunday the President told the Mahanayakes of Malwatte and Asgiriya that he does not intend to include any divisive elements in the constitution .

( T ) he committee did not say whether the constitution should be unitary or federal ( but ) wanted to turn the now powerful Provincial Governors into rubber stamps of the Chief Ministers and had sought powers over land and police for the provinces . This set off alarm bells among the majority Sinhalese who considers this to be secessionist ( according to Balachandran ) " . <p> This is hard to believe , I hope a figment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the President and his wing of the SLFP do not favour a new constitution but prefer amendments . Their argument it seems is that it is difficult to win a referendum on a radical new constitution but compromises can muster the requisite two-thirds majority in parliament . <p> What to me is incredible about the six reports is that there is a black-hole in the middle of their solar system ! The six planets freewheel round a sun that does not exist ! Will the presidency be executive , semi-executive or ceremonial ? How will the president be chosen ? What is the balance of powers between president , PM-cabinet and parliament ? What of a second chamber ? What the trade-off between FPTP and proportional representation in parliament and province ? Total silence ! Did January 8 , 2015 ever happen ? The apex of state structure is undefined ; it is a mystery . Delineation of state structure at its apex is mysteriously missing while subcommittees frolic with trifling details . <p> Judiciary <p> The proposed structure is conventional ; the membership of the Supreme Court has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers is proposed . The report flays previous administrations for abuse of power and meddling with the judiciary ( music to the ears of human rights activists ) and makes a strong case for explicit clauses to ensure judicial independence and impartiality . Excellent ; though words will not deter crass autocrats like the one whose grip we recently escaped , but still it 's helpful . What can stop despots is the determined will of the people as we learnt in January 2015 . <p> Finance <p> There is a useful review of weakness of state financial mechanisms such as the budget making processes and inadequate control of borrowing . The report seeks to overcome weaknesses , ensure better control and management of public finance , budget processes and establish oversight . I am not constitutionalist enough to know how much should be laid down in the constitution and what is better relegated to ancillary legislation . Do you want to go in search of a two-thirds majority every time a procedural detail needs modification ? A welcome feature is that the report seeks equitable and adequate provision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors is discussed . <p> The huge defect in the ' Finance ' report is that it says nothing and proposes nothing to integrate the state into economic development . The report on the Public Service ( next item ) does make anaemic reference to a National Planning Commission , but the proposal has no gall or spunk . Last week I wrote approvingly of the Economic Development Bill ( ECB ) now before parliament which seeks to establish planning structures at centre and periphery . Remember I mentioned planets a while ago ? Well the drafters of ECB and the folks who wrote this report inhabit different planets ! How can so deep a proposal as the ECB find no resonance in the constitution ? <p> Public service <p> A good discussion and review of shortcomings , but the problem is that the recommendations pertain not to the constitution but to subsidiary legislation that should be enacted later . For example quality , efficiency , fairness , reasonableness and people-oriented service delivery can not be enforced constitutionally other than making sonorous pronouncements . <p> The Public Service Commission must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Senior Management Group to train officers , Public Sector Performance Review Committee , Public Corporation Service Commission ( there goes independence of state corporations and more political inference than at present ) and - help have they got anything more up their sleeve ! -- a National Committee of Public Service Commissions . The Steering Committee would be wise to sort sheep from goats when reading this report . <p> The report says Ministers must be accountable for instructions they give Ministry Secretaries , not only the other way round . Excellent , our Ministers habitually play pandu issuing verbal instructions about which they later deceive public and PM . This is a good proposal but what 's the best way to get it done -- constitutionally ? <p> There are many recommendations of constitutional ' stature ' . These include the establishment of Grama Rajayas to devolve power down to the broadest mass level , bilingualism with English constitutionally stipulated as link-language , and strengthening provincial public services . A debatable point is whether COPE , Public Accounts Committee and Committee on Public Petitions should be hardwired into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vagaries of fundamental rights in Lanka since independence and offers a review of human rights worldwide . This is true but certain to be ignored by dictators everywhere and -- god forbid -- in Lanka , again . This sour note aside , it 's a damned good to have a strong chapter on fundamental rights because of our misery with civil wars and white vans . The recommendations on individual , religious , language , trade union , family rights and the right to information are welcome . <p> The report recommends that social and economic rights be written into the constitution and be made justiciable . I do not oppose this -- who can -- but it 's a cry in the wilderness ? How to enforce in the context of budgetary , regional and planning constraints ? Socio-economic rights are right to education , health-care , **39;346;TOOLONG and the right to a healthy environment and natural resources ( whatever that adds up to ) . Very good but how is it going to be manifested , except in party manifestoes at election time ? <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African Constitution -- the drafters Mecca - which did not help one iota to deter a half-mad president from , in effect , murdering millions of countrymen . Thambo Mbeki , an ignorant black-racist and pseudo witch doctor , refused to allow his people -- the country worst affected by AIDS-HIV -- to receive retroviral drug treatment resulting in the worst known medical calamity . Of what use was ' finest social and economic rights chapter of any constitution ' , or the much extolled free and independent judiciary in preventing the catastrophe ? Nil ! <p> Law and order <p> The subcommittee says consensus could not be reached and only the majority report is attached ; the minority view is not made available ; we are not enlightened on who dissented and on what issues . Most of this report in not suitable for inclusion in the constitution ; the subcommittee recognises this and suggests that two new laws National &amp; Public Security Act ( to replace the Public Security Ordinance ) and Police Act ( to replace the Police Ordinance ) be enacted to include the bulk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a structural overhaul of the police into National Police ( NP ) , nine Provincial Police ( PP ) units and a Metropolitan Police ( MP ) for Colombo and environs . PP would be responsible for day to day stuff ( traffic , crowd control , crime ) and hence the large majority of personnel will end up here . NP will include CID , STF , maritime , serious commercial crimes and MP . It will also be responsible for national security , counter terrorism , the police academy and training . There will be a National Police Commission and Provincial Commissions to lay down schemes of recruitment , promotion , transfers and disciplinary control in their domains . Since transfer between NP/MP and PP is envisaged and since all officers above a certain rank will be eligible to become IGP , it is not clear how divergences in recruitment and promotion policies will be rationalised . <p> **38;387;TOOLONG ! The success of the proposed police structure is predicated on creating healthy instructions at the provincial and national level . The authors of Why Nations Fail ( Daron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they fail to build vibrant institutions . This will be the decisive challenge mediating the success of the proposed police system . <p> A second part of the report is devoted to National Security and envisages the repeal of the much hated " Emergency Law " -- hooray ! However it is to be replaced by new regulations under which a State of Emergency can be declared for 34 itemised reasons -- phew ! The list is extensive and constitutes an infringement of the rights of the citizen and an erosion of protection from abuses by the state ; so not much gained . The good side is proposed checks and controls on extension of a State of Emergency and a special majority ( maybe two-thirds but not specified ) will be needed to extend it beyond three months . Citizens can also file for judicial review of a declaration or against specific provisions . <p> Centre-periphery <p> relations <p> This piece is longer than my usual and I will surely have to return to this topic in the coming weeks ; so let me be brief . I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words like ' unitary ' and federal and the practical minded recommendations it makes have my support . The clout of the Governor will be curbed to the benefit of Provincial Councils ( PC ) , Provincial Ministers and the Chief Minister and his ability to block PC decisions will be time limited -- this will mean more devolution of power . Provincial authority over state land is enhanced and police powers will be more devolved since the Province 's Police ( PP above ) force will report to the relevant provincial minister . There is also substantial discussion of the provincial public service and provincial finances . <p> An important recommendation is to give the third-tier of administration ( Local Government ) greater power and recognition . A vital tool to accomplish this is the Grama Rajya ( GR ) concept . GR is a village council ( of more than one village to limit the number ) ; a statutorily recognised community level forum . GRs will assist , advice and monitor local authorities , Provincial Councils and the National Government it says in one place and elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A lot of thinking will need to go into formulation supporting legislation . <p> I will wind up with a few largely supportive comments . There is enough meat in the six reports to build a good constitution , equally useful are the ancillary ideas thrown up for supporting legislation . The envisaged practicable devolution avoiding verbiage that will rouse Lanka 's abundant supply of racists is workable . That such a degree of unanimity has been achieved by parliamentarians with varied ethnic delusions and partisan hues is encouraging . Missing are chapters on the apex political structure and on the directive role of the state in economic development . 
@@16397239 <h> Who is day dreaming ? Mahinda Rajapaksa or Maithripala Sirisena <p> January 14 , 2017 , 7:21 pm <p> by Rajan Philips <p> 2016 ended with a whimper for Sri Lankan politics ; 2017 has begun not with a bang , but political banter . The banter is about who will topple whom and who is day dreaming . They are all daydreaming , all three of them , Mahinda Rajapaksa , RanilWickremasinghe and Maithripala Sirisena . According to President Sirisena , his former boss , and predecessor , is daydreaming when he ( Rajapaksa ) says that he will topple the government in one week or two . But Mr. Sirisena did not let the former President finish his dream . It would have been a dreadful end because the dream would have reminded the former President that he could no longer be president , and at the first crack of any unlikely opportunity to topple the government , the best he can do is to become Prime Minister under President Maithripala Sirisena . They could both be dreaming hoppers . <p> President Sirisena is also daydreaming , but vicariously through the Central Committee of his bifurcated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution naming Maithripala Sirisena as the ' SLFP ' candidate for the 2020 presidential election . The President was there , but did n't say yes or no . He was daydreaming . Or , was he having nightmares in broad daylight ? He should be . Would n't it be something for Maithripala Sirisena to run as the new incumbent candidate of the same party that sacrificed its former incumbent candidate on the electoral altar the last time around ? What would be President Sirsena 's balance sheet on the term that he would have served , and his manifesto for the new term his party is dreaming he would be seeking ? Imagine , the same SLFP ministers who silently stood behind Mahinda Rajapaksa as he went down to defeat seeking a third term , now donning Version 2 of the yahapalanaya pacakge to help Maithripala Sirisena win just a second term . <p> Ranil Wickremesinghe must be having multiple dreams , given the many irons that he has been throwing in as many a fire . He reminds one of Leonid Brezhnev , the former Soviet Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longevity . There is nothing common between the Sri Lankan PM and the former Soviet boss ; the connection is in one of the many jokes about Comrade Brezhnev . The old Soviet society was as well known for its jokes as it was for vodka and swearing , for the jokes were outlets for the people 's political emotions and they reflected the swings in public mood . One Brezhnev joke went like this : Stalin , Khrushchev and Brezhnev and the Communist Party entourage are on a train from the Kremlin to Siberia . The train suddenly stops in the middle of nowhere , at the dead of night . The leaders wake up and inquire from their aides what was going on . The Politbureau is summoned and Stalin goes first : " Send the train engineers to the firing squad and get a new team of engineers " . Khrushchev deadpans : " We must convene the whole Central Committee and take a collective decision . " Finally , Brezhnev : " Let us pretend the train is moving and go back to sleep . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soporific last years of the Brezhnev era , when everything was pretended and nothing happened . Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is hardly soporific ; if at all he is hyper-active . He has let loose so many initiatives on so many fronts it is very difficult to keep track of them all . But after two years in office , the Prime Minister is not sleeping but pretending that everything is fine and there is nothing to worry about . Wake up in the morning , that is the government 's full term for you , everything would be fine . Yahapalanaya would have been started on all its fronts , but do n't ask how it would end on each front because that would be the end of history for Sri Lanka . The dream must not end . <p> Full term , but on Rajapaksa agenda <p> The Sirisena-Wickremasinghe government would likely serve out its full term , but it is becoming increasingly clear that it would do so implementing Mahinda Rajapaksa 's agenda that the common opposition so vehemently decried in the two 2015 elections . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labour between the UNP and the SLFP factions of the government ( and cabinet ) in implementing the Rajapaksa agenda . The UNP is taking care of the economic part of the agenda ; the SLFP , the political part of the agenda ; and it is a joint venture between the two when it comes to the corrupt parts of the Rajapaksa agenda . <p> To its credit , or discredit , the UNP leadership in appropriating the economic part of the Rajapaksa agenda has somehow managed to take ownership of all the blunders and corrupt failings that were associated with the original Rajapaksa projects . It is now up to the UNP to not only explain and justify what Rajapaksa started in Hambantota , but also deal with SLFP protestors against the magnified extension of what was started by the previous government . What smarts and what a turnaround ! But it is not so much of a turnaround for the SLFP in taking up the political part of the Rajapaksa agenda . The SLFP , despite its division between the government and the opposition , seems united @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that the constitutional changes should be limited to what can be achieved within the ambit of a two-thirds majority in parliament and without requiring a referendum . <p> On the other hand , it is curious that the SLFP ( government ) Central Committee that is running shy of facing the local government elections , or a constitutional referendum , is getting ready to face the next presidential election with Maithripala Sirisena as its candidate . If President Sirisena were to go along with the CC resolution , he would be the common SLFP candidate in 2020 , and not the common opposition candidate that he was in 2015 . He would be Version 2 of Mahinda Rajapaksa , and the SLFP CC must be daydreaming to think that such a candidacy could be successful in the next presidential election . While it would not be fair to assume that President Sirisena would abide by the ill-advised and premature SLFP resolution , it is fair to suggest that the President should direct his party in the government to focus on helping him fulfill the agenda that he was elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ publicly daydreaming about the next election . <p> It is also curious that the SLFP thinking , without daydreaming , is predicated on the assumption that President Sirisena is the only national figure who can again amass the same plurality of votes ( Sinhalese , Tamils and Muslims ) that vaulted him to victory in 2015 . But this assumption does not sit well with their positions on the constitution and the recent report of the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms . It is not just the SLFP position , but the position of the whole government and especially of the two government leaders , President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremasinghe , that is becoming a concern . Here again , the government , inadvertently or otherwise , is following the Rajapaksa example on the recommendations of the LLRC reports . <p> In that instance , at least Mahinda Rajapkasa formally received the LLRC report and even made headline photos of his trying to read it while reclining on an easy chair . In contrast , President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe have run shy of even being seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Chandrika Kumaratunga to do the honours of receiving the report from the Task Force members . The two leaders were not only not seen , but they also do not want to be heard on the new report and its recommendations . They can both run from the results of their well-intentioned initiatives , but they can not hide from the commitments that they have been making so handsomely since 2015.

The unthinkable had happened and the effect is somewhat like the Boxing Day tsunami which hit the Asia region in December 2004 . If he sticks to his campaign pledges , many of which were shocking , the victory of the president elect will see a complete overhaul of decades-old US practices and policies . The run-up to the election itself saw a seismic rupture with past presidential elections , with candidates attacking each other on a personal level and Mr. Trump even threatening to jail his chief political opponent Hillary Rodham Clinton . <p> In addition he ( Trump ) also promised to eliminate regulations on US businesses . The President-elect 's chief campaign slogan however was to ' drain the swamp ' - to become an agent of change , booting from power the elites who got rich while ordinary Americans struggled . And so it was , when the ballots were finally counted Trump had won 304 electoral collegial votes compared to 227 for Hillary Clinton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US society voting for Trump . Yet with days to go before his being inaugurated president , the US intelligence forwarded a dossier to current President Obama , the president-elect and leaked it to the media . The dossier contains allegations of a sexual dalliance between the president-elect and Russian prostitutes , which intelligence sources claim could leave the incoming president open to future Russian blackmail . The media is awash with lurid details of the incident . The document is unsubstantiated and BBC has reported the research was initially funded by anti-Trump Republicans ! Despite the media brouhaha , the president elect retains his popularity with electors . <p> A question which comes to mind is why was this document released/leaked to the media so late in the day ? Despite intelligence services having the document in their possession during the election campaign . After all did not the selfsame intelligence services leak stories and even reopen investigations into allegations of presidential nominee Hillary Clinton while the election campaign was in progress .

" I 'm going to bring down drug prices , " Trump said , according to a transcript of an interview posted on Time magazine 's website as it named him its Man of the Year . " I do n't like what 's happened with drug prices . " He also singled out Carrier Corp . and Ford Motor Co. in efforts to keep jobs in the U.S. , and called out Boeing Co. for the cost of replacing the Air Force One presidential aircraft .

The US intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US elections by hacking into the Democratic Party emails and giving the contents to anti-secrecy websites to publish . <p> Trump rejected the intelligence community 's assessment that Russia had meddled in the election , and ridiculed the assessment . He pointed out to the faulty US intelligence services reports claiming the presence of weapons of mass destruction in Syria . Improved US-Russia relations could see a drop in tensions world-wide , but will of course be a blow to the arms lobby as improved relations between the world 's super powers would see a drop in conflicts the world over . Peace does not bring mega profits to the arms lobby . The US president has since his election antagonized powerful lobbies within the US system . Is the system striking back ? The bigger question however , is whether US democracy as we presently know it can survive and exist in the aftermath of a Trump presidency ? Time will tell .

@@16532231 <h> STRATFOR ANALYSIS The Manila Times <p> This year will bring more political infighting in Sri Lanka as former President Mahinda Rajapaksa tries to stir discontent ahead of local elections and constitutional reform . <p> The disarray will continue to cause headaches for China , which invested in strategic and lucrative development projects in the country at a more placid time . <p> Tamil nationalism will further complicate matters as nostalgia for the defunct Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam insurgency increases among members of the ethnic minority . <p> ANALYSIS <p> Sri Lanka 's raucous political scene is poised to become even more tumultuous in this year . Once notorious as the home of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam , a militant group better known as the Tamil Tigers , Sri Lanka resolved its decades long civil war in 2009 . But in the years since the government 's victory over the Tamil Tigers , the underlying tension between Sri Lanka 's Buddhist ethnic Sinhalese majority ( 75 percent of the country 's population ) and the Hindu ethnic Tamil minority has persisted . Now , Tamil and Sinhalese leaders in Sri Lanka are at odds over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans to enact constitutional reforms . <p> To make matters more difficult for the current administration , former President Mahinda Rajapaksa -- who lost power in a 2015 electoral upset -- promised in late December to " topple " Sirisena 's government this year . Already , Rajapaksa has proved a formidable political foe as the leader of a movement that has forced the government in Colombo to rethink a development deal with China . Though the central government and Parliament still have a few years before the next general elections , the upheaval in Sri Lankan politics -- and a round of local elections later this year -- will test the sustainability of Sirisena 's administration . <p> Despite its small size , Sri Lanka holds substantial strategic value by virtue of its geographic position : It is at the center of Asia 's busiest maritime routes and has a wealth of natural deep harbors . Over the years , the country has attracted the interest of nearby India , which intervened periodically in Sri Lanka 's civil war , brokering a peace deal in 1987 and dispatching troops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunity to establish a footprint on the island nation . In 2005 , when India -- along with Western powers concerned with human rights issues -- left Colombo to deal with the conflict on its own , Beijing stepped in and offered the Sri Lankan military $1 billion in aid . China continued to lend the country financial assistance even after the war 's end , providing loans for development projects such as hydropower dams , roads and port infrastructure . Today , the Sri Lankan government owes Beijing $8 billion , more than 12 percent of its total $64.9 billion debt . Over one-third of the country 's government revenue goes to servicing that debt . <p> An inopportune development <p> Much of the political tumult in Sri Lanka stems from China 's growing influence in the country . On Jan. 8 , 21 people were injured and 52 arrested after protests broke out at a ceremony marking the first brick laid at the Hambantota Industrial Zone , a 6,000-hectare ( 15,000-acre ) industrial park near southern Sri Lanka 's Hambantota port . At the same time as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Employees Union staged sympathy protests at the ports of Galle and Colombo . Adding further weight to the civil action , lawmakers from the Joint Opposition , a parliamentary coalition still loyal to Rajapaksa , also participated in the demonstrations . Choosing his moment carefully , the former president then called for a meeting with China 's ambassador to Sri Lanka to discuss concerns about the project , an initiative Rajapaksa himself proposed while in office . <p> Chinese colony <p> Members of the opposition object to the terms of the original agreement , which offers China Merchants Port Holdings Co . Ltd. a 99-year lease on the industrial park in exchange for granting Sri Lanka $1.1 billion in debt relief . ( Activists have described the project as the beginning of a " Chinese colony " on the island . ) Rajapaksa , meanwhile , opposes the appropriation of local village land under the agreement , insisting that the original deal leased only about 300 hectares on a shorter term . <p> In the wake of the protests , the Sri Lankan government deferred signing the agreement , delegating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beijing 's dismay . This is not the first time China has weathered a political firestorm sparked by its development projects in Sri Lanka . In March 2015 , the $1.4 billion Colombo Port City project , which Chinese President Xi Jinping personally inaugurated six months earlier , came under criticism in Sri Lanka for appearing to grant the Chinese military potential control of the country 's airspace . After repeated delays , the Sri Lankan government finally gave the go-ahead to resume construction on the project , now known as the " Financial City , " in March 2016 . ( On Jan. 5 , Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe announced that Sri Lanka 's air force and navy would be handling the project 's security . ) The Chinese government struck both deals as part of its Maritime Silk Road Initiative back when Rajapaksa had a tight hold on power . Since his defeat in 2015 , the projects have become a source of growing contention between the current administration and Rajapaksa 's supporters in the opposition . <p> The President 's predicament <p> The discord in Sri Lankan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rival from Rajapaksa 's own Sri Lanka Freedom Party , owes his surprise victory in the 2015 elections in large part to the support of minority parties . Many voters in Sri Lanka 's Tamil-dominated northeastern regions pulled for the current president , likely motivated by distaste for Rajapaksa 's role in the bloody assault on Tamil Tiger territory that ended the civil war -- killing thousands of civilians in the process . In addition , Tamil voters objected to Rajapaksa 's attempts to centralize power in Colombo . The Tamil National Alliance , a coalition of Tamil parties that picked up 16 seats in Parliament during the 2015 vote , has put greater regional autonomy at the center of its platform . If the current government does not honor its demands , Sirisena may well lose the Tamil National Alliance 's backing in the next national elections . <p> Sri Lanka 's geographic challenge <p> In fact , the coalition threatened Jan. 15 to rescind its support for the president 's constitutional reforms if the government does not heed its calls for a federalist model and a merger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so would jeopardize Sirisena 's standing among his Sinhalese supporters , who staunchly oppose granting Sri Lanka 's Tamil areas more power . For Rajapaksa , Sirisena 's loss would be his gain , since the former president has positioned himself as the champion of the anti-federalist cause . Though Sirisena has staked his political future on constitutional reforms to reverse Sri Lanka 's " executive presidency " system and reform the electoral process , he has little room to maneuver . <p> Mounting opposition <p> At the same time , signs of growing grassroots opposition to the central government are cropping up in Tamil areas , mostly in response to the enduring presence of Sri Lankan forces there and their continued occupation of land . ( Since the civil war 's conclusion , the military has returned only 5.2 percent of the private land it seized from Tamils following the conflict . ) Members of the Tamil minority have even become less restrained in their expressions of nostalgia for the Tamil Tiger insurgency , long considered a taboo in the country . An official in Jaffna district caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Velupillai Prabhakaran would have made an excellent lawmaker or president . Students in the district even dragged out Tamil Tiger memorabilia and military headstones to celebrated a Tamil holiday . <p> Notwithstanding the mounting turmoil in Sri Lanka , Sirisena 's rule is not in any immediate danger . His National Unity government holds 155 of the 225 seats in Parliament , while the pro-Rajapaksa faction has only 50 seats . <h> One Response to " Sri Lanka braces for trouble ahead " <p> Whoever is doing it , the Hambantota projects funded by China must go ahead . It will provide employment to the two poorest Sinhala districts of the country now battered by drought . It will also ease the massive debt burden . More people were displaced by other development projects ( Mahaweli , Southern Expressway , Colombo beautification , etc. ) but overall they benefitted the nation . <p> Chinese government must make it clear to all politicians of Sri Lanka that it will not come to their rescue if they keep postponing and disrupting Chinese projects . This should include Chinese veto on war crimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

@@16532232 <p> Last Wednesday , January 18th , Sri Lanka 's minister for regional development , Sarath Fonseka , told journalists at a conference in New Delhi that terms were being discussed to give Sri Lanka 's northeastern Trincomalee port to India . Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe reportedly vouched for the veracity of the remarks on the sidelines of Davos . But by Friday India was denying them , stating that they had no interest in taking on a fledgling port that would n't be profitable for a very long time . <p> The offer of Trincomalee port to India was a move designed to offset India 's very outspoken reservations about the amount of Chinese economic and political power that is being consolidated right off their coastlines . To salve India 's fears that some of these Chinese projects could someday have military implications , Sri Lanka attests that they are not partial to any one country in particular when it comes to investment and are willing to do business with a wide array of potential suitors -- be they from India , the USA , Japan , Singapore , or China . India was never overtly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for some , such as Colombo Financial City , the Hambantota port , and the projected Hambantota industrial zone , they have actually been invited in . <p> While India has shown inclinations to invest large amounts of money in Sri Lanka -- just a few months ago India 's Commerce and Industry Minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced that they would be pumping $2 billion into Sri Lankan infrastructure development -- they have n't exactly jumped right in to make good on this offer . India has its own infrastructure challenges at home , they have a dire need to modernize their own ports , and taking on Sri Lanka 's port at Trincomalee does not appear to be on their near-term to-do list . <p> Only PARAGATHI Gonseka wants to " give " Trincomalee Port , the largest deepest natural harbor in South Asia to India . <p> ALL of us KNOW the TRAITOR Gonseka who netrayed Sri Lanka to the West and the ICC , is salivating at the prospect of SOMEHOW becoming President ! So , what Gonseka says ..... DOES NOT COUNT , DOES NOT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Looks like we have got the wrong end of the stick again ( as with Hambantota protests in 2017 ) . Actually , we should be proud of Sri Lanka 's new ( unbelievable ) bold stand . It is common knowledge Sarath Fonseka is a mismatch at the Raisina Dialogue . It is a projection of Indian hegemony attended by important people who indirectly shape economic and geopolitical policy of countries . Why did Sri Lanka send a person completely ignorant of geopolitics and economics to this ? Sending Fonseka was an insult to the Raisina Dialogue ! <p> That is exactly what it is . Raisina Dialogue is organised by India and started last year to counter China 's growing economic clout in Asia . However , even in that many speakers ( including Chandrika ) pointed out the need to see China as an opportunity not a threat . Sri Lanka 's position towards China changed drastically since then . In addition , India deliberately planned this to coincide with the Davos conference where China was expected to ( and actually did ) steal the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a worthy counter to China . Hilarious indeed . By sending Fonseka , and not sending any of the head of the state personalities , Sri Lanka sent a powerful signal to India that it will not play by Indian geopolitical games . Bangladesh followed this same strategy . <p> I think Fonseka was trying to assume some self-importance by spilling the beans ( or inventing something else ) . For that he was grilled by the CID for 5 hours over the stale Lasantha affair . This is a common practice of this government . Anyone it wants silenced is grilled by the CID , FCID , etc . <p> This is another event of a series of action Sri Lanka has taken since 2016 disregarding Indian dictates ( Port City , Hambantota , Moragahakanda , the proposed kidney research institute , making a mockery of the Raisina Dialogue by sending a joker , continuing navy action against Indian poachers , approaching China 's AIIB for more loans at the Davos conference though rejected , approaching China 's Jack Ma for the development of direct small-scale sales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other reports dismally failed , etc . ) . <p> At last , the government elected with Indian help seems to have realised it has no future with India . A very good and bold indication that must be supported by all . Not the government but its bold action against Indian dictates . <p> I sincerely hope that the Opposition will not play politics with this and side with India . This is what always happened . When the government takes bold decisions against Indian dictates , the Opposition opportunistically becomes the Indian agent in the island . We must keep our senses open to detect any sign the Opposition making gestures towards India . One key foreign affairs commentator ( a great human being by any standard though ) of the JO is an Indian citizen who lived in India for a year until July 1987 ( until the Accord gave them a common amnesty ) . He was hiding in India fearing the JR Regime ( anti-Indian ) , not the JVP as he states because the JVP ( Deshavimukti Janatha Vyaparaya ) started killing pro-Indians only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Accord ( 1987 ) , not 13A . That prevents us from doing anything inimical to Indian interests ( as decided by India ) . Essentially , Sri Lanka is an Indian satellite state since 1987 . Only LTTE resisted it ( 1987 to 2009 ) and after its demise , the entire Lankan territory is an Indian satellite state since 2009 . All our leaders are protective of 13A ( a product of the Accord ) so it is a waste of time even to think of abrogating the Accord . <p> I do n't trust any of these statements from India . It has not been declared officially by some authority . Some Indian official has told it and they play according to the game plans of RAW . Even the Forbes writer could have been bribed by RAW to make it more glitter . <p> This will cool down our public sentiment and ECTA and the Hanuman Bridge will easily get materialised un-noticed .. Please do not be complacent . <p> Gonseka is in RAW 's pay role and he has stirred up the issue according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again probably published by RAW will on surface kill the issue for ever , in our public mind . Then as usual , " Sinhala Modayas " will forget about ECTA and the Bridge and be busy with the day to day work and Teledramas at the evening . <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

There are useful second chambers in large states with federal constitutions . The second chamber in Britain that Dr. Fernando cites is a holdover from feudal times and its powers have been cut down step by step since the Liberal Party government of Lord Asquith in 1910 . The most recent rationalization of their legislature has been to take away most of the judicial functions of the House of Lords and vest them in a new Supreme Court . It is probably a matter of time before the House of Lords will become another a curiosum in Bagehot 's ' The English Constitution ' . <p> Be that as it may , my chief concern is the idea that professionals , including Ph.D . degree holders , would form a pool from which about ' 50 eminent persons ' could be selected ( elected ? ) to function as a Second Chamber which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The institution of MPs from the two old English universities was again a holdover from feudal times when corporations with royal charter could send in representatives to Parliament . ) Last year a university professor estimated there were some 80,000 professionals in the country . The evidence from a casual examination of the behaviour of professionals here and now is that those people are wide open to the risks of temptation to corruption , nepotism and other malpractices and that they succumb to those temptations with no less alacrity and more cunning than their comparators . This does not in any manner assume or establish that all professionals are crooks and knaves . We know that it is not true . The ideal that Dr.Fernando saw has deteriorated to what we see on the ground as aristocracy , ' government by the best ' deteriorated into democracy , ' government by the mob ' as Plato averred . What is the casual evidence ? <p> Several instances of massive corruption and malpractice have come to light in recent years . Take payments by the Central Bank in millions of rupees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bank and for promoting a site in Sri Lanka for the 2016 Commonwealth Games.A reasonable reading of the Monetary Law Act which governs the working of the Central Bank does not provide any legitimacy for such payments . Yet the Governor , the Controllers , Accountants and other professionals put through those deals . Some officials actually signed the cheques . How did they take each step when some must have known it was wrong and water spout conversation must have spread the horrid tale ? The 2015 Bonds Scam arose mainly from failure to follow procedure at the Bank by senior staff . There have been no stories of anyone of those professionals protesting or resigning because they did not want to participate in the racket . Take the massive losses of Sri Lankan Airlines partly because payments were made for crooked activities and activities unconnected with the work of the airline.The people in authority were professionals , including accountants , lawyers and university graduates.There were firms of auditors whose reports should have boldly highlighted these breaches of procedure and perhaps of law . Did you hear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the course of recent inquiries by Police into the conduct of a loquacious politician that he pleaded that he did not know the law and his officers did not warn him that what he did was wrong . The 1972 Constitution , departing from the Soulbury document , empowered Ministers to direct and supervise the work of their ministries . The 1978 Constitution copied it Article 52 ( 2 ) . Although the Auditor-General does not generally report on the responsibility of ministers for the management of their ministries , they are in law and in fact responsible for the maladministration and the mismanagement of their ministries . ( The Auditor-General must hold Ministers jointly responsible for the management of the Ministry . Otherwise , Minsters will have power without accountability . ) Ministers have an obligation to know the law relating to their work and if they did not know it , it is their funeral . However , if the professional staff did not in writing protest that they could not do what was not permissible under the law , their conduct in the minimum is unprofessional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is a lesson for public servants . No matter the instruction from the minister , they must record in writing ( and a copy reserved in their private safe possession , preferably overseas ) that instruction was illegal and that they would not carry it out ) . Each trade union of public servants must hold public meetings and inform the public and politicians that would be their conduct thereafter . <p> Take a second category of professionals : lawyers . I was told that for years there have been several thousand cases awaiting proceedings in court and in fact there were cases in court which have dragged on beyond 50 years . The causes are not entirely that there are inadequate resources ( Whenever did a bureaucracy complain of a plenitude of resources ? ) to resolve these cases but that expeditious disposal of cases now pending and coming to courts afresh would cure the beggar of his sores ( Surgical procedures do that. ) without which he can not beg.There was a retired Chief Justice of the Supreme Court repeatedly pleading for mercy in public for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grossly wrongfully and knowingly , to prevent his friend , the accused , from going to jail and of course from becoming the President of the Republic . Two Chief Justices were dismissed , one after an impeachment process as rapid as the Court Martial that deprived a four star general of his rank and honours , of his pension and lively hood and of his liberty and a career , the other summarily.Two others were appointed in their places without due process in situations that were not revolutionary . Did the lawyers protest loudly ? These incidents should have happened in Pakistan and we would have seen behavior exemplary . <p> Take a third category of professionals and Ph.D . degree holders : university men and women , professedly professional . There are several works of fiction written by university teachers about the conduct and behavior of their peers in the humanities faculties.It seems to me interesting that the characters in these works of fiction do not come from the non-humanities faculties , although one of the writers was a distinguished professor of Dental Surgery . Inquiries do confirm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remark briefly on their influence on language competency among language users . Prior to 1960 or so Sinhala usage was governed by teaching in pirivena and teachers colleges and when Kumaratunge 's teachings were held valid there was elegance in Sinhala usage . Read writings of Martin Wickremasinghe , Rapiel Tennekone , T.B . Ilangaratne , Sarachchandra and Gunadasa Amarasekera . New writers who came after about1960 had learnt their Sinhala from universities whether directly or indirectly . Recently , it was necessary that the term ' electoral college ' ( in US ) be translated into Sinhala for news reports . On two television channels which I saw , the Sinhala versions were ' mativarana vidyalaya ' and ' chanda vidyalaya ' . The problem is with ' vidyalaya ' . Both etymologically ( vidya+ alaya , knowledge house , pustaka+alaya , book house ) and by usage vidyalaya is a place of learning : visva vidyalaya , visaka vidyalaya . It is common knowledge that the US ' electoral college ' is not an educational institution . Yet , nobody felt the need to look up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college ' is also commonly used to mean a collection of people organised for particular purposes : College of Cardinals of the Roman Catholic Church , College of Physicians ( MRCP ) and many others . The nomenclature ' college ' in medieval universities rose from the same meaning : ' Fellows and Students of St.John 's College ' . More generally , sensitive readers have suffered long from the ugly language usage perpetrated by university professors and their students . If that is the way that university professionals discharge their avowed obligations , would anyone in his normal senses agree to hand over a part of legislative functions to them ? <p> Dr.Fernando also raises the need for a Planning Commission . The last time we officially had something like that was from 1966-1977 . That was the Ministry of Planning and Employment.The most important parts of that mechanism were the Department of Plan Implementation and the Department of External Resources . These two departments handled questions of resources allocation which comprise the essential part of planning . The proposed Development ( Special Provisions ) Bill on which I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Planning Commission . I would leave planning functions to this body rather than set up a new mechanism . The mechanism of advisers to the President , in the previous administration , using professionals was much abused . I heard complaints from some such advisers that they felt utterly unused and were mostly ornamental . Only a scant few resigned . There was no major report , except one , whose authorship was attributed to any one or more of these advisers . The exceptional report was prepared by Professor W.D . Luxman . He headed a Taxation Commission and produced a report , with customary thoroughness , I expect . I demanded several times in this newspaper that the report be published and was treated with utter disregard . ( Although details may have changed , the fundamental problems of taxation have remained and the public may well gain if the present government were to publish that report . ) There is a probable explanation for this urge to collect Ph.D.s as advisors . President Rajapakse 's government lacked intellectuals among its central supporters . The two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would not hew wood and fetch water for them . In fact , frequently they spoke highly critically of the policies of that government , although they voted for that deplorable 18th Amendment.All ' concepts ' ( sankalpayakata anuva ) seem to spring directly from that fertile broad forehead of the President . Surely these men must have some idea of their limitations . Is n't there a feeling of shame associated with such frequent repetition ? And whatever are those 1.4 million public servants doing ? Are they so barren that they can not conceive an idea for one good project when their political copartners do it so frequently more in darkness than in daylight ? <p> This country already has a surfeit of elected representatives of the people running ( at times ruining ? ) people 's lives : about 1,000 .

He does ask us to think about a real problem that exists . I happen to think that the solution he presents is not the right one . However , the very poor quality of debates in Parliament , which I read from the Hansard , has been given painful evidence of the quality of persons in Parliament . .

A second reason is that there is no research service to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are faced with .

@@16532236 <h> Let 's Not Eat Meat ... for a better Environment <p> January 22 , 2017 , 9:37 pm <p> The Island 's " Health and Society " of last Friday ( 20.01.2017 ) spoke of why we should not eat meat for health reasons . That discussion will continue in the coming weeks as well . Now let 's see why we should do the same , for the good of the environment . <p> It is well known that killing of animals for food , fur , leather and cosmetics is one of the most environmentally destructive practices taking place on the earth today . Besides , raising animals for these purposes requires enormous amounts of land , food , energy , and water in addition to facilities to dispose their excreta and waste and managing their health , thus , depleting the already scarce world resources . <p> Enormity of land use for agriculture is so much so that it is estimated that 40% of the world 's landscape is used for producing food for people . And out of that , about 30% is utilized for the maintenance of live stock and poultry , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water use , as one-third of the world 's fresh water is used for the purpose of rearing livestock and poultry . There may be no other single human activity that has a bigger impact on the planet than raising the livestock . As Bryan Walsh , Foreign Editor of TIME laments , " the planet we live is one gigantic farm , one occasionally broken up by cities , forests and the oceans " . He further says , " Planet is n't getting any bigger while the global population and the global appetite keep growing . While factory farming in the U.S. ( and Europe ) gets a lot of criticism for its cruelty , it poses danger to the public health through the overuse of antibiotics and the pollution of air and water " . <p> The environmental impact of the livestock is captured in the Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) report titled Livestock 's Long Shadow ( 2006 ) , where it states , " the livestock sector is a major stressor on many ecosystems and on the planet as a whole . Globally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gases and one of the leading causal factors in the loss of biodiversity . In developed and emerging countries it is perhaps the leading source of water pollution " . <p> Environmental Destruction <p> of Predation <p> Some equate carnivorousism to predation . The enormity of the negative environmental impact of industrial livestock and poultry production could be understood by the following statistics . <p> Forest Destruction <p> It is estimated that half of the annual destruction of tropical forests is caused by clearing land for beef cattle ranches . This has also reduced the natural habitat of the wildlife drastically . Each pound of hamburger made from Central American or South American beef has been worked out to cost 55 square feet of rain forest vegetation . For each person who becomes a vegetarian one acre of trees are known to be saved per year . <p> Soil Erosion and Desertification <p> Soil is the earth 's fragile skin that anchors all life on Earth . It is comprised of countless species that create dynamic and complex ecosystems and is among the most precious resources to humans . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overgrazing , the cover of vegetation almost gets removed from the land . The soil becomes exposed and gets eroded by the action of strong wind , rainfall etc . It is estimated that half of the topsoil on the planet has been lost in the last 150 years , mainly due to the conversion of forests and grasslands to farm fields and pastures . According to the World Watch Institute , one pound of beef from cattle raised on feedlots represents the loss of 35 pounds of top soil . <p> Air Pollution <p> Both , setting fire to forests to clear land for cattle grazing and burning of oil in the production of feed grain result in air pollution . The carbon dioxide ( among the other gases ) thus emitted is the main cause of global warming . <p> Besides , meat industry is notoriously fuel intensive . Calorie for calorie , it consumes 40 times more energy to produce 1 kg of beef than similar quantity of soybeans . Also it produces greenhouse gases such as methane , in addition to carbon dioxide . Methane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The global warming potentiality of methane is much greater than carbon dioxide , and is 84 times more . ( But as the overall quantity of carbon dioxide produced the world over is much greater than methane , the former remains the main culprit of global warming ) . About 12% of the total methane load that find way to the atmosphere is thought to come from the cows , and there again mainly from the feedlots as compared to the range-fed . The usual rearing method of animals practiced in India and most of the countries in the global South is range-fed . As the feedlots consume much larger quantities compared to the range-fed , they produce more methane than their less " affluent " counterparts . <p> Water Pollution <p> About 50% of water pollution in the West is directly linked to their livestock and poultry industries . Pesticides and fertilizers used in grain production for the livestock run off into the lakes and rivers polluting them , further to a part of it seeping into the water table . In addition , pollution of water from organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockyards holding pens . Due to the nature of feeds given to the industrialized livestock and poultry , their excreta are anywhere from ten to hundred times more concentrated than raw domestic sewage . Reports of these been responsible for forest killing acid rains come from the Netherlands . <p> Water Depletion <p> In the industrialized world the livestock and poultry industries consume as much as 50% of their water supplies . Weight for weight , production of meat requires 100 times water than vegetarian sources . For example , while it takes only 25 gallons to produce a pound of wheat , it takes 2,500 gallons of water to produce a pound of meat . <p> Agricultural Inefficiency <p> The unconventional economists believe that rearing animals for food is a highly inefficient form of agriculture . About half of the world 's grain is consumed by the animals that are later slaughtered for meat . A simple economics in this regard is that it takes 15 pounds of grain and soybeans to produce 1 pound of feedlot beef . It is said that if all the soybeans and grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would feed 1.8 billion people ( or quarter of the world 's population ) , a quite a viable answer to world 's hunger while saving the lives of " born to be killed " hapless animals . <p> **45;426;TOOLONG ... The man who upheld the Indians ' right to breathe -- CSE <p> Paying a glowing tribute to India 's outgoing Chief Justice T. S. Thakur , the New Delhi based Centre for Science and Environment identifies him as " the man who upheld the Indians ' right to breathe " . In its e-publication of Down To Earth it unfolds how Thakur , while sitting at the helm of Indian judiciary , helped the citizenry breathe better quality air through his groundbreaking judgments . <p> Down To Earth reports , the battle against air pollution gained momentum in 2016 with the judiciary taking action to deal with it . The national capital witnessed a spike in pollution levels post Diwali last year . The situation got out of control , as a thick blanket of smog settled over the city , affecting visibility . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoors as a precautionary measure . <p> The Supreme Court acted in right faith . Taking cognisance of the fact that firecrackers were responsible for Delhi 's foul air and worst smog in decades , it banned the sale of crackers in Delhi and the National Capital Region ( NCR ) on November 25 , 2016 . Earlier , on November 10 , the court had asked the Central Pollution Control Board to submit a graded emergency action plan to tackle pollution . <p> Justice Thakur 's statements show his concern over the deteriorating air quality in the national capital and reflect his urgency to deal with the crisis . Given below are some of his landmarks proclamations . <p> " Do you want to wait till people start dying ... people are gasping for breath . " <p> " You are sluggish in responding to the problem . You are not even conscious of the need to set up more machines to get a clear picture on pollution in different places in the city . " <p> " We want to know about your plan . How you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you must plan for graded response for different levels of pollution . You must not allow things to go out of control . It must be checked . The CPCB ( Central Pollution Control Board ) has no plan . It works in the dark and gives different reasons for the crisis . We gave you two days but still you do n't have a plan . " <p> " There is , however , no reason why registration of private cars and SUVs using diesel with an engine capacity of 2000 cc and above should not be banned . It is noteworthy that diesel vehicles of 2000 cc and above and SUVs are generally used by more affluent sections of our society and because of the higher engine capacity are more prone to cause higher levels of pollution . A ban on registration of such vehicles will not , therefore , affect the common man or the average citizen in the city of Delhi .

" <p> " We accordingly direct that the state government and the local bodies concerned , including MCD ( Municipal Corporation of Delhi ) , NDMC ( New Delhi Municipal Council ) and all other institutions that are generating solid waste shall take steps to ensure that no part of such waste is burnt and that proper arrangements are made for disposal of such waste in a scientific way without causing any hazard to environment .

Like all migrants we invariably gravitated to little circles of our own trying to recreate and relive that part of the culture and society we left behind . Withdrawing into little identity islands of our own culture , surrounded by alien waves lashing us daily , was a prime necessity to create a sense of togetherness and security . Being with our own kind rekindled our faith in our selves when we were trying find our feet in a foreign land . So bumping into a fellow-Sri Lankan in Melbourne in the seventies was like Robinson Crusoe discovering Man Friday . Creating a little bit of Sri Lanka and living in it became one of the great achievements of the expatriates .

And everyone who met him felt his comforting , calming , almost priestly presence . He rose in stature by being the unwavering moral man who , in the Kiplingnesque sense , never lost his head when everyone else was losing theirs . He carried within him an unshakeable religiosity that influenced his thoughts and actions . His soothing quietude and " natural piety " ( Wordsworth ) was endearing , almost hypnotic , and I used to tease him saying that in his previous birth he must have been a Buddhist monk meditating in the forest on the eternal laws of samsara ( dharma ) and the higher values of life that went with it . That is one aspect that was unmissable in Judge Weeramantry 's life : his amazing grace which , incidentally , was one of his favourites hymns he played on the piano for all of us at parties that sometimes went on till break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it without being of it -- again another quality of his religiosity . He would , for instance , come to parties carrying a whole bundle of papers and while we were belting out " Ka-pal-la , bee-pal-la , jolly kara-pal-la " at the top of our voices , gathered round the pianist , ( who else but his gifted wife , Rosemary ! ) , he would slip into a secluded room and write the next chapter of his latest book , or correct exam papers of his law students at Monash University . There was a fine balance in all his actions as there was in his judgements . Above all , he was a glutton for work . <p> He was an indefatigable explorer of paths to peace . He had an inexhaustible and indomitable will to go with it . Combined together he produced volume after volume dealing critically with the many challenges that threaten modern civilisation and mankind . His dissenting judgment at the International Court of Justice ( ICJ ) declaring the use of nuclear weapons " illegal in any circumstances " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also confirms his moral courage and concern for the future of humanity . It is inconceivable that learned judges who huff and puff about human rights violations in small countries should take the side of Big Powers armed with nuclear weapons -- the most destructive force that can wipe out the human rights of all mankind in one flash . The ICJ was divided evenly on this issue with seven judges for and seven judges against it . The decisive vote of Court President , Mohammed Bedjaoui , tilted the judgment in favour of the Big Powers . Judge Weeramantry was the leading judge of the ICJ who stood up for mankind and their right to live in a world without WMDs . His dissenting judgment was a big blow to the Big Powers who expected the judges to legalise their WMDs , while dictating human rights to the smaller nations .

Considering the potential to wipe out humanity with WMDs stored in the silos of Big Powers and considering the unforgiveable scale of crimes committed at Hiroshima and Nagasaki , what moral right did the judges of the ICJ have to legalise nuclear weapons ? The Court President , Mohammed Bedjaoui , stated categorically : " Nuclear weapons , the ultimate evil , destabilize humanitarian law , which is the law of the lesser evil . The existence of nuclear weapons is therefore a challenge to the very existence of humanitarian law , not to mention their long-term effects of damage to the human environment , in respect to which the right to life can be exercised .

One judge , for instance , had thought that Buddhism was some voodoo cult ! Though the ICJ was supposed to be a universal court of justice for all mankind it was primarily dominated , like all other UN organisations , by Western , or Western-oriented legal eagles whose limited knowledge on the diverse global culture was deplorable . He was , perhaps , the pre-eminent polymath with a 20-20 vision in the land of blind . In his biography he was critical about international justice system in which the Western lawyers dominated every department of the international law . The best of specialists in international law came from Western universities and legal agencies , the prosecutors came from Western legal systems , the majority of judges too were drawn from Western or pro-Western countries .

WMDs are the anti-thesis of human rights . It is in this context that the minority vote of Judge Weeramantry speaks louder than the majority vote of misguided missiles in the ICJ . Though he lost it was great day for humanity who had no one to speak on their behalf in the highest court of the world . The anti-nuclear movement has found in him an enlightened moral leader who could , hopefully , pave the way for a world without WMDs some time in the distant future . <p> His dissenting judgment was in keeping with his religious beliefs which elevate the sanctity of human life -- the greatest and the glorious manifestation that illuminates an infinitesimal corner of the immeasurable universe . Besides , it reflected his innate tendency to stand up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his moral conviction that no one should bow down to foreigners of the West simply because they have the power , wealth and the institutions of international law under their thumb .

I shall enumerate some of them , expanding on them in the next chapter : i ) Inability to run our institutions without factionalism ; ( ii ) Envy of success of others ; ( iii ) Lack of respect for law and order ; ( iv ) Lack of a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( vi ) Lack of transparency in public decision-making , appointment , contract , disbursements ; ( vii ) Multiple division of society ; ( viii ) Using politics as a road to personal advancement ; ix ) Making extravagant election promises ; x ) Over indulgence in political rhetoric ; xi ) Sweeping past wrong doings under the carpet ; xii ) Waste of resources on political tamashas ; xiii ) Cringing before superiors ; xiv ) Fawning on foreigners ; xv ) Flaunting of wealth , possession and power ; xvi ) Lack of concern for the environment ; xvii ) Outsourcing crime through contract killers . ( pp. 15 -- 16 ) . <p> " A noticeable national weakness is the tendency at many levels of society to show excessive deference to foreigners , particularly from the west " ( p.49 ) . His judgements were drawn from his rich experiences that span the colonial and the post-colonial periods . He wrote nostalgically : " We all have memories of the days of friendship and happiness before these communal problems erupted and have a longing for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he goes down memory lane and recalls : " One of my earliest childhood memories was that my father 's friend from his student days in England was Mr. G. G. Ponnambalam , a regular visitor to our home who used to take me with him n horse back when I was five or six. ( p.99 ) . <p> He was most saddened by the communal violence that consolidated divisive politics . He refused to accept that the break-up of the nation in any form as the solution to communal harmony . In his chapter on Ensuring A Single Sovereign Sri Lankan State he stated quite categorically : " The fourth essential -- and this is perhaps the most important -- is the acceptance by all of the basic principle that any solution whatsoever must be in the context of a single Sri Lankan sovereign state . " ( p.101 ) . It was on this principle that he came forward to give leadership to the patriotic Sri Lankan community faced with the aggressive anti-Sri Lankan lobby , led by Prof. C. J. Eliezer , in Melbourne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV the Tamil propagandists , as usual , played up , quite effectively , the role of being victims of the majority Sinhalese persecuting the minority Tamils . It was a political ploy manipulated by them to win the sympathy of the shocked Western audiences . <p> The Tamil lobbyists , at all levels , excelled in dramatizing the theme of victimology to nail the Sinhala-Buddhist majority in the eyes of the world . To them " 1983 " was a blessing in disguise . It gave them the visual and marketable images of " Paradise Burning " to demonise the Sinhala-Buddhists as the evil force that discriminated against the Tamils of the North -- the most privileged community in Sri Lanka . Prof. Eliezer , who was a lay preacher in the Uniting Church , did not hesitate to grab this opportunity to campaign for a separate state . He was an established figure leading the anti-Sri Lankan propaganda campaigns . <p> Non-Tamil Sri Lankans , however , were paralysed not knowing how to counter the sudden wave of sympathy that was sweeping the Western world in the immediate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this vacuum to give leadership to the rudderless Sri Lankans . He formed a multi-ethnic front , the Overseas Sri Lankans Organisation for National Unity ( OSLONU ) which presented the alternative narrative . His stature , his vast knowledge of the law and history , his commanding personality , his persuasive presentations were invaluable assets in combatting anti-national propaganda . Our confidence was strengthened by the fact that a judge of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka was willing to walk with us in the streets of Melbourne , carrying placards . <p> For his part , Prof. Eliezer manoeuvred , in overt and covert tactics , to pursue separatist politics as a Mosessian commandment . He was committed to keep the divided expatriate community apart . Prof. Weeramantry , on the contrary , was stretching every nerve to bring unity and harmony . He even led a delegation of Sri Lankans to meet the Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne , hoping to get the blessings of the Church for communal harmony . The Archbishop agreed to hold a prayer meeting of all communities for peace and amity . Prof. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his divisive politics . In a move to reach out to the Tamils , Prof. Weeramantry reserved a place for the Tamils in OSLONU at the presidential level and invited them to join the other Sri Lankans in setting an example for communal harmony . But Tamil separatist politics forced them to abandon peaceful co-existence and communal harmony . <p> Finally , he achieved his dream when he brought undergraduates from the northern , eastern and southern universities under one roof at the Subodhi Institute at Piliyandala . In this experiment he discovered that the undergraduates who were at first reluctant to even smile with each other were crying and hugging each other when the time came for parting at the end of a fortnight 's communal living . He was quite elated that his experiment had succeeded . He saw great possibilities in it for the future of communal harmony . <p> In his legal career he rose way above the chrematistic , coconut-cracking , black-coated pettifoggers at Hulftsdorp . He went through all the stages that a lawyer could go through . He was a lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teacher of the law , ending up finally as the Vice-President of the ICJ . We have had eminent Sri Lankans shining in various realms of international law and institutions . Shirley Amerasinghe presided over the UN law-making body of the sea . Jayantha Dhanapala headed the UN Atomic Energy Commission probing deep into the center of atomic particles . Nandasiri Jasentuliyana soared high into outer space to write the future laws of the new world opening up in the Milky Way . Judge Weeramantry occupied the highest seat of all in the ICJ -- the highest court in the world . <p> His career path to that seat was foretold by one of his lawyer friends when he was appointed as the youngest judge of the Supreme Court . He was told that he would go abroad , be a teacher of the law and at the age of sixty or so he would win the Nobel Prize if he was a scientist . But as lawyer the equivalent of the Nobel Prize was a seat in the ICJ . However , there were many obstacles in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jayewardene , the brother of President Jayewardene , who promised to help him , undercut him and presented himself as the rival to Prof. Weeramantry . The Foreign Ministry went round the world capitals canvassing for Harry Jayewardene . But he lost . His CV was limited to one line : an article in the Daily News . Judge Weeramantry 's impressive CV ran into pages with Ph D 's from international universities . <p> In the second round , it was Asia 's turn but the Jayewardene government had pledged its support to the Pakistani candidate . Zia al-Huq was the head of Pakistan . There was no way that Prof. Weeramantry could win the backing of the Sri Lankan government . There were only a few days left for the closing of applications . By this time the Jayewardene 's were no longer in power . President Ranasinghe Premadasa was in command . But Jayewardene 's commitment to support to Zia 's nominee was in force . Then , as predicted , even world events turned dramatically in favour of Prof. Weeramantry . Zia went up in helicopter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pakistan said that they were not interested in Zia 's nominee . And so the doors opened for Judge Weeramantry to win his " Nobel Peace prize " . <p> In all respects his was a legendary career . In the words of Lakshman Kadiragamar , his achievements abroad were merely the icing on the cake . It was baked wholly in Sri Lanka which , he said , broadened his perspectives with its blend of multi-ethnic , multi-cultural tolerance . Though a staunch Catholic he was proud of the Sinhala-Buddhist culture in which he grew up . He even wrote lines picked from the Mahavamsa into the texts of international law in his judgment on the Danube contested by Hungary and Slovakia . The following extract reveals the extent to which he was influenced by Buddhism . He wrote : " The teachings of Buddhism go even further , for they require a compassion for all living things even to the extent of recognising the rights of animals to freedom form fear . The sermon of the Arahat Mahinda to King Devanampiyatissa at the time when Buddhism was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The concept of freedom from fear is an advanced human rights concept . Yet more than 2000 years ago the king was told " Remember that these animals are also as much inhabitants of this island as you are " . The king was also told that he was only a trustee of this land , and not the owner of it . Trusteeship is one of the basic principles of modern environmental law . Yet , it was anticipated over two thousand years ago . This basic concept of environmental law is thus deeply ingrained in our traditions having been incorporated in the very first sermon that was preached at the time when Buddhism was brought into this country . " ( Sustainable Development : Ancient concept recently developed ) . <p> If there is one single strand that dominated his thinking it was religion . He believed in the brotherhood of mankind and , in keeping with this philosophy , he titled his three-volumed biography Towards a One World . His faith in humanity was as great as his faith in religion . He saw in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewed the UN Charter , particularly its " commandments " on human rights , as a secular translation of the humane principles enshrined in all religions . Not surprisingly , the last text he wrote , lying on his back at the hospital , was titled , Praying the Hail Mary . <p> He was , by any known standards , a great son of Sri Lanka who never forgot to pay his dues to his homeland . <h> One Response to " The Amazing Grace of Judge Christy Weeramantry " <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

@@16729232 <h> Will Norway handover diaspora Tiger leader " Nediyavan " to Sri Lanka ? <p> 2017-02-04 00:16:33 <p> 0 <p> 523 <p> By D. B. S. Jeyaraj <p> " What was your first military operation " ? was a question posed to Veluppillai Prabhakaran in a media interview many years ago . The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) leader replied " Alfred Durayappah " . Prabhakaran was of course referring to the popular former Mayor and ex-MP Alfred Thangarajah Durayappah who was gunned down within the Jaffna peninsula on July 27 , 1975 . Prabhakaran and three others Kalapathy , Kirubakaran and Satkunam were responsible for the cold-blooded murder which took place opposite the Ponnaalai Varadarajaperumal temple . <p> An assassination of an unarmed civilian holding elected office is generally regarded as an act of terrorism and not as a military operation . But Prabhakaran claiming the murder of Durayappah as his first military operation is indicative of Prabhakaran 's twisted mindset which perceived an act of terrorism as a military operation . This may perhaps throw much light on the personality of the ruthless Tiger supremo whose organization was responsible for the murders of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sri Lanka . <p> Starting with Jaffna Mayor Durayappah , Prabhakaran 's LTTE went on to assassinate numerous political leaders , including a former Indian Premier , a Sri Lankan President , a Sri Lankan ex- leader of the Opposition , Several Cabinet ministers , ex-chairmen of District Development Councils , Parliamentarians and ex -parliamentarians , leaders of rival Tamil militant organizations etc . Many analysts have pointed out that the prevailing crisis of a lack of strong political leadership within the Tamil polity is very much due to the effect caused by the spree of continuous political assassinations by the LTTE . <p> All this however came to an abrupt end in May 2009 when the LTTE was defeated militarily by the armed forces . The Tiger leadership was eliminated . Over 12,000 members of the LTTE who surrendered were detained and released in stages after undergoing a process of rehabilitation . The overseas structures of the Tigers remained intact , but were seriously undermined by the fall of the LTTE in Sri Lanka . The Diaspora Tigers though active abroad could do a very little damage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lankan soil had virtually ended . <p> Tamil National Alliance The Tamil people living in Northern and Eastern Sri Lanka in general and their political parties in particular were the main beneficiaries of this changed state of affairs . The premier political configuration of the Sri Lankan Tamil people - the Tamil National Alliance ( TNA ) - emerged free of the eight-year period of political bondage and servitude suffered under the LTTE . The TNA re-invented itself to changed circumstances accordingly and began chartering its political course independently . The chief constituent of the TNA namely the Ilankai Thamil Arasuk Katchi ( ITAK ) asserted itself more boldly and began playing a more strident role in Tamil politics . The TNA established itself as the dominant political entity representing the Tamils of North - eastern Lanka by doing well at Parliamentary and Provincial Council polls . The TNA won 14 and 16 seats at the 2010 and 2015 Parliamentary elections respectively . The TNA got 11 seats at the 2012 Eastern PC poll and 30 seats at the 2013 Northern PC elections . <p> Though Tamil politicians would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat and destruction of the LTTE by the armed forces that had caused this renaissance in the democratic political sphere of Sri Lankan Tamil politics . After many years of being under the Tiger yoke , the Tamil leaders were able to engage in democratic politics without fear . To adapt the Orwellian ( George ) phrase " Big Brother is watching " to Lankan Tamil politics " Little Brother " ( Thamby ) was not watching any more . The danger of democratic Tamil politicians facing death at the hands of the LTTE began diminishing . Assassination of Tamil politicians by the Tigers became a distant memory . <p> Definite plot to kill This situation underwent a drastic change last month . After many years of comparative calm and safety , the spectre of moderate Tamil political leaders being assassinated by the LTTE was raised again . The possibility of a Tamil parliamentarian being assassinated by the LTTE on Sri Lankan soil became once again a shocking reality . A definite plot to kill TNA MP for Jaffna district and lawyer M. A. Sumanthiran by exploding a claymore mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13 , 2017 was uncovered by the Police Terrorism Investigation Department ( TID ) . Sumanthiran accompanied by his wife was scheduled to travel along the road to participate at a seminar in Maruthankerni on that day ( 13 ) . However , due to some private reason , he had cancelled the trip on the previous day . This unexpected cancellation unintentionally thwarted the diabolical designs of the would-be assassins . <p> Four suspects , all of them former members of the LTTE were arrested and produced at the Kilinochchi Courts on January 20 . Police told courts that a claymore mine , detonators and stocks of Kerala Ganja ( Marijuana ) were discovered in their possession . It was also mentioned that there was a conspiracy to kill a political VIP . Sumanthiran 's name was not mentioned . The four suspects were charged separately for the alleged offences of possessing narcotics and dangerous explosives and for plotting to kill a political VIP . Three " B " reports were filed . None of the suspects were charged under the Prevention of Terrorism Act ( PTA ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They were held at the Anuradhapura prisons . The assassination plot against Sumanthiran had not been reported in the media at this point of time . <p> Extensive details of the assassination were reported exclusively in Sri Lanka by this column in the " Dailymirror " of January 28 , 2017 . The Indian English Daily " The Hindu " also carried a news story by its Colombo correspondent . Subsequently other newspapers too picked up the story . So , when the matter was taken up again at the Kilinochchi courts on January 30 , the news about Sumanthiran being the target of an assassination plot was well-known . <p> Three separate reports Yet , the Police maintained its earlier stance on January 30 too with one change . One more person , Vijayan from Mannar had been arrested and charged . Now there were five suspects . The alleged offences were still the same . There were three separate reports on charges of narcotics possession , possession of dangerous explosives and plot to kill a political VIP . Sumanthiran 's name was not mentioned explicitly . Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephones of the five suspects to Moratuwa University for further decryption and analysis . Two lawyers appeared on behalf of the suspects and requested that they be transferred to Jaffna prisons from Anuradhapura . All five were further remanded until February 13 . <p> After remanding the suspects , Kilinochchi Magistrate and District Judge A. A. Anandarajah summoned the Police to his chambers . The Judge queried from TID officials the name of the targeted VIP . He was informed that it was M.A. Sumanthiran MP . Thereafter Judge Anandarajah inquired from the Police as to whether any other political VIP was also being targeted in this regard . The TID had replied that only Sumanthiran MP was the target . Then the Judge had asked as to why the Police was not naming Sumanthiran explicitly in their reports . The Police had said that they wanted to do that after the mobile phones were scrutinised at the Moratuwa University . Thereupon Judge Anandarajah had advised the Police to combine the three separate reports into one report and file it in courts the following day . He also instructed Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot in the report . <p> This was adhered to promptly by the Police who filed a fresh report B 85/2017 on January 31 . In that report filed at the Kilinochchi Courts , TNA parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran was specifically mentioned as the intended target of the suspected assassination attempt planned for January 13 , 2017 . Five persons , Gnanasekaralingam Rajmathan from Trincomalee , Lewis Mariyampillai Ajanthan from Maruthankerni , Karalasingham Kulendran from Kilinochchi , Velayutham Vijayan from Mannar and Murugiah Thavaendran from Kilinochchi are the five suspects . The next hearing will be on February 13 , 2017 . <p> It has been the usual practice in matters like this to charge suspects under the PTA and conduct further investigations . This however is not being followed in this matter . This has led to former External Affairs Minister Prof. G.L.Peiris raising the issue . Prof. Peiris in a media interview has questioned the Govt as to why the suspects were not being charged under the PTA . According to authoritative sources , this is so because the Govt had already taken a policy decision to repeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation . The Govt had decided not to charge anyone under the PTA until it was replaced . As such , the Govt does not want to utilise the PTA in this respect and is trying to conduct further investigations into the case without resorting to the PTA . Since Sumanthiran MP himself has been critical of the PTA in the past , this Govt 's decision is expected to strike a responsive chord with the TNA parliamentarian notwithstanding the fact that he himself is the target in this case . <p> Safety and security The decision not to invoke provisions of the PTA does not mean that the Govt is not concerned about the safety and security of Sumanthiran MP in particular and Tamil MP 's in general . The post-war years have seen many futile attempts to revive the LTTE on Lankan soil . These attempts were strongly backed by LTTE and pro-LTTE elements in the Diaspora . Fortunately , these attempts were checked and foiled on time by vigilant Police and Security Forces . This has been the case in this instance also . The plot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this attempt as opposed to the earlier ones is the fact that for the first time a clear conspiracy to assassinate a specific individual has been detected . There is nothing vague or ambiguous about the overseas LTTE-backed plot by ex-Tiger cadres to assassinate Sumanthiran on the Soranpatru- Thaalayady road . <p> Sumanthiran is resented by the extremists in the Tamil community . This is particularly so with the Tiger and pro-Tiger elements in the global Tamil Diaspora . He has been constantly attacked and vilified in media organs partial to or controlled by the LTTE . In early 2015 , there was an orchestrated campaign against TNA leader R.Sampanthan and M.A.Sumanthiran amidst the overseas Tamils . Their effigies were burnt . I have focused on those attacks in detail in these columns written for in the " Dailymirror " then . <p> An excerpt from the article headlined " Tamil extremists target Sampanthan and Sumanthiran " which appeared in the " Dailymirror " of February 28 , 2015 describes the political role of Sumanthiran and why the Tamil extremists attack him . Here is the excerpt - " These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find fault and embarrass the TNA particularly its leadership . Sumanthiran is singled out specifically because he is the most articulate TNA parliamentarian . <p> He is widely accepted by Southern politicians nationally as well as leaders and officials internationally . Sumanthiran is the most trusted and able deputy of the octogenarian Sampanthan . In recent times , Sumanthiran has been playing a constructive role in Tamil political affairs . In a blend of public advocacy along with quiet diplomacy , the TNA national list MP has been rendering yeoman service to his community . In many instances , those who want to weaken Sampanthan use Sumanthiran as a target . The idea is to cripple Sampanthan politically by undermining Sumanthiran " . <p> Sumanthiran 's political role " Sumanthiran 's political role has been appreciated and praised by many but it has also led to some resentment in certain circles within and outside the TNA . The green eyed devil has much to do in this regard . Among the TNA parliamentarians of today , Sumanthiran is the only MP who has had no interaction with any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entering politics . Though born at the Mcleod Hospital in Inuvil , Jaffna , he grew up in Colombo and studied at Royal College . Sumanthiran was aloof from active politics , practising law in Colombo until invited by Sampanthan to join the TNA . He was appointed national list MP in 2010 by Sampanthan " . <p> When I wrote this article in 2015 , Sumanthiran was a national list MP . However in the 2015 August polls , he contested from the Jaffna district and was elected MP . The Diaspora Tigers spent huge sums of money to defeat him at the 2015 Elections but he had won handsomely . But the people backed by the overseas Tigers like Gajendrakumar Ponnambalam of TNPF and Suresh Premachandran of EPRLF lost badly . Thereafter the Tigers coordinated and conducted a campaign to abuse and humiliate Sumanthiran publicly at different places in Jaffna and in Western countries like Australia , Britain and Switzerland . The idea was to pressurize him into quitting politics . This too did not happen . <p> Sumanthiran has been playing a very positive role in bridging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restoration of Tamil rights through democratic means . In recent times , he has been making a constructive contribution to the Constitution making process in his capacity as TNA member of the Constitutional Assembly Steering Committee and also as co-chair along with Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne of the Management Committee of the Secretariat for the Constitutional Assembly . It is widely acknowledged that the enactment of a progressive Constitution would be a significant achievement that could usher in true justice , equality and ethnic reconciliation . It is an incontrovertible fact that the LTTE elements overseas and pro-Tiger elements within Sri Lanka are extremely antagonistic towards Sumanthiran . Also troubling is the fact that he has been intensively vilified and derogated by pro-LTTE elements in Sri Lanka and abroad . Traitorization and character-assassination has been the usual LTTE practice before and after killing a person . This modus operandi was patently visible in the assassination of Dr. Neelan Tiruchchelvam . <p> Phenomenon of traitorization I did write about this traitorization and elimination process extensively in an article titled " Recurring Phenomenon of " Traitorization " in Tamil Nationalist Politics " published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here is an excerpt - " Any Tamil , proposing conciliatory politics or supportive of co-operation with the Government will have the Damoclean sword of Traitorization hanging over them . In the present situation , comparatively moderate TNA leaders such as Sampanthan and Sumanthiran are also being labelled as traitors . Their portraits and effigies are being burnt . The latter is the favourite target of the LTTE elements . He is being vilified widely as a " thurogi " or traitor . As noted earlier , the practise in the past when the Tigers were riding high was to demonize someone as a traitor and then exterminate him " . <p> " Mercifully , this is no longer an option for the Tigers and their fellow travellers because of Mahinda Rajapaksa , who has bestowed a great gift upon the Tamils by destroying the LTTE militarily in Sri Lanka . In a post-Prabhakaran era , the course of action available is not assassination but character assassination . The idea is to " kill without killing " by portraying the targeted victim as a traitor . Unable to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cremating " portraits and effigies . However , there is the danger of this trend acquiring a destructive capacity if left unchecked or not contained now " . <p> When I wrote the above stated lines nearly two years ago , I was confident that the overseas Tigers and/or their minions would not resort to killing or encourage assassinations in the current post-war situation in Sri Lanka . This is because anyone with a modicum of rationality and at least a tiny amount of concern for the well-being of the Tamil people in Sri Lanka would realise that a resumption or eruption of violence would be suicidally detrimental to the interests <p> of the community . But the LTTE and its fellow travellers are guided by the politics of irrationality and complete lack of concern for the Tamil people . The course of events that led to the humanitarian catastrophe of Mullivaaikkal and Nanthikkadal illustrate this . The idea is to " kill without killing " by portraying the targeted victim as a traitor . Unable to kill physically , the bloodthirsty fiends satisfy their lust by " cremating " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this trend acquiring a destructive capacity if left unchecked or not contained now " . <p> When I wrote the above stated lines nearly two years ago , I was confident that the overseas Tigers and/or their minions would not resort to killing or encourage assassinations in the current post-war situation in Sri Lanka .

The course of events that led to the humanitarian catastrophe of Mullivaaikkal and Nanthikkadal illustrate this . <p> " All changed utterly " It is against this backdrop that I warned in March 2015 that the effigy and portrait burning campaign against Sumanthiran could take a dangerous turn and acquire a more lethal and destructive capacity if unchecked or not brought under control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the first time , after the war concluded , the authorities have detected a conspiracy and plan by Tigerish elements to assassinate a democratic Tamil Parliamentarian . Not only Sumanthiran but all democratic Tamil politicians striving to arrive at reconciliation and peaceful co-existence now face potential risk , This has transformed the political situation entirely . As Yeats wrote in his " Easter 1916 " " All ( has ) changed , changed utterly " . <p> The Sirisena-Wickremesinghe Govt is not unmindful of this changed scenario . After protracted discussions at the National Security Council meeting chaired by the President and at the intelligence services coordinating meeting chaired by Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi , a new security arrangement has been formulated . Protection for leader of the Opposition R. Sampanthan and Jaffna district MP M.A. Sumanthiran will be provided by the Police Special Task Force ( STF ) . In addition , all TNA parliamentarians and Provincial ministers will be provided enhanced Police security . <p> This applies even to Northern Chief Minister C.V . Wigneswaran who has been accused in recent times of playing " footsie " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into force from the beginning of this week for Sampanthan and Sumanthiran . The Jaffna district MP who was targeted for death in Jaffna in mid - January undertook a two-day trip to the northern peninsula mid-week to appear for the defendants in a murder trial and also to attend some social and political events . Many people in Jaffna did not expect Sumanthiran to visit Jaffna so soon after the assassination plot was detected . Most of his supporters were pleasantly surprised to see the MP in Jaffna and expressed concern over his safety . Jaffna High Court Judge Manickavasagar Ilanchelliyan told Sumanthiran in court that he did not expect him to be in Jaffna so soon after the plot to kill him was known . He replied that he was committed to appear for the young students charged for murder . Judge Ilanchelliyan instructed that maximum security be provided to Sumanthiran within court precincts and the surrounding environment . <p> " Vetri " , " Maran " and " Amuthan " While it is certainly a matter for satisfaction that five suspects have been apprehended and security has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were actually being controlled by Tiger agents abroad . As stated in these columns last week , TID officials have discovered that three persons namely " Vetri " in Australia , " Maran " in France and " Amuthan " in Malaysia have been planning , financing and coordinating the activities of the five ex-Tigers in Sri Lanka . Lankan law enforcement authorities have alerted their counterparts in all three countries . Investigations have commenced and are continuing in France and Australia but Malaysian security circles have indicated that Amuthan is no longer in that country . Incidently the phone used by Amuthan to communicate to Northern Sri Lanka had a Brazilian SIM card . <p> Amuthan , Maran and Vetri may have been the puppeteers of the five ex-Tigers arrested in Sri Lanka , but this trio too is part of a larger Tiger overseas network . Sri Lankan security officials firmly believe that this network is led by the Tiger operative known as " Nediyavan " whose real name is Perinbanayagam Sivaparan. 40-year-old " Nediyavan " is from Sangarathai , Vaddukkoddai in Valigamam West , Jaffna . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall man ' . Nediyavan had joined the LTTE in 1994 when he was 18 . He was sent to Russia for higher studies by the LTTE and studied political science but apparently Sivaparan did not complete his degree in Moscow . <p> Interestingly the financial arrangements for Nediyavan 's studies in Russia were handled by Selvarasah Pathmanathan alias " KP " who took a personal interest in the youngster . KP who was in charge of overseas administration , fund raising and procurement before 2002 , got someone in France to send money regularly to Nediyavan . Ironically , the very same Nediyavan turned against KP later . <p> Nediyavan functioned in the LTTE 's political wing and accompanied former Tiger political commissar Suppiah Paramu Thamilselvan to some of the peace talks during 2002-2003 . He was later transferred to the overseas LTTE administration section under Veeragathy Manivannan alias Castro . Nediyavan was in charge of Castro 's public relations unit and interacted with several overseas functionaries visiting the Vanni during the peace process . It was then that Nediyavan met his future wife Sivagowri Shanthamohan . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alias Ranjan Lala . Gnanendramohan was one of the pioneering members of the LTTE and a trusted confidante of Prabhakaran . Ranjan Lala was shot in Jaffna by the Army when riding a motor cycle . <p> Sivaparan and Sivagowri Many young , unmarried female Tiger supporters who visited the Vanni during the peace process found themselves unable to resist the " five flower arrows " of " Manmathan " or cupid when they interacted with young Tamil male Tiger militants . Sivaparan and Sivagowri fell in love . Prabhakaran who had been very fond of Ranjan Lala supported the union . After their marriage , Sivaparan went to Norway in 2006 . The LTTE had been sending a number of operatives abroad over the years . These cadres belonged to different departments of the LTTE and began functioning as Tiger operatives in these new countries . Most of these cadres were from the political and intelligence wings . <p> Nediyavan took up residence in Norway . The matrimonial alliance with Sivagowri had strengthened Nediyavan 's clout within the LTTE . Castro used him to communicate with overseas operatives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the war escalated . So Castro appointed an international representative on his behalf . This person was to be in overall charge of the LTTE overseas branches .

@@16879237 <h> STOP THE RUMPUS AT THE CAMPUS - EDITORIAL <p> 2017-02-13 00:01:42 <p> 0 <p> 270 <p> he South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine or SAITM -- Sri Lanka 's only private university with a licensce to award medical degrees- is again in the news . Once again , for all the wrong reasons . Student unions , the Government Medical Officers ' Association ( GMOA ) , public university lecturers and trade unions are calling on the government to close down the private medical college . The GMOA , medical students who benefit through the government 's free education programme and certain groups of non-government organisations ( NGOs ) see the private university 's medical degree programme as a threat to free education . Trade unionists have claimed SAITM is the only medical faculty in the world that started without having a teaching hospital of its own , which is not really truthful . <p> The Joint Opposition in Parliament also backs parties opposed to SAITM being granted a licence to award medical degrees . They too claim the University poses a threat to the government 's free education programme . What is questionable about the Joint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that at the time the private university was set up , it was done with the approval of the self-same Opposition governing the country at the time . The University Grants Commission granted approval and registration to SAITM on August 30 , 2011 to conduct the MBBS degree programme , again under the previous regime . In fact , when thousands of students took to the streets in October 2015 , demanding the closure of the private medical college , the then Government comprising today 's Joint Opposition unleashed anti-riot armed Police , who used tear gas and water canons to break up the demonstration . Around 12-15 students were hospitalised in the aftermath of the protest . <p> The President of the Sri Lanka Medical Council ( SLMC ) on one occasion said he would never register students from SAITM . One of his reasons being that " SAITM students do not have exposure to forensic medicine " and hence can not complete their clinical training , which is reasonable . In December 2015 , at the hearing of an application filed in the Supreme Court by the SAITM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clinical training to the students of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine ( SAITM ) , at the Avissawella Base Hospital and the Kaduwela MOH . In an effort to resolve their dilemma , an MBBS graduate of SAITM filed a petition at the Appellate Court , as the Sri Lanka Medical Council refused to register medical students who had passed out from the SAITM . On January 31 this year , the Appellate Court after hearing claims of the opposing parties , allowed the provisional registration of SAITM 's MBBS graduates , and in its judgement , directed the Sri Lanka Medical Council ( SLMC ) to grant provisional registration to medical students passing out from SAITM 's medical degree programme . <p> University students threatened to demonstrate against the judgement . Better sense however , seems to be prevailing and the deans of medical faculties of eight universities have proposed suggestions to resolve the problem . In a nutshell , what the deans have emphasised on is the need to maintain minimum standards for medical education in the country and proposed a process which needs be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face facts ; Sri Lanka is facing a serious shortage of medical doctors . A study by Professor Lalitha Mendis shows Sri Lanka has a doctor to population ratio of 55.2 per 100,000 population ( i.e. one doctor per 1,811 persons ) . The current specialist per 100,000 population is even worse , being 4.8 ( one specialist per 25,000 population ) . According to statistics published by the University Grants Commission ( UGC ) in 2006 , only 14.34% could enter the university out of those eligible for university admission . Dr. Tara de Mel ( Secretary to the Minister of Education ) in 2009 pointed out that 164 students with 3A grades , the highest grade one can secure at the GCE Advanced Level , and 1,464 students with 2As and 1B grades , did not find placement in the universities . <p> The Government universities can not produce sufficient doctors to meet the country 's needs . Students with a capacity to study medicine can not enter the medical faculty , despite acquiring requisite standards . There is therefore a need to help the country meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held to ransom to decrepit claims of threats to the free education system . We already have private schools and private universities but the system of free education in the country continues . It is time for good sense to prevail .

In the wake of the government 's programme to restructure state owned enterprises ( SOEs ) , the AON method can be a medium through which strategic stakes in government owned entities can be transacted in a transparent manner in a competitive environment . " The AON method will assist in the disposal of such assets at the optimum price , " the SEC said . The ATS is designed to match buy and sell orders placed by stockbroker firms of the CSE . Accordingly , several mechanisms can be used to transact securities including the normal order book , crossings and the AON facility .

Further , transactions using the AON method will have a lower systemic risk since clearing and settlement of transactions will take place on a de-facto delivery vs. payment basis . Another facility provided in the AON method is the facility for a consortium of buyers to bid for the parcel collectively , which will help improve liquidity .

U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan said Rajaratnam failed to show his actual innocence on five of the 14 counts on which he was convicted , or that two other counts should be vacated because the main government witness committed perjury . <p> Preska also rejected Rajaratnam 's argument that his trial counsel was ineffective , and denied Rajaratnam 's bid to reduce the US $53.8 million he agreed to forfeit to about US$ 4.3 million .

Former McKinsey &amp; Co chief and Goldman director Rajat Gupta is awaiting a federal appeals court decision on whether to reverse his conviction for providing tips about Goldman . In seeking a shorter sentence , Rajaratnam said he did not provide benefits to insiders for confidential information related to trades underlying five counts , or know that insiders provided that information for the sake of any benefit . But on December 6 , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in a separate case that gifts of confidential information could violate securities laws even if recipients did not give tangible benefits in return . Preska wrote : " Here , because all the information was transferred between trading relatives or friends , the mere transfer of information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moreover , " had knowledge that inside information was being conferred in exchange for such benefit , " she added . The judge also rejected Rajaratnam 's claim that former McKinsey partner Anil Kumar perjured himself , citing alleged contradictory testimony Kumar gave three years later at a trial of Rajaratnam 's younger brother Rengan , who was acquitted . Preska said the alleged contradictions were immaterial , and that " a faulty memory resulting in inaccuracies or mistakes " did not mean perjury occurred . The cases are U.S. v. Rajaratnam , U.S. District Court , Southern District of New York , No. 09-cr-01184 ; and Rajaratnam v U.S. in the same court , No. 15-05325.

@@17825239 <h> Importance of remittance to Sri Lanka and its future in digital world <p> 2017-04-07 11:05:25 <p> 0 <p> 253 <p> It has always been my pet subject of digital marketing , which I 've invested time and knowledge to pour in thought to a one-page article . This time around I had a different thought of gathering information to make aware about the remittance business that I 'm in . Understanding the potential and inflow of remittance to Sri Lanka , I could n't keep away from sharing my thoughts about it . Sri Lanka is an open market economy . As in many other developing nations , Sri Lanka 's official records show that remittances have grown dramatically over the past decade . Nevertheless , the role remittances plays in development as well as the growth effect of this unconditional migrant assistance are under-researched and needs more development policy-oriented attention . In the meantime , the protracted civil war has elevated the importance of this injection of foreign exchange into the national economy . <p> Why remittance ? Remittances flow directly from one person to another . Also , unlike the official aid flows , the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost incurred is that of the money transfer service . The recent competitive expansion in the remittance industry has reduced the cost of remitting money across countries . Hassle-free and faster remittances are also freely available in Sri Lanka . Sri Lanka has been the most liberalized economy in South Asia , recording greater trade dependency with an export and import share in gross domestic product ( GDP ) that is higher than 55 percent ( often referred to as the trade dependency ratio ) . The country persistently depends on worker remittances as an attractive source of financing the widening trade deficit in its balance of payments . Remittances are the second largest source of external financing . They help to offset over 70 percent of the trade deficit and to reduce the current account balance to a manageable level . After garments exports , remittances have become the single largest component of foreign exchange inflows to the economy . <p> Remittance pattern in Sri Lanka Most Sri Lankan migrants , especially almost all of the ones in the Middle East , emigrate for a fixed period of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When there is no possibility of settlement in the destination country , then migrants are more likely to save their income and either send it as remittances during their stay or bring with them when they return . As a result , while Mexican remittances from the US are likely to decline over time as the migrants settle permanently and their families join them , this is not likely to be the case in Sri Lanka . As long as there are migrants in the Middle East , remittance flows are likely to stay stable . <p> Remittance impact for Sri Lanka As of 2016 , remittance inflows account for almost 10 percent of Sri Lankan GDP . How are the remittances spent ? And it is definitely the case in Sri Lanka , thus it indicates that remittances are more likely to be spent on investments whether these are physical or human capital investments such as education . There is naturally a selection effect - people with good investment opportunities are more likely to migrate and send remittances . Furthermore , many unobservable characteristics , such as entrepreneurial ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is very important to control for these selection and endogeneity biases as much as possible when identifying the development impact of remittances , especially through the spending channels . Are remittances important in removing credit constraints ? This is one of the key issues in financial development , especially in cases where borrowers do not have access to capital markets and/or there are capital market imperfections . In this case , people with investment opportunities can not borrow and investment -- which is crucial for development and growth -- does not take place . Remittances during the time abroad can relax these constraints whether through savings or creating opportunities -- such as collateral -- for financial market access . This can be especially identified when we survey migrants who have returned and observe what they have done since then in terms occupation and labour market activities . Are there community spillovers of remittance , other than the families ? This is another key question in development . The extended families and the communities benefit from remittances , whether directly as recipients or indirectly through the activities of the migrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers and others overseas have become the single largest foreign exchange earner and are now the mainstay of successive government budgets . Migrant workers ( 300,703 ) departed for foreign employment in the year 2014 , which reduced to ( 263,307 ) in the year 2015 . This is a dip of 12.44 percent . Sixty five percent of migrant workers have been males in comparison to 34 percent of females in 2015 . Until recently , labour migration from Sri Lanka was dominated by females departing as housemaids . Subsequent to many concerted policy efforts , such as the family background report ( FBR ) requirement , pre-departure training and upgrading the existing skill training to internationally recognized levels , this female and low-skilled-oriented migrant worker flow is now transformed into a more skilled and male-centric flow . As a result , the share of females among migrant worker departures further shrank to 25 percent from 28 percent in 2016 . The other skills groups , such as professionals and semi-skilled groups also experienced growth to reach shares of 2.4 percent and 2 percent , respectively . This gender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first-ever decline in inward remittances in 14 years . The main markets of remittance inflow are Saudi Arabia , UAE , Qatar , Kuwait and Oman . These markets have hired approximately 88.3 percent of Sri Lankan workers in the year 2016 . In the year 2015 , the workers ' remittances had decreased US $ 6,980.2 million ( Rs.948,936.31 million ) , while the figures were recorded as US $ 7,018.0 million ( Rs.916,367 million ) when it was compared with the same period in the year 2014 . US $ 7.2 billion ( Rs.1.1 trillion ) is what foreign remittances bought into this country in 2016 . Workers ' remittances are also expected to slow down , given the increased availability of domestic employment opportunities and policy measures to discourage migration in the semi-skilled and unskilled categories . <p> Remittances and poverty Remittances , in fact , have great potential to generate a positive impact on development and poverty reduction in Sri Lanka . It is important to note that remittances can reduce the probability of food-based and capability-based poverty among underprivileged entities at the receiving end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . Where widening inter-regional income disparities are concerned , the migration of rural men and women could contribute to family income and , thereby , to rural economies . In many cases , this happens through the remittances of the primary breadwinners . It is evident that much of Sri Lanka 's labour exports is induced by household economic hardships . The departure of housemaids for the Middle East -- from where the highest volume of remittances flows into Sri Lanka -- is mainly determined by the economic hardships in their families . The volume of remittances may , therefore , have positive correlation with wage levels of migrant workers and the economic needs of their families back home . Significantly , a colossal portion of the total remittances received by Sri Lanka meets day-to-day consumption needs rather than long-term productive purposes . In most cases , the remittance-recipient households set aside little or no savings for their future . <p> Remittance in digital world The number of countries offering real-time intra-country fund transfer is increasing rapidly . This has made the instant cross-border small-ticket remittance on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety and lower fees , the remittance business is becoming more efficient due to mainly it having a total cost saving ( per remittance ) , corridor cost savings and most importantly these savings have an impact on poverty reduction . While understanding the fact that there is numerous digital remittance developments such as Cash-to-Wallet and Wallet-to-Wallet implemented around the world , let 's ponder for a moment to see how Sri Lanka can have its potential hands opened wide for digital remittance implementation . The mobile subscriber growth rate in Sri Lanka has been strong between 2011 and 2016 . Mobile market penetration increased from 87 percent to 123 percent in 2016 . The government effort is needed to facilitate the movement of financial transactions from cash to digital , especially with regard to reaching individuals in financially underserved areas . When governments shift their social , salary and procurement payments and taxation and licensing receipts to electronic form , it creates a foundation upon which the private sector and person-to-person payments , such as international and domestic remittances , can build . The private sector is a critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to catalyze private-sector growth . The Sri Lanka government needs to offer a clear vision and tangible incentives in order to ensure that the private sector is an effective , competitive , transparent and efficient partner . Part of this requires that a level playing field be set up , whereby governments do not create disproportionate hurdles for a broad and growing range of providers to participate in the global financial system . Empowering a diverse range of private-sector providers will increase competition , reduce costs , empower consumers , increase the scale needed for sustainability and drive financial inclusion . The above is only the first part of understanding the remittance business and its importance for us , as a country . My future articles would pout thought about remittance marketing and digital remittance . ( Kevin Almeida MCIM , MBA ( Wales ) is UAE Exchange Head Corridor Marketing for Sri Lanka )

During the previous decade , the abuse of power had been unprecedented , even when assessed against the country 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1948 . Ordinary law and order had deteriorated to abysmal depths . State , economic and military powers were concentrated in the office of the Executive President . Corruption on the part of a ruling family cabal was rampant and ugly . Shaky at its best , the scales of the State tilted dangerously towards raw , naked authoritarianism . Editors and journalists were assassinated , beaten up and threatened . A decades-long secessionist war fought by the LTTE in the Northern peninsula was brought to a bloody end in 2009 but even after , terror continued to stalk the land . <p> Yet the stage for this departure from the democratic path had been set quite a while ago . Prolonged ethnic conflict and more sporadic but equally violent clashes between the majority Sinhalese government and rebellious Sinhalese youth in the South had paved the way for emergency law to become the norm . Checks and balances once holding arbitrary executive discretion in check became weaker . Under the Kumaratunga Presidency , a Supreme Court headed by her handpicked Chief Justice in 1999 became politicised with severe adverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists waxed and waned with criminal defamation law being used to stifle dissenters until a vigorous media-led campaign resulted in its repeal . <p> So to many , the excesses of the Rajapaksa Presidency was a natural -- and logical -- culmination of what had preceded . Regardless , a restive if not angry populace was ripe for change when , following a surprise announcement of a premature Presidential election , Rajapaksa 's onetime Health Minister Maithripala Sirisena deserted his party leader and contested the elections with the support of Ranil Wickremesinghe , leader of the ( then ) opposition United National Party ( UNP ) after months of covert planning . It was an explosive electoral challenge in the best traditions of excitable party politics , catching the imagination and hope of Sri Lankan citizens who voted for the imprudent challenger . But the 2015 reformist agenda of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe coalition is now facing grave internal subversion by forces that were very much part of the earlier anti-democratic establishment . <p> Great expectations ; the Government 's reform agenda One major thrust of reform concerned the restoration of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enactment of a Right to Information law and a Contempt of Court Act , the broad-basing of state-owned media among a host of other pending media law reforms . The other equally imperative focus was on state accountability for war time abuses premised on a consensus resolution on Sri Lanka adopted at the United Nations Human Rights Council . <p> However , progress has been faltering . Indeed , in some respects , there is regression . For example , the Government promised to repeal or reform the Prevention of Terrorism Act ( PTA ) under which journalists and activists had been routinely imprisoned . But now , a draft Counter-Terror Act ( CTA ) , conceived in secret and running to more than fifty pages , has far more terrifying potential to restrict civil liberties than the PTA . <p> Where accountability is concerned , little of significance has happened apart from an Office of Missing Persons which remains yet inactivated . Similar dysfunction affects a Victim and Witness Protection Authority . In addition , hawkish elements within the Government are denying the right of immediate legal counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the killings and beatings of journalists are yet pending . <p> Emblematic cases of gross human rights abuses against Tamil civilians under the previous regime suffer a similar fate . Absent sufficient pressure from civil society , the members of which have now been co-opted in great part into ad hoc task forces , punishing perpetrators through a radically reformed criminal justice system has been replaced by a spluttering Colombo-centered transitional justice process . This has been an early victim of the huge gap between what the Government promised and what it can actually deliver . Ambitious constitutional reform plans are similarly bedevilled . Corruption investigations into the near-bankrupting of the state coffers by the Rajapaksas have also stalled . Emboldened , the former President 's supporters have become increasingly more vociferous . <p> Encouraging use of RTI across the country The one exception to this sad litany of non-performance is that on June 23 , 2016 , Parliament unanimously passed the Right to Information ( RTI ) Act . This was a result of persistent advocacy for over one and a half decades by editors , lawyers , media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the 1998 Colombo Declaration on Media Freedom and Social Responsibility , which focused on RTI as a legislative imperative . Earlier , a Prime Ministerial committee had drafted the 2004 Freedom of Information ( FOI ) Bill which was approved by the Cabinet . However the premature dissolution of Parliament resulted in the 2004 Bill being discarded . Some unsuccessful revivals were attempted in later years , one such effort being notably by the present Speaker of Parliament Karu Jayasuriya then an opposition parliamentarian . But the Bill was re-activated as a template only in 2015 with the change of regime . Following sleepless days of hectic drafting and after public consultations , the revised version now named the Right to Information ( RTI ) Bill was approved by the Cabinet . <p> The Bill passed the test of legal challenge before the Supreme Court subject to certain modifications . To the surprise of those anticipating vigorous opposition on the floor of the House , it was passed with nary an opposing vote . As a member of both drafting committees in 2004 and 2015/2016 , this was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a constitutional amendment had also enshrined the right of access to information . RTI was therefore backed by two supports ; one , constitutional and the other statutory . That said , the fact that the constitutional restrictions ( drafted differently to the statutory process ) were somewhat broader in scope did give rise to unease . Nonetheless , there was much to be pleased about . <p> Since the Act and its Regulations with the Rules of the Commission on Fees and Appeals were operationalised on February 3 , Sri Lanka has been ranked globally as having the third best RTI regime . No state agency is exempted from its reach unlike other information laws in the region . For the past two months , the use of RTI has been quite diverse and vigorous . This is a positive factor even though I can not comment on specific cases . <p> Will RTI be an exception to a discouraging pattern of practically ineffectual good laws in Sri Lanka ? Will it radically transform the culture of secrecy that holds the political and public service establishment in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But unlike other laws which depend on dysfunctional state institutions , RTI can be directly used by citizens to provoke , needle and demand accountability from government and non-government entities . Early signs of its enthusiastic use are encouraging . <p> Conclusion Ambitious reform plans of Sri Lanka 's coalition leadership have been slowly collapsing into disarray . True , citizens now live free from the threat of enforced disappearances and blatant misuse of power . Moreover , there is freedom of public debate which was once a luxury . Nonetheless , as has been repeatedly emphasised in my weekly column to the Sunday Times , Colombo , the coalition Government 's incessant refrain that ' things are not bad as they once were ' , is no answer . Setting the bar of comparison based on the previous regime is akin to no standard at all . <p> And freedom of expression is of limited use when structures of state power remain impervious . In addition , increased criticism appears to be having a bitter impact . The Government has vowed to bring in a regulatory framework for print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deteriorated badly , mostly due to journalists being bludgeoned literally and metaphorically in the past , government regulation is unquestionably not the solution to that problem . Cloaked in the deceptively misleading language of ' independent regulation ' such innocuous experiments are often twisted to political advantage . <p> Some in the Government have asserted that RTI is a quid pro quo ; in other words , as RTI has been ' given ' to the media , it should ' submit ' to the proposed regulatory scheme . This argument suffers from a fundamental misconception . RTI is not a privilege to be bestowed at the magnanimity of politicians . Rather it is a people 's right ( not limited to the media ) . Any suggestion of a quid pro quo is unfortunate . <p> In 2015 , democratic change-makers were ordinary citizens from far flung corners of the land who reacted with powerful anger against state-sponsored racism , chauvinism and corruption . But this critical constituency of reform is being eroded day by day . That is regrettable for Sri Lanka 's people , for the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working for genuine systemic change . <p> ( The writer serves as a Commissioner on Sri Lanka 's RTI Commission as the nominee of the organisations of editors and publishers .

Must her unfortunate citizenry always be driven to either an elitist and mostly incompetent clique or , ( on the other hand ) , a crowd of corrupt and communalistic villains peddling a poisonous cocktail of hatred ? <p> A ruinous pattern of law reform I may be blamed for painting this grim picture with far too extravagant brushstrokes . But let us not forget that these realities recently underpinned the near-collapse of the State as a democratic socialist republic . A fresh-faced President emerged in 2015 precisely due to these terrible convulsions . Eager to believe as always , Sri Lankans voted for change . But nonetheless , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it can only bring about ruin . <p> Let us take as just one example . This relates to the manner in which laws are drafted . With one or two exceptions due to uncompromising persistence by relevant stakeholders , the order of the day is haphazard law reform . As editorially pointed out in this newspaper last week , the Government is apparently intending to enact a brand new Inland Revenue law that is a carbon copy of the International Monetary Fund 's ( IMF ) tax legislation for Ghana . If this astounding proposal does not lead to public agitation , one wonders what will . Professional organisations have opposed this proposal . But is the Government willing to listen ? <p> And yet another revised version of the Counter-Terror Act ( CTA ) has been hurriedly ' leaked ' this week apparently due to a looming deadline of the European Union ( EU ) with which the Government is negotiating on the preferential trade facility . More egregious offences previously subjected to hard scrutiny in these columns are now removed in this latest draft . Thankfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The offence of ' terrorism ' has been pruned . <p> Revisions due to frantic arm-twisting In addition , a long list of some thirty six terrorism related offences had earlier prescribed inter alia , causing or intending to cause the commission of violent acts between different communities or racial or religious groups through the use of words intended to be spoken or read or signs . This had to be with intent to cause harm to the ' unity , territorial integrity or sovereignty of Sri Lanka or the peaceful coexistence of the people . ' Now the reference to ' unity ' is no longer there . <p> As the explanatory note to the draft itself concedes , the earlier offence of terrorism and reference to ' unity ' were vague in law and had been deleted . But did it need such frantic arm twisting for this to happen on the part of a Government which once defined itself by promising to depart from the past ? Could not simple commonsense and a desire to have a well conceptualized CTA have sufficed in the first instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , of course , a rhetorical question . <p> But even despite these revisions , concerns persist . What is offensively vague regarding the term ' unity ' also applies to ' peaceful coexistence of the people . ' What does this even mean in law ? Moreover a new offence punishes ' any person who intentionally and unlawfully distributes or otherwise makes available a message to the public with the intent to incite the commission of a terrorist offence . ' This is regardless of whether or not that conduct expressly advocates terrorist offences . On the contrary , the legal test stipulated therein is if it causes ' danger . ' <p> Also a suspect 's immediate right of access to a lawyer remains ambivalent . Extensive police powers in compelling bank statements , calling for information from service providers and senior public officials etc without applying magisterial warrant have been retained . Other intrusive measures are specified to be on magisterial warrant . Therefore the exclusion of a similar safeguard in these instances implies that the omission was deliberate . Is the risk thereto of abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the police command structure , not recognized ? <p> Where are the law reform bodies ? But going beyond specific details of the draft CTA and the draft Inland Revenue Act , the country 's law reform process invites broader critical interest . What is the role of the Law Commission of Sri Lanka in this context ? We know that a crisply drawn up counter-terror draft formulated by the Commission was cast aside for the present CTA , which emerged through a secretive process and numbers more than 65 pages of grave potential for abuse . Is the Law Commission now redundant in the larger scheme of things ? <p> And what pray , is the function of the Bar Association of Sri Lanka ? It is now known more for embroiling itself in unpleasant controversies regarding ( personal ) recommendations of legal practitioners to High Courts sans knowledge of the executive body than anything else . Predictably , those responsible have , like the proverbial ostrich , refused to admit that mistakes were made even whilst the Judicial Service Commission ( JSC ) and the office of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted lack of interest of registered lawyers in voting in the recently concluded election of the Bar indicates that course correction should be a priority . However , there is little expectation of this taking place . <p> Meanwhile the Human Rights Commission of Sri Lanka ( HRCSL ) has also been requesting that it be sent the revised CTA to no avail . It is a first principle of the electoral compact that a Government elected by the people must be responsible to the people . Is that principle not violated by the IMF , the EU and foreign embassies appearing to know more about Sri Lanka 's proposed laws than Sri Lankans themselves ? The Government needs to put these law drafts before the public and invite responses within a reasonable time period . <p> Beware of patchwork legislation A hasty tabling of this Bill in the House as a result of EU deadlines can not be countenanced by any means . That is akin to a person falling from a tree who is then gored by an angry bull . Once that process is in motion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must then be within a prescribed time period . Absent time for measured scrutiny , the public may well end up with patchwork legislation , incorporating various bits and pieces brought in from various sources . <p> Overall , there needs to be a radical re-thinking of Sri Lanka 's law reform process . Oversight committees by parliamentarians dominated by political agendas can not replace the primary duty of the Government to place its draft legislation before the people for independent scrutiny .

So , let me explain why . <p> I know peoples ' memories are short , especially in politics , but this happened just over two years ago . Remember , SB , the time when Maithri quit Mahinda maama 's team and told us that he would be contesting the big election ?

A. Sumanthiran said this week . <p> Despite sustained opposition to the project , the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management ( CCEM ) last week granted approval for the construction of 6,000 prefabricated houses in the North and East by international steel giant ArcelorMittal . The proposal will go to Cabinet for ratification . <p> But the original tender , floated by the Rehabilitation and Resettlement Ministry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed out Mr. Sumanthiran . The TNA has unanimously rejected prefabricated steel dwellings and called for the cheaper , culturally-suitable brick-and-mortar houses . <p> " With regard to the original 65,000 houses proposal , a Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee called for it to be cancelled and for fresh bids to be called , " Mr Sumanthiran said . " Resettlement Minister D. M. Swaminathan himself presented a Cabinet paper for fewer prefabricated houses and suggested fresh bids . " <p> " In any case , you can not rely on the previous tender price for 65,000 and do 6,000 houses because there could be so many others in the local construction industry with the capacity to tender their bids for the smaller number , " he pointed out . " If this story of 6,000 houses being agreed upon by the CCEM is true , we will challenge the process . <p> " And why is the Government not considering the alternate proposal put forward by civil society with the support of five local banks ?

" <p> The housing need in the North and East is dire and acute , he said . " The Government is using the desperate need of the people to force prefabricated houses down their throat , for the benefit of a few individuals who stand to benefit from this , " he said . <p> Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran endorsed Mr Sumanthiran 's criticism of the project . " Prefab steel houses are not suitable for the climate of the North and East , environment or ambience . Our engineers have given me detailed reports saying so , " he said . <p> " The continued insistence on foisting these houses on our Province smacks of the hidden needs and agendas on the part of the powers that be , " Mr. Wigneswaran said .

They ignore the social implications . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which the Government seems to want to promote , " he said . " The 6,000 prefab house owners would become the haves and the others the have-nots . There is a possibility that reaction from the have-nots might ostracise those who opt to take these houses . I would appeal to the Minister to reconsider . " <p> The project , which has been in the pipeline since 2015 , has been stalled by widespread protests . The TNA said it was " totally opposed to prefabricated steel houses " and called for traditional brick houses in keeping with the culture and way of life of the North-East people . All sixteen MPs of the party endorsed this position . <p> But the project is openly backed by Rehabilitation and Resettlement Minister Swaminathan . The TNA claimed that the minister had made personal telephone calls to several of its MPs , inviting them to make requests for prefabricated houses in their respective electorates . In the face of resistance , President Maithripala Sirisena passed off the project to Special Projects Minister Sarath Amunugama for a recommendation .

It was approved . <p> The initial proposal -- which would have forced to Government to borrow US$1 billion to implement -- was to build 65,000 prefab steel houses for war-affected families in the North and East . But the prefab steel dwellings have been objected to on multiple grounds including climatic unsuitability , flimsy construction , lack of durability , unjustifiably high cost and so on . <p> A Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee ( CANC ) rejected the project and recommended that fresh tenders be called . A group of civil society agencies and persons even put forward an alternate proposal for 102,000 masonry houses at a cost of just under Rs 1 million per house , using local labour and funded by a consortium of local banks . <p> Mr Sumanthiran said the project smacked of " grand-scale fraud , which is clearly apparent from the cost of Rs 2.1 million per house , which later dropped to Rs 1.6 million " .

From the publicly venerated and admired butterflies they were , flitting from hospital bed to hospital bed infusing life reviving honey to patient after patient , they retrograded to become once more worms cocooned in a world of their own on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were the pillars of society . A doctor in the house was an honoured guest at any party . They were known not only as law abiding citizens who respected the judgments of the courts but were also famed for their moral rectitude . But on February 1st all the goodwill , all the respect their medical forefathers had earned for them , were flung to the winds ; and they took leave of their senses . <p> They decided to declare their dissatisfaction against the Appeal Court 's decision not by resorting to the judicial process and appealing to the Supreme Court but by taking to the streets . The medical students -- the sacrificial pawns in the battle plan -- formed the advance guard of the convoy of protests to come and took to the streets , becoming the harbinger of a nation 's misery on February 2nd . <p> It was nothing short of an extra judicial exercise to coerce courts to rubber stamp their views . The ultimate affront and threat to law and order and to the majesty of the courts . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . To the GMOA it would have been a test run . To test the water with expendable students before the elders waded in . <p> Fortified by the lack of contempt charges for having staged a street protest not even a mile away from the Hulftsdorp court complex , the GMOA took to the streets the following day , February 3rd , ostensibly protesting against the police reaction to the students demo when they attempted to storm the barricades erected by the police to prevent them entering the road to the Presidential Secretariat . <p> To keep the boom of battle echoing the students of all medical colleges in Lanka started boycotting lectures and have done so up to now . Like Prabhakaran had no qualms in using child soldiers to win his battle for Eelam , the GMOA high command had no compunction in encouraging medical students to boycott their classes in their goal to destroy SAITM and re-establish the publicly funded government 's medical college as the only Eelam future doctors could graduate from . Of course the fact that the Medical Council already accepts registration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off . Foreign is foreign after all , the main fight is against one 's own , is n't that so in Lanka ? <p> Then after two further weeks of railing the Government , railing the Health Minister , railing all and sundry who held a different view , while all the time hailing themselves as the guardians of the nation 's health , the GMOA top brass could n't wake or sleep , breakfast , lunch or dine , think or talk without SAITM on its mind and SAITM on its lips . SAITM was the enemy and there would be no rest until it was flayed and its flesh fed to caged vultures at Maligawatte , where Lanka 's Parsi community once used to dispose their dead . <p> This obsession led them to inflict pain and misery , dose by dose throughout the nation . On February 20th the GMOA started its mobile misery clinic of strike action , province by province . Dr. Death was to cast its shadow upon each and every province , stage by stage and deny medical treatment to the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manacled by the Court of Appeal 's order , to overturn the Court of Appeal judgment by hook or by crook and burn down SAITM and have its ashes scattered at sea . The fact that this was to demand of the Government to resort to extra judicial measures did not dawn on the GMOA . And it was not surprising . So personally embroiled were the GMOA brass in the SAITM issue that they had lost their reason ; and the power of objective judgment had long fled from the spheres of their twisted minds . <p> But the GMOA nevertheless pursued its itinerary of pain and anguish to Lanka 's disease hit poor . The UVA province got the first dose on February 20th . On the 21st it was the turn of the South . On the 23rd it was the East and the North Central . On the 27th it was the North West and the Central Province . The caravan moved to Sabaragamuwa on March 1st followed by the GMOA 's Mara Devil arriving in Jaffna on the 2nd . And on March 3rd the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . All nine provinces covered . <p> Many tears shed and much blood drawn . But where the spoils of victory ? None . Except a whole carriage load of public opprobrium and revulsion . But , as another symptom of their descent to madness , the GMOA announced that their misery campaign ' had the support of the patients . ' As the SUNDAY PUNCH commented on March 19th , " Only those with a death wish and those yearning for euthanasia , waiting hopefully for a quick exit medical neglect would bring , would have echoed those sentiments . " <p> And then the SAITM obsessed GMOA took a breather . But it only took it to pump itself with more anti SAITM air and spent the hours planning out the gala 24 hour nationwide doctors ' strike . The GMOA 's sadistic capacity to inflict pain on others seems endless and betters Count de Sade 's ; and their fixation with SAITM so deeply rooted in their psychic that it must give rise to alarm . First they have declared this whole week as ' Anti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare the nation that Black Friday the 7th , the day they would hold their 24 hour nationwide strike , may bring tragedy . Not tragedies caused by natural disasters , not tragedies caused by accidents , but manmade tragedies , willfully designed and executed by the nation 's doctors that may possibly result in the death of some of its innocent civilians who unfortunately happen to be ill or fall ill during this period . <p> Is n't it the doctors themselves who advise all who come to them even with simple influenza not to dilly dally but get immediate tests done and get on medication or else the condition may worsen and even lead to death ? If that is valid advice they must also admit that denial of medical treatment even for a day can worsen the condition , even beyond hope . <p> Thus is there any difference between GMOA doctors denying the nation 24 hours of medical treatment to the ill merely to make a point of protest against their pet SAITM gripe and ISIS terrorists exploding a car bomb on a busy street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both may have done it as symbolic gestures of protest in order to give publicity to their respective causes and both may not have wished civilian deaths to happen as a result . But the unfortunate who happen to fall ill and is turned away from the doctor 's door and the innocent passerby near the bomb loaded car at the time of explosion will turn out to be the victims . Both the GMOA and ISIS can say it was not their intention . But does the possibility of human tragedy , whatever the motive absolve either of guilt ? In the ISIS case , the dead bodies of civilians blown up by the exploding bomb provide direct evidence . In the GMOA strike , the number of patients who die at home or at hospital due to lack of immediate treatment will never be known ; and a victim 's death will probably be recorded as due to heart attack or some such illness or natural causes and never as ' due to medical negligence occasioned by the doctor 's strike ' by the GMOA doctor who certifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Even before the sun went down on the 24 hour strike that was to end at 8am on Saturday morning , the government caved in and announced that it would take over the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital . But , despite the surrender , the GMOA stuck to their guns . Last morning , GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said that they would only be able to make a statement on the decisions once they receive them officially by the ministry . He added however that what they were demanding was a solution to SAITM and not to Neville 's Teaching Hospital . The obsession with SAITM continues . Nothing short of its neck will do . <p> The future fate of SAITM may have been resolved or at least may soon be resolved . But one underlying worry for the entire nation must persist . What made the GMOA top brass so gripped with SAITM that it made them totally absorbed with it and no other ? What held them spellbound to SAITM , what made their hatred toward it so maliciously intense that no other thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscious and demand a moment 's attention ? What made them carry on such a concerted campaign of encapsulated hate for over two months , what made it marshal its troops to follow suit without question , what made it ignore the public repugnance and curses that attended every step of their march against their perceived enemy SAITM ? What made their thoughts , their dreams , their speech , their actions SAITM , SAITM , SAITM 24/7 and nothing else ? <p> What made them hold fear of persecution which they constantly expressed when they argued that the right of SAITM to produce doctors would be a threat to the closely guarded medical citadel ? What created unwarranted envy at the thought of private medical degrees paid for by parents being recognised on equal terms as public funded degrees ? What made them display an exaggerated sense of self importance in themselves when they arrogated the right to decide the eligibility of medical graduates to be registered as doctors by the Sri Lanka Medical Council when it is not their province to so decide but the exclusive right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irrational thoughts and beliefs and be so fixated in their opinion that even when the contrary was shown to them , they could naught but stand cemented to their own bigoted view and shunned all else as blasphemy ? All the above symptoms lead only to one diagnosis . Medical science calls it Paranoia . <p> It is not a phobia . Paranoia is a Greek word and though it may sound Greek to us , the simple English meaning is ' madness ' . And according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , published by the American Psychiatric Association , it comes in three forms : <p> PARANOID PERSONALITY DISORDER : Paranoid individuals are eager observers . They think they are in danger and look for signs and threats of that danger , potentially not appreciating other evidence . According to the World Health Organization , it is characterized by excessive sensitivity to setbacks and rebuffs ; a tendency to bear grudges persistently , i.e. refusal to forgive insults and injuries or slights ; a combative and tenacious sense of personal rights out of keeping with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , manifest in a persistent self-referential attitude among others . <p> PARANOID SCHIZOPHRENIA : According to the Mayo Clinic , this is having a delusion in an unshakeable belief that is held strong even when the evidence shows otherwise and it includes , for example , " believing that the government is monitoring every move you make , or that a co-worker is poisoning your lunch . " Schizophrenia is in itself a involuntary tendency to seamlessly change into a different character , in the way the GMOA sometimes think they are a body of doctors walking the wards and checking the well being of their patients and at other times assume the role of a political party with its members marching the streets , holding placards , shouting slogans and holding rallies . <p> PERSECUTORY DELUSIONS : This is a set of delusional conditions in which the affected persons believes they are being persecuted . In ' The Psychology of Persecutory Delusions ' , this is described as when a person thinks that harm is occurring , or is going to occur that the individual thinks that the perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above , is it not apparent -- even to laymen -- and considering the fear of persecution , the degree of envy the exaggerated self importance that have surrounded the GMOA in their singular fixation over SAITM and the degree to which they have gone to and level to which they have stooped -- even making the Vets join the strike and deny sick dogs their treatment- that perhaps some of them may be suffering from an advanced state of paranoia ? Frightening , is n't it to think when we next go to visit a doctor -- god forbid -- that we may be receiving the panacea pills from such a nut case off his rocker ? <p> If prima facie proof is necessary that something has snapped and their thinking has gone wonky , just consider the statement made by the GMOA that their campaign of strike action which denied medical treatment to all Lankans and put at risk their lives , were done to " protect the patient 's right to life . " <p> CEB power strike fails to sizzle drought heat to higher degreesBut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Lanka is reeling under a record breaking drought and the people are suffering from intolerable degrees in the temperature . Enough that on the 5th of this month the sun stood directly over Lanka aggravating the steamy heat felt by all on the ground.But if that was the time most apt time to unleash upon the masses a most excruciating heat wave , the JVP backed unions at the Ceylon Electricity Board , could have picked no better day than to go on a 24 hour nationwide strike from Wednesday the 5th midnight to Thursday midnight to coerce the government to agree to their salary demands . <p> Thanks to a few unions in the 24,000 work force at the CEB , notably the powerful engineers union , the strike fizzled out and failed to reach the torrid degrees the JVP had planned to achieve . The unions ' threat not to attend to any breakdown had no effect since only a few minor breakdowns were reported and immediately attended to by CEB 's non striking members . To them the public owe their thanks . <p> But , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who struck work , were not motivated solely by a perverse intention to subject the people to a sweaty experience and eclipse their light for twenty four hours . They did not put lives at risk but only highlighting their plight . <p> Neither were they protesting over a court judgment that had gone against their interest . Nor were they marching on the streets demanding their grievances be met . And though in many government eyes , their strike may have flopped , it brought the injustice done unto them for so long to light ; and served as a wakeup call to the authorities to finally address their issues and grant whatever redress possible rather than shabbily twiddle their thumbs , procrastinating its attention and pulling the fuse from their justified demands . <p> And what is their grievance that made them resort to the take this extreme measure ? The main objective of the strike was to rectify the current salary anomaly within the CEB . Before 2012 , the standard salary difference between the management level and lower level employees was kept at 4:1 and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based on this rate . No problem with that . All happy . But in 2012 , during the Rajapaksa regime , this ration was changed to 5:1 . <p> As the Ceylon Electricity Employees Union Secretary Ranjan Jayalal told newspapers on Tuesday , " The then Government agreed to rectify this by increasing salaries of all employees by 30 percent in 2014 . CEB top management officials ' salaries were increased during the last Presidential Election so the politicians could distribute light posts and other CEB properties during the election . When we raised the issue , they agreed to increase the salaries of all employees . " <p> ' Today , " Jayalal said , " management level employees enjoy a salary hike between 70-120 percent while other employee 's salary had only been increased by 30 percent following two discreet gazettes issued on last presidential Election Day . " <p> According to the CEB employees union 's secretary , ' the CEB management had asked for one year to rectify the salary anomalies when they threatened trade union action in 2015 , but they had failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action in October last year , but it was also postponed as management promised us to resolve the problem within four months . " <p> Since then they have held talks with Ministers Champika Ranawaka and Ranjith Siyambalapitiya but , according to Jayalal , it had been to no avail . As a result of the ministers ' failure to address their grievances , the CEB unions had been forced to resort to the strike weapon to shake and wake the government to action . <p> Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has now said he would resolve the problem by August . He has said he had appointed a committee to investigate the salary anomalies issue of CEB workers . He has said " I will go with the recommendations of the committee to rectify the salary anomalies , " <p> It is hoped that Siyambalapitiya will keep his pledge . For if Wednesday midnight 's wakeup call is ignored and the ministers continue their sleep , it will be the turn of the public to feel the mercury rising in anger .

@@17997231 <p> Differences between Theravada and Mahayana BuddhismPosted on April 17th , 2017 <h> Roy Abey-Gunawardene <p> Theravada Buddhism and Mahayana Buddhism share the same core beliefs and devotion to the life and teaching of Buddha but they do have some differences . Mahayana Buddhists believe that enlightenment can be attained in a single lifetime , and that one can guide and teach the doctrine to others while still on the course for enlightenment . Theravada Buddhists believe that one may take several lifetimes to achieve enlightenment and has to achieve enlightenment first before guiding and teaching others . In a 2010 study , the Mahayana tradition was the largest Buddhist tradition with 53.2% practitioners , compared to 35.8% for Theravada and 5.7% for Vajrayana . <p> Theravada Buddhism is associated with South East Asia and is perhaps closer to the original Indian form of Buddhism . As Mahayana Buddhism spread north through Tibet and China , it took on more local customs . <p> In Mahayana Buddhism , the role of the Bodhisattva path is given more prominence . <p> Teachings <p> Theravada promotes the concept of vibhajjavada " teaching of analysis " . This suggests the seeker should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and critical reasoning , though this should be weighed against scripture and wise monks .

Thereby , primary dealers , like BoC , could bid in the auction directly or on behalf of their clients . <p> The BOC had not bid directly at the auction for thirty years fearing possible economic fluctuations that might take place if it did , but did so on behalf of three companies , Kalutara Bodhi Trust , Ceylinco Insurance and Perpetual Treasuries Ltd. , the latter being significant in this process since it was also a primary dealer that could directly place bids at the thirty year auction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was chosen by the PTL as it had provided the best economic benefit to the company . <p> Giving evidence to the Bond Commission , former Chief Dealer of the Bank of Ceylon Treasury Division , J.K.

Municipalities continue dumping nearly 800 tonnes of garbage in Colombo itself . Piles are only mounted daily , some thousand residents are paying the price . Politicians , past and present , point finger each other . Piles of garbage stand unattended around street corners and shopping zones , choking the areas with the odor of perishing food waste and persistent plastic . Residents erupt in protest . The question is where do we dump the city 's waste ? Let us see what is happening some 3000 miles away ? <p> Municipal solid waste management is one of the most serious challenges faced by any nation obviously on account of high population growth rate , urbanization , industrial growth and economic expansion . This is not therefore an exception to Sri Lanka . Qatar is among the countries having the highest per capita waste generation rates which is as high as 1.8 kg per day . Qatar produces more than 2.5 million tons of municipal solid waste each year . Various researches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials ( around 60 percent ) while the rest of the waste steam is made up of recyclables like glass , paper , metals and plastics . <p> Similar to Sri Lanka , municipalities are responsible for solid waste collection in Qatar both directly , using their own logistics , and indirectly through private sector contracts . Waste collection and transport is carried out by a large fleet of trucks that collect garbage from thousands of collection points scattered across the country . As usual , the predominant method of solid waste disposal is landfilling . The collected is discharged at various transfer stations from where it is sent to the landfill . There are three landfills in Qatar ; Umm Al-Afai for bulky and domestic waste , Rawda Rashed for construction and demolition waste , and Al-Krana for sewage wastes . However , this has been found to be impractical wherever the land availability is limited . <p> According to Qatar National Development Strategy 2011-2016 , the country will adopt a multi-faceted strategy to contain the levels of waste generated by households , commercial sites and industry -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been achieved . Qatar adopt integrated waste hierarchy of prevention , reduction , reuse , recycling , energy recovery , and as a last option , landfill disposal . <p> A comprehensive solid waste management plan is being implemented to coordinate responsibilities , activities and planning for managing wastes from households , industry and commercial establishments , and more importantly , the construction industry . The target is to recycle 38 percent of solid waste , up from the current 8 percent , and reduce domestic per capita waste generation . Five waste transfer stations have been setup in South Doha , West Doha , Industrial Area , Dukhan and Al-Khor to reduce the quantity of waste going to Umm Al-Afai landfill . These transfer stations are equipped with material recovery facility for separating recyclables such as glass , paper , aluminium and plastic . <p> In this respect , one of the most promising developments has been the creation of Domestic Solid Waste Management Centre ( DSWMC ) at Mesaieed . This centre is designed to maximize recovery of resources and energy from waste by installing state-of-the-art technologies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waste-to-energy and composting technologies . It will treat 1550 tons of waste per day , and is expected to generate enough power for in-house requirements , and supply a surplus of 34.4 MW to the national grid . We need only one third of the foregoing . <p> Meanwhile , Qatar enforce strict waste management legislation and create mass awareness about 4Rs of waste management viz. Reduce , Reuse , Recycle and Recovery . Legislations are necessary to ensure compliance , failure of which will attract a penalty with spot checks by the Government body entrusted with its implementation . Qatar is a country that Sharia law principles are adhered to . Citizens play by efficacy a vital role in improving waste management initiatives in Qatar by helping to reduce garbage generation . <p> One of the laudable ongoing garbage projects is the waste transfer station project located at Al Khor , the suburban of Doha .

@@19456232 <h> This elusive thing called Democracy ! <p> 2017-07-13 01:19:36 <p> 0 <p> 228 <p> The former President of the United States of America Barack Obama in his last official foreign visit to Greece delivered his speech at the Stavros Niarchos Foundation Cultural Centre in Athens . Obviously perturbed by the shock result of the then recently concluded Presidential election , it was no surprise that he dedicated a fair proportion of his speech to highlight the need to cling on to democracy and a mode of governance fashioned by its attributes . Doubtless he was inspired by the fact that he was physically in the place where democracy ( ' demokratia ' , as he pronounced in Greek to the applause of the audience ) , was born as a concept 25 centuries ago . Not only did he mention the fact that USA was more inclined to treat as their allies , those countries that had democratic modes of governing but was unequivocal in his notion that the power the USA yields in terms of its economic and military power was derived from their democratic roots of governance . <p> Obviously there would be cynics , detractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the so called democracy or the rules of democratic governance of the USA as a state in terms of its role as the international policeman . In addition , looms in the background the election of Donald Trump who seems to consider democratic norms and tolerance of dissension as afterthoughts . Yet one thing stands out as clear as ever ; the belief and persistence with democracy , not nominally but in reality , is still precious to the citizens of the USA as reflected by their popular former President . <p> We too have been a democracy since 1931 , when the Donoughmore Commission introduced universal franchise and the nation , ever since , has been going to polls every five or six years or sometimes more regularly than that . In that sense , we can boast of being a democracy , some times more vociferously than even advanced nations . Yet it seems that our acquaintance with democracy has been a superficial one and not profound or organic . In other words , in a quantitative basis we might call ourselves a democratic nation ; yet qualitatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a distinction between two types of countries that call themselves democratic . One were the type that went for elections every few years yet whose structures of governance are far from democratic at the core . The other type were the ones where the mode of governance was organically democratic and based on structures that support democracy from the roots . <p> SL had witnessed two massive , bloody revolts in the south and a separatist struggle in the north that spanned one third of a century <p> LTTE was crushed and war was won , but it did heavy damage to inter ethnic relationship <p> Civil Service was a pride to SL , but is in tatters with endemic corruption and subservience to Politicians <p> We live in an era where the nation state is being threatened by racial , religious and ethnic tendencies <p> I believe that the first type that he referred to is a fair assessment of the status quo of our democracy in many respects . We have a parliament that is supposedly filled with representatives of the people and also a President who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition we have Provincial Councils that could be called sub tier legislative bodies followed by local governments in the form of pradeshiya sabha , urban councils and municipal councils . Since the introduction of the universal franchise , no regime change has taken place other than through the ballot . Thus the notion that on a quantitative basis , we are democratic . <p> Yet can one be satisfied that we are a democratic society , in the true sense of the word ? We have witnessed two massive and bloody revolts in the south and a separatist struggle in the north that spanned one third of a century . The respective governments have been able to suppress these insurrections leading to nationwide bloodshed , disappearances , assassinations , abductions , media restrictions etc . We have crushed the rebellions but in doing so we have damaged , in my view fatally , the social fabric that was supposed to be democratic and civilized . <p> We tolerated a pogrom in the form of the black July in 1983 and it is no exaggeration to say that the civil society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered it necessary to look back or revisit those dark spots in our social psyche with a self critical out look , so that we would not allow such an occurrence again . The separatist war was crushed and we all celebrated ridding ourselves of the murderous and fascist group LTTE . Yet the heavy damage it did to the inter racial relationship as well as to the social psyche in terms of tolerance and right for dissension , it is yet to be recognized by the major society.The engagement with and the pursuant suppression of the terror outfit has been uniformly , but erroneously , identified along with the legitimate aspirations of the Tamils and other minorities and condemned in a heap without drawing a distinction between the two . <p> True , the excessive power concentration in the executive presidency and the consequent subjugation of other arms of the state by it are fatal to democratic governance , by itself . Yet the cancer that has stricken us is not confined to the obvious . I think we are witnessing phenomena wherein each and every citizen thinks that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the only things that matter . If at all , they will tolerate an extension of such rights to those who are like them socially , racially and economically and not beyond . Democratic principles which should underpin day to day activities are brushed aside . For the simplest of example , selecting a prefect board of a school is done not in a manner that allows the most suitable students being selected but in accordance with their affiliation to the immediate power structure that is in the form of Principals , teachers or powerful members of the school development board . <p> Going beyond that , selection of personnel for govt 's official portfolios are done in a manner that negates all civilized and accepted norms of selection . The Civil Service , which was once a pride to the country is in tatters with endemic corruption and subservience to Politicians.Transparency , accountability and suitability are simply forgotten words in face of nepotism , bribes , political favouritism etc . Even the public representatives elected by vote are bent on such interests rather than being mindful of the capabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve the populace . <p> Fundamental rights of citizens are of little concern until and unless judicial intervention is sought by an aggrieved party . The local government bodies , police , corporations and statutory authorities act more reflective of a slave-master or serf-feudal Lord-power relationship rather than a democratic one.Those who are capable of oiling the palms of authorities manage to circumvent the difficulties they face from such bodies while the hapless and the helpless are left to suffer without vindication of their rights . <p> All this , in my view , emanates from the utter decrepit and dysfunctional status of the civil society structure which , if at all , exists only nominally . The civil society and it 's organizations have been paralysed by the overriding political authority that permeates each and every aspect of social life . The executive presidency bludgeons all aspects of democratic socio-political life to listless submission . Democratically elected representatives are not being held accountable by the people who select them . The service that a citizen expects from a representative whom he voted for is some personal favouritism such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in a more extreme case getting some type of permit etc . <p> There is no concerted effort on the part of society to hold their representative responsible ; rather it also expresses itself along the line of party politics irrespective of whether such a representative merits to be supported . Once in a while you hear a voice in the wilderness like that of John the Baptist in the New Testament , calling for public representatives to declare assets and justify their election expenses etc. which arouses some interest for a while and falls silent . <p> The whole society seems to be engaged in a rat race aimed at grabbing the biggest piece of cake in the form of economic prosperity . There is nothing wrong with economic advancement and upward social mobility . In fact the whole objective of democracy is to allow individuals to attain to the highest possible goal without being weighed down by caste , creed , race , political affiliation etc . Yet the manner in which our society seems to be engaged in it seems to be in negation of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a hysterical struggle for personal gain alone , concerns about democracy , ethics , good governance , fundamental rights , universally accepted forms of charity etc. seem to be inconveniences . <p> Yet the ideals expressed by Barrack Obama with regard to democracy being the greatest propeller for their wealth and might , resounds so true , specially in our context . A deterioration of democracy , whether it is the neo-liberal type or the social democratic alternative , will ultimately give rise to unequal distribution of wealth , unrest , disillusionment and rebellion . The old classical type Marxist revolution may not be en vogue when it comes to social change , yet as the Arab Spring illustrated , its substitute is a spontaneous and an anarchist type of rebellion with no clear nucleus of control and therefore , so destructive and fragmentary in terms of the interests of national state . <p> We live in an era when the nation state is being threatened by racial , religious and ethnic tendencies that has the propensity to drive segments of the populace away from the centre along such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mindful of such tendencies and are not complacent with the mode of governance we have as being immune to such dangers . The need to protect , advance and promote democratic values in all spheres of life is felt ever more acutely at present . It is in this regard that the civil society with its non- political structures should take the banner of democracy instead of entrusting it entirely to politicians . <p> It is such structures , not political parties that hold the fabric of democratic life together in advanced democracies . The political colouring that the fabric assumes might change depending on the political leaders and parties that gain the support of the masses given the exigencies of times . The political inclination could be right wing , neo-liberal , social democratic or left-wing based on the policies of the govt . But yet the very essence of a democratic society is not touched as the civil society with its watch dogs are always vigilant to fire the first salvo , the moment a regime gives a signal that it intends to engage in an anti-democratic course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be doomed for failure in such a vibrant democracy . It is such a scenario that we should aspire for , no matter how utopian it might sound given the present stagnated and superficial democracy we enjoy . There is no alternative for us ; if our democracy is flawed , the alternative is more democracy ! !

A week after the presidential tirade , a Cabinet paper was presented to the meeting on Tuesday seeking the extension of the Anti-Corruption Secretariat to function further under the purview of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe . <p> President Sirisena is reported to have refused to grant his nod to this move .

Finally , it was decided to declare a Dengue eradication week . The President suggested that all the politicians should be actively involved in the clean-up operations to destroy mosquito breeding grounds . The Cabinet decided to focus more on abandoned or unoccupied premises as they could have unattended mosquito breeding places . <p> For this purpose , the health authorities initially conducted fogging operations .

Or else , they contemplate on leaving the government to join hands with the opposition in the event of declaration of any election - be it the local authorities or the provincial council polls . <p> As the third option , they believe there would be a point for them to part ways with the govt when it presents the draft of the proposed Constitutions .

Sri Lanka will be commemorating its 70th Independence Day by February 4 , 2018 and it will be imperative to look back at the post-independence era and recall the lessons learnt during the seven decades . <p> What happened to the country ? It is no exaggeration that the country 's economic and political climate and the social well-being of its people are deteriorating gradually and the public has lost its faith in the executive , legislative and judicial branches of the government . The vast majority apparently suffers great hardship and the current political leaders do not seem to have fully comprehended the current social , economic and political condition and as to where Sri Lanka as a country is heading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country experiences today ? Following independence , the country was governed by different political parties and their members , majority of whom had conflicting personal interests over national interest . The power was centred among such a group of individuals , who used it for their own personal benefits and interference in policy changes in their interest . <p> Use of power for conflicting interests at the top in the governing structure led towards the collapse in law and order , social , economic and political well-being . Politics became a business rather than a process of decision-making for the advancement of the country as a whole . <p> Active participation in politics and policy setting were seen and perceived as the easiest and fastest route of making money . Slowly it became a haven for uneducated thugs and corrupt people in the country just to use their undue power for their own benefits and to run their illicit businesses under the blessings of the rules and regulations of the country . <p> On the one hand , the political parties were never worried about the quality of their candidates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand the social and economic realities and drive the country towards economic prosperity were never evaluated by the selecting committees of political parties . Instead , the party leaders were more interested in and gave more weight on one quality in selecting their political candidates -- was the candidate good enough in attracting people and their votes ? <p> On the other hand , the vast majority in the country never realized what their expectations of politicians were . The public 's perception and the role model of politicians were completely different and certainly the public used unimportant yardsticks to assess the quality of politicians . The resultant truth was that the country was led by a set of people for almost seven decades , who did not have a clear vision and a detailed roadmap to drive the country towards economic , social and political prosperity . <p> It is , however , no use of lamenting about the past and stirring up the muddy pit over and over again as it only stinks like a sewer . Nevertheless , what is more important is to learn from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put the country back on the right track . <p> Status quo A quick analysis of key economic indicators will paint us the right picture of the economic condition in the country . The Sri Lankan economy achieved around 4 percent to 5 percent growth in 2016 and the economic outlook for 2017 will witness more or less the same growth rate . <p> In 2017 , the government gross debt will lie between 75 percent and 80 percent of the country 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) and the inflation will hit more than 5 percent with the increase in demand and the adverse impact over supply . The unemployment rate is estimated to be at 4 percent and the trade deficit will still surpass US $ 800 million . The budget deficit for 2017 will reach 5 percent of GDP or will be more than Rs.700 billion . <p> The country 's economy is not yet in the intensive care unit ( ICU ) , but the economic indicators are alarming more adversity with the government debt trap and ever increasing deficit of balance of payments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the politicians , policymakers , intellectuals , business sector and public participate collectively in setting the political , economic and social direction of this country . If the politicians and policymakers do not proactively involve in this process , the public have to take the biggest responsibility and play their vital role in selecting their political leaders . <p> The country is already an economically , politically and socially feeble patient , as a result , the prevailing situation warrants some immediate solutions in the short run . However , it should also be borne in mind that the harvest of the short-term strategies can never be reaped without long-term plans to take the short-term achievements to the next level required for fulfilling the long-term economic aspirations . <p> Short-term goals The list of short-term initiatives and goals will be long , yet it is important to focus on the priorities . <p> Lowering budget deficit No growth can be achieved without implementing cost-saving measures . Excessive government expenditure , largely on unproductive domains , has had adverse impacts on the fiscal deficit , government borrowing and trade balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parties in the country , making it more difficult to implement the much-needed economic reforms in the short run . <p> The excessive number of cabinet ministers , deputy ministers , secretaries and associated running costs has resulted in the ever increasing government expenses . The current portfolio of ministries and allocation of scope have merely been made to ensure the survival of the coalition in the short run , not to achieve the immediate savings required for minimizing the biggest burden on the annual budget . As the government expenditure is increasing due to the current political climate in the county , along with the government debt trap , the policymakers are left with only one option , which is to increase the government revenue through simply introduction of a number of direct and indirect taxes . Such sudden tax reforms are detrimental and deviate largely from the essential characteristics of a good tax system : fairness , adequacy , simplicity , transparency and administrative ease . As the amount of indirect taxes in place goes up , it will inevitably put the prices of commodities up leading to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sri Lanka needs to come up with a more stable tax framework and structure , which will form the basis for any tax reform under any government . A clear indirect and direct tax system coupled with robust administrative process will help the government achieve its revenue targets and fiscal stability . No system or law will be successful , if it is not implemented in the right way . <p> Recruiting talented new blood into the tax administrative process , use of new technology throughout the process and introduction of incentive-based salary structure for staff to achieve their performance goals , will positively address the loopholes in the current system . It is also important that these government bodies act and operate independently without political influence under the right leadership to achieve their organisational goals and objectives . <p> Managing state-owned enterprises The government owns a number of key entities in the country and these entities fall into different categories : fully commercial , semi-commercial and not-for-profit entities . As witnessed by the history , the simple solution to reduce the fiscal burden arising from state-owned entities was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Any state-owned commercial entity can be profitable if it operates independent of political interference . While the recruitment process of government entities must be independent to select the right candidates with the right set of skills to perform their duties , the entities must have the autonomy to operate as a competitive commercial entity with the other rivals in the market . <p> It is also important to restructure semi-commercial and non-commercial state-owned entities . The essential reforms will be to minimize bureaucracy in the entities and use of technology to expedite the processes . Empowering senior and junior staffs , creating an accountable culture , removing overlapping responsibilities , introduction of simple processes , curbing non-value operations and introduction of automated processes will boost the day-to-day operation and create a set of motivated government staff for excellent customer service . <p> As per the Census and Statistics Department , the total public servants in the public sector was around 875,000 and the total employees in the semi-government sector approximated to 250,300 at end-2016 . While one would be able to draw conclusions on the amount of salaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is also imperative to assess the financial impact of the government pension scheme . <p> The retirement benefit schemes are an essential part of the social security system of a country . Nonetheless , it must be restructured in a manner that the scheme becomes a retirement contribution plan , wherein both the employer and employee contribute to the plan on a monthly basis . <p> Most of the aforementioned reforms are required at institutional level but on a large scale , certain public entities can be combined together to bring efficiencies into operational processes and curb the unnecessary cost of maintenance of a non-commercial entity . This requires a careful analysis of scope of work of each government entity and simplification of processes to enhance productivity . <p> Achieving price stability Volatility in production and supply along with increased demand for essential commodities have put greater pressure on prices leading to steady inflation throughout the year ; further , increased indirect taxes on essential commodities as short-sighted fiscal policy has diminished the purchasing power of the people and led to create chaos among the low and fixed-income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cultivation lands , restrictions on clearance of cultivated lands for residential purpose , adoption of new technology replacing manual processes in cultivation , introduction and provision of fertile seeds , providing training to farmers on increasing crop production , educating people on food preservation , safe packaging and efficient : transportation of crops and introduction of financial mechanism in coordination with financial institutions to guarantee uniform flow of income to farmers throughout the year are some of the actionable points in order to cope with a number of key issues related to the volatility in the commodity prices . This will also be instrumental in addressing the scarcity issue of essential food items in the country . <p> Imports and exports One reason for the higher amount of imports was purchase of military weapons and equipment during the war time in Sri Lanka . The country is still spending large amounts of money on petroleum oil and related products , machinery , vehicles and transport equipment , textile fabrics , cements and construction materials . <p> While curbing imports will be difficult in the short run , it will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The United States remains as the country 's biggest export destination followed by the United Kingdom . Restoration of GSP Plus under the new government will be a big push towards achieving an export-led economy in the long run but it will be vital to address the key issues faced by the exporters . <p> Disseminating knowledge on the export process among the public and addressing the grass roots issues of exporters will be the key priorities in order to encourage exports . Further , training and technical advice must be provided for the diversification of products , packaging , marketing , value addition , being competitive , bringing efficiencies , cost management , adoption of technology and use of information technology . <p> Pushing the exporting industry forward will enormously help the country reduce the current trade deficit of around US $ 800 million , which will in turn have a positive impact over the exchange rate and inflation in the country . <p> Restoration of law and order Achieving economic goals can never be materialized if the vast majority of population in a country does not respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enforce the existing rules and regulations . Such a situation will diminish the public 's faith in government , governing bodies and overall system in the country and will demotivate the public to participate in the overall economic transformation process . <p> The existence of law and order is the strongest foundation for building pillars for economic success . It will enhance public faith in government , encourage the public to participate in policymaking , empower them to make decisions and inspire them to fight for injustice . <p> Long-term and way forward As mentioned , short-term initiatives must be underpinned by long-term strategies to harness the benefits of the short-term achievements in an economy . The key measures in the short run will help the government reduce its debt burden and invest money on productive domains such as education and human capital , infrastructure , health , research and development and technology . <p> Even though it is not intended to discuss long-term plans and strategies in details in this article , it is worth mentioning some areas where the government needs to pay its urgent attention . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned , the government must focus on reinstating political stability , restoring law and order , investing in quality education , adopting good governance and best practices , investing in health and nutrition , preserving forests and biodiversity , investing in technology and clean energy , expanding infrastructure and promoting small and medium enterprises . <p> The country has witnessed enough political swings during the post-independence history of the country , which has led to continuous changes in policies and procedures . Changes in the policies and making systematic changes to achieve the required goals must go beyond popular party manifestos . Most importantly , a shift in political power at each general election should not result in change in the master plan in place for achieving sustainable development goals in the long run . <p> ( A.A.

@@19893233 <h> Essay : Revolution and Counterrevolution , 1917 -- 2017 <h> Today , a hundred years after the Russian Revolution and a century-and-a-half after Capital , conditions have changed . It would appear that the clock has been turned back , and the forces of global counterrevolution have triumphed . Most of the emancipatory movements that seemed to be gaining ground in the 1960s , primarily in the periphery , have been roundly defeated . <p> by John Bellamy FosterCourtesy : Monthly Review <p> ( August 8 , 2017 , Boston , Sri Lanka Guardian ) The Russian Revolution of 1917 erupted on the fiftieth anniversary of the publication of Karl Marx 's Capital . From the start , the October Revolution seemed both to confirm and contradict Marx 's analysis . He had envisioned a working-class-based socialist revolution breaking out in the developed capitalist countries of Western Europe . But the 1882 preface to the Communist Manifesto , written a year before his death , amended this by pointing to a revolution in Russia as a possible " signal for proletarian revolution in the West . " 1 Yet although a worker-peasant revolution under Marxist leadership triumphed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , and the revolutionary uprisings in Germany and Central Europe which followed were weak and easily extinguished . <p> In these circumstances , Soviet Russia , completely isolated , faced a massive counterrevolution , with all the major imperialist powers intervening on the side of the White Russian forces in the Civil War . " Socialism in one country , " the basic defensive posture of the USSR throughout its history , was thus to a large extent a geopolitical reality imposed on it from outside . This was evident beginning with the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk , in which Russia was forced to give up much of the territory of the Tsarist Empire , followed soon after by the Treaty of Versailles , which sought to isolate it still further . <p> It was imperialism -- not in its generic sense , encompassing the whole history of colonialism -- but in its connection to the monopoly stage of capitalism , as V. I. Lenin employed the term , that constituted the differentia specifica of twentieth-century capitalism , determining the conditions of both revolution and counterrevolution . Already by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped much of European conflict since the seventeenth century had been replaced by a struggle of a qualitatively new kind : competition between nation-states and their corporations , not for imperial zones , but for actual global hegemony in an increasingly interconnected imperialist world system.2 Henceforth revolution and counterrevolution would be interrelated at the level of the system as a whole . All revolutionary waves , concentrated in the periphery where exploitation was most severe , since intensified by the extraction of surplus by the metropolitan powers , were revolts against imperialism , and were confronted by imperialist counterrevolution , organized by the core capitalist states.3 Complicating this was the fact that a privileged sector of the working class in the advanced capitalist states could be seen as benefitting indirectly from the drain of surplus from the periphery , giving rise to a " labor aristocracy , " a phenomenon first singled out Frederick Engels and later theorized by Lenin in his Imperialism , the Highest Stage of Capitalism.4 <p> Still , in 1967 , a half-century after October 1917 and a hundred years after Capital , it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cultural Revolution in China , that world revolution would gradually gain the upper hand , and that the revolutions that had occurred , not only in Russia , but also in China , Cuba , and elsewhere , were irreversible . The twentieth century had already proven itself the bloodiest in human history . Yet it was also a period of enormous advances in human liberation . If the forces of world counterrevolution were gathering , their victory , even in the short run , was far from certain . As Herbert Marcuse declared in the opening pages of his 1972 Counterrevolution and Revolt : <p> The Western world has reached a new stage of development : now , the defense of the capitalist system requires the organization of counterrevolution at home and abroad . In its extreme manifestations , it practices the horrors of the Nazi regime . Wholesale massacres in Indochina , Indonesia , the Congo , Nigeria , Pakistan , and the Sudan are unleashed against everything which is called " communist " or which is in revolt against governments subservient to the imperialist countries . Cruel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military dictatorships . Torture has become a normal instrument of " interrogation " around the world . The agony of religious wars revives at the height of Western civilization , and a constant flow of arms from the rich countries to the poor helps to perpetuate the oppression of national and social liberation .... The counterrevolution is largely preventative and , in the Western world , altogether preventative .... Capitalism reorganizes itself to meet the threat of a revolution which would be the most radical of all historical revolutions . It would be the first truly world-historical revolution . <p> Today , a hundred years after the Russian Revolution and a century-and-a-half after Capital , conditions have changed . It would appear that the clock has been turned back , and the forces of global counterrevolution have triumphed . Most of the emancipatory movements that seemed to be gaining ground in the 1960s , primarily in the periphery , have been roundly defeated . <p> Nevertheless , the material contradictions of capitalist development -- particularly in the form of the planetary ecological emergency -- are in many ways more serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2007 -- 09 pulled the veil away , it is abundantly clear that the present phase of global monopoly-finance capital , with its unprecedented levels of inequality , its stagnation and instability , its civilization-destroying bellicosity , its destruction of the environment , and its new forms of political-economic reaction , threatens the future not only of this generation , but that of all generations -- the very survival of humanity . As Eric Hobsbawm concluded in his history of the twentieth century , " the price of failure , that is to say , the alternative to a changed society , is darkness . " 5 <h> Reaction on a World Scale <p> If imperialist counterrevolution triumphed in the end over the revolutionary waves of the twentieth century , how are we to understand this , and what does it mean for the future of world revolution ? The answer requires a survey , in desperate brevity , of the whole history of imperialist geopolitics over the last century . <p> The period from the mid-1870s through the First World War marked a qualitative break in the logic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of the " new imperialism , " to refer to a rapid increase in colonial acquisitions , the rise of new imperial powers , and a reemergence of inter-imperialist rivalries.6 It was in this phase of the system that monopoly capital -- capitalism dominated by giant industrial and financial firms -- arose . Germany and the United States were rapidly entering the new age of heavy industry and advancing by leaps and bounds into the monopoly stage of capitalism , while Britain lagged behind in both respects.7 British hegemony over the capitalist world economy , dating from the Industrial Revolution , while still unrivalled in scale , was increasingly threatened under a new multipolar order of competing core states . The last three decades of the nineteenth century were years of economic stagnation , known in Europe at the time as the Great Depression . But it also represented an age of dramatic shifts in the locus of capitalist power . <p> Observing these trends , proponents of imperialism in the major capitalist states developed the new pseudoscience of geopolitics , which focused on the struggle for hegemony in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms as war by other means , often leading to the actual outbreak of hostilities . It had its origins primarily in the United States and Germany in the 1890s , marking the rise of both nations as imperial powers . In the United States , the new outlook was best represented by Charles Conant 's " The Economic Basis of Imperialism " ( 1898 ) and Brooks Adams 's The New Empire ( 1902 ) -- both of which projected U.S. political-economic hegemony over large parts of the globe , particularly the Pacific.8 The founder of the German school of Geopolitik was Friedrich Ratzel , who in the 1890s coined the term Lebensraum , " living space , " as an imperative of German policy . " There is in this small planet , " Ratzel wrote , " sufficient space for only one great state . " 9 <p> However , what can be called classical geopolitical analysis only appeared in the interwar years and during the Second World War . Its leading British theorist was Halford MacKinder , a former director of the London School of Economics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Democratic Ideals and Reality ( 1919 ) , he wrote : " The great wars of history are the outcome , direct or indirect , of the unequal growth of nations . " The object of capitalist geopolitics was to promote " the growth of empires , " ending in " a single World-Empire. " 10 MacKinder was famous for his doctrine of the Heartland . Hegemony over what he called the World-Island ( the interlocked continents of Europe , Asia , and Africa ) and through it control of the entire world , could only be achieved , he argued , by dominating the Heartland -- the enormous transcontinental landmass of Eurasia , encompassing Eastern Europe , Russia , and Central Asia . The Heartland was " the greatest natural fortress on earth , " because of its inaccessibility to the sea.11 In the new Eurasian age , land power -- not sea power , as in past centuries -- would be decisive . In Mackinder 's famous dictum : <p> Mackinder 's geopolitical strategy was influenced by the Russian Revolution , and used to justify imperialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high commissioner for South Russia , responsible for organizing British support for General Denikin and the White Army in the Civil War . Following the Red Army 's defeat of Denikin , Mackinder returned to London and reported to the government that , although Britain was right to fear German industrialization and militarism , German rearmament , then ostensibly blocked by the Treaty of Versailles , was essential . For Mackinder , Germany constituted the chief bulwark against Bolshevik control of Eastern Europe , and thus of the geopolitical Heartland.13 <p> Mackinder was not the only influential interwar figure to promote such beliefs . It was this same logic that led Neville Chamberlain 's government two decades later not so much to " appease " Nazi Germany , as to collude with it , in the hope that Germany would turn its guns eastward , toward the USSR . Indeed , the Treaty of Versailles , as Thorstein Veblen explained , was a " compact for the reduction of Soviet Russia , " which while " not written into the text of the Treaty , " could " be said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written . " 14 <p> In Germany , the leading geopolitical theorist of the 1930s and ' 40s was Karl Haushofer , the mentor of Rudolf Hess ( Deputy F ? hrer in the Nazi regime ) , and himself a key adviser to Adolf Hitler . He saw the British and U.S. empires as the main threat to Germany , and thus advocated the creation of a great Eurasian intercontinental power bloc , with Germany entering into an alliance of convenience with Russia and Japan to destroy Anglo-American power . With the signing of the Hitler-Stalin Nonaggression Pact , he wrote : " Now finally , the collaboration of the Axis powers , and of the Far East , stands distinctly before the German soul . At last there is hope of survival against the Anaconda policy the strangling encirclement of the Western democracies . " 15 <p> In the United States , the foremost geopolitical thinker of the age was Nicholas Spykman . In America 's Strategy in World Politics ( 1942 ) and his posthumous The Geography of Peace ( 1944 ) , Spykman opposed Mackinder 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that emphasized sea power . By controlling the coastal rimlands of Europe , the Middle East , East Asia , and the Pacific , the United States could encircle the Eurasian Heartland , then controlled by the USSR . Spykman insisted on the need for an American-British hegemony over the globe , and was primarily concerned in The Geography of Peace with preventing the USSR from establishing " a hegemony over the European rimland . " The Soviet Union , he argued , would be unable to defend itself against " a united rimland. " 16 Spykman 's geopolitics exerted a powerful if largely forgotten influence on U.S. foreign policy with the advent of the Cold War , including George Kennan 's strategy of " containment , " as well as the grand designs of the Council on Foreign Relations . <p> In 1943 , Mackinder underscored the global stakes for the U.S. empire , declaring in Foreign Affairs that " the territory of the Soviet Union is equivalent to the Heartland , " over which it could not be allowed to retain control.17 Washington 's initial geopolitical strategy adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hegemony outward beyond what the Council on Foreign Relations called the Grand Area of the British and American empires , to further encompass continental Europe , the Middle East , and the rimlands of Asia.18 In the new anticommunist crusade , revolutions were to be fought all across the globe , but especially in these strategic areas . Not only the Council on Foreign Relations , but a succession of leading Cold War and post-Cold War strategic planners , such as James Burnham , Eugene Rostow , Henry Kissinger , Zbigniew Brzezinski , and Paul Wolfowitz , would go on to argue in similar terms.19 Washington would ultimately set itself the wider objective of dominating states and regions throughout the world , as well as controlling strategic resources , capital movements , currencies , and world trade . However , the full extent of U.S. imperial ambitions was to become apparent only in the period of naked imperialism following the demise of the Soviet Union.20 <p> The clearest official statement of this new global ambition was the Defense Planning Guidance for 1994 -- 1999 ( portions of which were leaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolfowitz as undersecretary of defense for policy . This became known as the Wolfowitz Doctrine , commonly associated with the rise of neoconservatism . Intended as a direct response to the disappearance of the USSR from the world stage , it explicitly declared that the new goal of U.S. geopolitical strategy would be the indefinite prevention of the reemergence of any rival power that could threaten American supremacy -- that is , the pursuit of a permanent unipolar world . " Russia , " the document stated , " will remain the strongest military power in Eurasia and the only power in the world with the capability of destroying the United States . " 21 It thus continued to be the principal long-run target . <p> As Brzezinski , Carter 's national security adviser , put it in 1997 in The Grand Chessboard , " the United States ... now enjoys international primacy , with its power directly deployed on three peripheries of the Eurasian continent " -- Western Europe and parts of Eastern Europe , Central Asia and the Middle East , and East Asia and the Pacific Rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " hegemony of a new type " or " global supremacy , " indefinitely establishing the United States as " the first and only truly global power . " 22 The new world order then envisioned was one of U.S. unipolar power , backed by nuclear primacy . Regime change in mid-level states considered of geopolitical significance and outside the U.S. empire -- even those previously tolerated in the context of the Cold War -- became essential . Here the goal was not to create stable democracies -- an objective never considered viable in key strategic areas such as the Middle East -- but rather to destroy " rogue states " and unassimilated political blocs , particularly on the outskirts of the Eurasian Heartland and in the oil-rich Persian Gulf , that could threaten the security or hinder the expansion of the U.S. empire . The blowback from this grand strategy of destruction is most evident today in the rise of the Islamic State . <p> The U.S. imperial grand strategy for the post-Soviet era first outlined in the Defense Planning Guidance had as its governing assumption the eventual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that nation inevitably recovered . In anticipation of this , the U.S. hegemon and its NATO allies expanded further into Eurasia and surrounding regions , engaging in wars in the Balkans , Central Asia , the Middle East , and North Africa , tightening the noose around Russia over the quarter-century from 1992 to the present.23 This same grand imperial strategy included the suppression of all anti-systemic movements and forces in key strategic areas in the periphery , as well as attempts to constrain China militarily and politically . <p> Following the September 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in the United States , the New World Order originally declared by George H. W. Bush took on the additional ideological mantle of the War on Terrorism introduced by George W. Bush . This justified a strategy of permanent war and " humanitarian interventions " throughout the global periphery . In its efforts to assert total dominance over the Middle East following the 2003 Iraq War , the United States , backed by NATO , designated Iran and -- particularly after the 2011 invasion of Libya -- Syria as the leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principal objective . Yet the real reasons for regime change in the Middle East and elsewhere , as Wolfowitz had intimated in the early 1990s to General Wesley Clark , were strictly geopolitical.24 <p> The Obama administration , together with its NATO allies , brokered the 2014 coup in Ukraine , putting in place a pliant far-right government headed by a Western-friendly oligarch , thereby proclaiming in no uncertain terms the New Cold War against Russia . This reflected a strategic campaign in the works since at least 2007 , when Vladimir Putin defiantly declared that " the unipolar policy model of absolute U.S. global supremacy is not only unacceptable but also impossible in today 's world . " 25 The long counterrevolution against the Soviet Union was thus extended into a geopolitical struggle aimed at a reemerging , now capitalist , Russia . The latter struck back by absorbing Crimea ( formerly part of Ukraine ) following a referendum ; seeking to stabilize conditions in eastern Ukraine on its border , particularly with respect to Russian nationals ; and intervening to counter the U.S.-Saudi-sponsored proxy war against the Assad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its main Middle Eastern ally . <p> Remarkably , the new Trump administration , representing a somewhat different faction of the U.S. capitalist class -- beholden particularly to the fossil-fuel industry and financial sector and drawing heavily on a lower middle-class , ultra-nationalist ideology -- initially signaled a geopolitical shift , aimed at d ? tente with Russia . This was to be accompanied by a policy of concentrating on countering the Islamic State , Iran , North Korea , and China as the principal global antagonists -- a view associated with the " clash of civilizations " strategy of Samuel P. Huntington , as opposed to the Eurasian Heartland approach of Wolfowitz and Brzezinski.26 The incoming administration made it clear that China , with its rapid economic growth and increasing regional power , represented the main threat to U.S. hegemony ( and U.S. jobs ) , and hence the main target of its imperial strategy . <p> Nevertheless , the greater part of the U.S. military-industrial complex , from the Pentagon to the intelligence agencies to the major security contractors , has strongly resisted this shift away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insinuating treason on the part of the Trump administration for its preliminary discussions with Russian officials , portrayed as collusion with the enemy . Hence , the administration has been subject to an unprecedented number of leaks from within the national security state , and has come under investigation for its communications with Russia during the campaign and the post-election transition . For dominant sections of the U.S. ruling class , it remains essential that Russia , occupying the Eurasian Heartland , and still constituting the chief nuclear rival , should remain the principal target of U.S. grand strategy . The stability of the NATO alliance , and the entire U.S. strategy of permanently subordinating Europe to its rule , is founded on the New Cold War with Russia . <p> For the U.S. ruling class , the strength of the U.S. economy , the supremacy of the dollar , and hence the financial power of Washington , are all seen as dependent on U.S. global primacy . Although U.S. GDP growth and that of the other core capitalist countries has stagnated , with the West losing ground economically to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out of Washington still has as its objective a unipolar world order . This is to be leveraged by an array of strategic assets , including the combined weight of the triad alliance of the United States and Canada , Europe , and Japan under U.S. leadership ; geopolitical dominance ; military and technological power ; and financial supremacy via the dollar . <p> The aggressiveness of this imperial strategy can be seen in the U.S. pursuit of absolute dominance in nuclear weapons capabilities under the rubric of the " modernization " of all three legs of its nuclear arsenal . The object is to take full advantage of the fact that a weakened Russia fell behind for years in maintaining and modernizing its own nuclear weaponry , allowing the United States to pull decisively ahead . U.S. nuclear strategy is now predicated on the " death of MAD " ( Mutual Assured Destruction ) , that is , the demise of the entire system of deterrence.27 Those formulating U.S. strategic doctrine increasingly believe that the United States is currently capable , while using only a small part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an opponent in a first strike ( or counterforce attack ) -- even in the case of Russia -- to prevail in a nuclear confrontation . In short , Pentagon planners now believe the United States has attained " strategic primacy " in nuclear weapons capability.28 This would make a first strike against any enemy on Earth " thinkable " for the first time since 1945 , when Truman ordered the dropping of the atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki , resulting in hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties -- in what was a political rather than a military decision , and the first real act of the Cold War.29 Ominously , with the imminent death of MAD , the other side too , in any period of nuclear tensions , has greater incentive to strike first , lest it be destroyed completely by a U.S. hegemon no longer restrained by fears of its own destruction in the event of a first strike on its part.30 <p> " An essential feature of imperialism , " Lenin wrote , " is the rivalry between a number of great powers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the long run when one capitalist nation , as in the case of the United States in the twenty-first century , seeks to create a unipolar world or superimperialist order . <p> In the second half of the twentieth century , the United States showed itself to be the world 's most destructive nation , killing millions in wars , invasions , and counterinsurgencies across the globe.32 This bloody legacy continues into the present : over a single Labor Day weekend , on September 3 -- 5 , 2016 , the United States dropped bombs on or fired missiles at six largely Islamic countries : Afghanistan , Iraq , Libya , Somalia , Syria , and Yemen . In 2015 , it dropped a total of over 22,000 bombs on Iraq and Syria alone.33 No country opposed to the United States can afford to underestimate the level of violence that could be directed at it by the U.S. hegemon . <h> Revolution : The Human Future <p> In the twentieth century , revolutions were as much a product of resistance to imperialism as of class struggle . They most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " weak links " of the imperialist world system.34 Inevitably , they were met with counterrevolution organized by the great powers of the capitalist core . Even a small uprising was likely to be seen as a threat to world capitalist rule , and was usually crushed with brutal force , as in Ronald Reagan 's massive 1983 invasion of the tiny island of Grenada , or the covert war against the Sandinistas in Nicaragua . The dominant ideology invariably blames the enormous human cost of this warfare on the revolutions themselves , rather than on imperialist counterrevolutions , which are rapidly erased from historical memory . <p> In 1970 , MR editors Harry Magdoff and Paul Sweezy were invited to the inauguration of Chilean President Salvador Allende , who had been democratically elected as the head of a Popular Unity government , which promised to introduce socialism in Chile , starting with the nationalization of U.S. corporate assets in the country 's major industries . Magdoff and Sweezy were longtime friends of Allende 's , and their analysis at the time of his inauguration focused on the dangers arising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chilean military , suggesting the strong likelihood of a military coup to be sponsored by Washington and carried out by Chile 's praetorian guard . Imperialism , they warned , respects no rule of law where challenges to the existing order are concerned . And indeed , a bloody seizure of power , led by General Augusto Pinochet and engineered by the United States , occurred three years later , taking the life of Allende and thousands of others.35 <p> All of this reaffirms the historical truth that there can be no socialist revolution -- however it should arise -- that is not also forced to confront the reality of counterrevolution . Indeed , in judging revolution and counterrevolution over the last century , particular stress must be put on the strength and virulence of the counterrevolution . The struggles and errors of the revolutionists are only to be seen in the context of this wider historical dialectic . <p> From history textbooks to the mainstream news media , the dominant ideology in the West today presents the Russian Revolution of 1917 as an utter failure from beginning to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the weight of its own internal inefficiencies and irremediable defects -- though these accounts often claim almost in the same breath that it was U.S. power and military might that " won " the Cold War . It is undeniable that the history of the USSR was rife with historical tragedies and social and economic contradictions . Much of the enormous human potential that the Russian Revolution unleashed was exhausted in the devastating Civil War -- in which the White Russian forces were directly supported by troops and arms from the West . The Soviet Union later fell prey to Joseph Stalin 's extreme collectivization and brutal purges.36 <p> Nevertheless , the USSR over its history also underwent extraordinary industrial development , the conditions of the working class generally improved , and the population enjoyed certain economic securities lacking elsewhere . It was the Soviet Union that saved the West in the Second World War , beginning with the dramatic defeat of the Wehrmacht at Stalingrad -- the turning point of the war -- and the victorious westward march of the Red Army ( though the war also took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ) . The Soviet Union 's very existence inspired movements for human liberation in the third world . With the growth of the Soviet bloc and the region 's economic and technological accomplishments , the position of the USSR in the world seemed secure well into the 1970s . Its central planning system , despite certain inefficiencies and a tendency to degenerate into an overly bureaucratized command economy , offered a new and in many ways successful approach to economic and social development in noncapitalist terms . <p> But the USSR failed to carry forward the socialist revolution . The postrevolutionary society that emerged generated its own bureaucratic ruling class , the nomenklatura , which had arisen from the inequities of the system . The USSR 's stubborn refusal to allow independent development in Eastern Europe ( albeit viewed as a necessary buffer zone against Western invasion ) was made clear in the Soviet invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968.37 <p> In the end , the USSR lost its inner dynamism , relying too much on extensive ( the forced drafting of labor and resources ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the unleashing of creative forces ) . It was exhausted by a decades-long military , political , and economic contest with the West , forced to compete in a massive arms race that it could ill afford.38 For all their superficial promise , Mikhail Gorbachev 's misconceived and indeed disastrous glasnost ( openness ) and perestroika ( restructuring ) policies massively undid the system , rather than reforming it . Although the loss of Eastern Europe , symbolically marked by the fall of the Berlin Wall , contributed to this unraveling , it was the Soviet nomenklatura that proved to be the system 's final undoing , as numerous representatives of the Soviet power elite and a corrupted privileged intelligentsia , in alliance with Boris Yeltsin and the West , chose to dissolve the post-revolutionary state from above -- believing that their own individual and class interests would be better promoted under capitalism.39 <p> Yet in spite of all of this , the experience of the USSR , as the first major socialist break with the capitalist system , continues to inspire and to inform revolution in the twenty-first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it took an entirely different form and is now itself imperiled by a counterrevolution supported by the United States -- could hardly have been imagined without the Soviet example.40 The USSR 's extraordinary economic , technological , and cultural achievements are not easily erased in the historical memory.41 <p> The world capitalist crisis of the late twentieth century eventually engulfed the core capitalist nations themselves as they sank from the 1970s on into economic stagnation -- partly counteracted by the financialization of accumulation in the 1980s and ' 90s , which , however , ended with the bursting of the housing bubble in 2007 -- 09 . With the full onset of stagnation since the Great Financial Crisis , the positions of the working class and lower-middle class in the advanced capitalist states have plummeted . Inequality has reached its highest level in history , both within nations and globally . <p> So severe is this seemingly endless crisis that it has destabilized the state within the core capitalist countries . The ruling classes of the various capitalist countries have responded to the growing popular disenchantment by resurrecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . Neoliberalism has thus partially given way to neofascism , or what may prove to be a neoliberal-neofascist ( or center right/radical right ) alliance . In the United States , science itself is rejected as a threat to capitalism , with climate-change denial now the official stance of the Trump White House.42 The " destruction of reason " is thus complete.43 <p> Reactionary forces have of course gained the upper hand many times before in the history of the class struggle , only to give rise to new revolutionary waves . Commenting on the defeat of the 1848 revolutions in Europe , Engels observed in Germany : Revolution and Counter-Revolution : <p> A more signal defeat undergone by the continental revolutionary party -- or rather parties -- upon all points of the line of battle , can not be imagined . But what of that ? ... Everyone knows nowadays that wherever there is a revolutionary convulsion , there must be some social want in the background , which is prevented , by outward institutions , from satisfying itself .... If , then , we have been beaten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again from the beginning.44 <p> Although the historical conditions have been transformed many times over , these sentiments still ring true . Given today 's ever more desperate need for social change , it is necessary " to begin again from the beginning , " creating a new , more revolutionary socialism for the twenty-first century . Massive , democratic , egalitarian , ecological , revolutionary change in both center and periphery represents the only truly human future .

@@19955240 <p> ( August 11 , 2017 , Boston , Sri Lanka Guardian ) This book offers a valuable and provocative contribution to the growing literature on Nietzsche 's political philosophy . It invites us to understand Nietzsche 's politics as consisting mainly in a kind of political programcalling for a radical transformation of our earthly habitation . On Shapiro 's reading , this program principally requires reconceiving our relation to temporality , and , in particular , to the future , by cultivating a kind of openness that can make us receptive to those rare opportunities for radical change Nietzsche called " great events " . Nietzsche 's politics of futurity , however , requires displacing the way of thinking prevalent in the petty politics of nation-states . In each chapter , Shapiro investigates different aspects of Nietzsche 's critiques of this way of thinking , trying to articulate , at the same time , its positive alternative . <p> In the introductory chapter , Shapiro argues that " earth " is a political concept that Nietzsche meant to counterpose to the Hegelian notion of " world " , which has politico-theological affiliations with pernicious notions of unity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of history that overly extols the nation-state as the medium for the world-spirit 's self-realization ( pp.4 , 7 , 11-13 , 16 ) . According to Shapiro , Nietzsche sought to combat these entrenched political notions by initiating a great politics of the earth that , in contrast to the homogenizing world of nation-states , entreats us to see our planet as a place of radical plurality and of mobile multitudes that can dedicate themselves to giving a new direction to the earth ( p.5 , 18 ) . Shapiro is aware that the dichotomy of " earth " vs. " world " may be suspect , insofar as the contrast is not one Nietzsche appears to have made explicit in his texts . Still , he argues ( in my view credibly ) that the distinction illuminates important themes in Nietzsche 's work and that , in a way , it is implicit from the beginning in all of Nietzsche 's philosophizing . <p> Chapter 2 picks up the anti-metanarrative theme by focusing on early Nietzsche 's invective against end of history thinking . Shapiro emphasizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thinking is implicated with a racist ideology of national unity that devalues the exceptional human being in favor of the uniform , homogeneous masses of the nation-state ( pp.29 , 32 ) . This association is partly explained by the fact that state thinking displays a tendency to draw borders and posits an exclusionary dichotomy , in which the reasonably regulated life of those living within the state is to be contrasted with the chaotic barbarism encountered outside ( pp.50-51 ) . To sustain this kind of ideology , the state exploits the journalistic conception of events understood as " news " , i.e. as something that must be perpetually expected and feared , which , among other things , facilitates the manufacturing of permanent " states of exception " through which the hold on power of the money-makers and military despots that control the state is strengthened , with the excuse that it is the only way to handle the constant siege that the state is under ( pp.46-47 , 67-68 ) . According to Shapiro , Nietzsche in his early writings , aiming to disrupt this network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " great events " as unpredictable and transformative occurrences that instead of foreclosing the future can throw it open . But his attempt failed because he was still caught up with problematic notions of national unity and even with Hegelian modes of thinking ( pp.36-37 , 56-57 ) . <p> Chapter 3 begins with a look at " states of exception " which , on Shapiro 's analysis , Nietzsche saw as symptoms of the fragility of the modern state ( pp.65-66 ) . The nation-state requires the use of devices to suspend the rule of law in part because the increased mobility of populations and the growing cultural intermingling of Europeans are eroding the authority of the state and threatening to abolish it altogether . Much of the chapter , however , is devoted to a very hard to follow discussion of techniques of measurement and control of people , processes of territorialization , deterritorialization , and reterritorialization that organize the way we think of our relation to space and earth , the relation between music and geography , and so on . As happens in other places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with abrupt changes in focus and the development of lines of thought whose connection to an overarching thesis is not always discernible . Still , perhaps the connecting thread is to be found in Shapiro 's attempt to articulate what he takes to be Nietzsche 's way of exploring other alternatives for inhabiting the earth and overcoming the pernicious essentialism of the nation-state that stifles the spirit of a people . Shapiro argues that Nietzsche saw populations , not as masses to be molded into systematic and homogeneous forms , but as multitudes full of productive possibilities precisely because they constitute experiments in inhabiting the earth , ones that require mobility in the form of nomadic wanderings , migrations , and also climatic and environmental changes in order to be fecund ( pp.91 , 93 ) . Out of these multitudes are born the hybrid humans that anticipate the European of the future by trying out different cultural combinations and syntheses ( p.97 ) . <p> Chapter 4 returns to the theme of great events , this time highlighting their nature as kairos or moments of opportunity to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key aspect of nobility , as Nietzsche understood it , consists in " a mode of living one 's temporality involving alert vigilance , freedom from the crowd 's enthusiasms of the moment , and from the deadly deformation of lived time through economies of debt that mortgage the future " ( p.102 ) . In order to seize the opportune moment , the noble type must think beyond peoples and fatherlands , thus implicating him with the desire to see Europe become one by experimenting with new cosmopolitan forms of diversity and multiplicity that extend beyond borderlines ( pp.109-110 , 116 ) . Similarly , cultivating this type of nobility will require escaping the logic of mortgage time that governs nation-states , where personal and political time are subjected to a regime of debt and credit that forces us to experience life in the temporal mode of chronos , i.e. as a series of stretches of time measured in terms of conditions of repayments of debts and of penalties for defaulting that all militate against our ability to seize the kairos ( p.130-131 ) . <p> In chapter 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nietzsche 's politics . It includes a fascinating discussion of the historic role that the concept of the garden has played in the formation of modern aesthetics ( pp.140-151 ) . Shapiro has a very general statement regarding the garden as a space to promote a hedonistic happiness in which " the dominant themes are the shaping and tending of the natural , with a view to producing a rewarding result as well as the enjoyment of an earthly site " ( pp.150-151 ) . However , he fails to connect his rich analysis more forcefully with Nietzsche 's use of the metaphor . This missed opportunity is unfortunate , for Shapiro touches on themes that are very much at play in Nietzsche 's philosophy . For instance , Shapiro notes that the Italian and French styles of gardening that Nietzsche admired were designed to highlight the sovereignty of the human will over nature , its ability to master and civilize natural forces in order to subordinate them to some grand rational plan . And while , in fairness , it should be said that Shapiro does claim that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and making ( p.156 ) , and that it even incorporates the idea of the garden as the work of reason on behalf of reason ( p.162 ) , the overall tendency of Shapiro 's account is to foreclose the possible connection that these notions might have , in Nietzsche philosophy , to more grandiose conceptions of the human will and its capacity to plan the future with world-conquering and eternalizing ambitions . Such connections would , of course , run counter to the general picture of Nietzsche 's politics Shapiro is determined to draw , in which supposedly the future of the earth can not be planned ( pp.98-99 ) . Yet , it seems to me that such themes are very much part of Nietzsche 's philosophy , as seen , for instance , in the important section GS 291 that Shapiro himself brings to our attention . For Nietzsche , the garden is not just the product of an experimental reason , as Shapiro would have it ( p.161 ) , but also of an eternalizing , totalizing , perhaps -- forgive the contrived formula -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GS 291 , after all , " built and adorned to last for centuries and not for the fleeting hour " and they " perpetrated acts of violence and conquest " with their designs , that had the grand ambition of laying hands to the whole world around them in order to " make it their possession by incorporating it into their plan " . Here is one of the places where the real weak spot of Shapiro 's otherwise insightful analysis is exposed most clearly , a point to which I will return shortly . <p> In the last chapter , Shapiro turns to Nietzsche 's philosophy of the Antichrist by examining the infamous book that bears that name in its title . For Shapiro , one of the principal lessons of The Antichrist is that Christianity is Paul 's political invention , through which the early Christian interpretation of the Jesus event was subverted in order to accommodate the fact that the apocalyptic expectations of the faith had been disappointed ( pp.175 , 186-187 ) . A religion that started out as rigorously unworldly had to learn to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This political adjustment involved , above all , developing a new theory of time in which history became plotted as a story of deferred redemption through the intervention of Church and State , whose worldly powers ward off the imminent coming of the Antichrist ( pp.195-196 ) . Since , according to Shapiro , the metanarrative of world-history is one of the chief elements of statist ideology , he argues that Christianity is the inventor of world-history and that The Antichrist is integral to Nietzsche 's attempt to overcome this way of reckoning time that belittles humanity and the earth ( pp.180-181 ) . How the reformed Christian story of deferred redemption through the state transmutes itself into a story of fulfilled redemption in the state is something that Shapiro does not fully explain . On his account , Christianity lends ideological support to imperial authority partly by fomenting the belief that the state is the restraining force that can keep the Antichrist from appearing and history and the world from ending ( p.186 ) . Yet , part of statist ideology is also to suppose that the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two functions , as restrainer and enabler of the end of time , do not seem compatible at first glance . Perhaps the answer to this apparent contradiction is obvious to Shapiro , but , in general , these kinds of unresolved tensions abound in his analysis . <p> Overall , Nietzsche 's Earth is very interesting and provocative ; it strives with no small measure of success to provide a coherent picture of Nietzsche 's philosophy . Shapiro does a good job of showing the relevance of Nietzsche 's thought to contemporary social and political issues like the war on terror , globalization , the environmental crisis , and so on . He is to be commended especially also for his ability to engage fearlessly with Nietzsche 's metaphors , which are an essential part of his thinking , and yet are often neglected by many Anglophone commentators , particularly those working within the analytic tradition . To them , this book may serve as a lesson and an example of the kinds of rewards that could await those who dare to follow the thread that leads into Nietzsche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Shapiro has benefitted well from the continental tradition he draws from , which has fewer qualms about engaging in metaphoric analysis . <p> But the root of Shapiro 's strength may also be the source of his weakness . For one thing , readers who are not conversant with the philosophical perspectives of writers like Deleuze , Guattari , and Agamben will have a hard time following the discussions where these figures are recruited in order to explain important themes in Nietzsche 's philosophy . Shapiro often forgets to take the time to help readers clearly understand the conceptual resources he deploys , leaving us to fend for ourselves and to resolve the apparent tensions introduced by the use of these resources . How is it that statist ideology , whose tendency supposedly inclines towards an entrenched mentality of drawing borders , is not , as one would have perhaps naturally expected , associated with the thought-process of " territorialization " by means of which " we humans ( and all living things ) . . . stake out a space , a place . . . we mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but is instead linked to " deterritorializing " forms of thinking in which spaces are being absorbed in a kind of expansionist mindset that , disrespecting all borders , attempts to " configure itself as a mobile political structure , not absolutely tied to a fixed place " ( p.86 ) ? How is it that the network of statist ideas that includes the notion of the " end of history " according to which no more new events are to be expected because time has ceased , nonetheless , also includes the journalistic conception of events as " news " that must constantly be manufactured because the state can not tolerate empty time ? <p> As I mentioned , it may be that the solution to these and other tensions is not so difficult , but Shapiro does not even seem to notice their presence in his account . Indeed , as I read this book , I often found myself feeling as if I had stepped into the middle of a veritable lighting storm of very suggestive insights , but absent the metal rod and the lens that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focused beam . As a result , I can not help but feel that , while generally coherent and capturing much that I believe to be really part of Nietzsche 's philosophy , the Nietzschean tapestry that Shapiro has woven threatens to fall apart at the seams . It also provides a skewed and partial picture that omits important themes that , in many ways , are more central to Nietzsche 's philosophical outlook and , thus , presumably integral to whatever political project he may have espoused . I have no doubt that , as Shapiro insists , Nietzsche 's politics of futurity does entreat us to keep to some extent the future open , to cultivate nomadic lives and ways of thinking that are free from the stifling effects of nationalistic ideology , to resist the pernicious influence of the multitude 's passing enthusiasms and the theatrical sensationalism of the modern press , so that we can seize the kairos ; and so on . <p> But where , in this vision , is the Nietzsche who showed admiration for the laws of Manu , " whose goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thriving life " ( A 58 ) ? Or the Nietzsche who laments the Christian destruction of the Roman Empire because " this most remarkable artwork in the great style was a beginning , its design was calculated to prove itself over the millennia -- , nothing like it has been built to this day , nobody has even dreamed of building on this scale , sub specie aeterni from the standpoint of eternity ! " ( A 60 ) . Where , indeed , is the Nietzsche who , as Shapiro has it , may criticize the logic of mortgage time , but also has no problem incorporating that very logic into his own -- dare I say -- teleological metanarrative of redemption in The Genealogy , by appearing to suggest that the human being with the right to make promises , the sovereign individual who is the master of a free will , might be , in turn , the great promise that nature makes to us as repayment , perhaps , for the guilt it has incurred in using us for its bloody and cruel experiment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find in the recovered garden-earth Shapiro speaks of ( GM II.2-3 , 16 ) ? A great promise and a debt , by the way , that in an interesting reversal of the Christian story might require our assistance to be repaid ( for instance , by our learning to incorporate the thought of Eternal Recurrence into our lives ) ; for nature is blind , and the god of nature , Dionysus , might be incapable of securing on his own the conditions that will ensure that we are able to enjoy -- as does the convalescent Zarathustra in his post-redemption speech -- the pleasant smell of the rosy apple of our volitional powers instead of the repulsive , sinful scent of a rotting free will that has spoiled on the tree ( BGE 203 , 211 ; Z III ' The Convalescent ' , 2 ) . <p> It is not altogether surprising that Shapiro has a blind spot for these themes , for they tend to clash with those favored by the type of philosophic tradition in which he feels at home , and for which this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nietzsche often speaks positively of tradition . Its tyrannical hold can serve to educate the spirit in self-discipline and prepare it for freedom ( BGE 44 , 188 ) . The will to tradition is also , for him , part of the engine that drives those powers , like the Roman Empire , " that can wait , that can still make promises " , for this will belongs to " the sort of instincts that give rise to institutions , that give rise to a future " ( TI ' Skirmishes ' , 39 ) . But in his characteristic nuanced way , Nietzsche also warns us against becoming so comfortable within our traditions that we simply let our thoughts grow peacefully , all too peacefully from them ( UM III.8 ) . One of the things he admired in our modern culture was precisely its ability to contradict and to be hostile towards what is traditional ; the ability to take sides against all that is familiar and wants to become firm in us ( GS 296 , 297 ) . <p> None of us can completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain vigilant of the ways in which they might skew our outlooks might perhaps be one of the most important lessons I am bringing back home with me from my fortunate encounter with Shapiro 's thought-provoking work . <p> -- ( 2001 1882 and 1887 ( Book V added ) ) , The Gay Science : with a Prelude in German Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs ( GS ) , B.

A very important and hitherto unknown large Buddhist Silk Route site ' Mes Aynak ' , discovered during the initial exploration for a copper mine , was given until December 2016 for an immediate rescue excavation , a daunting task indeed . No one is sure what happened in the end . The purchasing of mineral rights across the continent of Africa would also be on similar lines . ' According to World Trade Asia , over 80 percent of China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' China 's commitment to FDI and infrastructure investment in Africa , regardless of it being for the implicit purpose of enabling easier exportation of oil , is aiding African development in the process . Chinese workers and companies alike are involved in building roads and railways and other such infrastructure development projects . ' The Tan-zam railway completed in the 1970s to connect the copper mines in Zambia to the Tanzanian Indian Ocean port of Dar-es-salaam , is an engineering marvel as it travels through totally unchartered territory , with over 5,000 Chinese being sacrificed to lions during the duration of the project construction . Interestingly , ' today the west seems to be concerned about a closed imperialistic loop , which , as experts on imperialism , could be a sentiment borne of their own colonial experiences with Africa that they see China now closely imitating ' . <p> Peter Navarro , a business professor at the University of California-Irvine described the US understanding of this loop as , " China goes in , builds the infrastructure , and uses that country 's infrastructure to extract their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished goods , and then ships them back into that country to sell . The bottom line is poverty instead of prosperity in countries that have incredible natural wealth " . Serge Mombouli , onetime Congolese Ambassador to the United States stated , " The Chinese are business people . They are not a charity organization . They are coming for business and any contract that the Chinese sign with African country , those are contracts that are negotiated . " The Chinese mining enterprise has reached South America as well . <p> ' There is truth to Navarro 's claims , Angola accounts for 50 percent of China 's oil imports and China has invested USD 2 billion in infrastructure development , yet still 70 percent of Angolans live under the poverty line . The same can be said for Sudan and in Nigeria 80 percent of the country 's revenues come from China 's oil importations , but the money is not trickling down . China 's reliance on African oil , in particular the case of Sudan , has highlighted political scrutiny from western countries , particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If China wants to remain long term trade partners with its largest oil exporters it may need to consider the social and humanitarian ramifications of its trade policy and revise how it could contribute more to establishing more stable future bilateral relations ' . <p> The US is critical of China 's role however , if the US establishes itself , it could be as bad or significantly far worse ; a very clear picture of their patronising role in the Middle East is something Sri Lanka should view with concern as the US gets ready to establish a second base in the Indian Ocean . To quote Henry Kissinger , " America has no friends , only interests " <p> Sri Lanka has many special heavy minerals , including Thorium . Two decades ago there was an Australian with permission from the government exporting sealed barrels of a sand material . No one was allowed to access the site by the special armed guard protecting the site , however , due to the protests it was stopped . The government of Sri Lanka should not issue mineral mining permits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its extent and what could be permitted to be taken out . This is often done without even understanding or appreciating the possible damage to the valuable and precious resource and eventually to the environment ? <p> Layers of Garnet sand accumulated over thousands of years in the sand dunes , along the south coast has been sold or negotiated for sale to a company , they state that they will extract the layer of garnet sand and reconstitute the sand dune . A dune that has taken thousands of years to form can not be reconstituted by human hands . Ilmenite along the north east coast was a resource that had been sold in the late 1960s to a Japanese company at Rs. 25.00 a ton . Mr Hara the Engineer in charge announced at that time that the company was making a profit of $ 4 Million per year , while the Geological &amp; Mines Bureau was making a loss . The project was subsequently given to the Provincial Council which gave it to an Indian Company for exploitation . The Indians built the Pulmudai Hospital for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Rutile the base for Thorium , was sold for Rs. 606.00 per ton . In many countries as these are metals of the future they are stockpiled , instead of selling their precious resources , on the understanding that the real value will rise to astronomical heights in the future . Desperate Sri Lanka has no such plan . <p> There are special gem stones being washed off the different peniplanes , with even the possibility of diamonds being found in the south as a by-product of Sri Lanka 's original connection with Gondwana land and the shifting continents . Thankfully , some years back , an attempt by a powerful group together with foreign collaboration , to promote a proposal to mechanically dredge the rivers for gem stones , was stopped before they got too far . This dredging would have destroyed all the endemic lifeforms inhabiting special pockets along the streams and rivers and would have added to the destruction and erosion already perpetrated by the many mini hydro projects operational and or proposed along most mountain streams in the hill country . <p> The question that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are extracted out of the ground to be enjoyed by someone else ? Is this not exploitation to benefit a select few in the short term ? What happens to the human populations in these countries , after they have been raped of their resources and what happens to the deep open pits left behind ? Maybe " Open Pit Tourism ? The way to go . For example , the Congo a large country with unbelievable riches , raped for decades by the colonial rulers and corrupt leaders , is today one of the poorest countries in Africa . Wake up Sri Lanka ! <p> Some years ago , Sri Lanka experienced an early attempt by a foreign company with Japanese/American and local political backing , in its attempt to exploit the whole of the Eppawela rock phosphate deposit within a very short period of 30 years . The 10 mile buffer zone round the deposit insisted on by the company as an insurance against the deposit extending far beyond what is known today , stretched up to the sacred city of Anuradhapura and the Sri Maha Bodhi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The exploited material was to be taken by special train to Trincomalee to a processing plant where the sulphuric acid tanks were located and the excess residue from the process , the mountains of phosphor gypsumwas to be collected in Cod bay with a new sea dam , constructed across its short mouth closing it off from the Ocean . Over time the leeching of this phosphor gypsum into the sea , could affect the future of all marine life in the deep channel going north east out of Trincomalee . <p> ' Phosphor gypsum is a carcinogenic substance and getting rid of it is difficult . Gypsum stacks represent a serious environmental threat to Central Florida and other American cities . According to the EPA , 32 million tons of new gypsum waste is created each year by the phosphate industry in Central Florida alone . ' <p> As noted by the popularTampa Tribune , " The gypsum mound is near capacity , and a wet spring or a tropical storm could cause a catastrophic spill " To prevent such a spill , which was all but inevitable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Option Z " : To load 500-600 million gallons of the waste water onto barges and dump it directly into the Gulf of Mexico.The dumping of the waste water into the Gulf represents the latest in a series of high-profile embarrassments for Florida 's phosphate industry ; one of the most dramatic of which happened on June 15 , 1994 . As noted by the St. Petersburg Times , " Spills from these stacks have periodically poisoned the Tampa Bay environs . " One spill , in 1997 , from a now-defunct gypsum stack in Florida , " killed more than a million fish . " <p> ' Resting atop the phosphate industry 's gypsum piles are highly-acidic wastewater ponds , littered with toxic contaminants , including fluoride , arsenic , cadmium , chromium , lead , mercury , and the various decay-products of uranium ? This combination of acidity and toxins makes for a poisonous , high-volume , cocktail , which , when leaked into the environment , wreaks havoc to waterways and fish populations . Due to big company pressure these cities have not been able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only a few Sri Lankans realise that the ancients did make use of the fertilizer at Eppawela , but in a more subtle and sustainable manner . They did not dig it out of the ground , instead they used the monsoon rains to wash over it . The Ela has no bund on the side of the deposit but only on the side opposite to the deposit . Rain water run off over the deposit carried a very small , but sufficient amount into the Ela . This is then taken along with the water in the canal to the fields of Anuradhapura . This intelligent use ensured that the deposit was in use for over two thousand years and still available for another couple of thousand years , if not misused . This is ancient philosophy and knowledge at its sustainable best . <p> The cry raised by the Farmers and the Temple priest in Eppawela , with the support of the prime mover the well-known photographer , the late Nihal Fernando and other committed environmentalists sounded a very loud ' Apita Epa Wala ' against the exploitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programme of the foreign group , finally ended in court . The brilliant judgement at the conclusion of the court proceedings by the very eminent judge Ranjit Amarasinghe , was a milestone in judicial history .

We have to educate yourselves on why these valuable resources should be preserved and not lost to a greed-driven herd ? <p> Is the present excavation of the phosphate rock that is taking place at Eppawela , though small in relation to what was to have been done , helping to create thedeadly cocktail ?

It shows not only the west 's bluff , but their fear from the East -- where Brussels and Washington know very well -- the world 's future lays . <p> This revival of the ancient Silk road with 21st Century technology , as China calls it , also comes with financing to promote basic needs , such as urban planning , water supply , sanitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparative production advantages will be applied in an open market of equals among equals , already begun under the Eurasian Economic Union ( EAEU ) , signed by Presidents Putin and Xi in May 2015 , and rapidly expanding westward . <p> The OBI is sometimes referred to as the Eastern Marshall Plan . But it should rather and more aptly be called the Xi Plan . It comes with the appropriate financial instruments , foremost the Beijing based Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank ( AIIB ) . The Xi Plan is destined for economic development and peoples ' well-being . Whereas the Marshall Plan was designed for deceit , exploitation and enslavement of Europe with its subservient Bretton Woods Institutions -- and it succeeded . <p> The AIIB is a multilateral development bank . In June 2015 , 57 countries signed the Bank 's Articles of Agreement which entered into force on December 25 , 2015 . The Bank started operations on January 16 , 2016 .

After having lived through a fake and fraudulent privately run monetary economy for most of the last 200 years -even the staunchest ally and Washington vassal is becoming wary and ready for a new start . <p> AIIB will be tough competition for the Bretton Woods Institutions , IMF and World Bank , especially since the AIIB will be playing by faire rules -- no strangulation structural adjustment loans to privatize social sectors and natural resources , and to plunge developing countries into misery and subjugation with austerity programs no end .

The BRICS NDB is headquartered in Shanghai and will work in parallel with the AIIB to further economic cooperation , growth , and human well-being . The NDB Treaty was signed in July 2015 with a subscribed capital of US$ 50 billion , of which US$ 10 billion paid-in and US$ 40 billion callable .

Just 6 days away . <p> The Convention came into force on the 23rd December 2010 . So far , of the 193 member states of the United Nations , only 57 countries have become State Parties by ratifying it . State Parties have voluntarily undertaken to be bound by its provisions . Sri Lanka became a State Party on the 26th of May 2016 . Just over a year ago . <p> Of cardinal significance is that the UK and the US have not become State Parties . When Lord Lester of Herne Hill asked Her Majesty 's Government whether it intends to sign the bill , Lord Triesman , Parliamentary Under-Secretary ( Foreign and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against wartime disappearances <p> " The Government needs to conduct a detailed analysis of the provisions of the treaty and their implications for implementation in order to determine the UK 's position towards ratification , including whether we would need to make any reservations . The UK did not sign the convention at the signing ceremony in Paris on 6 February because the UK does not sign international treaties unless it has a firm intention to ratify within a reasonable time frame . We understand that 57 states , including 10 member states of the European Union , have so far signed the convention ... " <p> As for the US , this is how it went at the Daily Press Briefings , with Sean McCormack , saying on 7th February 2007 in Washington DC : <p> " QUESTION : Did you notice that 57 countries signed a treaty today that would basically bar governments from holding secret detainees and the U.S. did not join ? <p> MR . MCCORMACK : Yeah . This is -- I understand that there is a Convention for the Protection of All Persons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information on it here , George . I confess I do n't have all the details . I do know that we participated in all the meetings that produced the draft . Beyond that , I ca n't give you specific reasons here from the podium as to why we did n't sign on to it . We 've put out a public document that I can give you the citation for afterwards and it explains our reasons for not participating in the draft . But I think just as a general comment , clearly the draft that was put up for a vote or put for signature was not one that met our needs and expectations . " <p> And yet , Sri Lanka 's Yahapalana government which looks to those two countries for guidance , signed up for it . Some of the other countries which signed up , declared certain reservations at the time of signing which are included with their signature . For instance , Cuba has the following declaration : <p> " Declaration : The Republic of Cuba hereby declares , in accordance with article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself obliged to refer its disputes to the International Court of Justice , as provided for in paragraph 1 of the same article . " <p> Morocco , Ukraine and Venezuela did the same . Sri Lanka , however , did not . <p> Consider the following in Article 13.4 : <p> " If a State Party which makes extradition conditional on the existence of a treaty receives a request for extradition from another State Party with which it has no extradition treaty , it may consider this Convention as the necessary legal basis for extradition in respect of the offence of enforced disappearance . " <p> From what I understand , this means that in the case of Sri Lanka , even if we do n't have an extradition treaty with another State Party , if they request the extradition of , say , General Jagath Jayasuriya to Brazil ( which by the way is a State Party ) , we have to oblige ! <p> Is n't that why this government is gagging to ratify this treaty ? If it was n't , would n't it have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only declaration Sri Lanka did make at the time of signing is to strengthen the role of the committee : <p> " Declaration under article 32 : " ... the Government of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka wishes to declare as per Article 32 of the Convention that it recognizes the competence of the Committee to receive and consider communications in which a State Party claims that another State Party is not fulfilling its obligations under this Convention " . <p> This was despite the fact that article 32 goes on to say : <p> " The Committee shall not receive communications concerning a State Party which has not made such a declaration , nor communications from a State Party which has not made such a declaration . " <p> This makes it seem like Sri Lanka , in May 2016 , wanted very much to avail itself of every opportunity to use this convention fully ! <p> Even if it claims good faith , it is incumbent on a government to ensure that the country 's security as a state is not jeopardized when it signs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report with its extravagant claims , to be alerted to the dangers of a distorted narrative skillfully mainstreamed by a separatist Diaspora which was able to co-opt even eminent international lawyers to underwrite its claims . <p> The claims in Brazil by a civil society group which calls for the extradition of General Jagath Jayasuriya is only the canary in the mineshaft . <p> The inordinate hurry to bring this Convention for a vote in parliament at this time , when most members are seized with the far more important work of the Constitution , only exposes this government 's bad faith in trying to slip it in without due consideration of the national interest , and without granting adequate time for the parliament ( i.e. the people 's elected representatives ) to study it and make the necessary amendments to it . <p> Reading Sir Desmond de Silva QC 's riveting book , ' Madam Where Are Your Mangoes ? ' where he recounts his experiences as the Chief Prosecutor of the Special Court for Sierra Leone which indicted Charles Taylor , the President of Liberia , an evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international criminal justice system has many ways to bring wrongdoers to justice . Sir Desmond 's Diary record for the 10th of March 2003 reads : " HMS Iron Duke is at anchor off Lumley Beach . Her 4.5 inch guns with a range of twenty two kilometers are trained on Freetown ... " Freetown is where the Special Court was located . It continues : " C company of the Royal Gurkhas is conducting a set piece firepower demonstration ... They will use antitank guided missile and medium range mortars ... The projection of power is ... a signal that any attempt to interfere with arrests to be carried out , or any attempt to come to the aid of the indicted War criminals will be met with force . " <p> In President Charles Taylor 's case , despite the African continent 's reluctance to hand him over , ways were found to persuade Nigeria to do the deed . The Appeals Chamber gave a judgment in this case that read : " The principle seems now established that the sovereign equality of states does not prevent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or court . " <p> People such as Charles Taylor needed to be stopped since he sounds like he 'd lost his mind -- the crimes ascribed to him are utterly heinous . However Sri Lanka at this moment in history is facing a false narrative about its war against an ethnic separatist militia employing terrorism , including suicide bombing , as its weapon of choice . The anti-war , anti-Sri Lanka lobby has been able to win the sympathy of the powerful Western countries , even though this narrative conspicuously failed to win a vote at the UN Human Rights Council in 2009 . Before the goodwill gained by that effort could be consolidated to firmly establish a fair account of the war against the LTTE , Sri Lanka 's Ambassador was recalled by the government of the day . Since then , the approach of that Sri Lankan government saw many resolutions censoring it , urging it to prosecute those alleged of War Crimes . It is during this time that we saw the Darusman report present a biased view , which the government of the day never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts against Sri Lanka and is quoted in every book and article on the subject . <p> Just as one thought it could n't get worse , the successor government was only too eager to co-sponsor resolutions of similar or worse claims . And now we have this Convention on Disappearances about to be presented in parliament . <p> As the book Travesty by John Laughland shows , in the case of the International Court of Justice for Former Yugoslavia , in the West 's eagerness to prosecute , this court was illegally constituted and its judgments found wanting . Some who have been prosecuted have been exonerated , but too late , for they died while incarcerated . <p> In this context , it seems unethical and a crass political expediency for the government to bring this bill to parliament on the 21st of this month , sandwiched between the 20th amendment ( Sept 20th ) and the tabling of the consolidated Steering Committee report on the Constitution ( Sept 22nd ) . <p> If the really existing Opposition is unable to successfully appeal for postponement , they should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It may be unusual procedure since we have already signed the convention . But since the convention itself allows amendments to it with the support of two thirds of the state parties , I do n't see why a parliament which was not consulted when the convention was signed by the Sri Lankan Foreign Ministry , should meekly accede to it without proper consideration of our national interest . It is for this purpose that we have sent our representatives to parliament . The least they can do is to declare its opposition and enter its reservations into the ratification to properly reflect the position of the people of this country . <p> At least some of us citizens do n't want this government to use this convention to eliminate the competition that it clearly can not overcome at an election . <p> The writer is author of ' MISSION IMPOSSIBLE-GENEVA : Sri Lanka 's Counter-Hegemonic Asymmetric Diplomacy at the UN Human Rights Council ' , published by Vijitha Yapa and now available at the International Book Fair , BMICH . <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

@@20553231 <p> The Least Cost Long Term Generation Expansion Plan 2018-2037 ( LCLTGEP ) is one of the key tools that the Commission uses <p> Today the argument that coal is cheap is no longer valid in the light of rapidly reducing renewable energy prices <p> After obtaining public views on the submitted LCLTGEP , PUCSL requested CEB to prepare 12 different scenarios with updated fuel prices <p> The Dailymirror conducted an interview with Director General of the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka ( PUCSL ) Damitha Kumarasinghe to obtain his views on the future of power generation in Sri Lanka and the current crisis in the power sector.The following are excerpts of the interview . <p> Q Energy experts predict that Sri Lanka will face a power crisis by 2019 as the existing power plants in operation would n't be sufficient to meet the demand for power by then . How are you , as the regulator of power supply and generation , going to tackle this problem ? <p> A power crisis can be triggered or instigated by either an energy shortfall or capacity shortfall . The former is determined by the availability of energy resource ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter relates to the availability of power plants . When we consider 2019 , the forecast peak demand will be 2,903 MW and the energy requirement will be 16,188 GWh . So without new additions of plants , we will be short of a generation capacity of about 300MW in 2019 . <p> However , there are a number of new power plants in the Long Term generation expansion plan approved by the Commission . This includes 3 furnace oil plants with a total capacity of 320MWs , that will be in operation within 2018 , and another 300MW Natural gas power plant that will be operating by 2019 . <p> PUCSL has approved these plants and have included them in the Commission approved generation plan . CEB has reiterated its commitment to implement these plants on time following the recommendations of a Sectoral Oversight Committee in Parliament . In addition to this , more than 450MW of renewable energy is expected to be added to the system in 2018 and 2019 . Therefore , I believe in terms of generation capacity , we are adequately covered for 2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning , is implemented on time . <p> The availability of energy resource is the other aspect of the problem . What I have said above is based on a conservative yet reasonable assumption of rainfall . Special emphasis should be given by all stakeholders to ensure the fuel availability of all thermal power plants -- coal , oil , and natural gas . Natural gas infrastructure would be available on time along with a secure fuel supply chain . Based on this condition , I can say that there is no imminent power crisis in 2019 . This again emphasizes on the importance of the construction and connectivity of power plants in keeping with the long term generation plan . <p> Q At a time when many other countries in the world -- the developed nations in particular - are in the process of phasing out coal power generation , why have you included a 600 MW coal power plant in your Long Term Generation Expansion Plan ( LTEGP 2018 -- 2035 ) ? <p> Coal used to be the main source of energy in the past . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially the pricing of renewables and climate change . <p> I would like to highlight a few recent developments and the future direction in which other countries are heading in the energy front to understand the direction of the energy sector . <p> In April , 26 of the 28 member states in the European Union , represented by 3500 utilities , pledged that there would be no coal plants after 2020 . In Australia , the prices of coal power-especially ultra-super critical plants- became more expensive than the average wholesale cost of electricity . The authorities now find it difficult to sell electricity . Further , Indian coal plants are currently operating at an average plant factor below 60% . The lower cost of solar and the use of wind forces have contributed to the reduction of coal power plants in India . <p> Therefore , it is clear that renewable and natural gas based electricity is becoming cheaper than coal . This trend is most likely to be continued into the future . <p> Q Despite heavy protests , initiated by the public in the area together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plant ( LCPP ) in Puttalam , there is a powerful lobby to promote coal power generation in Sri Lanka . How do you see this ? <p> Construction work of the Lakvijaya Coal Plant began more than a decade ago . Then the debate was about cheap energy generated through coal and as opposed to environmental and health issues that it would create . But today that argument of coal being cheap is no longer valid in the light of rapidly reducing prices of renewable energy . The world is moving towards greener energy production at lower costs . <p> QEnergy experts opine fossil fuel deposits in the world will be exhausted in about three to four decades from now . If so what is your strategy for power generation beyond 2035 in a scenario where petroleum products are n't available or are fast depleting ? <p> The Commission 's decision regarding the Long Term Generation Expansion Plan clearly makes us target the generating 60% of the electricity needed by 2030 through renewable sources . Presently about 40% of the electricity is generated through renewable energy . Therefore the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This will ensure energy security , lower costs and also price stability regarding electricity . <p> In April , 26 of the 28 member states in the European Union , represented by 3500 utilities , pledged that there would be no coal plants after 2020 . In Australia , the prices of coal power-especially ultra-super critical plants- became more expensive than the average wholesale cost of electricity <p> Although the CEB is the only Transmission licensee , it is only one among several other licence holders . Hence it 's not proper to approve all future generation projects on the basis of a forecast prepared by one of the licencees <p> Q Major motor car production companies in the US , Japan and EU will not produce fossil fuel powered motor vehicles after 2040 . Are we ready for the full electrification of our transport system in four decades ? <p> One of the objectives of producing electric vehicles is to reduce emissions from combustion engines . To achieve this objective it is important to charge the batteries of these vehicles using renewable energy . As described earlier that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope that transportation can be electrified in the future . <p> QThe CEB Engineers ' Union charges that the PUCSL , the regulator of the power sector , is overstepping the powers vested in it and has approved an amended Least Cost Generation Expansion Plan which totally differs from what the CEB submitted for approval . <p> Initially the CEB had submitted its Base Case of LCLTGEP with two other fuel diversification scenarios . <p> This related to the plant capacity mix of the above 3 scenarios and PUCSL . <p> By comparing the " No Future Coal Power Development " Scenario , submitted by CEB and PUCSL Revised Case , it could be observed that plant capacity mixes of both scenarios are the same . The only difference of the above two options is that , CEB has only considered 300MW units of NG plants while PUCSL has considered both 300MW and 150MW units of NG plants during optimization . Also , PUCSL has found that the PUCSL 's revised case is cheaper than CEB Base Case . <p> After obtaining the public views on the submitted LCLTGEP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with updated fuel prices . Even one out of the 12 scenarios developed and submitted by CEB , in which both 300MW and 150MW units of NG plants are occupied , is very similar to the PUCSL Revised Case . <p> Q The CEB Engineers Union ( CEBEU ) are at odds with the PUCSL and maintains that you have overstepped your mandate and the LTGEP is illegal , hence it must not be accepted.Your comments ? <p> When fulfilling its obligation , carrying out its responsibilities and exercising its powers that are vested with the Commission under sections 43 ( 2 ) and 43 ( 8 ) of the Sri Lanka Electricity Act , the Commission ca n't discard obligations and responsibilities it is entrusted with under the provisions of both applicable statutes namely the and the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka Act No. 35 of 2002 ( PUCSL Act ) and the Sri Lanka Electricity Act No.20 of 2009 as amended ( SLEA ) and would like to highlight some of them as follows : <p> The responsibility of the Commission to secure that all demands for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ b ) of SLEA <p> The responsibility of the Commission that a coordinated efficient and economical system of electricity supply is provided for and maintained throughout Sri Lanka - Sec 3(2) of SLEA <p> The responsibility of the Commission to promote efficiency in both the operations and capital investment in public utilities industries- Section 14 ( 2 ) ( c ) of the PUCSL Act <p> The responsibility of the Commission to promote an efficient allocation of resources in public utilities industries - Section14 ( 2 ) ( d ) of the PUCSL Act . <p> To receive general policy guidelines formulated by the Cabinet of Ministers in consultation with the Minister in charge of the public utility industry - Section 30 ( 1 ) of the PUCSL Act <p> Further it 's a function of the Commission to make consultations to the extent the Commission considers it is appropriate for any persons or group of persons who may be affected or are likely to be affected by the decisions of the Commission . Section 17 ( b ) of the PUCSL Act <p> The Least Cost Long Term Generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key tools that the Commission uses to exercise its legal mandate and to fulfill its obligations . <p> The decision making process on approving the LTGEP involves considering many other facets including the Commission 's responsibility to secure ; all electricity demands of the country are met , the availability and continuity of electricity supply , considering the views of stake holders , efficiency in both the operations and capital investment to name a few . Although the CEB is the only Transmission licensee , it is only one among several other licence holders . Hence it 's inconsistent and not proper to approve all future generation projects on the basis of a forecast prepared by one of the licencees . The revised case was n't arrived at on its own by the Commission , but was due to a decision arrived at after giving due considerations to all aspects that are essential towards fulfilling its obligations , as vested by the relevant statutes . <p> The CEB ( Transmission Licensee ) ca n't maintain a position of non-acceptance of the approved plan as per the provisions of the SLEA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Commission . <p> Q The CEBEU had recently accused the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management of manipulating the PUCSL into submission . What do you have to say about this charge ? To what extent are you bound by the decisions taken at the CCEM ? <p> PUCSL 's decision document on the Long Term Generation Plan clearly states the basis of the decision . Explanations on all assumptions and the commission 's view on all stakeholder comments are also provided . This decision was taken after a lengthy and extensive public consultation process . Energy experts , Environmentalists , Economists , Sociologists , Investors , Licensees and other stakeholders including the general public have expressed their views on the generation plan . Generation planning is n't merely a technical exercise , but requires economic , environmental , social , financial inputs . So participants with wider expertise in the decision making process is important . We brought in a wider range of views through a public consultation process . <p> Therefore , PUCSL being manipulated in the process of decision making does n't arise . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly makes us target the generating 60% of the electricity needed by 2030 through renewable sources .

We are looking at a generation mix of 55%-60% renewable , 20%-25% Natural Gas and 15%-20% coal by 2030 . The Government 's objective of achieving self-sufficiency in power generation by 2030 is set to be achieved through renewables and natural gas . Therefore over the next decade we should look at developing renewable energy and natural gas .

@@20553233 <p> There is broad consensus that women 's empowerment underpins the success of the new 2030 Agenda for Development ( also known as the Sustainable Development Goals ) . While gender equality itself constitutes one of the seventeen development goals ( Goal 5 ) , it is widely acknowledged that the empowerment of women and girls is an important prerequisite for the realisation of all other goals , including the reduction of poverty ( Goal 1 ) , inequality ( Goal 10 ) and the promotion of inclusive and sustainable economic growth through decent work for all ( Goal 8 ) . <p> This new development agenda also has an important focus on unpaid care work . Accordingly , target 5.4 of the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) calls upon nations to ' recognize and value unpaid care and domestic work through the provision of public services , infrastructure , and the promotion of shared responsibility within the household and the family ' <p> Unpaid care work -- which refers to all unpaid services provided within a household for its members , including care of persons , domestic chores and voluntary community work -- is an area that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work was considered to be ' women 's work ' , performed in the ' private sphere ' , for the benefit of ' loved ones ' . Because women take on unpaid care work in their capacity as mothers , grandmothers and wives , it is assumed that their labour is motivated by factors other than financial reward . Although this analysis holds true , it ignores a more pertinent point : traditional norms and customs assign care work to women irrespective of their willingness or ability to undertake unpaid care work . This is best evidenced by the fact that women who are engaged in paid employment still bear the responsibility for taking care of the household and the family . <p> The inclusion of unpaid care work as a target in the 2030 Development Agenda therefore marks an important watershed in the recognition and valuation of this type of work . It has shed light on the immense economic value of unpaid care work and , more significantly , prompted an important conversation on women 's contributions to the global economy . <p> The gendered distribution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals and households , as well as for economic development in a country . It has a direct effect on labour market outcomes , particularly with respect to women 's labour force participation , wage distribution , and job quality . It also has direct , negative impacts on the health and well-being of women . It is in light of this revelation that Diane Elson , professor of Economics at the University of Essex , developed the 3R Framework , which calls on countries to Recognise , Reduce and Redistribute unpaid care work in the economy . This framework has now been widely adopted by the international development community , including the United Nations and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , as an effective strategy to empower women as economic actors . However , many countries continue to exclude unpaid care work from their policy agendas . <p> Sri Lanka too remains blind to all but paid , visible forms of women 's economic contribution . This has led to significant gaps in economic policymaking and governance . Outlined below are the some of the reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and domestic work in the economy . <p> Increase female labour force participation : The gender gap in unpaid care work has significant implications for women 's ability to actively participate in the labour force . Unpaid care work shapes the duration , quality , and type of paid work that women can to undertake . For every hour that a woman spends on domestic chores , she foregoes the opportunity to engage in the labour market or to invest in educational activities . In many respects , unpaid care work is the missing link that influences gender gaps in labour outcomes . Therefore , in countries like Sri Lanka , where female labour force participation is low , redistribution of care work could help to increase women 's participation in the labour force . <p> While anecdotal evidence may highlight the inherent gender disparities in unpaid care and domestic work in Sri Lanka , the country lacks comprehensive data to inform policymaking . At present , Sri Lanka does not conduct any nationally representative time-use surveys , which could effectively capture the distribution of care work between men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is vital to informing policies that would reduce the burden of care work on women and redistribute domestic responsibilities among men and other institutional actors in the economy . Sri Lanka should further consider the need to improve policy readiness to achieve the SDGs . If the country hopes to stay on track , it must work immediately to address the issue of unpaid care work -- a target that is indispensable to the attainment of Goal 5 of the SDGs.

The follow up action by the Navy resulted in the Indian Peace Keeping Force ( IPKF ) , that came to Sri Lanka as peace keepers , to monitor the truce between Sri Lankan Forces and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam ( LTTE ) , ending up fighting the LTTE . <p> The incident -- later named ' Cyanide Drama ' -- not only ended the truce , but also changed Indian policy towards the LTTE and finally it claimed the life of former Indian Prime Minister , Rajiv Gandhi . <p> Inside facts of that interesting episode were never revealed until much later and the research article written by this columnist was published in the book Broken Palmyra as Annexure 1 . <p> The facts were gathered after talking to many people including the Tigers , the IPKF officers and senior Sri Lankan military officials and a senior minister . <p> According to reliable sources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IPKF .

Navy personnel saw a fast boat trying to cross over to Sri Lankan waters . They gave chase and caught up with it . When they approached the boat , the sailors saw the mounted gun and realized it was a vessel carrying LTTE cadres . As a truce was in effect after the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement of 29 July 1987 , the Navy did not shoot at the boat , and when they ordered the seventeen Tigers in the boat to surrender , they did so without a fight . <p> But the Navy did not know they had a prize catch until they brought the prisoners and the huge stock of arms found in the boat to Kankesanthurai Port , where LTTE Colonel , Pulendran was recognized by a soldier .

According to the then LTTE spokesman , Dilip Yogi , the Tigers did not protest because they thought they would be released as there was a general amnesty . <p> Brigadier ( later promoted to Major General ) Jayaratne immediately informed his superiors and he was told that a special plane would be sent to bring them to Colombo . By then , the Tigers had come to know about the arrest of their colleagues and they requested the IPKF Commander , General Rodriguez , to get them released as the Government of Sri Lanka granted a general amnesty to Tamil militants . <p> Sending prisoners to Colombo <p> General Rodriguez asked Brigadier Jayaratne either to release them or hand them over to the IPKF . After speaking to his superiors in Colombo , Jayaratne informed his Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he agreed to allow a few LTTE leaders , including their theoretician , Dr. Anton Balasingham , to visit the prisoners . <p> The IPKF chief wanted to keep some Indian soldiers to guard the prisoners and Brigadier Jayaratne agreed to allow the Indians to stand about 10 yards behind the Lankan troops guarding the prisoners . <p> Realizing that the prisoners will not be released , the LTTE swung into action . Within a short time , more than 3,000 women and children arrived at the Palali Camp , demonstrated , and demanded the release of the seventeen prisoners . <p> Rodriguez , who was under tremendous pressure from Balasingham , walked into Brigadier Jayaratne 's makeshift office at Palali and once again demanded the release of the LTTE cadres .

@@20896233 <h> Is Rahul Gandhi Making BJP Nervous <p> The violent reaction in the BJP camp to some of the utterances of Rahul Gandhi , the long written off vice president of the Congress , during his recent US visit should come as a surprise . Has he started to make the ruling dispensation and its social media gladiators and Bhakts nervous ? <p> It will seem to suggest so considering how the BJP had to deploy an army of ministers , senior leaders and combative spokespersons to ' hit back ' at him after every speech that he made on the American soil where the BJP mascot and prime minister , Narendra Modi , had reportedly become a ' rock star ' after his two much publicized visits in the past two previous years . <p> Of course , any realistic analysis will rule out an early turnaround in the fortunes of Rahul Gandhi or his party , no matter how impressed his US audience -- particularly the people of Indian origin -- were by his style of direct and frank dialogue . <p> But perhaps that is what made the BJP uncomfortable . He was able to carry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reportedly wooed convincingly . In the US ( and the UK ) , Modi was backed by the rich Gujarati diaspora which had an impact on their brethren at home . Now , it appears , some of them are moving away from Modi and , horror or horror , turning to Rahul Gandhi . <p> It could well be that a fellow US-based Gujarati NRI , ' Sam ' ( Satyanarayan Gangaram ) Pitroda , was able to win over sections of the Gujarati diaspora in the US and line them up behind Rahul Gandhi . Late Rajiv Gandhi had ' discovered ' the telecom entrepreneur whose help had catapulted India into the front rank of the IT world . <p> After his first two visits to the US , Modi was projected as a larger than life political figure who could count the likes of US President among his admirers , not to speak of the rich and effervescent ' Desis ' in the US who undoubtedly played a big role in creating a halo round Modi . His spin doctors failed to point out that the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Modi had cast over Indians when he was ' rocking ' in the US . <p> Another mistake made by Modi 's fans was that the so-called positive vibes between Indian and US administration officials does not mean that the Indian diaspora will take its cue from what the US President or some other senior dignitary says about the Indian prime minister . President Barack Obama held Man Mohan Singh in high esteem but that did not prevent Indians , either at home or in the US , from rejecting him . <p> In the exclusive BJP world , Narendra Modi is seen as a Goliath-like political figure with a ' 56-inch ' chest though his height is considerably less than that of the Biblical figure 's 9 feet 6 inches ( Hebrew text ) who can not be felled . <p> Sure , there was David but it will be stretching things a bit too far to relate the David and Goliath story to the Modi versus Rahul Gandhi fight . All that can be said at the moment is that for the BJP it can be an uncomfortable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The BJP would reject the thought . But the manner in which it jumps to attack Rahul Gandhi indicates a degree of nervousness . Could it be that the rush to ' hit back ' may be attributed to a famous Modi speak . Quoting a ' Christian ' scientist without naming him , he said ' to every reaction there is an equal and opposite reaction ' . <p> But the question is why should the BJP take notice of whatever Rahul Gandhi says and ' hits back ' when in BJP 's opinion he is no threat at all ? One guess is that while the BJP is able to ensure that Rahul Gandhi gets only unfavourable notice within India with the party 's social media warriors constantly attacking and ridiculing him , the foreign media and audiences have ' let down ' the BJP . <p> Word has reached Indian shores that the American audiences and members of the ' think tank ' fraternity who listened to him did not find Rahul Gandhi talking like an idiot . He raised issues and questions that are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention in public space within the country . <p> It is not that the American audiences were totally unaware of what he was saying . Much as the ruling dispensation would like the countrymen and women to believe that India under Modi continues to be presented in positive light abroad the fact is that over the last two years there has been a lot of critical reporting on India , especially the many gross instances of ' intolerance ' . <p> The US disappointment over Modi 's failure to ' open up ' the Indian economy is widespread . India can no longer boast about being the ' fastest ' economy . The ease of doing business is more in the government propaganda machine than on the ground . The failure to accelerate the job market may not be of direct concern to the outside world but it adds to the belief that the economy is not on the right track . <p> Instead of paying attention to the drawbacks in policies , the government treats criticism in foreign media the way it treats Rahul Gandhi 's criticism . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it further lowers the country 's image . <p> A case in point is a famous ' rebuttal ' by the government when an American paper took a closer look at some of the problems related to religious intolerance and human rights in India . The publicity department of the government , in its ' reaction ' , sought to teach lessons in human rights to the outside world while totally failing to make out a convincing case in its defence . <p> By now it is becoming clear that Modi pays only lip service to various acts and statements by his party members , including those occupying high positions that actually weaken the country and tar its image .

I was never asked to do so and was told that there was no necessity " <p> ASG De Livera was of the view that it was a mandatory requirement of a person who was serving in a corporation and the oath would reflect on serving the country faithfully . <p> ASG De Livera : I suggest to you that you never took an oath . And it was a grave omission with regard to the post you held in the country <p> Witness : Ca n't answer on that . <p> ASG : You had no intention of serving the country but only yourself and the son-in-law . <p> Witness : Completely disagree . <p> ASG De Livera thereafter moved to the February 27 , 2015 incident and questioned again about the auction process . <p> ASG De Livera : You walked into the Public Debt Department ( PDD ) twice on that day . And on the second visit to the PDD , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ananda Silva ) . So you called them did n't you ? <p> W : It was a collective decision to go to the PDD <p> ASG : These two Deputy Governors gave evidence before this Commission in contradiction to your stance and would there be any reason for them to lie ? <p> W : That I do n't know . I did n't call them . It was a collective decision . <p> It was revealed that Mr. Mahendran , Dr. Weerasinghe ( Dep . Gov . ) , Ananda Silva ( Dep . Gov . ) , Mrs. Muthugala ( Superintendent of PDD ) , Dr Aasim and Ms. Srimali ( official of PDD ) were present at the PDD when the decision was discussed regarding the auction around 12.30 pm on February 27 , 2015 after the auction floor was closed . <p> ASG De Livera was of the view that Dr. Aasim and Mr. Mahendran had an argument with regard to the acceptance volume of the bids . ASG Livera said that Dr Aasim had informed Mr. Mahendran about the PDD 's recommendation of only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mr. Mahendran however said that there was no argument took place at that moment and it was only a counter proposal of Rs. 2.6 billion to be raised through the auction and rest of the money to be raised through Direct Placement Method . ( fund requirement of the time was amounting to Rs. 13.5 billion by March 2 ) <p> I was skeptical about the PDD 's capacity . So , I said if I were you I would have accepted Rs.10.05 billion from the auction and walked away . It was a civil argument " , Mahendran said . <p> It was explained that after the suggestion by Mr. Mahendran , the PDD had prepared another option sheet recommending Rs. 10 billion to the Tender Board ( TB ) , where the final approval would be given before the Governor 's signature . <p> After a series of questions , ASG Livera suggested to the witness that he had directed the PDD to first accept Rs. 20 billion and after the discussion at the PDD , he reduced that amount to Rs. 10 billion . <p> However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so , because he had only made the suggestion to the PDD considering the huge government fund requirement at that time . <p> ASG : You prevented PDD officials from making an independent recommendation to the Tender Board and you prevented them making a recommendation of Rs. 2.6 billion , which they considered as appropriate , right ? <p> W : I never prevented them <p> ASG : The recommendation ( Rs. 10 billion ) of yours sent to the Tender Board had no economic basis , was n't it ? <p> W : Disagree . <p> At this moment , Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned the witness . <p> Justice Prasanna Jyawardena : You became aware about the PDD recommendation of Rs. 2.6 billion after visiting the PDD for the second time , right ? <p> Witness : Yes . Dr Asim told me about it holding an option sheet . <p> J : Subsequently , another option sheet had been prepared recommending Rs. 10 billion which is similar to your suggestion or the direction as the ASG said . <p> W : Yes <p> J : The second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rs. 2.6 billion option sheet was precisely what you suggested to the PDD , right ? <p> W : I ca n't say precisely on the first option sheet and ca n't say the option sheet reflect someone 's view . <p> Justice Chitrasiri at this moment asked : The PDD would have recommended only Rs. 2.6 billion if you would n't have suggested such an amount , right ? <p> Witness went on to explain what made him to suggest Rs. 10 billion in the backdrop of the Government 's urgent fund requirement . <p> Justice Jayawardena : There was an option sheet recommending Rs. 2.6 by the PDD and another option sheet thereafter recommending Rs. 10.05 billion , which coincide with your suggestion , right ? <p> W : Yes <p> ASG Dappula De Livera : You initially suggested to the PDD to accept Rs. 20 billion ( all bids at the auction ) without knowing or verifying the rates at which the bids had been placed at the auction . <p> W : I only asked , can we take Rs. 20 billion . <p> ASG : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 billion at any cost and you were not considered about the rate but only at fixing the auction . <p> Witness Mahendran completely rejected that stance . <p> It was explained that after the discussion at the PDD around 12.30pm on February 27 , 2015 , Mr. Mahendran had visited his daughter 's residence at Flower Road to have lunch and had returned around 2.00 p.m . <p> It was revealed that at this moment the Tender Board ( TB ) meeting had taken place regarding the bond auction at the CBSL and Mr. P. Samarasiri had chaired it . <p> During the deliberations of the meeting Mr. Samarasiri had telephoned Mr. Mahendran questioning about the situation and at that moment the witness said he was in the car . <p> Mr. Samarasiri said that TB members indicated to him about the suggestion made by me regarding the acceptance of Rs. 10 billion . So I told him about the reasons that made me take that decision " , the witness said . <p> The witness while explaining said that there was a miscalculation by the PDD with regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that made him suggest to accept Rs. 20 billion . <p> ASG De Livera : So , you told him to take Rs. 10 billion ? <p> Witness : I did n't direct him . I told that it was reasonable . <p> When questioned , the witness was of the view that Mr. P. Samarasiri had not conveyed to him about any disagreement among the members of the Tender Board over the acceptance of Rs. 10 billion nor conveyed about the request made by the members seeking an immediate meeting with the Governor . <p> ASG Dappula De Livera : I suggest to you that Mr. P. Samarasiri and you connived to prevent the Tender Board members from changing the decision . <p> Witness totally rejected that stance . <p> ASG De Livera thereafter moved the questioning to a new area and asked about the governments Rs. 75 billion fund requirement discussed at a meeting held on February 26 , 2015 with Ministers Ravi Karunanayake , Kabeer Hashim , Prime Minister 's Advisor at that time Malik Samarawickrame and other RDA officials . <p> However , the witness also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fund requirement which was discussed at that meeting on February 26 , 2015 . <p> At this moment , ASG De Livera intensively objecting to the witness ' stance said that he had never mentioned about a Rs. 15 billion fund requirement in his previous testimony . The ASG was of the view that it was he who drew the attention over the remark made by the Prime Minister in Parliament on March 2015 , stating about a funding requirement of Rs. 15 billion . <p> ASG De Livera was of the view that earlier the witness had stated about an urgent fund requirement of Rs. 75 billion and had submitted documentary evidence in a letter given by the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake , to the Commission which reflects a Rs. 75 billion money requirement . <p> The ASG said that even the then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake had not mentioned about a Rs. 15 billion urgent requirement before the Commission . ASG De Livera said the witness was contradicting his own evidence at the moment . <p> However , Mr. Mahendran said there was a halt in road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the February 26 meeting the ' economic research department ' officials had suggested a Rs. 15 billion requirement to start those paused projects immediately . <p> Justice Prasanna Jyawardena questioned at this moment : However that was the funding requirement for the March of 2015 and not an immediate requirement in February 2015 , right ? <p> Witness : Yes <p> ASG Dappula De Livera questioning the witness suggested that there was no single word reflected in the statement given by the witness to the first COPE ( D.E.W . Gunasekara ) regarding such an urgent fund requirement . <p> ASG : You did not utter a single word about an urgent fund requirement to this COPE ? <p> W : I have to check about that . <p> ASG : You had mentioned about neither a Rs. 15 billion nor a Rs. 75 billion urgent requirement any time in 2015 , right ? There was no such requirement . Your testimony is false . <p> W : Ca n't answer that without checking . <p> It was revealed that a Cabinet sub committee meeting took place on February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Prime Minister , Ravi Karunanayake , Kabeer Hashim , Dr Harha de Silva , Saman Ekanayake , Dr Samaratunge ( Secretary to the Treasury ) and other RDA officials , where matters relating to road development projects were also discussed . <p> ASG De Livera submitting the minutes of that meeting said : These minutes say that all RDA projects should be prioritized with the available funds . So there was no decision taken at that meeting regarding an urgent fund requirement " <p> However , the witness was of the view that the minutes would not state what was exactly discussed at the meeting . <p> At this moment ASG De Livera brought out the minutes of another meeting held at Temple Trees with the same people on March 3 , 2015 . He said that even in that meeting such urgent fund requirement for RDA projects had not been discussed . <p> The ASG was of the view that the witness was unable to support his stance with other evidence except the document provided as AM 22 , which was given to him by the then Finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2015 . <p> After a short adjournment of yesterday 's proceedings , ASG De Livera questioned Mr. Mahendran again about the urgent fund requirement of Rs. 15 billion . <p> ASG De Livera : This Rs. 15 billion is a magical figure was n't it ? <p> W : Ca n't see any magic in it . <p> ASG : At the February 27 auction , it was only Rs. 1 billion that was advertised and somehow your son-in-law 's company bid 15 times more than the advertised amount , right ? <p> ASG : And PTL had bid 15 billion at the auction , which is 75% of the total bids , right ? <p> W : Yes <p> ASG : So , do n't you think this Rs. 15 billion is a magical figure ? <p> W : No <p> ASG : As a stand alone Primary Dealer , how would he have this information ? <p> W : I ca n't answer for him <p> ASG : Would you consider this practice as unusual of a primary dealer ? <p> W : I told this earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rs. 15 billion were accepted . <p> ASG : So , Rs. 5 billion of PTL was ultimately accepted at the auction . When compared with the track record of PTL it was a lifetime achievement , was n't it ? <p> W : I do n't know about lifetime achievement . That was well within the permitted regulatory amounts . <p> ASG : Have you given a gift to Arjun Aloysius by providing price sensitive information ? <p> W : No <p> At this moment President 's Counsel Romesh De Silva observed that the ASG was denying about a requirement of a Rs. 15 billion at one point but contrary to that again he questioned about the Rs. 15 billion requirement relating to the Auction . <p> However , ASG De Livera said that the Commission was in the process of revealing the truth , so that he needs to question the witness . <p> During this questioning it was also revealed that there was a Criminal investigation initiated by the Criminal Investigation 's Department as well on the Bond issue . <p> When questioned it was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never initiated an internal inquiry regarding the February 27 , 2015 auction . According to the witness , when the ' Pitipana Committee ' was appointed by the Prime Minister to scrutinize the incident Mr. Mahendran had voluntarily kept away from his position until the investigation was over . <p> ASG De Livera and the Commission thereafter questioned the witness regarding the decision to stop the use of the ' Direct Placement Method ' . <p> According to the witness , the Prime Minister had been instructing him to have a transparent process in CBSL matters since his appointment as the Governor in January , 2015 . <p> Mr. Mahendran said he interpreted that this transparency should include the procurement process at the CBSL as well . <p> The witness said yesterday that on February 24 , 2015 , the Prime Minister precisely advised him to stop direct placement and raise funds through public auctions only . <p> And thereafter , on February 27 , 2015 , 12.30 p.m . Mr. Mahendran had decided to stop raising money through the direct placement method and told the PDD to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auction floor was closed . This auction was however , initially advertised for only Rs. 1 billion and the raising of other money was expected to be done through direct placements . <p> During a series of questions , Justice Prasanna Jayawardena asked the witness : Be careful of facts of your evidence . According to you the Prime Minister wanted public auctions in so many words , right ? <p> W : Yes <p> Justice Jayawardena : And you conveyed this to the PDD on February 27 , 2015 ? <p> W : Yes <p> J : Did the Prime Minister tell you about the complaints received by him from Primary Dealers regarding Direct Placements ? <p> W : Yes <p> J : Who were those Primary Dealers ? <p> W : That I did n't know <p> The witness was of the view that he was told by the Prime Minister at the meeting held on February 24 , 2015 to stop the direct placement method . <p> It was revealed that there was a Monetary Board meeting on February 23 , 2015 and another on March 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to implement the policy decision to stop the Direct Placement method , it had to go through the Monetary Broad . <p> However , on this occasion , Mr. Mahendran had decided about stopping direct placements on February 27 , 2015 and then obtained the approval of the Monetary Board later on March 6 , 2015 . <p> ASG De Livera questioning the witness contested that there was no decision taken by the Monetary Board with regard to the Direct Placement method on March 6 , 2015 . <p> However , the witness was of the view that there was no objection raised at that meeting held on March 6 and rejected the ASG 's stance saying that there was another occasion in June , 2015 where , the Monetary Board did not re-instate the Direct Placement method . <p> At this point , Justice Prasanna Jayawardena questioned the witness . <p> Justice Jayawardena : You have said that you and the Prime Minister were having discussions over the removal of the Direct Placement method ? <p> W : Yes <p> J : So , why did n't you discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 23 ? <p> Witness was silent for a while and said Yes I did not talk about it at that meeting " <p> During Justice Jayawardena 's further questioning it was revealed that the witness had provided information to the Prime Minister continuously regarding shortfalls of the Direct Placement Method and then based on that instruction , the Prime Minister had decided to stop DPM on February 24 , 2015 . <p> However , ASG De Livera also submitting the Minutes of the February 24 , 2015 cabinet sub committee meeting said that the minutes reflect no decision regarding the Direct Placement Method at that meeting . <p> The witness said Minutes are very sketchy . I would say that what transpired at the meeting are not reflected in the minutes " <p> You are lying again " , ASG said <p> I 'm not " , said the witness . <p> ASG : According to your evidence , you were privy to this information ( about the stoppage of Direct Placement Method ) from February 24 , 2015 , right ? <p> W : Yes <p> ASG : And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? <p> W : Yes <p> ASG : Would it be correct to say that it was you who conveyed this vital information to Arjun Aloysius before the auction ? <p> W : Not at all . <p> ASG : And that information enabled Aloysius to succeed in the auction . <p> W : Totally disagree . I would not have done such a foolish thing destroying my carrier after having an experience in the field for years . <p> ASG : You never expected to testify before this Commission , would n't you ? <p> W : Since my appointment , I was well aware about this issue and therefore I had to work always in arms length with Aloysius . I never discussed matters with my Son-in-law . <p> ASG : You , daughter and son-in-law , Aloysius , lived in the same house at flower road , right ? <p> W : Yes <p> ASG : So , when did you got your appointment as the Governor ? <p> W : January 23,2015 <p> ASG : At that time Aloysius was the CEO of Perpetual Treasuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know <p> ASG : Do n't you know about what your Son-in-law does ( asked in a sarcastic manner ) <p> W : No <p> After a series of questions , the witness said that he was unaware about the ownership of the companies relating to the PTL but knew about who were running the Company . <p> ASG : Aloysius resigned from his position as the CEO on January 16 , 2015 , and that is well before your appointment right ? <p> W : He told me something to that effect . Even though my appointment was given on January 23 , it was communicated to me a week before . <p> ASG : That was not known to the General Public . So , how would Aloysius have known it ? <p> W : I would have told them <p> ASG : You told him , right ? <p> W : Yes <p> ASG De Livera in a sarcastic manner quipped at this moment that it tells that you have been telling him things quite earlier since January 2015 " <p> The witness was of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and him , he maintained an arms length distance in his CBSL matters with Aloysius as there was also speculation in Media with regard to that interest at that time . <p> ASG : Why did Aloysius resign from PTL ? <p> W : That I ca n't answer . <p> ASG : So , considering the potential conflict of interest , why did n't you decline the position as the Governor ? <p> W : I talked about this matter with others too and subject to the proviso that I would do my activities keeping an arms length , I continued . <p> ASG : So , the Prime Minister agreed to your stance and continued with the post , having known the conflict of interest , right ? <p> W : Not only the PM other Ministers also agreed to it . <p> ASG : So , having known the fact that you would have to approve the Tender Board decisions on bids and having known the fact that you would be the regulatory supervisor regarding the bond auction , you still continued to hold the position as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , I practiced the arms length distance in my activities as the Governor of CBSL . <p> ASG : Show us what your arms length would be like . <p> Witness raised his hand and the court room burst out in laughter . <p> Justice Prasanna Jayawardena at this moment made an observation in relation to the revelation that transpired during the previous proceedings . <p> Justice Jayawardena considering that two wrong doings do n't ' make it right , said that there was also an incident where former Governor Cabral 's sister happened to be a director of PTL in 2014 . <p> The Justice also said that this has happened in the past and that past practice should not be an excuse for what happens in the future . <p> Justice Jayawardena also quipped : Wonder whether Nivard Cabral and his sister lived in the same house too " <p> Questioning the witness on his relationship with Aloysius , ASG De Livera questioned the witness whether he had ever disclosed about the relationship to the CBSL . The ASG was of the view that Mr. Mahendran had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the witness said that he could prove that he did . <p> Justice Jayawardena finally asked the witness . <p> J : You saw potential conflict of interest , right ? <p> W : Yes <p> J : And maintained an arms length due to that <p> W : Yes <p> J : Despite all other things , do you think it was appropriate to live in the same house with Aloysius , who was a primary dealer . <p> W : Yes . I never consider it bad , because in my family we do n't talk about such matters with each other . <p> When Justice Jayawardena asked about comparable incidents where he and his family ever worked with potential conflict of interest , earlier the witness was of the view that when he was working at the HSBC bank in Singapore his daughter was an analyst in an investment company while his son was an employee at the KPMG audit firm . <p> Justice Jayawardena : Are you really telling that these two instances are comparable to living with a Primary Dealer while being the Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the yesterday 's proceedings Justice Jayawardena observed that the Commission was concerned about the time constraints and therefore would like to finish its proceedings by next week considering the importance of writing the report .

@@20896237 <p> Abandoning the Foremost place given to BuddhismPosted on October 3rd , 2017 <h> Courtesy Ceylon Today <p> The Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly of Sri Lanka submitted its interim report to the Constitutional Assembly on 21 September 2017 . When the report was presented , the Prime Minister and the Members of Parliament representing the Government stated that their constitutional proposals have not deviated from the foremost place given to Buddhism . <p> This interim report however proposes two alternative provisions to the existing Article 9 of the Constitution . The proposed alternative provisions are reproduced below : <p> n Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana , while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Article 10 and 14(1) ( e ) . <p> OR <p> n Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana , while treating all religions and beliefs with honour and dignity , and without discrimination , and guaranteeing to all persons the fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative proposal looks very similar to the present Article 9 , it may be noted that the words " Republic of Sri Lanka " in Article 9 is changed to " Sri Lanka " . It is obvious that this amendment has a sinister motive . The existing Article 9 states that it is the duty of the " Republic of Sri Lanka " to give foremost place to Buddhism to enable State patronage being given to Buddhism . <p> The removal of the word " Republic " will necessarily do away with the State 's responsibility to give Buddhism the foremost place . <p> Thus the meaning it will then convey is that although in Sri Lanka Buddhism has the foremost place , the Government of the Republic of Sri Lanka is not obliged to treat Buddhism as being given the foremost place . <p> The second alternative provision asserts that other religions should not be treated differently . It is impossible to give Buddhism the foremost place without treating other religions differently . It is obvious that this is an attempt to alter the meaning of Article 9 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unitary status to federal <p> There is no doubt that these proposals have the effect of changing the unitary character of Sri Lanka.The Constitution includes a clear provision to ensure the unitary character of the State since 1972 . In 1978 , the 2nd Republican Constitution was enacted without any alteration to this provision . For the past 45 years , these provisions have remained without change . <p> Under both the First and the Second Republican Constitutions , Sri Lanka 's Government structure is described in Article 2 as " " Q z ? Y ? cpycx A ? x y ? c ? x . " " . In the English version of the Constitution it is described as ? Republic of Sri Lanka is a Unitary State. ? The proposed alternatives seek to replace the word ' Unitary State ' in the English version of the Constitution with the Sinhala and Tamil words ' aekiya rajya/orumiththanadu ' . <p> The provisions proposed to be included in the English version of the Constitution are as follows : <p> n Sri Lanka ( Ceylon ) is a free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consisting of the institutions of the Centre and of the provinces which shall exercise power as laid down in the Constitution . <p> In this Article aekiya rajya/orumiththanadu means a State which is undivided and indivisible , and in which the power to amend the Constitution , or to repeal and replace the Constitution , shall remain with the Parliament and the People of Sri Lanka as provided in this Constitution . <p> The Tamil version of the present constitution uses the term ' Ottriachchi ' which gives the meaning ' unitary ' to describe the ' unitary ' nature of the State . The constitutional proposals of the government have used the word ' orumiththanadu ' instead of the word ' outriachchi ' . The word ' orumiththanadu ' means ' united ' ( federal ) , ' otteriachchi ' means ' unitary ' . It is important to note that the Constitution does not provide , unlike in ordinary statutes , that the Sinhala version shall prevail over the Tamil version of the Constitution . <p> Further , the constitutional proposals of the Steering Committee have given a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sinhala text . Accordingly , a Unitary State is called an indivisible State . A federal State is not necessarily a divisible State . Merely because a State can not be divided , it does not become a Unitary State . India can not be divided but it is a federal State . Adding a new meaning to the term ' unitary ' , saying that it means an ' indivisible State ' is simply an attempt to deviate from the accepted meaning of the English word ' unitary . ' <p> Sinhala text books written on Constitutional Law are few . Therefore , it is necessary to refer to English texts on Constitutional Law to understand the meaning of the term ' Unitary State ' . The term ' unitary ' is well explained in books written in English . Even our own Supreme Court described the meaning of this term unitary in the English language in the 13th Amendment determination . The term ' Unitary State ' has been removed from the English text for the purpose of giving a new meaning beyond the internationally recognized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of these alterations would be that when interpreting the Constitution of Sri Lanka the structure of the State shall be interpreted to mean a united state ( federal State ) . It seems that not only the alteration of the meanings of the Constitution is fraudulent it is also an attempt to mislead the Sinhala masses . <p> We regret to note that these fraudulent proposals have been made in contempt of the Sinhala people and is an insult to their intelligence . We must condemn the efforts made to conceal the true nature of these proposals made at the behest of various foreign forces . Therefore , we strongly urge thegovernment not to engage in such fraudulent machinations . <p> Amalgamation of the Northern and Eastern Provinces and other proposals made to alter the unitary character of Sri Lanka Among the proposals put forward is the proposal to amalgamate the Northern and Eastern Provinces with the objective of legalizing the false and fraudulent demand for a historical Tamil homeland pursued by Tamil separatists . <p> The removal of the concurrent list , the deprivation of the right of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointment of the Governor on the advice of the provincial board of ministers and vesting of State land and Police powers in the Provincial Councils is an apparent manifestation of the separatists ' agenda . <p> One would expect lawmakers to unite everyone in Sri Lanka under one banner . Proposal to create a " Praja Sabha " ( Community Council ) based on Ethnicity , Religion and Caste is certainly not a proposal to strengthen reconciliation . It is clear that these proposals have been made by separatists with a mindset to divide Sri Lanka . <p> The appointment of a TNA member , campaigning for a Federal State , as the chairman of the Centre-Periphery Relations Sub-committee and appointment of members with a federal mindset to the Steering Committee , and other committees , including experts affiliated to such sub-committee whilst ensuring that no patriots with a nationalist ideology are appointed shows that this whole exercise is a plan to pursue the needs of the separatists . <p> We express our deepest disappointment at the attempt to implement the 13th Amendment as presently constituted which provides for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council and to provide for the amalgamation of the Northern and Eastern Provinces . We would also like to point out that the advice given by the Maha Sangha on various occasions not to engage in such a distorted constitutional process has been ignored by the Government . We advise the Government and its leaders to dedicate themselves only to constitutional reform which would ensure the country 's development and that too to be implemented through a proper mechanism which sufficiently represents the majority of the people of the country , without opening the doors to secession . <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

Modi 's speech could be treated as an attempt to sow the seeds of another separatist movement in Sri Lanka . Further , Modi 's suggestion that the Plantation Tamil Community in Sri Lanka were upholding Indian culture would dissuade the community from integrating into Sri Lankan culture .

The outrage was near universal . Prime Minister Justin Trudeau wondered if this was a " bad April Fool 's joke . " The British called the appointment " surprising and disappointing . " Perhaps the only one surprised by the outcry was the embattled head of the WHO , Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus . <p> There are too many examples in recent history of the United Nations turning a blind eye on individuals and countries with appalling human rights records . <p> The United Nations Peacekeeping Conference taking place in Vancouver on Nov. 14 is a case in point . Many countries being invited to this conference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including war crimes , crimes against humanity , and genocide . One such country invited this year is the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka , whose military has a long record of rights violations . <p> According to the Associated Press , the Sri Lankan peacekeepers deployed to Haiti between 2004 and 2007 by the UN ran a sex ring operation with nine children , some as young as 12 . Some 134 members of the Sri Lankan military were implicated , with 114 of these men being returned to Sri Lanka by the UN without any consequences . <p> In 2013 , a young Haitian woman accused a Sri Lankan soldier of rape . The UN mandated the Sri Lankan military to investigate . Maj.-Gen . Jagath Dias was charged with investigating this incident . General Dias , who himself is alleged to have committed war crimes in Sri Lanka , reported back that the rape allegation was fabricated . He apparently did not even speak to the actual victim in the case . <p> But Sri Lanka 's record of violations of international law , nor the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Sri Lankan armed forces have been the subject of several United Nations investigations . In 2011 , the Panel of Experts appointed by then-Secretary General Ban Ki-moon concluded that allegations leveled against the Sri Lankan armed forces during the last phase of the war on the island in 2008 and 2009 , if proven , amounted to war crimes and crimes against humanity . <p> These include indiscriminate bombings of hospitals and no-fly zones , rape and sexual violence , violating the Geneva Convention by conducting summary executions of those who surrendered , enforced disappearances and more . In 2015 , the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights found the Sri Lankan military had indeed committed war crimes and crimes against humanity during the period of the war and beyond . <p> The Sri Lankan military continues to violate the rights of Tamils in the North and East of the island . The army occupies as much as 60,000 acres of civilian land just in the Mullaithivu district in Northern Sri Lanka , with massive camps that encroach on the daily lives of civilians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centre for Policy Research and People for Equality and Relief in Lanka ( PEARL ) , the Vanni region , where much of the civilian carnage took place , has one army personnel per two civilians . There are ongoing reports of torture , rape , and suppression of journalists and human rights defenders . <p> Notwithstanding any of these findings , the Sri Lankan government refuses to hold any military personnel accountable for these crimes . Sri Lankan President Maithiripala Sirisena has recently said that he would not prosecute a single soldier who fought for his country . The Sri Lankan legal system appears unwilling and unable to handle any of these international crimes . <p> On the other hand , the victims in Sri Lanka continue to live with the military intruding in their daily lives , while they search for justice . Similarly , the poor victims in Haiti are awaiting answers . <p> It is with this backdrop that Sri Lanka 's invitation to be part of this noble role as International Peacekeeper is very troubling .

While these are laudable goals and highlight the progress of the United Nations in addressing some of its previous failings , the question of Sri Lanka being invited to this table remains problematic . <p> Had Sri Lanka embraced a process of accountability and sought truth , a valid argument for engagement could have been made . By inviting Sri Lanka to take part in discussions on peacekeeping without substantive progress on accountability , the UN is validating the island nation on the world stage , thereby sending the message to other despotic leaders and rogue countries that they too could violate the rights of their people without consequences .

@@21624238 <h> Dilrook Kannangara <p> Racism has a new abode in Sri Lanka -- the budget . Mangala 's 2018 budget is all about taxing Sinhalese to pay Tamils . Budget proposes to ease the burden on war affected people " but it only proposes benefits for Tamils ! Sinhalese and Muslims were also affected by the war but they get nothing . Tamils in Jaffna continue to occupy land of evicted Sinhalese since 1977 and evicted Muslims since 1990 . This is new apartheid .

Sri Lanka as a developing nation can ill-afford electric and hybrid vehicles . Eventual beneficiaries are Indian motor manufacturers and their local dealers . <p> This is the opposite of reconciliation . This is racism with dire consequences in time to come . <p> People outside the north and east must stop paying tax as it is a fraud on them .

The apology for a central government that will result will be shouldering the massive debt burden ( development loans ) accumulated over the decades . The provincial governments dominated by the minorities will contribute as little as possible to the public coffers of the so-called akeeya/orumitta nadu Sri Lanka . This will mean that the Sinhalese dominated provinces will be squeezed dry through taxation to find funds . In the meantime , the new found ( or about to be extracted ) mineral wealth including oil and gas deposits found almost exclusively in the northern and eastern areas will be beyond the reach of the rest of the country ( whatever the new constitution will verbally assure to the contrary ) .

To rephrase your comment , the adverse impact on the Sinhala population since 2009 is far worse than before 2009 . <p> The audacity of Tamil politicians is such that they openly claimed the Sinhala majority Western Province must finance the new proposed provincial councils which is done solely for the benefit of Tamils . <p> As with most things after 1972 , this is yet another replay of the " Gamarala-Panikkiya " drama . <h> Leave a Reply <p> Disclaimer : The comments contained within this website are personal reflection only and do not necessarily reflect the views of the LankaWeb .

Lakshan 's unique journey , started with him volunteering at a Habitat Build event , and thereafter led to over a decade long partnership with HFHSL . That single experience fueled a deep love for volunteering within him , that he has since then shared with countless colleagues , friends , donors and communities . Today , a key member of HFHSL 's leadership team , Lakshan not only continues to volunteer whilst encouraging hundreds of others to do so as well , he has applied his corporate , PR and management expertise to shape the vision and mission of Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka , and aid its ongoing commitment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need . <p> Habitat builds homes not houses : Since Habitat for Humanity was launched in Sri Lanka 23 years ago , the organization has enabled 24,600 families to achieve strength , stability and self-reliance and rebuild better lives . A proper home is the strong foundation on which families and communities thrive . Better , affordable living conditions lead to improved health and stronger childhood development , well-being of children and give families the ability and financial flexibility to make forward-looking choices . Recognizing that donors may not always understand the immense value of building homes , or even consider building a house to be a feasible or practical form of charity , Mr. Madurasinghe said : " A typical Habitat home will be a 550 sq.ft lockable home with two bedrooms , a living room , a kitchen and a toilet , and constructing a home of this nature would generally cost approximately One Million Rupees . Having worked in Sri Lanka for over 23 years , wherever we work , we witness tangible evidence that strong and stable homes help build strong and stable communities " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey started and how he embraced HFHSL 's mission , Mr. Madurasinghe said : " My journey with Habitat for Humanity started in 2005 , while I was serving as the Head of Public Affairs and Communication for Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd . As part of my responsibilities , I also led the company 's strategic CSR efforts and community engagement initiatives . Following the aftermath of the Tsunami , we partnered with Habitat for Humanity in 2005 to rebuild homes in Galle . Our company volunteers were able to actively engage with homeowners and help them build their new homes and regain a sense of normalcy in their lives in the aftermath of the disaster . I was deeply moved by the warmth , hospitality and kindness that was extended to us by those homeowners . They had lost everything , and were so grateful and moved that we had come all the way , to help them rebuild their lives . " Having understood the impact of volunteering instead of simply opting to donate funds , Mr. Madurasinghe explained : " At HFHSL , you get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The beauty of volunteering with Habitat is that you get to be a part of changing people 's lives . " HFHSL provides families with a hand-up not a hand-out ; so that Habitat homeowners are able to achieve the strength , stability and self-reliance they need to build better lives for themselves and their families . <p> After volunteering and engaging in HFHSL 's fundraising activities for many years , Lakshan was invited to serve on the National Board of Directors of Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka in 2009 . In 2012 , he was selected as the Vice-President of the Board and in 2015 he was appointed as the President and Chairman of the National Board of Directors . His decade long journey with Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka has made him a champion of volunteering , who is passionate about expanding HFHSL 's dynamic volunteer engagement initiatives and programmes , whilst increasing awareness about the manifold benefits of volunteering . <p> Volunteering beyond borders : In the hopes of fostering volunteerism internationally , Habitat for Humanity conducts a unique volunteer program known as ' Global Village ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , to travel to Sri Lanka on a cultural exchange for a period of 5-7 days and provide unskilled labour to build homes for communities in need . These volunteers cover their own travel and accommodation costs , and also donate towards Habitat for Humanity 's housing projects . Commenting on this Mr. Madurasinghe said : " Our GV program is a rewarding experience not only for the volunteers themselves but also for our beneficiary families and our staff . This year alone we 've had GV teams from Japan , China , Hong Kong , Korea , Netherlands , Canada , Abu Dhabi , Saudi Arabia , Singapore and the U.S travelling to locations such as Kalutara , Batticaloa , Muthurajawela , Aranayake , Yatiyantota , Deraniyagala and Pussellawa to help communities in need of a safe place to call home . It is remarkable to see how touched our homeowners are when people from all over the world , travel all the way to Sri Lanka , just to be with them and help them build their homes . " <p> Volunteering as a team : Throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team building skills and bonds that Corporates as well as school students can forge when they spend a day working together at a Habitat build . Commenting on this further he said : " Many Corporates opt to invest in high-end training and out-bound team building exercises , however we always urge them to consider sending their entire team out on a ' Corporate Team Build ' where they can work together with a common goal in mind . You really do bond exceptionally well as a team , when you have to put all of your differences aside , and focus on delivering on an important need -- a home that will help a vulnerable family and generations to come . Something powerful happens when we stand shoulder to shoulder to work toward a common goal . Every helping hand , every donation , every voice makes a difference , and the work can be transformative , not just for the family who will reside in a Habitat home , but for everyone involved . It 's a great way to give back to communities and do something truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young leaders : Each year , on International Volunteer Day , Habitat for Humanity launches the Habitat Young Leaders Build ( HYLB ) which is an Asia-Pacific initiative that engages young people , and encourages them to volunteer and advocate for decent housing . Commenting on this , Mr. Madurasinghe said : " A very important part of our International Volunteer Day celebrations , is launching the Habitat Young Leaders Build . In Sri Lanka in particular , we really do want to strengthen our youth engagement and have more youth aged 16-35 be a part of our volunteer initiatives . Going forward we also hope to strengthen our public-sector partnerships and engage with more youth-based NGOs and organizations to bolster our youth volunteer drive . " The HYLB campaign following its launch on the 5th of December culminates on the 21st April 2018 . <p> Every gift makes a difference : Another key segment that HFHSL will be working on moving forward is to actively engage the Sri Lankan Diaspora who may be keen to give back to people in need in their home country , by contributing funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the support needed by Habitat to continue its work in the country , Mr. Madurasinghe stated : " Our work extends far beyond providing shelter and building homes ; the work we do gives people much-needed security , and this has an immense ripple effect on society and the economy . We welcome volunteers and donors regardless of their age , background , career , whether they are individual donors or are a part of an organization . Irrespective of whether you live in Sri Lanka or abroad , regardless of how much and what you have to give ; we welcome you to join hands with Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka and become a part of a story that is reshaping our nation , one Habitat home at a time . Through shelter , we empower and have the immense pleasure knowing that we would be causing a positive generational impact in our nation . "
