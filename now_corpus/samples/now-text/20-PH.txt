@@71542239 <h> 2019 Year-end Report of the Philippine Competition Commission <p> QUEZON CITY , Jan. 3--The year 2019 was another banner year for the Philippine Competition Commission ( PCC ) as it sought to protect and promote market competition -- its core mandate under the Philippine Competition Act ( PCA ) . <p> The past year saw the Commission issuing landmark decisions , instilling discipline in the competitive landscapes across different industries , and imposing sizeable penalties on erring firms . Allow me to report on these and other achievements in 2019 and share our priorities in 2020 . <p> Stronger Competition Enforcement for a Growing Economy <p> The past year had not been smooth sailing for the country 's economy . The ongoing trade disputes around the world continued to depress global demand . Moreover , the delay in the passage of the national budget tempered economic growth . <p> Still , amid these pressing economic challenges , the Philippines continued to thrive and perform well , with GDP growth hovering around 6 percent . Moreover , poverty estimates recently released show that the country 's full-year poverty incidence dropped from 23.3 percent in 2015 to 16.6 percent in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to achieve AmBisyon Natin 2040 , our long-term vision for the Philippines . <p> The persistence of various anticompetitive policies and practices poses risk to the sustainability and inclusivity of economic growth . Effective enforcement of competition law and policy is thus part and parcel of the country 's long-term development agenda . <p> To instill discipline in the markets , PCC flexed its enforcement muscle by deciding on its first abuse of dominance case , issuing its first merger prohibition , and imposing hefty fines on competition law violators . The total amount of fines imposed in 2019 reached PHP 114.6 million -- four times greater than in 2018 . A total of PHP 40.9 million of these fines had been collected . Since its establishment in 2016 , the Commission has imposed fines totaling PHP 162.3 million and collected a total of PHP 72.6 million . <p> As it matures as a competition authority , PCC has sustained its momentum in delivering stronger competition enforcement , pursuing its mandate to prohibit anticompetitive agreements , abuses of market dominance , and anticompetitive mergers and acquisitions . <p> Mergers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency , PCC has been recognized by global peers and practitioners for its active and advanced merger control regime . We pushed for a more robust and streamlined merger notification and review in the past year . <p> Last March , we adjusted our notification thresholds for the second time . Based on the nominal GDP growth of 2018 , we raised the value of Size of Party threshold from PHP 5 billion to PHP 5.6 billion , and the value of Size of Transaction threshold from PHP 2 billion to PHP 2.2 billion . <p> From 2016 to 31 December 2019 , the Commission had received 204 M&amp;A transactions , cumulatively worth PHP 3.3 trillion . We had approved 188 of these transactions . One transaction has been prohibited , 4 are under the sufficiency determination stage , 3 are under Phase 1 review , 1 is under the more in-depth Phase 2 review , 1 is pending with the courts , and 6 have not been refiled . <p> In 2019 alone , PCC received 44 M&amp;A transactions , altogether worth PHP 758 billion ; 30 of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year is 22 percent higher than in 2018 , the total transaction value had almost doubled . The sectors with the most transactions in 2019 were manufacturing ( 10 ) , real estate ( 8 ) , electricity and gas ( 8 ) , and finance and insurance ( 4 ) . <p> The Commission completed all merger reviews well within the statutory periods . In 2019 , we spent an average of 21 calendar days for the 30-day Phase 1 review and an average of 52 calendar days for the 60-day Phase 2 review . These indicate that as we commit to fulfilling our merger review mandate , we also keep in mind considerations related to the ease of doing business . <p> The PCC 's Mergers and Acquisitions Office continuously seeks ways to further simplify the merger review process . Last June , we launched the Expedited Merger Review Rules , wherein qualified transactions will now be subjected to a fast-track review period of 15 working days instead of the statutory period of 30 calendar days . Moreover , we issued our Rules for Solicited Public-Private Partnership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merger review process for these transactions , paving the way for a faster rollout of priority infrastructure projects . The Commission undertook a number of notable decisions and actions regarding mergers and acquisitions . <p> First , the Commission issued its first ever merger prohibition in January 2019 . It blocked Universal Robina Corporation 's proposed acquisition of Central Azucarera Don Pedro as it would substantially lessen competition in the market for sugarcane milling services in Southern Luzon . The prohibition of the transaction prevented the creation of a monopoly that could significantly harm the welfare of sugarcane farmers in Batangas , Laguna , Cavite , and Quezon . <p> Second , the Commission stood guard in monitoring Grab 's compliance with the Commitment Decision , which subjected Grab 's acquisition of Uber in 2018 to pricing and quality standards . These conditions were part of Grab 's Undertaking for a period of one year to address the competition concerns we raised in view of the merger of the country 's two biggest ride-hailing apps . Since opening a motu proprio review of the transaction , PCC has exacted fines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19.2 million shall be refunded to affected Grab riders . <p> As Grab 's initial Undertaking lapsed , the Commission recently approved a new set of voluntary commitments by Grab as a continuing condition for PCC 's clearance of Grab 's acquisition of Uber . Considering the continued lack of viable competition and the lingering competition concerns in the ride-hailing market , we found it necessary to continue to bind Grab to non-exclusivity , service quality , and pricing commitments for the benefit of the riding public . <p> Competition Enforcement <p> The Commission had considerably intensified its enforcement activities across a broad range of industries in 2019 . As a result of its greater public visibility , PCC had received a total of 309 queries to date , 135 of which are informal complaints on possible cartels and abuses of dominance . One of these queries led to our first abuse of dominance case . This underscores the importance of the public 's support to our enforcement actions . <p> In 2019 , the Commission received 2 verified complaints and initiated 2 motu proprio cases . We also commenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we have opened 15 preliminary inquiries : 6 based on verified complaints and 9 motu proprio by the Commission . Thirteen of the 15 preliminary inquiries led to FAIs : 9 investigations are ongoing , 2 have been closed , and 2 have proceeded to adjudication . <p> The past year also marked the Commission deciding on the country 's first abuse of dominance case -- a significant milestone in Philippine competition enforcement . This landmark case involved Urban Deca Homes ( UDH ) , a property developer that imposed a sole internet service provider on its residents , preventing them from availing of alternative and cheaper internet service . In March 2019 , PCC 's Enforcement Office filed a complaint against UDH . Instead of contesting the complaint , the developer proposed to correct its anticompetitive conduct through a settlement . In October , the Commission approved the settlement , ordering UDH to cease its admitted misconduct , pay a fine of PHP 27 million , and comply with the terms of settlement , which included inviting other internet service providers to offer their services to its residents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including corrective measures by some property developers with similar conduct and the wider impact of deterrence on other sectors with tendencies to leverage their dominance in their markets . <p> Moreover , recognizing that price increases in basic goods disproportionately harm the poor , PCC 's Enforcement Office continued to investigate the rice and energy markets , in addition to other sectors already under our enforcement radar in previous years . We also continued to closely look into the logistics supply chain because of its effects on the prices of final goods . <p> Most of the inquiries we have opened are progressing to more targeted investigations . We put in place new enforcement tools to expand our capacity to detect , investigate , and prosecute cartels and abuses of dominance . <p> Foremost of these tools is the Leniency Program , launched in January 2019 to discourage the creation of cartels and assist in the investigation and prosecution of existing ones . This whistleblower-type program , a staple in most jurisdictions , offers immunity from suit or reduction of fines to former or current cartel participants in exchange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ November , the Commission got a boost from the Supreme Court through its issuance of the Rule on Administrative Search and Inspection . The rules govern the application , issuance , and enforcement of inspection orders , reinforcing PCC 's ability to carry out dawn raids on entities suspected of violating the country 's antitrust law . These are expected to significantly improve our case-building and increase the number of cartel prosecutions in the coming years . <p> Competition Research <p> The Commission commenced work on several issue papers and policy notes in 2019 . These analyzed different sectors and their value chain to identify potential competition issues . These not only inform the Commission when it weighs in and decides on cases brought before it but also guide it in prioritizing enforcement and advocacy activities . <p> For example , we published two policy notes regarding the National Food Administration 's ( NFA ) policy on rice importation and potential competition concerns in the rice sector . We also commenced work on issue papers on sugar , agrochemicals , corn , and cargo services -- sectors that fall under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituted a Technical Working Group to conduct a series of studies on the rice sector to help focus our ongoing investigation on the alleged rice cartel . In collaboration with external consultants , the study aims to identify market power along the rice supply chain and to coordinate with other rice-related working groups in other agencies as well as research institutes to ensure the complementarity of research efforts . <p> To support its merger review , competition enforcement , and advocacy initiatives , the Commission launched the PCC Long-term Research Program in 2019 . This initiative is expected to help the Commission assess the impact of its interventions and encourage knowledge creation in the field of competition law and economics . <p> Competition Advocacy <p> The Commission has continued to advocate the development of an informed community of consumers , businesses , and partners in government . We recognize that the most cost-efficient way to implement an effective competition policy is to facilitate voluntary compliance by entities and ensure better coordination with government actors . <p> In 2019 , we successfully organized 48 advocacy and capacity building activities tailored for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business groups . Among our flagship activities was the second Forum on Competition in Developing Countries , attended by local and foreign antitrust experts , development practitioners , business leaders , and sector regulators . <p> In line with the government 's development blueprint , PCC believes that competition introduced in strategic sectors can help usher in a period of increased economic productivity . In 2019 , the Commission submitted several critical inputs to the executive and legislative branches to advocate for pro-competitive government policies in priority sectors . <p> First , PCC welcomed the updating of the Foreign Investments Act to ease the restrictions on the entry of foreign investors in key sectors of the economy . In the same vein , we championed the amendment of the Public Services Act , particularly the lifting of foreign equity restrictions on certain industries such as telecommunications and transport . We also supported the amendment of the Retail Trade Liberalization Act , as easing the entry of foreign retailers is beneficial to both consumers and the domestic retail industry . <p> These three game-changing reforms , intended to usher in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy , are critical to fostering robust competition in the market . <p> Second , PCC continued to champion actions that improve the country 's information and communication technology , advocating for pro-competitive features in regulatory measures . We supported the passive telecommunications infrastructure sharing policy as this would unlock market efficiencies , providing relief to millions of subscribers through improved services and better network coverage . Primarily , we noted that for the sharing of passive infrastructure to be successful and aligned with competition principles , access should be granted by providers on fair , reasonable , and nondiscriminatory terms . <p> Third , the Commission expressed its support in ensuring greater access to affordable and quality medicines through the Maximum Drug Retail Price ( MDRP ) . However , we recommended that MDRP 's implementation be timebound or subject to periodic review , and that other pro-competitive policy options to complement MDRP 's objectives be likewise considered . <p> On another front , the Commission signed 6 Memoranda of Agreement ( MOAs ) and 2 Memoranda of Understanding ( MOUs ) in 2019 to bolster efforts to mainstream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four regulators in sectors prioritized by the Commission due to their impact on consumers , namely : Department of Trade and Industry ( DTI ) , Department of Energy ( DOE ) , Energy Regulatory Commission ( ERC ) , and Department of Agriculture ( DA ) . The agreements with these agencies are expected to facilitate better policy coordination and fast-track investigation of cases where competition concerns may arise . <p> The PCC inked a partnership with the Bases Conversion and Development Authority ( BCDA ) , sealing a harmonized campaign to foster competition in the big-ticket projects of the government 's Build , Build , Build program . <p> The PCC also entered into an agreement with the University of the Philippines ( UP ) through the UP College of Law for the formation of the UP Law Center 's Program in Competition Law and Policy . This is an important step toward achieving our long-term objective of building and sustaining a local stream of competition experts . <p> Partnerships with Foreign Jurisdictions <p> As the government 's official representative in international competition matters , PCC has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with counterpart authorities abroad . <p> Last April , the Commission hosted a study tour of officials of the Myanmar Competition Commission ( MmCC ) . This gave PCC an opportunity to share its development , lessons , and challenges to the newest competition authority in Southeast Asia . <p> Notably , the Commission and the State Administration for Market Regulation of the People 's Republic of China ( SAMR ) signed an MOU last November to strengthen bilateral ties on competition law enforcement . This agreement covers exchange of information , coordination of enforcement activities , notification of cases of mutual interest , as well as technical cooperation and capacity building . <p> The PCC actively participated in international meetings , competition fora , and technical workshops sponsored by the International Competition Network ( ICN ) , the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) , and various partners through the ASEAN Experts Group on Competition ( AEGC ) . These intergovernmental functions allow PCC to further bolster its enforcement network and technical capacity as it strives to achieve its vision of becoming a world-class competition authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the competition chapters of the country 's modern trade agreements . These include the PhilippinesJapan Economic Partnership Agreement ( PJEPA ) , the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership ( RCEP ) , and more recently the Philippines-Korea Free Trade Agreement . The Commission provided inputs that introduce the competition lens to these trade agreements . <p> 2020 : Toward a More Robust and Resilient Competition Regime <p> The Commission has gained significant ground and has built its confidence as a competition enforcer from its experience in the past years . Yet many challenges still need to be overcome . <p> In 2020 , we will focus our competition analysis and enforcement on telecommunications , retail , energy and electricity , transportation , construction , health and pharmaceuticals , and food . Our initiatives in these sectors are intended to unlock the economic potential of these industries that have long been protected by regulations . <p> Our topmost priority is to effectively investigate anticompetitive agreements and conduct , bearing in mind that effective deterrence requires not only the threat of penalties but also effective detection and prosecution of infringements . With leniency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are now more equipped to exercise our full investigative powers . <p> We will further streamline our merger review process by issuing a circular on the process for exemption from compulsory notification of unsolicited PPP projects . <p> Moreover , we will undertake in-depth research to support merger reviews and competition enforcement and to provide inputs for advocacy initiatives . These include analyses of sector regulations and market conditions , and an impact evaluation of PCC 's decisions . The Commission also intends to conduct research on vertical restraints and the impact of government subsidies and subsidy-like measures on the competition landscape . <p> We intend to establish and reinforce ties with other institutions to further expand our enforcement network . The Commission looks to having possible MOUs with peers in the Asia-Pacific , including the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore ( CCCS ) and the Hong Kong Competition Commission ( HKCC ) . With the continued rise of populist sentiments and trade frictions , the need for international cooperation and the exchange of knowledge and expertise has become even more urgent . <p> The Commission will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third-party peer review of our processes and outputs . This will allow PCC to benchmark itself with more developed jurisdictions . <p> On the local front , we look forward to solidifying and formalizing inter-agency ties with other sector regulators , particularly the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board ( LTFRB ) , the Intellectual Property Office ( IPOPHL ) , and the Department of Information and Communications Technology ( DICT ) . <p> On the other hand , the Commission plans to formally propose to Congress amendments to the PCA to address significant issues that have emerged during its first three years of operationalization . The amendments will be aimed at strengthening PCC 's mandate and operations , keeping in mind that actions in its early years spell the basis for future enforcement actions . <p> The proposed amendments will include raising the amount of pecuniary penalties , giving PCC the power to conduct dawn raids without court order , and reinforcing its primary , original , and exclusive jurisdiction over all competition cases . Following global trends , we will also explore expanding our mandate to include consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . <p> As prescribed by the PCA , the Commission will be adjusting its schedule of administrative fines in August 2020 to maintain their real value from the time the law was enacted in 2015 . <p> We will continue to strengthen our institutional capacity . By end of 2019 , the Commission was composed of 215 personnel , of which 170 are in plantilla positions , including 44 lawyers and 25 economists . Recently , the Office of the President has approved the creation of 28 new positions for the PCC 's Office of the General Counsel and the Economics Office . This allows us to increase our productivity as we expand our portfolio of enforcement and advocacy work . We intend to request additional positions for our other core offices this year . <p> As a reflection of our commitment to good housekeeping , we successfully renewed our ISO certification for quality management system this year .

It 's all about rebellion , protest , giving the middle finger to the status quo , authority and the hypocrisy of the moneyed . But in 2017 he was more direct . Before the UK 's general election , he replaced the girl 's red balloon with the Union Jack and offered to send a free print to people who voted against the Tories .

Now the half-shredded artwork has become a new artwork called " Love is in the Bin " -- and its price immediately increased by 20 percent according to art appraisers . <p> Banksy has said " the art world is one of the most amusing phenomena on the planet " and for someone who 's made so much money from the art world , he has no compunction about hiding his disdain for it .

The image is of a young girl running and screaming after her village Trang Bang was attacked in a napalm blast -- only this time she is flanked by Mickey Mouse and Ronald McDonald , the two mascots smiling as if they were in a theme park .

@@71566236 <p> In the early ' 50s , I was at the College of Nursing with classes in Diliman . My daily allowance was one peso : 10 centavos for jeepney fare from Dapitan to Quiapo and 15 centavos for the MD or JD bus ride to Diliman . Another 25 centavos was saved for the trip home . Fifty centavos was for my lunch of the best chicken sandwich and a bottle of coke at the Liberal Arts Building basement . Occasionally , a friend would get on the same jeepney or bus with me and pay for my fare , so I would treat myself to a full meal at the Home Economics cafeteria for 80 centavos ! Couples who went on lunch dates on campus went to Sawali Corner where ? la carte meals were served for about P1.50 per person . It was our idea of elegant dining on campus . <p> Girls wore full-balloon skirts to school . When the Diliman wind blew , we had to quickly squat and hold down our skirts or they would fly up and cover our heads and show our layers of petticoats . AC jeepney passengers would complain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them , the whole side seat was occupied with her skirt or covered the other passengers ' laps . I made my own skirts and blouses and each outfit cost me P5.50 . At a peso per yard , I would buy four yards for the skirt and a yard and a half for the sleeveless top . <p> During class field trips and the Labor Day parade , we wore blue jeans or pedal pushers with a shirt ( T-shirts were not for girls then ) . If the trip fell on a Sunday and we had to hear Mass before the trip , we stood at the back because we were not properly dressed for church . We enjoyed rainy days because it was an excuse to use bakya and carry an umbrella to share with anybody who did not have one , to cross the campus to another building for the next class -- it was a way of meeting new friends .

I remember classmates who did not learn how to swim and had to be pushed into the deep end of the pool to execute how to float and tread water . They were scared to death but the lifeguard was always there with his long pole . The vacant period after swimming class was spent in Little Quiapo eating merienda -- the famous halo-halo for 15 centavos . There was a jukebox where we dropped five-centavo coins to play 45 rpm records of our favorite tunes . <p> The television was newly invented then and I had to travel on a jeep to go to a classmate 's house to watch an interview of Joni James before her performance in the Philippines .

I remember Carriedo stank with the smell of leather because most shoe stores were there and all shoes , and even slippers , were made of pure leather . Movie houses were also located in the area so it was not unusual to meet classmates or other UP friends in the place referred to as " downtown . " <p> We enjoyed the annual Cadena de Amor for graduating girls . We wore white short formals for the occasion . There was the Lantern Parade where we paraded in costumes during the Christmas season . The Oblation Run had not been conceived of then .

We had late-night picnics and chats in the dark after the 9 p.m. " lights out .

We also had classmates who " borrowed " our stuff from our closets without permission . One classmate borrowed my blue pair of shoes and returned it black . We had a curfew and those with boyfriends who went out on dates had to be back by 9 p.m. or be locked out . <p> As in other UP dormitories , there was this eerie story of a " white lady " hanging from the ceiling of one of the bathrooms .

These officials also say the State Department did not produce the analysis that US embassies in the Middle East faced an imminent threat , the legally required threshold to justify Soleimani 's killing . <p> While security at US embassies in the region was increased in recent months , those steps were n't taken immediately ahead of the Soleimani strike and were n't the additional measures that are usually taken in an " imminent threat " situation , former State Department officials said . Those officials said State would usually issue an explicit warning to diplomats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actively consider staff evacuations . <p> The agency also failed to take steps that would be typical in a situation like this , former State Department officials said , failing to issue an explicit warning to diplomats overseas or take follow-up steps to limit diplomats ' movements or actively consider staff evacuations . <h> Confusing explanations <p> Since the strike , Trump administration officials have issued confusing explanations , contradicting each other about how imminent a threat the Iranian general posed , whether they had specific intelligence on the threat and even what that threat was , with Trump saying one thing , then another , while officials offered varying explanations . <p> On Monday , Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Soleimani 's killing was part of a larger strategy of deterrence , a shift from his pervious rationale that the strike was to prevent an " imminent " attack . <p> " Judging from the type and intensity of the strike , the regime certainly must now understand what we will do if they ever again pose risk to American lives , " Pompeo said during a speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we will end it on our terms . " <p> Responding to a question later about why Americans should trust the intelligence about the reported " imminent " threat , Pompeo said , " There was in fact a set of imminent attacks that were being plotted by Qassim Soleimani .

It never eliminates it . But it reduced that risk . " <p> However , Pompeo , a former CIA director , told the audience that " the intelligence community makes mistakes , all the time . " <p> CNN reached out to eight embassies in the region , including Baghdad , to see if they received specific threat warnings about any plot to blow up their posts .

He emphasized military reinforcements which were moved to the region . " We are not going to have another Benghazi , " he said , referring to a 2012 attack in Libya that left four Americans dead , including the US ambassador . <p> Pompeo has not said there were any threats to specific US embassies , describing the threat posed by Soleimani as one that " included attacks on US embassies . " <p> A State Department spokesperson said that every US embassy worldwide was warned of potential escalation with Iran , but this person would not say if that security warning went out before or after the Soleimani strike , saying that the dates of classified cables are n't disclosed . <p> The spokesperson also would n't say if specific US embassies in the Middle East were warned they could face bombings . <p> " The Department of State sent a worldwide security warning to every embassy alerting them of potential escalation with Iran and their proxies , " a State Department spokesperson told CNN . " We followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GCC Gulf Cooperation Council and Levant to make sure they understood the gravity of the situation . " <p> The spokesperson said the department also asked the regional security officers if they needed additional diplomatic security assets , agents , or resources . <p> One source familiar with the warning said it had gone out before Soleimani 's killing . US missile strikes against facilities in Iraq and Syria tied to an Iranian-backed militia on December 29 , four days before the Soleimani strike , led officials to expect some form of retaliation from Iran 's proxies . <p> The source said the State Department was working around the clock with embassies worldwide , even calling them , to be sure that they heeded the warnings . But this source said State was not aware that four specific US embassies faced a particular threat . <p> The fact that the State Department alert went out to " every embassy " and Trump administration officials continue to avoid referencing specific warnings to specific diplomatic outposts contributes to the mounting skepticism about Trump 's assertion that Soleimani posed an imminent threat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a US diplomatic post is received , the pertinent bureaus at State -- in conjunction with other relevant agencies -- evaluate its credibility and decide how to proceed . <p> " If it 's credible , specific , can not be thwarted and poses a threat to our people , an Emergency Action Committee is formed at post , coordinating their deliberations with main State and Diplomatic Security , specifically , " explained John Kirby , a CNN contributor and former spokesperson for the State Department and the Pentagon . <p> It would be extremely rare -- and likely only in a case where the threat is hours or minutes away -- that a threat against a US embassy picked up by another US agency would not be shared with State Department officials who oversee security . <p> Esper said on CNN that the US embassy in Iraq did know of a threat , separate from that of the militia the US struck on December 29th and protestors who stormed the embassy January 1 .

Something that had nothing to do with the director 's Palme d'Or win for " Parasite , " international box office success or becoming an Oscar nominee . Last October , the killer he made a film about nearly two decades ago confessed . <p> " The day I read the ( news ) article I could n't really do anything else , " Bong said . " I was so overwhelmed . " <p> The Hwaseong serial murders were perhaps South Korea 's most notorious unsolved crimes . Ten women were sexually assaulted and killed between 1986 and 1991 in the city south of the capital , Seoul . In many cases the women were strangled using items of the women 's clothing such as stockings or a blouse . The lack of closure cast a long shadow in the nation 's collective memory , and the police 's futile efforts became the subject of Bong 's " Memories of Murder " in 2003 . <p> Skip forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the US , a police official told CNN that a South Korean man , a prisoner in his 50s , had confessed to nine of the murders , along with five others ( officials believe the tenth Hwaseong murder was a copycat crime ) . The killer , already serving a life sentence , can not be prosecuted as the statutes of limitations have already expired . Police are now working to verify the man 's confessions . <p> By his own admission , Bong had been " obsessed " with the case . During the screenwriting process for " Memories of Murder " in 2001 and 2002 he met detectives , journalists and people familiar with the victims . " But the one guy I could not meet was the murderer , " he recalled . <p> " I really wanted to see his face -- I even tried imagining his face and sketching it out to myself , " Bong said .

" I felt very complicated looking at ( it ) . " <p> Seated next to his interpreter Sharon Choi in London in December , Bong had not yet won a Golden Globe for best foreign language film to put alongside his Palme d'Or -- the first ever won by a Korean .

It 's tightly-wound , containing little that does n't serve a greater purpose : to befuddle our expectations and offer a probing social critique , while charming us along the way . <p> Inequality -- and examining the mechanisms behind it -- lies at its heart . Bong finds himself in familiar territory , inequality also underpinning his recent films " Snowpiercer " and " Okja .

" <p> Capitalism as a structure benefiting some , depriving others and offering delusions to all is n't an original reading . But " Parasite " goes out of its way to suggest we 're all suffering under it . Bong described the film as " a very sad portrait of our current times , and the story sort of makes you face that honest portrayal . " <p> And yet he mines humor out of class trauma . In one scene , an intimate moment between the Parks is fueled by dirty talk of cheap knickers and nondescript drugs .

" I feel like people were very easily able to sympathize with this very contemporary story . It 's difficult to understand the reason why at this point . I think I need more time to figure that out .

" Just being nominated along with fellow , amazing international filmmakers was a huge honor , " he continued . " I think we use only one language : the cinema . " <p> Back in London , the director confessed " deep down inside , I really want to return to my main job as soon as possible . " Bong revealed he 's working on two projects .

It is about reducing the amount of waste they produce in their everyday lives that there would be nothing left for recycling . <p> Learn how to say " no " to things with lots of packaging .

Segregate your waste This is the first step in proper waste management . Segregation simply means keeping wet and dry wastes separately . You may start by separating recyclable waste such as paper , plastic , and glass from landfill and compostable waste . It also helps in reducing wastes that reach landfills and reduces pollution . <p> 4 . Start switching Metal straws and wooden pairs of spoon and fork are probably the first thing that comes to mind when they hear the term " zero waste lifestyle . " These are just some of the basic ways you can start doing towards a zero-waste lifestyle . <p> Just like other plastic items -- such as bags and bottles -- straws and plastic utensils can also take years to break down .

@@71595232 <h> Fred Hawson <p> Richard Jewell ( Paul Walter Hauser ) was an odd fellow . At the age of 34 , he was single , obese , not too bright , ca n't hold a job and still lived with his mother Bobbi ( Kathy Bates ) . In 1996 , he worked as a security guard at Centennial Park where they held concerts for the Atlanta Olympics . One night , he noticed an abandoned bag on the grounds near the tower which was later confirmed to be a bomb . <p> Richard was hailed as a hero at first . However , FBI agent Tom Shaw ( Jon Hamm ) leaked to a persistent reporter Kathy Scruggs ( Olivia Wilde ) that they were investigating Richard as a possible suspect for the bombing . This was because he fit the stereotype of a false hero -- someone who purposefully caused an emergency so that he can be there to save people from it . When Scruggs went for it and made it headline news , Richard 's life was turned upside down . <p> " Richard Jewell " is a strong statement against how irresponsible law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . These two organizations were expected to uphold only the truth , and not act upon mere suspicions unsupported by reliable evidence .

While it is the role of his lifetime , it could lock him into similar roles of redneck losers . His rather low-key performance of a low-key yet challenging role failed to get the critical acclaim it deserved . Kathy Bates can really spin her own magic out of any small familiar role , like this one as a loving supporting mother .

Marcelo , Associate Editor <p> FINDING a Sol LeWitt ( 1928 -- 2007 ) in Art Fair Philippines is as unexpected as finding a vegan in a steakhouse . In his biography of LeWitt -- a luminary figure in conceptual art -- Lary Bloom writes that the artist , through his manifestos , urged people to " steer away from what is known and what is safe ( and what is commercial ) . " What , then , are two of his wall drawings doing at an art fair , which is , by definition , a commercial endeavor ? <p> " The LeWitt Estate indeed avoids installing his wall drawings in art fairs as a matter of policy , " said Carina Evangelista , a New York-based curator and writer who spent two years corresponding with Sofia LeWitt , the artist 's daughter , just to get LeWitt 's wavy lines and words onto the walls of The Link car park in Makati City . <p> The works will be drafted by Filipino artists and writers whose names carry weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dash of irony since the crux of LeWitt 's practice was " the democratic hand " -- a phrase that means any of the fair 's 40,000 visitors could have executed the works . For LeWitt , what mattered was the idea : if an artist has thought things through , he wrote in " Paragraphs on Conceptual Art , " then the " execution is a perfunctory affair . " <p> In this e-mail interview , Ms. Evangelista explains how she got Sol LeWitt into Art Fair Philippines , the triumph of thinking over doing , and how Shop 6 -- a motley crew of artists led by Roberto Chabet -- embodied LeWitt 's ideas in the Philippines . <p> SLM : Could you walk us through the thought process behind bringing Sol LeWitt to this year 's edition of Art Fair Philippines ? Why him after Weegee , the street photographer whose work you brought in last year . It 's quite a turnaround from Weegee 's gritty photojournalism to conceptualism . <p> CE : Lisa Periquet , Trickie Lopa , and Dindin Araneta actually approached me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw my inclusion of a LeWitt work in Counterfeit Monochromes , the 10th anniversary exhibition I mounted for MOSpace in December 2017 . <p> Weegee 's iconic photographs provided the context for a public talk to which I invited Raffy Lerma and Ezra Acayan to present their work in 2018 . The searing images they have captured left some members of the audience at the art fair in tears , providing a barometer for the fact that even at something like an art fair , Filipinos are in fact bewildered by the toll of the drug war rhetoric that transformed policy into practice . <p> Although programming such as this might come across as radically different from conceptual art ( which is the kind of art that is really my cup of tea ) , what has in fact drawn me to conceptualism is its predisposition for institutional critique and political content . It bears noting that the roots of Conceptualism can be traced not just to the US but also to Latin America , practically birthed by political upheavals there . Conceptual form and thought can thrive on social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the very inception of the Wall Drawing series was for an exhibition that was clearly political in nature , the Benefit for the Student Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam , an exhibition at Paula Cooper Gallery in New York in 1968 . <p> Asked whether art should have a social or moral purpose , his response was , " No , I think artists should have a social or moral purpose . " The exhibition thesis I had for Counterfeit Monochromes was in fact premised around the social realities in the Philippine context that underpinned the lexicon of conceptual forms . <p> SLM : By accounts , Sol LeWitt is not the kind of artist one would see at an art fair . How did you get permission to mount his work ? And how do LeWitt 's wall drawings function in the context of an art fair ? <p> CE : The LeWitt Estate indeed avoids installing his wall drawings in art fairs as a matter of policy . This Special Project took two years of corresponding directly with Sofia LeWitt , Sol 's daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project at Art Fair Philippines , pointing out the astonishing volume of as many as 40,000 visitors , comprising mostly students . <p> In a way , Art Fair Philippines provides the annual event to which this many Filipinos are able to consider both the contemporary art that 's out in the market , works by Philippine masters , and some international art . I spoke of how interesting LeWitt 's conceptual approach to ordinary materials and bare walls allows us to consider what walls are , what walls speak , what walls accrue , what walls become . <p> How such conceptualism works in the context of an art fair specifically here in the Philippines is its proposition about " the democratic hand " -- that such art can be made even by hands not necessarily academically trained . <p> While Philippine appetite for art can tend to hew close to photorealist virtuosity and whereas an extremely robust strand of Philippine contemporary art is social realism ( particularly as a record of artistic response to the repression of the Martial Law years during the Marcos regime ) , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ output of Philippine conceptualists who are not driven by the urge to paint hyperrealist work , to trade in social realist imagery , or to indulge in " pakapalan ng pahid ng oil paint " ( who can apply oil paint thicker ) . <p> This is not to knock this kind of output that has always fared well in the art market because there IS room for everything . It is to suggest that an understanding of conceptualism could round out the understanding of contemporary art that Art Fair Philippines attempts to cultivate . LeWitt 's conceptualism that started out with among the most basic elements of art and design -- the line -- proved to be extremely generative in ideas . The examples of his wall drawings posit what incredible range of forms is within the realm of possibility and imagination even within the restrictive or prescriptive parameters of instructions for abstract forms . <p> Sofia LeWitt was quite patient with all my questions and helped figure out what would work given whatever logistical constraints we might have while ensuring that the project is installed in the spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director of the Sol LeWitt Estate , and John Hogan , Installations Director and Archivist for Sol LeWitt Wall Drawings at Yale University Art Gallery , were both generous with their time and the " institutional memory " of which they have been custodians from decades of having worked side by side with Sol on hundreds of installations . When I mentioned to John Hogan that I relish the thought of LeWitt 's commitment to " the democratic hand " gracing the walls in an art fair in a country currently under rule of self-proclaimed " iron fist , " he said that if LeWitt were alive , he would agree . <p> SLM : From an art historical perspective , could you describe how groundbreaking LeWitt and his approach to art-making were . As I understand it , the primacy of the idea over authorship/execution when it comes to conceptual art was -- and still is , in some quarters -- controversial . <p> CE : LeWitt laid the precepts of conceptualism in his writing such as " Sentences on Conceptual Art " and " Paragraphs on Conceptual Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussing and exploring as they tried to break free from the traditional notions of how to make and exhibit art . <p> With premium given to the idea and to process , art could now be made with anything ( including the artists ' own bodies and thus yielding to performance art ) , made anywhere ( any wall in LeWitt 's case ; out in the fields or the desert in the case of land/earth art ) , and made any which way ( as enumerated in Richard Serra 's 1967 -- 1968 Verblist that suggested " to shave / to smear / to fold / to tear / to scatter / to hide / to discard / to weave / to erase / to spill / to knot ... " are viable ways of making art . <p> If this remains controversial in some quarters , it is from the distaste for work that does not look like it warranted skill or talent to produce or work that looks happenstance or work that does n't seem invested at all in looking beautiful or work that was fabricated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the wall with markers or a tautological sentence written directly on the wall would easily be dismissed with " And you call this art ? " And yet , the incredible range of variations that such attitude toward making art has indeed pushed the frontiers of how art can be made , how art can look , and what meanings art could mine or what questions art could trigger . <p> SLM : LeWitt wrote " Paragraphs on Conceptual Art , " a manifesto of sorts published in 1967 . Which of the comments he made there , in your opinion , are the most relevant today ? <p> CE : It would have to be this : " The idea becomes a machine that makes the art . " It is what has made Conceptualism truly generative . And contrary to the notion that conceptual art is dry , that it can really be done with any medium has meant not just more than 1,300 permutations of what a wall drawing can be for LeWitt . <p> In the Philippines , this spirit was embodied by Shop 6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls of an empty commercial stall in Pasay from 1974 to 1975 .

@@71710234 <h> Questioning road-widening as the main solution to traffic <h> Yellow Pad <p> By Regina Mora , Ira Cruz , and Patrick Jalasco <p> Metro Manila is a bustling and bursting metropolis of over 24 million people . Among the mounting challenges faced by the metropolis , chief among them is moving people efficiently amid rising road congestion . Why are the streets of Metro Manila becoming more congested in the first place ? Is there truly a way to decongest a city still steadily experiencing urban growth ? <p> In his paper Practical Strategies for Reducing Congestion and Increasing Mobility for Chicago , Samuel Staley defined congestion as an event wherein the supply of road space can no longer keep up with the increasing number of vehicles . Metro Manila 's congestion problem especially exemplifies Staley 's definition of the word : there are in fact more vehicles plying the metropolis ' streets than what the network can appropriately manage . <p> Given the definition of the word , it seems almost intuitive to deduce that augmenting road supply in the form of road widening would ease congestion . After all , conventional knowledge tells us that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solution would be to correspondingly increase its supply . Moreover , it does no benefit that we have placed private car ownership on a pedestal since the dawn of our postcolonial obsession with the American Dream , which perhaps reveals where the problem lies . Our fixation on the private vehicle as the ideal mode of transport has seeped its way through not only our personal consumption choices , but also in the way policy makers have evaluated what is good for our cities . Instead of channeling investment towards infrastructure that enhance the movement of people , projects have received the government 's go-signal often on the basis of its ability to improve vehicular travel . <p> This practice has led to no less than the country 's widest highway : Commonwealth Avenue , the seventh radial road in Metro Manila 's arterial road system and the main corridor connecting the northern residential districts of Quezon City to the rest of the capital . On its widest section , the highway houses 18 mixed-traffic lanes . Despite its unparalleled road capacity , the corridor remains notorious for severe traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordeals , especially during weekend peak hours . The same is true for some of the world 's widest highways that hosts the worst traffic bottlenecks in their respective cities : from Houston 's 26-lane Katy Freeway to Beijing 's 50-lane G-4 Expressway . These all provide proof that a wider road does not necessarily result in less congestion . <p> There is a reason road supply is not able to keep up with the demand for its use : that is , in the case of transportation , infrastructure creates or induces its own demand . The underlying concept is called induced or latent demand , a phenomenon wherein demand for a certain good is generated as its supply increases . According to an article published by the LA Times , this is best understood when we visualize traffic as gas that expands and fills the space of its container , instead of the traditional engineering perspective of likening traffic to liquid , which merely follows its vessel 's shape . Although some form of decongestion may be experienced immediately after a road-widening project , it leads to generating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic will then create the need to augment road capacity all over again . In essence , building more car infrastructure will result in more car traffic . <p> This paints a powerful image because it shows us that our mobility has in effect been shaped by the infrastructure we have built -- and that if we have built our way into the crisis we now experience daily , we can also build our way out of it . <p> The light at the end of the tunnel is that induced demand works the same way for all other transit modes . When a bike network is installed , more people start to bike ; when a sidewalk is widened , more people tend to walk ; when a bus service is augmented or improved , more people start taking public transport . Shifting people from depending on private vehicles to using more sustainable transit modes such as walking , cycling , and public transport is key to solving congestion because it optimizes the use of the limited road space available by moving the most number of people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but a symptom of inefficient mobility . Going back to our previous example , according to counts by the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority in 2018 for Commonwealth Avenue , private transit modes ( i.e. cars , motorcycles , and taxis ) accounted for 84.7% of the corridor 's annual average daily traffic ( AADT ) while only carrying 39.7% of people that traverse it . On the other hand , public transit modes ( i.e. buses , jeepneys , and UVs ) carried 58.4% of the corridor 's commuters while only contributing 12.7% to traffic . The solution is clear : if we want to sustainably reduce congestion along roads like Commonwealth Avenue , we must focus on moving people more efficiently by building infrastructure for sustainable transit modes . <p> Unfortunately , although we hear the slogan Move People , Not Cars bannered as the government 's new policy direction for transportation , traditional car-centric policies and projects continue . The practice of road-widening remains to be the arsenal of choice amidst the mobility crisis -- often in the name of an additional car lane , but at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressways and flyovers to solve the city 's most congested roads are the ones gaining traction , yet low hanging public transport improving initiatives are shelved . Conversely , to give way to private vehicles , public utility vehicles are kicked out of primary thoroughfares and forced to take longer routes to their destinations . Instead of providing dedicated space for two-wheelers to ensure the safety of their riders , personal mobility devices ( i.e. bikes , e-bikes , and electric scooters ) are simply banned from car-dominated roads without being given viable alternatives . <p> Mobility is not a slider that lives on the extremes ; so the alternative is not for the exclusion of private vehicles but for the reduction of dependency on it -- equitable distribution of road space that opens more options for people . The focus should be on optimizing road use by building infrastructure for more efficient transit modes , instead of building additional road space . That is where the opportunity to build our way out of the current crisis comes in . <p> Regina Mora , Ira Cruz , and Patrick Jalasco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport experts and ordinary citizens advocating sensible and humane transport policies .

But doing that last thing is challenging , and near impossible for the most disenfranchised .

Pawid <p> BOMBS DROPPED by allied planes and artillery shells are exploding in every distant mountain surrounding the evacuation hide-out of my father and company in the forest at the south-western section of Kiangan , Sub-Province of Ifugao . These war sounds are so frightening that can shake the minds and bodies of children and women including the rest of the adult civilians . <p> My father wrote : " I felt pity and pain to see the children and women bodily shaking whenever these military war armaments explode near us .

@@71843239 <p> I 've just finished power washing a 3-meter wide stairwell that connects four floors , and hand dried 47 one-meter wide wooden steps . I usually go up and down all four floors at least 15 to 20 times a day . Before that , I started the morning washing 3 cars , sweeping the street in front of our house , sat down with my wife and daughter to watch Sunday praise and worship service , then I did some carpentry work that involved lifting 15 to 20 kilo art pieces and repairing the wood rot . That 's a normal day for me except for the fact that I now ca n't go to TV5 / Cignal TV to host our show AGENDA and then do a 45-minute workout at our local gym after which I write my column three times a week . On April 14 , the day the government might lift the Luzon-wide Quarantine I will be celebrating my 64th birthday . Yes I am a " Senior Citizen " and have been for four years . Once you read the succeeding paragraphs you will fully appreciate where all this is headed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PC inside Barrio Kapitolyo was no longer allowing Senior Citizens to shop ! After verifying the complaint , I learned from an official of PC Supermarket that no less than the barangay Chairwoman Corazon Benavidez and officials had ordered PC to block Senior Citizens . Later in the afternoon , I heard that a political appointee of Malaca ? ang for the Visayas had allegedly instructed all LGUs in the Visayas to issue a memorandum circular for a " total curfew " for children and senior citizens in the entire Visayas . I can only assume they and the many likeminded officials are only acting in the interest of a segment of society that so many health officials keep labeling as " Most Vulnerable to Covid-19 . " But is it correct to simply dump everybody that 's " too young " or " old " in the same bin and place us under lock and key ? <p> Just because people are " Senior Citizens " it does not necessarily mean they are weak , old and frail . It is important to emphasize this because more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might end up treating " seniors " as fragile and then later " disposable " . Let us be clear about certain things ; predisposition to a disease has nothing to do with age unless you already have pre-existing medical conditions and or a compromised lifestyle . Even among " Senior Citizens " there is an observable difference among those in the 60 's , the 70 's and the 80 's and above . If there is anyone currently predisposed to Covid-19 these would be our health workers , physicians , and front-liners . That 's whom we should be focusing on and spending our time , money and energy and not on hasty generalizations to confine those who are well and able to care for themselves . <p> Local officials and political appointees should first study the reality and the consequences of their ideas . There are people who are 60 plus years old who still run or compete in athletics , there are 60 plus year olds who care for their parents who are still alive , there are many senior citizens living the life past 75 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live the " Lock and load " lifestyle of not having maids or kids . In other words , we Senior Citizens are all well able to care for ourselves . In fact many of us still have jobs , busy schedules and have lived enough and want to live long enough to know that we need to practice social distancing , cleanliness and are considerate enough not to panic buy or hoard ! <p> The worst thing you can do to old people is to love them to death and by this I mean treating us like we are invalids , fragile or frail . Many of today 's parents will die young because of inactivity , too many medicines and too little exercise , many of them will suffer mental , nutritional and digestive ailments because the older they get the more they will be treated as children who do n't know what 's good for them . We did not just get old ; we grew up and learned all there is to learn . Yes , many of us undoubtedly have weaker resistance , but did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seniors versus Gen-X and Millennial . The horrifying truth is that Covid-19 kills regardless of age . Even before Covid-19 , Pneumonia was already a known killer of Senior Citizens right alongside cardiac arrest . The only difference today is now we associate it with the virus . Every time health experts isolate a certain population , the other groups start thinking they 're safe and then they are the ones that start dying . This is what happened when people started saying that HIV only affected gay people . At the moment , many western countries are very concerned that the biggest hit of Covid-19 will soon be among students in college or universities not among Senior Citizens . <p> If all of the above is not enough to make government officials discover an ounce of common sense in their cranial cavity , then so be it , let EVERY Senior Citizen in the Philippines stay home . Lock us in and then let 's see who will run the Republic of the Philippines ! Who will run all the top corporations that are now donating food , alcohol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see who will run the cities , towns and barangays . Who will run the hospitals ? We are a nation run by Senior Citizens and now barangay captains and political appointees wo n't even let us go to the neighborhood grocery ? <p> * * * <p> Romans 12:16 " Be of the same mind toward one another ; do not be haughty in mind , but associate with the lowly .

He rightly referred to the fans ' reaction to him as a celebration of baseball , and that occurred day after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open . <p> Here are some of the other bits of the summer of 2,131 that were n't always in plain sight for fans . <p> 1 . His autograph sessions were legendary . <p> You might have heard stories about Cal turning into a one-man autograph machine that year , and assumed such tales are exaggerated , or apocryphal , or myths borne through the fog of time . <p> Well , the stories are true . <p> Like most players , Cal stopped to sign for fans gathered along the foul lines in the two-hour window before games , around batting practice , and from time to time , I 'd see him stopped to sign for fans who waited near the ramp to where he parked inside Camden Yards . <h> Editor 's Picks <p> But in the midst of the ' 95 season , he began to hold some postgame , late-night autograph sessions , home and road . After games , he 'd retreat to the clubhouse for a quick bite to eat , and then take a seat next to the Orioles ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still see him with a towel draped over his shoulder -- as one single-file line snaked around the ballpark , extending to the left-field corner . And he would sign for everybody who took the time to wait , putting his name on baseballs , programs , bats , tickets , scraps of paper . <p> " It really began due to a simple surplus of energy , postgame , " said John Maroon , who led the Orioles ' media relations department . " He was pretty wound up after the game and he was getting a lot of requests from fans for signatures , so it started fairly generically and then became a thing . People started to clamor for it , and ask about it . " <p> I ca n't remember actually timing those sessions , but they 'd last more than an hour , easy . I 'd return to the press box from the clubhouse , rewrite a game story , refresh the notebook -- and as I packed up my stuff , he 'd still be signing . <p> The peak of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All-Star Game festivities , in the middle of a deadly heat wave . Arlington , Texas , was the site of the event that year , and it was so hot , more than 100 degrees , that a lot of players understandably retreated into the air conditioning after they completed their round of batting practice . Cal remained outside to sign ... and sign ... and sign ... moving along the foul lines . <p> The late , great Gerry Fraley covered the Rangers at that time for the Dallas Morning News , and no writer had a more acerbic sense of humor . He was difficult to impress . But even Gerry stopped me to remark on Cal 's effort to connect with fans . <p> 2 . Teammates believed he possessed a special power of recovery . <p> I can recall Roger Clemens drilling Brady Anderson in the middle of the back with a fastball , and the next day , most of Brady 's back was covered with a massive bruise . Players get hurt , they bleed , they bruise . <p> But Cal 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McDonald inhabited the locker next to Ripken 's and in a recent interview , he told a story of seeing Cal get hit by a pitch -- and when Ben asked Cal to see the resulting damage , there was nothing . A lot of teammates had stories like that , from the 15-plus straight seasons he played without missing a game . <p> 3 . Pitchers on other teams were seemingly scared to death by the prospect of injuring him . <p> The consecutive-games record was odd because no matter how effectively Ripken played , you knew well in advance the exact date he would pass Gehrig 's milestone -- assuming he was able to stay healthy . One errant pitch had the potential to change that , of course , and I remember there being some angst when Cal was hit a couple of times early in the season -- in the fourth game of the season , and again two weeks later . This was not unusual : During the course of his career , he 'd get hit anywhere from four to seven times a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flanagan , a coach for the Orioles that season , was the first to notice how opposing pitchers seemingly shied away from throwing inside to Cal . <p> In fact , he was not hit by a pitch in Baltimore 's last 130 games . Everybody in baseball wanted to see him set that record . <p> 4 . The record-setting game was such a celebrated event that President Bill Clinton attended . <p> Clinton was in the ESPN booth when Cal hit his home run -- of course he homered in No. 2,130 and No. 2,131 -- and overpowered Chris Berman on the microphone , no small feat . <p> 5 . Cal fell into a deep slump after he broke Gehrig 's record , which was n't a surprise , given the enormous amount of energy expended in the run-up to the big day , and all of the stuff happening for games 2,130 and 2,131 . Over the next 13 games , Cal went 3-for-44 with no extra-base hits . <p> On a Saturday afternoon at Tiger Stadium on Sept. 20 , he was hitless in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home plate in that old ballpark , and as I wrote my story after that particular game , I glanced to the field -- and saw someone walking toward home plate , carrying a bucket of balls and a batting tee , with a bat wedged in his armpit . <p> It was Cal , going to work , alone . <p> He whacked baseballs into the empty outfield before accepting the penance of retrieving them -- with help from a teammate or two who emerged from the clubhouse to join him -- and then repeated the drill . <p> He was baseball 's most powerful player , its most credible figure , owner of the year 's most celebrated record , and in an empty park following a meaningless game for a team out of contention , he looked for a fix to his slump .

@@71872234 <p> The term ' sport sedan ' has practically been synonymous with the 3 Series , and 2020 is a major milestone for BMW 's best-seller . It turns 45 this year and over the past several decades , it has grown from strength to strength . It was one of the cars that turned BMW into a global powerhouse , and it is now on its seventh-generation . <p> It will be celebrating its birthday next month as it was first launched in May of 1975 . The first generation was called the E21 and it replaced the 02 Series models from the late ' 60s . With its introduction , the core line-up of BMW as we know it was completed as it joined the 5 Series which was released in 1972 , and the 7 Series which debuted in 1977 . <p> In November 1982 , BMW then launched the second-generation model , the E30 .

It also had the longest life cycles among all the 3 Series models , spanning from 1982 to 1992 . It even overlapped with the next-generation 3 Series called the E36 . <p> Whereas the E30 was an evolution of the E21 , the E36 brought in radical changes to the 3 Series range in August 1990 . Gone were the boxy , upright designs of the past , replaced by a sleeker , more aerodynamic and revolutionary design . It was also the first BMW to have those signature round lights encased in a shroud , which was a rather big deal at the time . Because of its slippery shape , it gained the nickname Dolphin . Also , the E36 was assembled here in semi-knock down kits , making it the only 3 Series built in the Philippines . <p> November 1997 marked the launch of the E46 , the fourth-generation 3 Series . While the design was evolutionary from the E36 , the E46 featured more tech and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It also came with a lot of safety systems , offering stability and traction control as standard in all variants . By this time , the 3 Series had established itself as one of the most ( if not , the most ) engaging cars to drive among its contemporaries and this generation further cemented that reputation . Whether it was the lowly 316i to the six-cylinder 325i , there was fun to be had behind the wheel of a 3 Series ; and that 's before we even get to the M3 . <p> Fast forward to March 2005 and the fifth-generation 3 Series debuted . Internally known as the E90 , it was , again , a radical departure from the previous model . It adopted the same design language as the 2001 7 Series and 2003 5 Series .

It was October 2018 when the seventh-generation model first made its appearance , and it builds on the foundations the past six generations had previously laid down . There 's tech , safety , and on-board communications , but it 's still in tune with its sports sedan roots . It also presents a new direction for BMW with its new taillight design and wider grill . Locally , the 3 Series had reverted back to an all-gas lineup with the 330i M Sport and 320i Sport . <p> In the span of 45 years , BMW had sold over 14 million 3 Series sedans , coupes , convertibles , and wagons .

@@71887238 <h> Banawe Horror Story : When you entrust your ride to the wrong shop <p> There are two sides to Banawe . In the eyes of many , the place is car-guy heaven . Affordable parts and aftermarket bits around every turn , the freedom to haggle , and skilled talyers and mechanics if you know where to look are among the reasons the area gained its legendary reputation . <p> Continue reading below ? <p> Unfortunately , there 's also a dark side to Banawe 's busy and bustling community . To the untrained eye and uninitiated , the place can also be a one-stop shop toward ruining your ride and voiding your warranty . <p> Guess which side the Nissan Navara in the photos below happened to visit ? <p> What you 're looking at is the result of a careless owner looking for a quick , not to mention cheap , fix . Remember : If something sounds too good to be true , it most probably is . It 's a saying that applies to car shops , and just about anything else in life for that matter . Sadly , it 's an adage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took up a Banawe shop 's offer to install a roll-out bed cover for the low , low price of just P15,000 . <p> IMAGE Drei Laurel <p> Continue reading below ? <p> The price alone should have raised an alarm already . Unfortunately , the owner bit and will have to live with the outcome . Now let 's go over the results one by one , shall we ? <p> For starters , the cover does n't roll out . Well , at least not without someone breaking their back to get it to do so . And the lock does n't work properly either . Chances are , operating this thing is only going to become more burdensome over time . <p> Then comes the sealant . Cracks are already beginning to show and , slowly but surely , chunks of it are starting to fall off ( an issue which we 're sure will only worsen moving forward ) . As you can see , the shop did a s*** job applying the adhesive , too . <p> IMAGE Drei Laurel <p> Continue reading below ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top are showing sign of it , you can bet it 's in other places , too . That 's a bad look . Even worse when you take into account the cover is barely a couple of months old . <p> The cherry on top of it all ? You might want to sit down for this one . Whoever did the installation ' jammed ' holes into the cargo bed for the drain pipe ( which does n't look proper by any means ) to pass through . He did n't drill holes , he did n't cut holes , he punched holes through it with something and did n't even bother to apply sealant . For reference , Google " pickup bed cover drain " to see what it should have looked like . <p> On the bright side : The shop made up for this hack job by throwing in a fancy ' Navara ' logo on the cover -- even if it is only stuck on with double-sided tape . <p> Continue reading below ? <p> IMAGE Drei Laurel <p> This could all have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicle while the shop worked on it . Sadly he did n't , leaving the Navara at the mercy of less-than-capable hands . <p> Basically , this owner paid someone to jam holes into his pickup bed and make it harder to load things onto it . Hopefully , it 's a lesson learned not just for him but for other inexperienced car owners thinking of heading to Banawe to score a sweet deal . We 're sure there are good deals in Banawe , but do your research and ask around before entrusting your ride to a shop you know nothing about . Again , if it 's too good to be true , it probably is. 
@@71887239 <h> How the Maserati GranTurismo taught me to appreciate GTs <p> To be honest , my Asian-centric mindset has always had trouble understanding the whole concept behind a grand tourer . Wikipedia defines it as " a performance and luxury automobile capable of high-speed and long-distance driving . " <p> That 's quite the disconnect for your average motorist in the Philippines . Need something for high speeds ? Okay , then go buy a sports car designed for the job -- usually , that means something fitted with a turbocharger or two . Want something for long distances ? Then you 'd be best by something with just enough hauling power for your needs , but not too much that you sacrifice fuel economy over long distances . Oh , and you wan na be comfy , so space is a must . <p> Yet grand tourers fly in the face of those conventions . In general , GTs are front-engined and rear-wheel-drive , have two doors paired to a coupe body , and are powered by engines with six or more cylinders . I get the performance part of them just fine , but it 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw it , the sports-car-like proportions meant a cramped and bumpy ride over the long haul , while the big engine pretty much ensured you 'd be guzzling up plenty of fuel as the mileage racked up . <p> Continue reading below ? <p> PHOTO : Jason Tulio <p> So it was a little difficult for me at first to look at the Maserati GranTurismo through a different lens when I was given a chance to take the MC variant out for a spin . But hey , I thought , how many chances do you get to drive the trident ? <p> Continue reading below ? <p> Looks-wise , the GranTurismo is a head-turner . A well-designed coupe with a long hood and a short tail is bound to have that effect . It 's got a distinct Italian flair to it as well , especially with the long headlights , the low grille , the bi-color paint job , and the all-black alloy wheels . Inside , the materials are undoubtedly premium , though the design leans a bit more toward the old-school , particularly the analog gauges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tulio <p> Continue reading below ? <p> Through the quiet streets of Clark , the GranTurismo provided a comfy and steady ride inside its luxurious cabin . I could see how despite its power and big engine , it 's adept for long drives as well -- provided the roads are Euro-smooth , of course . The leather seats simply hug you even more the longer you drive . The hydraulic steering is heavier than you 'd expect , but I imagine the added weight is better-suited for high-speed cruising than a light electronic setup . Put the pedal down , though , and the 454hp 4.7-liter V8 roars an exciting but refined tune . With a 0-100kph time of 4.7sec and a 301kph top speed , this cruiser is certainly not short on performance . <p> Now , do I see myself ever buying a grand tourer ? Unless I win the lotto and move to a place with much smoother roads , it 's not likely . But this brief drive taught me that in another part of the globe , a high-powered , long-distance car is indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most economical option for a long road trip , but I 'll be damned if it is n't way more fun than your average econobox. 
@@71887240 <p> Stories of the underdog overcoming all odds to defeat the bigger and better foe are nothing new , especially in sports movies . The formula was perfected when Sylvester Stallone slurred his way to an Academy Award nomination in Rocky , which came out 1976 . Almost a decade later this same formula was replicated in another movie , except instead of focusing on boxing and the heavyweight champion , it centered on a high school student taking on a group of bullies using the Japanese art form of karate . <p> Since it came out in 1984 , The Karate Kid has become one of the most quoted films of all time , and despite its predictable and somewhat cheesy premise , it possesses an unmistakeable charm that still warms audiences to this day .

This particular model ran on a 3.9-liter V8 engine mated to a very old school three-speed manual gearbox . <p> As Daniel takes it all in , no doubt reeling at the prospect of owning his own car , Mr. Miyagi drops him a valuable bit of wisdom : " Just remember , license never replace eye , ear , and brain .

Hybrid means the government mobilizes ODA money and government funds to finance priority infra projects . The public-private partnership , developed during the time of the Macapagal-Arroyo administration , is also part of the BBB program . Resigned Neda Secretary Ernesto Pernia revealed that he favors the PPP modality , which relies fully on the private sector in the funding and implementation of infra projects . <p> This column shares the concern of government officials on the gravity of the present Covid-triggered socio-economic crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displacements . The present crisis is comparable to the recession-depression situation during the last years of the Marcos administration ( 1980-1985 ) . The unpayable external debt then triggered a full-blown economic crisis and bankrupted hundreds of manufacturing/commercial firms , resulting in massive unemployment and workers ' protests . <p> The IMF-WB solution to the debt-economic crisis in the 1980s was a " structural adjustment program " ( SAP ) that subjected the Philippines to a severe austerity program while requiring the country to service fully the Marcosian debt legacy and accept the triple neo-liberal economic policies : privatization , trade/investment liberalization and deregulation of various economic sectors . Outcomes ? The decade of the 1980s became a decade of economic stagnation , deindustrialization and de-agricultural development . It was the decade when Philippine neighbors ( Malaysia , Singapore , South Korea , Taiwan and Thailand ) left the country behind in the growth race in Asia . <p> It is important that a Covid-related recovery plan is able to prevent disastrous outcomes similar to what the SAP program of the 1980s gave to the nation . A balanced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is needed . <p> Along this line , two major questions need to be answered and clarified by the policy-makers . First , what are the major weaknesses of the economy today ? Second , what are the policy options available to the policy-makers in addressing these weaknesses ? <p> On question number one , the following weaknesses of the economy can easily be validated : <p> One , the nation 's principal economic lifeline -- the overseas Filipino workers numbering over 10 million and remitting over $35 billion a year -- is tottering . The major OFW-receiving countries ( Europe , Middle East , East/Southeast Asia , etc. ) have been ravaged by Covid-19 and have become inhospitable to OFWs and other migrant workers . The global cruise industry and sea-based logistics industry , serviced mainly by Filipino seafarers , are now comatose . We expect return migration will be a big reality except in the case of Filipino health workers . As a result , total remittances are likely to go down . <p> Two , the call center-BPO sector has been declining since 2017 , as per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ICT-based DIY communications , service offshoring by America 's Fortune 500 is likely to go down faster . The closure of the Nokia facility at UP Technohub is a sign on the dimming prospects for the sector . <p> Three , the Peza-registered and Clark-Subic-hosted electronics , semiconductors and auto parts asssemblers are also in crisis . Not because of the proposed Citira law , which seeks to withdraw fiscal incentives to these locators , but mainly due to the disruptions caused by the technology revolution ( automation , robotization , AI , etc. ) , trade conflicts ( US-China trade war ) , and weakening global demand as a result of the pandemic . As it is , the so-called Factory Asia based on the global value chains developed by the multinationals from the 1980s to 2010s has been " fracturing " or disintegrating . These GVCs are now being overhauled by the global outsourcing firms .

Even government officials , who have embraced the rice trade liberalization law , are now singing a different tune -- " plant , plant , plant . " But the sector is hobbled by supply chain bottlenecks , lack of coherent government ( national and local ) vision on the sector and problems related to the virus containment program . <p> Seven , the need to address the food and survival needs of the population under the Covid-19 lockdown has made visible the huge informal sector of the economy , truly the country 's biggest employer .

@@71888240 <h> World Bank : Virus , oil price dip hurt remittance flows <p> Instead of their families welcoming them at the airport , Filipino workers returning home will be met by Philippine Coast Guard and Airport Police members who will escort them to buses that will take them to their quarantine place . Thousands of OFWs are estimated to have been laid off , placed on forced leave , or suffered pay cuts due to the Covid-19 pandemic . The Department of Foreign Affairs said Filipinos wishing to return will be repatriated . <p> REMITTANCES from Filipinos abroad are expected to decline due to the coronavirus 2019 ( Covid-19 ) pandemic , according to the World Bank , which said the projected fall in remittances of migrant workers worldwide would be the steepest in history . <p> In a Migration and Development Brief titled " Covid-19 Crisis Through a Migration Lens , " the World Bank said remittances by overseas Filipinos still have not slowed to date at 4.8 percent in January and 4.4 percent in February . <p> However , the World Bank cited the estimate earlier made by former Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Ernesto M. Pernia that remittances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pandemic . <p> " We do expect a decline in remittances , particularly from OFWs overseas Filipino workers engaged in tourism-related businesses . This comes up to only about 4 percent to 5 percent of remittances . We still need to factor in the lower oil prices in the simulation , though , " National Economic and Development Authority ( Neda ) Undersecretary for Policy and Planning Rosemarie G. Edillon told the BusinessMirror . <p> Factoring oil prices in the estimates would affect remittances since millions of OFWs are working in oil-producing countries in the Middle East . <p> The continuing plunge in world oil prices further shook the industry on Tuesday , when prices dived so low -- at negative values -- that some traders paid just to have the oil stocks taken from them . <p> Based on the 2018 National Migration Survey of the Philippine Statistics Authority ( PSA ) , majority of Filipinos who work abroad went to the Middle East . <p> Data showed around 20 percent of all Filipinos who migrated abroad in the past five years went to Saudi Arabia . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent went to Kuwait ; and another 7 percent went to Qatar . <p> In a recent Ateneo de Manila University ( ADMU ) Policy Brief , Ateneo Center for Economic Research and Development ( ACERD ) Director Alvin P. Ang and Institute for Migration and Development Issues ( IMDI ) Executive Director Jeremaiah M. Opiniano estimated around 300,000 to 400,000 OFWs will be laid off or suffer pay cuts due to the pandemic . <p> Ang and Opiniano said this will likely cut the remittances from OFWs by 10 to 20 percent or as much as $3 billion to $6 billion , " the steepest decline in remittances in Philippine migration history . " This means remittances could only reach $24 billion to $27 billion this year from $30 billion in 2019 . <p> The high estimates were disputed , though , by recruitment industry veteran Lito Soriano , who said in a separate statement that he projected declines in remittances to only reach less than $3 billion , " a 10-percent decline from the $30-billion remittance in 2019 , " adding that the $3 billion-$6 billion estimates by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ways and Means chairman Joey Salceda 's $5-billion projection -- were too high . <p> For its part , the World Bank said : " Year-on-year growth in remittances for January and February 2020 was 4.8 percent and 4.4 percent , respectively , suggesting little slowdown to date . However , the government is anticipating a 20- to 30-percent decline in remittances for 2020 and a corresponding growth rate of 2 percent due to the fallout from Covid-19 . " <h> Countercyclical <p> The World Bank said remittances have a countercyclical flow . When crisis hits host countries , old and new migrants tend to send less remittances , similar to what happened during the Global Economic Crisis . <p> But when crisis hits their home countries , migrants increase the amounts they send to their families in their countries of origin . This is similar to the increase of remittances observed when the Philippines was affected by the the bird-flu pandemic in November 2003 . <p> " The persistence of the stock of international migrants over an economic cycle or a crisis is an important factor in the persistence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send money home but also those migrants who arrived a long time ago , " the World Bank added . <h> Lowest fees <p> Meanwhile , the World Bank said remittance fees to the Philippines are among the lowest in East Asia and the Pacific . <p> Using fourth-quarter 2018 and 2019 data , the World Bank said remittance costs of sending $200 to the Philippines from Singapore was at 2.9 percent in 2018 and 2.2 percent in 2019 . <p> Remittance fees from Kuwait to the Philippines were also low at 3.4 percent in 2018 and 2.8 percent in 2019 . <p> However , these are average costs and more needs to be done to reduce remittance costs not only in the Philippines but also in other parts of the world . <p> Remittances from South Africa to China were the highest at 25.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2019 . This was higher than the 21 percent posted in the same period of 2018 . <p> Reducing remittance costs is part of the Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) , particularly SDG 10 on reducing inequality within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remittance costs should be reduced to less than 3 percent of migrant remittances . It also aims to eliminate remittance corridors with remittance costs that are higher than 5 percent . <p> " The five lowest-cost corridors in the region averaged 2.6 percent , while the five highest-cost corridors averaged 15.4 percent as of the fourth quarter of 2019 , " the World Bank said . <p> The World Bank said global remittances are projected to decline sharply by about 20 percent in 2020 due to the economic crisis induced by the Covid-19 pandemic and the resulting lockdowns of geographical barriers and industries . <h> Sharpest fall in history <p> The projected fall , which would be the sharpest decline in recent history , is largely due to a fall in the wages and employment of migrant workers , who tend to be more vulnerable to loss of employment and wages during an economic crisis in a host country . <p> Remittances to low- and middle-income countries ( LMICs ) are projected to fall by 19.7 percent to $445 billion , representing a loss of a crucial financing lifeline for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of income for developing countries . The ongoing economic recession caused by Covid-19 is taking a severe toll on the ability to send money home and makes it all the more vital that we shorten the time to recovery for advanced economies , " said World Bank Group President David Malpass . <p> " Remittances help families afford food , health care and basic needs . As the World Bank Group implements fast , broad action to support countries , we are working to keep remittance channels open and safeguard the poorest communities ' access to these most basic needs . " <p> Remittance flows are expected to fall across all World Bank Group regions , most notably in Europe and Central Asia at 27.5 percent followed by Sub-Saharan Africa at 23.1 percent . <p> World Bank remittances in South Asia are expected to decline 22.1 percent ; the Middle East and North Africa , 19.6 percent ; Latin America and the Caribbean , 19.3 percent ; and East Asia and the Pacific , 13 percent . <p> With this , the World Bank said effective social protection systems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Quick actions that make it easier to send and receive remittances can provide much-needed support to the lives of migrants and their families .

@@71897231 <p> It has already been over two months since the country 's first positive case of COVID-19 was detected and over a month since Luzon was placed under an Enhanced Community Quarantine ( ECQ ) . Still , our government 's response and emergency guidelines to the pandemic are evolving daily . <p> What appeared to be one of the well-defined aspects of the government response plan though was the immediate distribution of financial aid to low-income families , many of whom are daily wage earners whose income was drastically affected by the ECQ . This Social Amelioration Program ( SAP ) received the bulk of the funds re-programed by the new Bayanihan to Heal as One Act . <p> Unfortunately , the roll-out of the SAP was much slower than many had hoped . According to data from the Department of Social Welfare and Development ( DSWD ) , only 21% of the allocated cash subsidies were successfully distributed to beneficiaries as of April 13 , 2020 , two days before the original date the ECQ was set to end . <p> Surely many of us were disappointed but not entirely surprised by our government 's inefficient response @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have already gotten used to the inefficiency , red tape , and lack of transparency encountered when dealing with public institutions and officials . <p> However , there are still those that defend the government 's performance . Some of them argue that the task of distributing P200 billion worth of assistance to millions of families spread across Luzon is by no means easy . And that because of this , we should also understand if the government is slow to implement its programs and is less exact about where the funds have gone . <p> And it is true , the government does have a lot of money to spend on its crisis response . In fact , the P200 billion allocated for financial aid by the Bayanihan to Heal to as One Act does not yet include the 75 billion the law also allotted for health services . Besides that , the government can also tap into the Department of Health 's P100 billion and the PhilHealth 's P71 billion budgets for the year 2020 to improve its COVID-19 response and health services . <p> Furthermore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line with the Central Bank , to around P280 billion pesos it loaned from the World Bank , and billions more in pledges from the private sector . And though the Department of Finance considered all of these amounts when it announced the value of its latest economic package , P1.45 trillion is by no means an insignificant amount of taxpayer money . <p> So yes , the government is being tasked to distribute and spend an extraordinarily large amount of money to respond to COVID-19 . And while it may make political sense for the national government to centralize its response , it does not make practical sense . Instead of politicizing the crisis , the government should focus on improving the efficiency program implementation . <p> The key to unlocking this improvement is for the national government to realize that it must stop with it political maneuvering and get on with the program . <p> Hardworking and creative local government units ( LGUs ) are its partners on the ground . Tap into their granular understanding of the needs of their constituents and enable them to respond to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society groups are its willing partners ready to mobilize their resources , knowledge , networks and time to help communities and frontlines . Maximize the passion , credibility and networks of civil society groups to launch information dissemination campaigns to inform people about important developments and educate them on how to keep safe and healthy during the pandemic . <p> Take advantage of the private sector 's specialized expertise and efficiency to more effectively implement government response programs . Just imagine if the DSWD partnered with initiatives such as Project Ugnayan to distribute aide to low-income communities ? <p> If Project Ugnayan is n't familiar , it is an initiative led by the Philippine Disaster Resilience Foundation ( PDRF ) in cooperation with the country 's top business groups . According to Project Lead Fernando Zobel de Ayala it is an " unprecedented assembly of so many of the country 's corporations and business families " , who , soon after the ECQ began , started to raise funds to provide aid to low-income communities in Metro Manila . <p> In just over three weeks , the project raised over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable Metro Manila communities with assistance in the form of grocery vouchers for food and essential supplies . <p> In addition to making the implementation of response programs more efficient , the collaboration between the government , private sector and civil society groups could also lead to much needed transparency in the disbursement and allocation of the crisis response funds . And with the government 's health , social and economic package worth over one trillion pesos , the increased openness , transparency and accountability that multi-sectoral collaboration can bring is very much needed . <p> Manuel V. Pangilinan , the co-chairman of PDRF , said that he was proud to be part of Project Ugnayan because it represented an " extraordinary collaboration between industries " . <p> We will continue to need this extraordinary collaboration between the business community , civil society , LGUs and the National Government to rebuild the extensive economic damage of this pandemic . <p> As PDRF Co-Chairman Jaime Augusto Zobel de Ayala said , " This is a movement we should nurture as we prepare to let people return to work and to re-start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@71897236 <h> Taxation during times of crisis <p> We all know the familiar saying that taxes are the lifeblood of the nation . This truism is more pronounced during times of crisis , such as the Covid-19 pandemic that the entire world is encountering now . As governments of practically all countries are infusing massive amounts of funds to address the requirements of the virus attack , the leaders of the states will have to be conscious on how to sustain the supply of financial resources . For this , most governments resort to borrowing and taxation . <p> The Department of Finance recently reported that the collections of the top 2 collection agencies , i.e. , the Bureau of Internal Revenue ( BIR ) and Bureau of Customs ( BOC ) for the first quarter of the year amounted only to P600.86 billion . This is 1.66 percent lower than the previous year 's first quarter gatherings of P611.03 billion .

It is very rare that government revenues from tax collections not to exceed that of the prior period collections . I anticipate that the full adverse impact on tax collections is still forthcoming since the business slowdown brought about by the Covid-19 lockdown started only in the latter part of March . Hence , it can be expected that the corresponding slowdown in tax payments arising from such will be felt only thereafter . Another barometer as to how BIR tax collections may move is the payment of the income taxes for 2019 operations , which traditionally are fully paid by April 15 of the following year . The collection goal for this amounts to P175.8 billion or a substantial 7 percent of BIR collections expected from this source of taxes for the month of April . However , since the tax payment deadline for the 2019 income tax payments have been extended to May 30 , 2020 , the BIR will be anxiously awaiting if the income tax payments will be up to expectations . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the slowdown or closure of business operations . I implore our taxpayers to prioritize amounts from their available finances for the payment of their taxes , which are most needed at this time of crisis . Delaying or deferring the payment of taxes is reneging on our civic and legal obligations . <p> The BIR and BOC are to be commended for putting in measures to alleviate the tax compliance obligations of taxpayers in the past weeks . Both agencies have issued guidelines that include extension of tax payment and compliance dates , streamlining the regulatory rules and processes , and other support mechanisms to lessen the burden on taxpayers .

@@71918233 <h> Coronavirus is causing a flurry of plastic waste . Campaigners fear it may be permanent <h> Discarded masks and gloves have become a common sight in cities around the world . <p> ( CNN ) -- All of the defining images of the coronavirus pandemic seem to feature one thing : plastic . <p> Surgical masks , gloves , protective equipment , body bags -- the Covid-19 crisis has spurred a rapid expansion in the production of desperately-needed plastic products , with governments racing to boost their stockpiles and regular citizens clamoring for their share of supplies . <p> Such production is necessary . But all that plastic ends up somewhere -- and environmental campaigners fear it is just the tip of a looming iceberg , with the pandemic causing a number of serious challenges to their efforts to reduce plastic pollution . <p> From people discarding plastic gloves and masks in cities across the world to important regulations on the use of plastic being scrapped , rolled back or delayed , the problem has taken a back seat during one of the most significant public health crises of modern times . <p> The implications of those trends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We know that plastic pollution is a global problem -- it existed before the pandemic , " Nick Mallos of US-based NGO Ocean Conservancy tells CNN . " ( But ) we 've seen a lot of industry efforts to roll back some of the great progress that 's been made . <p> " We need to be quite cautious about where we go , post-pandemic , " Mallos adds . <h> PPE adding to oceans ' plastic burden <p> The coronavirus crisis has sparked a personal protective equipment ( PPE ) arms race around the world as governments rush to stockpile masks , gloves , visors and gowns . The battle has proven so intense that some have resorted to international mudslinging . <p> It comes as a growing number of countries encourage or order their citizens to wear face coverings in public -- once seen as a personal preference with minimal benefit , but now the preferred guidance in the US and much of Europe . <p> And while the moves are important from a public health perspective , one immediate impact is clear on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house there are discarded gloves and masks all over the neighborhood , " says John Hocevar , oceans campaign director at Greenpeace USA . <p> " It 's been raining here for two days , so these are very quickly washed down into the sewer . Here in Washington DC , they end up in the Anacostia River , out in the Chesapeake Bay , and then the Atlantic Ocean . " <p> PPE has become an additional threat to the world 's oceans , which have been choking under the weight of plastic at a rapidly increasing rate . <p> Global plastic production has quadrupled over the past four decades , a 2019 study found , with its authors warning that if that trend continues , the making of plastics will make up 15% of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 . By comparison , all of the world 's forms of transportation now account for 15% of emissions . <p> Other studies have estimated that some 8 million tons of plastic trash leak into the ocean annually , with the rate getting worse every year . <p> But PPE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make it particularly hazardous for marine life , " says Hocevar . " Gloves , like plastic bags , can appear to be jellyfish or other types of foods for sea turtles , for example . The straps on masks can present entangling hazards . " <p> Over time , those products break down and add to the vast collections of microplastics in our seas , air and food . And the irony is that , while we produce and discard plastic to fight one public health crisis , we may be slowly contributing to another . <p> The risks of microplastics to human health are still being studied . One stems from the fact that microplastics passing through wastewater plants can pick up harmful bacteria , which they can carry with them . If we ingest the plastics , we may ingest the bacteria . <p> Another is that plastics have a number of chemicals added at the manufacturing stage , and it 's possible that these are released in the body . <p> " First and foremost , this is a time of public health and safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we also have to realize that the broader waste issue that is being highlighted by this pandemic really matters . " <p> " We know many places around the world do n't have this capacity to manage this waste , " he adds . " This is harmful to human health , and to the oceans and the environment . " <p> There 's little that can be done , given the timespan of this crisis , to reduce the amount of plastic involved in countering coronavirus . But campaigners hope changes will come . <p> " We are seeing some people experimenting with disinfecting PPE now , but that 's largely out of necessity -- we just do n't have enough , " says Hocevar . <p> " Longer term , we 'll want to be a little bit more intentional about that , and develop reusable , disinfectable PPE .

A ban on such items has been put on hold in US states such as Maine , while retailers including Starbucks have banned reusable products to protect against the spread of Covid-19 . <p> The pattern has prompted concern from organizations including the World Bank . " These measures have all been announced as temporary , but how long will they stick , fed by anxiety around health concerns ? " Grzegorz Peszko , a lead economist at the organization , asked in a blog post last month . <p> Driving that concern is a feeling among conservationists that the plastics industry is seizing its moment to capitalize on public health concerns by promoting the use of its products . <p> " Parts of the plastic industry have worked really hard to exploit fears around Covid , " Hocevar says . <p> " It 's disappointing that lobbying groups are taking advantage of this climate of fear and uncertainty , " Mallos adds . " Using this opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our challenges . " <p> In March , the Plastics Industry Association wrote to the US Department of Health , asking it to " make a public statement on the health and safety benefits seen in single-use plastics . " <p> The pandemic is " forcing many Americans , businesses and government officials to realize that single-use plastics are often the safest choice , " the group said . <p> Conservation groups criticized studies cited by the body , and have talked up others which suggest that Covid-19 lives for longer on plastic than on most other surfaces . CNN has contacted the Plastics Industry Association for comment . <p> Hocevar remains confident that rollbacks will be temporary , and notes that some progress in his organization 's cause has been made even during the pandemic -- citing new restrictions against single-use plastic in Orange County unveiled in April . <p> But Mallos fears the daily onslaught of coronavirus developments means important setbacks are going under the radar . <p> " We are oversaturated daily with news around the pandemic ... there is so much information streaming to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missed , " he says .

@@71935231 <h> Inflation king of Asia , world 's second worst stock market <h> My Cup Of Liberty <p> By Bienvenido S. Oplas , Jr . <p> The Philippines ' inflation rate has been rising nonstop ever since the TRAIN law was implemented : 2.9% in December 2017 , 3.4% in January 2018 ( first month of TRAIN law ) , 3.8% in February , 5.7% in July , 6.4% in August , and 6.7% in September . <p> This is the country 's highest inflation rate in nearly a decade , since 7.2% in February 2009 . The increase largely came from the food and non-alcoholic beverages index , a big component of the overall consumer price index ( CPI ) , which increased to 9.7% last month . <p> So the Philippines is now the undisputed inflation king or queen of Asia . Year to date ( Ytd , January to September ) , 2018 inflation is already 5.0% , a lot higher than the government target of 2-4% full year 2018 . <p> In the stock market , the Philippine Stock Exchange ( PSEi ) as of Oct. 5 closing was the second worst performing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst performing for several months this year but last week , it has recovered while the Philippines and Turkey continued their slide . <p> Last 52 weeks , PSEi ( -14.8% ) is also the second worst in the world after China ( Shanghai , -15.8% ) . <p> To control high inflation , the most visible action by the government comes from the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas ( BSP ) raising domestic interest rates . I do not think that this will be effective since the current inflation is largely cost-push , starting from TRAIN tax hikes in January and exacerbated by high world oil prices . This is not demand-pull inflation . <p> Another action is agricultural import liberalization , expanding rice importation to help reduce domestic rice prices , and replacing quantitative restrictions ( QR ) with tariffs of up to 35% , the bill is being hastened in Congress . The impact so far is not clearly felt as rice prices remain high . <p> One ' action ' by government is non-action on fare hike petitions by buses , jeepneys , taxi , and air-con @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become terribly insensitive and Machiavellian in pinning down public land transportation operators to endure very high oil prices with no corresponding fare hike , except the P1 increase in jeepneys which is still not sufficient . <p> Domestic airlines ' petition to have fuel surcharge on ticket prices have been granted and this will have inflationary pressure from October onwards . Another pressure will come from a series of wage hikes . <p> One single most important measure that government can do to reduce inflation is to cut the VAT rate from 12% to around 8% and significantly reduce the exempted sectors . My best example for suggesting this is Malaysia . It had a gross sales tax ( GST ) of 6% until May then it was abolished in June . Its average inflation rate three months before ( March 1.3% , April 1.4% , May 1.8% ) was 1.5% , became 0.3% three months after ( June 0.8% , July 0.9% , August 0.2% ) . <p> High and multiple taxes are always inflationary . To help reduce high inflation , taxes should be smaller and fewer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be smaller and fewer too . <p> Bienvenido S.

The jobless figures could mean more than half of Filipinos aged 15 years old to 65 years old would be unemployed after a 75-day lockdown . <p> These are not just merely statistics ; these figures illustrate the gravity of the pandemic and its impact on businesses and households as the country faces an economic downturn . <p> For smaller firms , this can mean scaled-down operations -- filing for bankruptcy at worst . For low-income households , this can mean drained savings , which ultimately puts stress on their cash flows . <p> They , along with big businesses , are seeking relief as the flow has been constricted . <p> The government 's response was the " Bayanihan to Heal as One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to implement 30-day grace period for all loans with principal and/or interest falling due during the enhanced community quarantine ( ECQ ) . The ECQ , which began mid-March , was extended until May 31 . <p> Government 's move is , however , a double-edged sword : providing relief for the borrowers while constricting the liquidity of banks and financial institutions . <p> In a battle between showing compassion and staying afloat , the banking industry is trying to find a middle ground to not lose the war . <h> Delayed payments <p> This means a reduction in the carrying amount of an asset -- which is loan receivable in this circumstance -- due to extension of debt payments , Isla Lipana &amp; Co . Assurance Partner Zaldy D. Aguirre told the BusinessMirror . <p> " Delayed loan payments can give rise to an impairment loss unless the bank is compensated for the time value of money during the extended payment period , " he said . " Postponing the collection also distorts the cash flows in duration . " <p> The Isla Lipana official explained that the delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading to concerns over liquidity and adverse impact on income statement . <p> " Delays in receiving payments for amortization from customers will constrain banks to find funds to offset these obligations as cash flows remain frozen , " ING Bank Manila Economist Nicholas Antonio T. Mapa said in an email to the BusinessMirror . <p> Along with this , banks will be on the lookout as well for spikes in nonperforming loans ( NPLs ) as these can burn the bottomline . <p> The Bankers Association of the Philippines ( BAP ) has warned that NPLs may surge to approximately P240 billion to P300 billion in the coming months . The BAP also expects that 50 percent to 80 percent , or P120 billion to P240 billion , will be written off . <p> It is more noteworthy , however , that NPL ratio -- portion of gross NPL in the total loans -- of the local banks has been stable during the period , Aguirre said . This means that the sector has a low exposure to default loans . <p> He noted that NPL ratio has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lowest in the region . <h> Framework alignment <p> WITH bad loans on the rise , experts advised banks to be more discerning of the situation . <p> Mapa said that even borrowers with good credit standing can be cash-strapped due to the pandemic , which obligates the bank to carefully assess the clients ' profiles before tagging a borrowing as NPL or default . <p> " Banks now have the difficult task of gauging which creditors can remain to be good credit after the lockdown and which ones will truly struggle to make payments , " Mapa said . <p> Effective communication is key to managing NPLs and maintaining good customer experience during this pandemic , said Alden Basbas , country manager for the local unit of California-based analytics firm Fair Isaac Corp . ( Fico ) , in an email to the BusinessMirror . <p> This means that banks will be dealing with numerous inbound customer calls , Basbas said , suggesting that automating the process can ease the burden . The Fico country head said that the firm has an artificial intelligence ( AI ) -driven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and complexity of inbound communications . <p> He stressed the need to identify " which consumers will catch up with payments and which ones will default . " <p> Ricafort expressed confidence that local banks are equipped to evaluate credit standing , noting that regulators are requiring them to " have credit risk weights on various loans , depending on the risk profile of borrowers , under the risk-based capital adequacy frameworks that are aligned with global best practices . " <h> Expanding buffers <p> PREPARING for the inevitable , banks have been gearing up by increasing buffer for potential loan losses . <p> " In 2020 , due to the pandemic , the banking industry is bracing for a dramatic surge in past due accounts after the moratorium period . This could cause a spike in the NPL ratio as well as sharp increase in loan loss provisions , " Aguirre warned . <p> Bank of the Philippine Islands ( BPI ) recently reported that its loan loss provision was increased by more than twofold to P1.8 billion . <p> Security Bank Corp . set its loan loss buffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of P4.2 billion -- in the first three months . <p> Metropolitan Bank &amp; Trust Co . ( Metrobank ) allocated P5-billion reserves in the first three months , significantly higher than P2.4 billion for the same period in 2019 . <p> Union Bank of the Philippines ( UnionBank ) accrued P1.3 billion for potential loan losses in January-March period , up by over sevenfold from P174.6 million the previous year . <p> The Philippine National Bank ( PNB ) said its loan provisions reached P3.4 billion during the period , higher by P3.0 billion compared to the P346 million during the same period last year . <p> As of writing , other listed banks have not yet disclosed the recent figures of their loan loss reserves . <p> BSP data show that loan loss provision of the local banking sector reached P181.14 billion as of end-February , higher than January 's P178.42 billion . Provision for potential default rose by nearly 15 percent to P170.52 billion last year from P148.34 billion in 2018 . Loan loss buffer was earmarked at P145.84 billion in 2017 . <h> Not last resort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses from loan defaults . <p> " Debt restructuring is a strategy to improve the chances of collection , thus , mitigating the risk of the loan defaulting and becoming completely worthless , " Aguirre explained . <p> He said this process allows extending the terms of the debt and even reducing original interest rate . <p> " Accounting-wise , debt restructuring can result in undesirable P&amp;L profit and loss effects due to changes in cash flows between the original debt and renegotiated debt unless there is proper compensation for the time value of money , " he said . <p> UnionBank Chief Economist Ruben Carlo O. Asuncion , in an email to the BusinessMirror , agreed that debt restructuring could ease the consequences of NPLs . Asuncion added that debt restructuring " may potentially help both private companies and financial institutions if done correctly . " <h> Demand for borrowings <p> PRIOR to the Luzon-wide lock down , demand for borrowings registered an uptick . <p> The Central Bank reported that outstanding loans of universal and commercial banks , net of reverse repurchase placements , picked up pace to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Majority of the loans -- which comprised 86.4 percent of the total -- were for production activities , registering 9.4 percent in February from the 8.8 percent notched in January . <p> The growth was driven by activities from real estate ; financial and insurance ; electricity , gas , steam and air conditioning supply ; information and communication ; and construction . <p> Bank lending even further grew in March at 12.9 percent , according to recent BSP data , driven by loans for production activities . <p> As of February , total outstanding loans provided by universal and commercial banks stood at P9.88 trillion , a little higher compared to P9.87 trillion a month ago , according to preliminary report by the BSP . <h> Positive effects <p> LOOKING at a three-year history , borrowings rendered by the banks have been on an uptrend , averaging at P8.95 trillion , per calculations by the BusinessMirror based on BSP data . <p> BusinessMirror computations revealed that total loans grew by 14.63 percent to P9.02 trillion in 2018 from P7.87 trillion in 2017 . In 2019 , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Asuncion attributed the increasing loans in recent years to robust economic growth which encourages and allows businesses to borrow and fund expansion . <p> " The consequent increase of economic activities does not assure the success of all these expansions . Some make it ; and some do not , " he pointed out . <p> Gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth last year registered at 6 percent -- from 5.9 percent previously -- after revising calculations using 2018 as base year instead of 2000 . This means that the country 's economic growth has been growing by at least 6 percent since 2012 . <h> Rising demand <p> ASUNCION said that demand for loans would only surge in the next few months amid lower policy rates . <p> " With interest rates declining , the expectation is for loans to increase , " he said . " Demand may simply come from the fact that rates are ultra-low . " <p> The Central Bank recently cut rates by 50 basis points ( bp ) , bringing overnight repurchase rate to 2.75 percent ahead of the May 21 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ requirement ratio on reservable liabilities of universal and commercial banks by 200 bp to 12 percent . <p> Aguirre said that demand for new loans in the coming months are likely to be driven by the micro , small and medium enterprises ( MSMEs ) to acquire immediate liquidity and address concern on cash flows . <p> " Due to the ongoing lockdown , most companies are not able to sell their goods and services and collect their receivables , yet they continue to shell out cash for some important bills , " he said . " This condition results in depletion of cash reserves and tightening of liquidity of businesses . " <h> Expecting improvement <p> ACCORDING to the BSP 's Senior Bank Loan Officers ' Survey , most respondents were expecting a steady demand for loans coming from firms and household in the second quarter . <p> Using diffusion index approach -- or a condition where there is net tightening of overall credit standards for loans -- the BSP revealed a disparity . <p> Loan demand coming from businesses is expected to improve in the second quarter due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generated funds and more inventory financing needs . <p> Demand for household loans , meanwhile , is traversing the opposite path this quarter because of " less attractive financing terms " and availability of other fund sources , the survey noted . <p> In the first quarter , loan demand for enterprise increased due to higher investment in plant or equipment , lower interest rates and inventory financing needs . Household consumption and housing investment , meanwhile , drove the demand for household loans during the period . <p> The BSP conducted the survey from February 28 to April 7 . <h> Stable to negative <p> ULTIMATELY , the pandemic-induced market volatility , coupled with delayed loan payments , can drag the profits of the banks , Aguirre said . <p> " The grim economic outlook on account of the pandemic is currently rattling the market . Many economies ( including the Philippines ) are projected to shrink due to reduced consumer spending and slowdown in business activities , " he explained . <p> GDP contracted 0.2 percent in the first quarter , the first time since 1998 , due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserves did not help either as the move pulled earnings , which is the case for many banks during the first quarter . <p> Philstocks Financial Inc . Analyst Piper Chaucer E. Tan , meanwhile , noted that he was expecting a U-shaped recovery for banks ' earnings , noting that those with good digital banking and online presence are likely to better weather the storm . <p> In the first quarter , total earnings of local banks rose by 9.29 percent to P59.66 billion from P54.59 billion the previous year for the same period , according to BSP data . <p> The banking sector 's profits climbed by 28.35 percent to P230.67 billion last year from P179.71 billion in 2018 . The bottom-line of local banks reached P168.07 billion in 2017 . <p> Nonetheless , debt watcher Moody 's Investors Service revised its outlook for the Philippine banking system to " negative " from " stable " in April due to possible decline in profits amid the pandemic . <p> While it believes most large companies could withstand the disruptions , the prolonged lockdown , however , would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Saving on costs <p> STILL , analysts say robust capitalization can cushion the hits from Covid-19 as well as government measures to contain its spread . <p> Data from the Central Bank showed that the capitalization of local banks rose by 8.3 percent to P2.32 trillion in March from P2.14 trillion the previous year for same month . Moody 's , meanwhile , said that capitalization of the industry will remain stable given that rated local banks have an average common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 13.7 percent as of end-2019 . <p> Still , Aguirre said that banks should focus on cutting costs to improve profitability because they are likely to miss revenue targets this year . <p> " Potential cost savings can also be derived via simplification of products and services and the underlying processes , " he said , noting that digitalization is one such measure . <p> " While the digitization program may require sizable initial investments , huge cost savings in the long run can be achieved through reduced manpower requirement in back-office and support functions , " Aguirre explained . <p> Banks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase capital buffer , he added . <p> Apart from the banks ' financial position , their share performance has also been affected by the pandemic . <h> First-quarter bloodbath <p> THE first quarter was undoubtedly a bloodbath for the local bourse , registering a whopping 32.15-percent drop as the coronavirus pandemic prompted investors to stay at the sidelines . <p> " As Covid-19 pandemic disrupts our healthcare system , it also wreaks havoc on our economy not just for the Philippines , but as the global economy actually goes into a recession , ending the economic prosperity and bull run for the market for the past 11 years , " Philstocks ' Tan told this newspaper . <p> Financial stocks were no exception , he added , noting that this sector was one of the worst performers in the counter during the first quarter . <p> Tan noted that financial stocks recorded a 34.34-percent drop in shares , the sharpest next to the mining and oil sector at 48.57 percent .

Have you ever questioned them ? , " Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Hua Chunying asked reporters at a press briefing last week . <p> US reporters have challenged the Trump administration about that claim and have been given no evidence to support it . <p> But it 's not just the US administration that 's pointing fingers . <p> A report by the European Union 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia " have continued to widely target conspiracy narratives and disinformation both at public audiences in the EU and the wider neighborhood .

Reports that claim China has been spreading disinformation on Twitter are groundless . " <h> Questionable success <p> China 's coronavirus campaign appears to have had mixed success so far . <p> A poll in Italy released last month found that for the first time Italians are looking more to China than to the United States as a potential international partner . <p> But Chinese state media have had paid-content insert deals canceled by influential papers .

These foregone revenues to fuel economic activity can be used by businesses , especially micro , small and medium enterprises ( MSMEs ) , to fund their operations and retain their employees . <p> The urgent passage of the CREATE bill , Dominguez said , is one of the five measures that he has recommended to President Duterte to help the country beat the pandemic and bring it back to the path of inclusive and shared prosperity . <p> Aside from the outright tax cut , among the major features of the CREATE bill are the additional 1-percentage point reduction every year from 2023 to 2027 until the CIT rate reaches 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive recipients from 2 to 7 years provided under the original CITIRA to 4 to 9 years to help them adjust in this difficult time ; lengthening the period of the net operating loss carryover ( NOLCO ) for non-large taxpayers from the current three years to five years , which will be credited for losses incurred in 2020 ; and the flexibility of the Fiscal Incentives Review Board ( FIRB ) , which will be allowed to recommend to the President the grant of longer incentives and additional non-fiscal incentives for deserving investments . <p> " Be assured that the Duterte administration will do its very best to protect the economic gains together we have made , support our recovery , strengthen our resilience , and bring us back to the path of inclusive and shared prosperity , " Dominguez told the business leaders during the virtual meeting .

Well , these actors are so good at being antagonists that they 've perfected their craft to a T. <p> With a long list of K-drama kontrabidas , we asked Pinays who they found the *most annoying* ever . Check out their picks below ! <h> 1 . Nam Gyu Man from Remember ( 2015 ) <p> In Remember , Nam Goong Min plays the role of Nam Gyu Man , the son of a chaebol who always uses his anger to get his way . You 'll see him smashing objects and even threatening his father in the drama ! IMO , he could really use a chill pill . <h> 2 . Hyun So Ah from My ID Is Gangnam Beauty ( 2018 ) <p> Hyun So Ah ( Jo Woo Ri ) is a victim of society 's superficial standards , so much so that she grows up to be extremely jealous , insecure , and constantly wanting attention from everyone . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is being manipulative and two-faced towards people . <p> Continue reading below ? <h> 3 . Kang Ye Seo from Sky Castle ( 2018 ) <p> Kang Ye Seo ( Kim Hye Yoon ) from Sky Castle gives a whole new meaning to the term " grade conscious . " She 's too self-absorbed and focused on being number one in her class that she fails to notice glaring issues her younger sister faces . She even turns a blind eye on the obviously innocent Hwang Woo Joo ( Kang Chan Hee ) when he 's accused of murder simply because she sees him as a rival in school . <h> 5 . Kang So Young from Who Are You : School 2015 ( 2015 ) <p> Bullies are the absolute worst and Kang So Young ( Jo Soo Hyang ) definitely fits the mold . So Young bullies the orphan Lee Eun Bi ( Kim So Hyun ) for no apparent reason -- as if her life was n't hard enough already ! And at one point , So Young even frames Eun Bi for school violence . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far ? <h> 6 . Park In Gyu from World Of Married Couple ( 2020 ) <p> Continue reading below ? <p> Ah , the epitome of an abusive boyfriend/husband . A lot of people hate him probably because they 've all met or heard of horror stories of someone like Park In Gyu ( Lee Hak Joo ) . Remember : Do n't let anyone manipulate you into believing that they hurt you because they want to " save " the relationship . Take it from Min Hyun Seo ( Sim Eun Woo ) and finally get the strength to walk away . <h> 7 . Empress Dowager Kang from The Last Empress ( 2018 ) <p> Empress Dowager Kang ( Shin Eun Kyung ) is your text-book " I-have-to-have-it-all " kontrabida .

Cho Cheol Gang From Crash Landing On You ( 2019 ) <p> Crash Landing On You 's antagonist Cho Cheol Gang ( Oh Man Seok ) is one of the most recognizable villains ever , not because he tries to get Yoon Se Ri ( Son Ye Jin ) kicked out of South Korea and is obsessed in ruining Captain Ri Jeong Hyeok 's ( Hyun Bin ) life . But simply because he embodies a figure we 're all too familiar with : a corrupt person in authority who uses his position for personal gains . Sound familiar ?

" <p> The signatories cited the need for an immediate 5-percent cut in the corporate income tax ( CIT ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and medium enterprises ( MSMEs ) , and the extension of the net operating loss carryover ( NOLCO ) by two years to " provide businesses more resources to pay for their expenses and keep their employees " amid the COVID-19 pandemic 's economic fallout . <p> " The immediate 5 percent cut in the corporate income tax strikes a good balance between the fiscal needs of our country and the need to support businesses . The reduction in the tax rate will provide businesses more resources to pay for their expenses and keep their employees . The rate reduction could be conditional on job retention or creation . The immediate cut sends a strong , clear signal to both the local and international business community that the Philippines is serious about competing for investments , " the statement said . <p> The NOLCO benefit , meanwhile , " together with the credit stimulus strategies of the government , will help keep businesses afloat and help protect the employment of hundreds of thousands of Filipino workers , " they said . <p> The signatories also cited their support for CREATE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fiscal Incentives Review Board ( FIRB ) , to grant longer incentives or additional non-fiscal incentives to investments that have a massive positive impact on the economy . <p> This provision , they said , " repositions the country to compete for investments . " <p> This joint statement has come on the heels of another statement of support for CREATE from 33 of the largest business and professional organizations in the country , who have called on Congress to act " quickly and decisively " in restoring market confidence and providing the " most direct , cost-efficient and instant relief " to enterprises suffering from the coronavirus pandemic 's economic fallout . <p> In their statement , the group of former finance and socioeconomic planning secretaries and industry leaders pointed out that , " Even sectors that had made known their reservations in the past have signified qualified support for its ( CREATE ) urgent enactment . " <p> The signatories also warned of the consequences of delaying the passage of the reform , saying that " during crisis periods , inaction on crucial reforms leads to even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in industry sentiment toward CREATE demonstrates what the undersigned have always asserted : that any delay in passing the reform causes undue business uncertainty , and costs the Filipino people inordinate amounts of foregone opportunities for better jobs and better business prospects , " the statement added . <p> Emphasizing the case for reform , the signatories also said that " the current incentives system has not worked to the full benefit of the Filipino people . It has not incentivized value-adding behavior , and it has cost the Filipino taxpayer , over several decades , trillions of pesos that could have been better spent on delivering public goods , such as infrastructure , and an enhanced incentive system that is performance-based , targeted , time-bound , and transparent . The status quo is far from what the Filipino people deserve . " <p> " What we do in the coming weeks will be recorded in historical accounts of this challenging period and what will follow .

" the statement concluded . <p> The statement is the latest in a series of statements of support from business leaders , student leaders , and civil society organizations for the urgent passage of CREATE , which has been calibrated to reflect emerging business needs brought about by the global health emergency triggered by COVID-19 . <p> The reform is championed in the Senate by Senator Pia Cayetano , a UPSE alumna , and in the House of Representatives by Rep. Joey Salceda , an economist and former equities analyst . <p> President Duterte has certified the bill as urgent , and the Senate leadership has committed , in statements made to the media , to speed up deliberations on this measure . <p> The President 's economic team has appealed to lawmakers to pass CREATE before the sine die adjournment of the Congress to allow businesses to benefit from the immediate cut in the CIT rate from 30 percent--the highest in the region--to 25 percent as early as July this year .

@@71993235 <h> Silo mentality <h> FINEX Folio <p> By Reynaldo C. Lugtu , Jr . <p> " Employees in my company are working in silos . " This is a common issue raised by business leaders when asked why their companies are not innovating . <p> Like large concrete cylinders for storing bulk grain , silos in an organization are monolithic departments such as accounting or sales , or similar worker groups such as administrative assistants or managers , that keep information to themselves , minimizing if not , preventing any form of sharing . Silos can also be geographical , such as Luzon , Visayas , and Mindanao office branches , that are separated by invisible force fields . <p> But how do they end up like these ? It starts when employees develop loyalty to a group or manager . Lack of direction from the top regarding cross-functional meetings and coordination reinforce silos . Even the benign practices of Philippine-based companies such as holding Christmas party group performances and departmental team-building activities , which build camaraderie within a group but promote and strengthen silos . <p> As silos solidify like concrete , employees become more exclusive and insular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentment develop as members in a silo reject outsiders , withholding information and cooperation . This is where a kind of mindset sets in like a hard-to-remove plaque inside the organization . <p> The silo mentality is defined by Business Dictionary as " a mindset present when certain departments or sectors do not wish to share information with others in the same company . This type of mentality will reduce efficiency in the overall operation , reduce morale , and may contribute to the demise of a productive company culture . " <p> Indeed , silo mentality is a pernicious organizational disease that stunts innovation . It forms part of the overall culture of the company and manifests through employee refrain like , " I ca n't do that , it 's not part of my job " , or " " that 's the way we 've always done it . " . It is the biggest barrier to CEOs desire to digitally transform their organizations . In this age of technological disruptions , organization members need to work together toward a shared purpose . But how can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The CEO together with his or her lieutenants should display collaborative behaviour and cross-functional communication . They should mandate their employees to institutionalize interdepartmental meetings to jointly solve problems and come up with new ideas . There should be task force , sponsored by the CEO and headed by a senior executive , charged with breaking up the silos and develop practices that require collaboration and communication . Instead of departmental competition during Christmas parties , why not promote cross-functional group performances ? Apart from departmental team buildings , why not promote other interdepartmental activities ? <p> Moreover , employees should undergo reskilling and coaching to change behaviours , attitudes and mindset . In our consulting work , we have identified three skills that needs to be developed and practiced -- empathy , collaboration , and complex problem-solving/agile decision-making . Through classroom training , role-playing , and on-the-job coaching , employees will develop empathy toward colleagues and learn how to collaborate with other groups to jointly solve problems and make decisions . <p> Lastly , reconfiguring office spaces can do wonders by breaking down office walls and laying out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work spaces . In Google Philippines office , there is a common area where employees and guests can meet , eat , or just hangout to talk to others . There 's fresh supply of free food , stylish furniture , and cool ambiance that encourages employees to meet there and collaborate . <p> Building trust amongst employees will lead to openness and communication . But silo mentality is not an easy problem to fix . At times , drastic moves such as letting go of certain employees and introducing fresh blood and new leadership into the organization to mandate changes . <p> What 's tricky is that Filipino culture is innately a siloed one , which makes it easier to form silos in organizations . From hometown silos such as Cavite ? os , Batange ? os , or Mindanaoans , to school silos such as Ateneans or LaSallians , to sport team silos and religious silos -- we lack national unity because of silos ; hence , our country ca n't collectively focus on national progress .

But before we get rolling with the ' 20s , ESPN is taking a look back at the best -- and worst -- of the 2010s and naming the top players of the decade for all 32 teams . <p> From the social media star of the decade to the worst call by a referee , ESPN 's NFL team remembers the people and moments of impact -- good and bad -- from the past 10 years . And NFL Nation reporters select the two best players of the decade from their teams , the top coach and assemble all-division teams of the 2010s . <h> NFC North players of the decade <p> Matt Forte 's versatility as a runner and pass-catcher made him one of the NFC North 's best offensive threats of the past decade .

Ebenhack <h> Matt Forte , RB <p> Years with team : 2008-15 <p> Forte entered the league in 2008 ( second-round pick out of Tulane ) but became arguably the NFL 's best all-purpose back during the first half of the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rushing for 8,602 yards and scoring 64 touchdowns . Forte ranks second , behind only Hall of Famer Walter Payton , on Chicago 's all-time lists for rushing yards , yards from scrimmage ( 12,718 ) , receptions ( 487 ) and 100-yard games ( 24 ) . He 's third in total touchdowns and sixth in receiving yards ( 4,116 ) . Forte joined the New York Jets after the Bears decided against re-signing him following the 2015 season , but without question , Forte 's most productive years were in Chicago . <p> Honorable mention : Take your pick : Brian Urlacher , Charles Tillman , Lance Briggs , Brandon Marshall or Julius Peppers . Heck , Jay Cutler even deserves some recognition for being the starting quarterback for so long ( 2009-16 ) . Forte earned the nod over Urlacher , Briggs and Tillman because they did the majority of their damage the previous decade . Marshall and Peppers did n't play in Chicago long enough to unseat Forte . And Cutler is Cutler . You know what I mean . -- Jeff Dickerson <p> Calvin Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outsizing and outrunning the best cornerbacks in the league . AP Photo/Rick Osentoski <h> Calvin Johnson , WR <p> Years with team : 2007-15 <p> Johnson is the easy selection for the Lions . He 's the only surefire Hall of Famer to play a significant portion of the 2010s with Detroit and he was for a time the best receiver in the NFL . He set the all-time single-season receiving yards mark with 1,964 yards in 2012 , and was a Pro Bowler every year he played in the 2010s -- from 2010 to ' 15 . He was also a three-time first-team All-Pro selection in the 2010s and went over 1,000 yards receiving every season of the decade in which he played . Johnson was simply dominant and often faced double and triple coverage . " It should be illegal for a guy to be that tall and that big and that fast . They should have banned him from the NFL , " Hall of Fame cornerback Charles Woodson told ESPN in 2014 . " But he 's one of those guys , man -- he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There are three players worthy of mention here -- quarterback Matthew Stafford , defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh and cornerback Darius Slay . And it 's a tough call , but Suh gets the slight nod over Stafford and Slay . Suh made four Pro Bowls in his five seasons in Detroit and was first-team All-Pro three times . The AP Defensive Rookie of the Year in 2010 , Suh was a dominant force on one of the best run-stopping defenses in NFL history in 2014 and set the tone for the Lions ' defense for the first half of the decade . Stafford is the best quarterback in franchise history and Slay was a perennial Pro Bowler at corner . But Suh was the best at his position for a large portion of his time in Detroit . -- Mike Rothstein <p> Only Rodgers and Tom Brady were two-time MVP winners during the 2010s . Rodgers won it for the 2011 and 2014 seasons and also was the Super Bowl XLV MVP . The start of the decade marked Rodgers ' third season as the Packers ' starter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start the decade and eight overall in the 10 years . Rodgers had the third-most touchdown passes in the decade ( 305 ) in 11 fewer games than leader Drew Brees ( 345 ) and 14 fewer games than second-place Tom Brady ( 316 ) . <p> Honorable mention : Jordy Nelson , WR , 2008-17 and Davante Adams , WR , 2014-present . Both were dominant receivers in the decade . Clay Matthews was dominant on his side of the ball too . And how about the combination of tackles Bryan Bulaga and David Bakhtiari ? Had the Packers not dumped Charles Woodson after the 2012 season he 'd be worthy of consideration too . -- Rob Demovsky <p> This was about as unanimous a decision as there is . Peterson was the only non-quarterback to win the NFL MVP award during the past decade and holds countless titles and awards from his time with the Vikings . He was the league 's offensive player of the year ( 2012 ) , a two-time first-team All-Pro selection ( 2012 , 2015 ) , went to the Pro Bowl four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,097 yards and again in 2015 . Peterson ended his time in Minnesota as the franchise 's all-time rushing leader and will go down as one of the best running backs in NFL history . <p> Honorable mention:Cordarrelle Patterson , WR/KR , 2013-16 and Harrison Smith , S , 2012-present . Drafted by the Vikings in 2013 , Patterson reached a career-high 1,393 yards and two touchdowns on 43 kickoff returns on his way to the Pro Bowl as a rookie and was one of the most dangerous returners of the past decade . Smith was another easy choice . His 13 career sacks are the most by any defensive back since 2013 . The five-time Pro Bowler and 2017 All-Pro notched 23 interceptions and set a franchise record with four of those being returned for touchdowns. -- Courtney Cronin <h> NFC North coach of the decade <p> Mike McCarthy led his Packers to an NFL championship in Super Bowl XLV , the NFC North 's only title in the past decade .

And he was n't just a one-hit wonder . McCarthy led the Packers to the playoffs every year from 2010 to 2016 and had a run of eight straight playoff seasons starting in 2009 . Yes , McCarthy was fired in the decade , but after a year off in 2019 , he landed another of the NFL 's prime coaching gigs with the Dallas Cowboys . -- Rob Demovsky <p> Honorable mention : Mike Zimmer , Vikings , 2014-present . Zimmer led the Vikings to the playoffs in three out of his six seasons and got Minnesota as far as the NFC Championship Game after the 2017 season . The Vikings have been consistently good under Zimmer , who has battled just about every abnormal circumstance you could imagine , from losing quarterback Teddy Bridgewater to a freak knee injury days before the start of the 2016 season to having eight eye surgeries and working with four different offensive coordinators in five years . -- Courtney Cronin

Moore prays with them before heading inside . <p> Her hair is pulled back and laid under a headband , just like it was when she was one of the greatest basketball players in the world , when winning championships , not fighting for justice , was her focus . Game 4 of the WNBA Finals was last night , but instead of watching the Connecticut Sun force a decisive Game 5 against the Washington Mystics , Moore was here , meeting with lawyers . <p> Her blue suede sneakers squeak against the marble tile as she descends the stairs to the security X-ray machine , empties her pockets and puts her purse on the belt , then marches up the narrow stairs to the main floor of the courthouse .

It was Cheri 's father , Hugh Flowers , who first formed a bond in the early 2000s with Irons while volunteering as the choir director at Jefferson City Correctional Center .

This hearing is Irons ' best chance to try to convince at least one person in the criminal justice system of the innocence he 's claimed for over two decades . And it is Moore 's opportunity to prove that leaving the WNBA at the height of her talents was not in vain . <p> The bailiff stands up from his seat at the front of the room . <p> " All rise . " <p> For the past 16 months , former Minnesota Lynx superstar Maya Moore has dedicated her life to the exoneration of a Missouri man named Jonathan Irons , who at age 16 was convicted in 1998 of assault and battery and sentenced to 50 years in prison . Kelvin Kuo/USA TODAY Sports <p> ON FEB. 5 , 2019 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tribune that would upend the WNBA : She would be sitting out the 2019 season to focus on " the people in my family , as well as on investing my time in some ministry dreams that have been stirring in my heart for many years . " <p> It was a stunning declaration . This was Maya Moore , in her prime . <p> Consider : At 29 years old , she 'd already won four WNBA championships and a league MVP award . She was the 2011 WNBA Rookie of the Year . She was a six-time WNBA All-Star and a five-time All-WNBA first-team honoree . She had won three consecutive championships with her club in China , Shanxi Flame , as well as a EuroLeague Championship with Russian powerhouse UMMC Ekaterinburg . She had won two Olympic gold medals with Team USA . At the University of Connecticut , she 'd won two national championships and was a four-time consensus All-American and the only player in women 's college basketball history to win the Wade Trophy three times . <p> Since then , for the past year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flying between her Atlanta home and Jefferson City , fully committed to a singular cause : supporting the effort of Jonathan Irons to regain his freedom -- because she believes he was innocent . <p> For more than 20 years , the Missouri justice system had not agreed . And entering this year , Moore 's commitment begged a question : <p> Why was one of the greatest players of all time willing to never step on a court again -- and to leave behind one of the WNBA 's great dynasties -- for the sake of what could well be a lost cause ? <p> Jonathan Irons first met Maya Moore during the summer of 2007 , only months before Moore would begin a UConn career that saw her become one of the most dominant collegiate players in history . Nina Robinson <p> THE CRIME FOR which Jonathan Irons was ultimately convicted began with the click of a closet door . <p> It was around 6:30 p.m. on Jan. 14 , 1997 , and a man named Stanley Stotler had returned to his home in O'Fallon , Missouri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change his clothes before heading back out for a hair appointment . After walking through the door , he ventured toward the back of the house , to his bedroom . It was then , according to his testimony in Irons ' original trial , that he heard the latch of the closet door . <p> Stotler testified that he knew something was wrong . His home had been robbed before , the previous December , and the burglar had taken more than $200 in cash from that same closet . Frightened , Stotler slowly reached under his mattress and pulled out a 9 mm semi-automatic pistol he owned . He loaded a magazine , put a shell in the chamber and pointed it at the closet door . He called out to the intruder , imploring the person to come out . <p> Stotler reached for the phone on his nightstand , calling out once more , this time to alert the intruder that he was calling the police . Seconds later , the closet door flew open , and Stotler saw a young black man whom he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testified that as he turned his eyes away to look at his phone , he was shot in the shoulder and fell to his bedroom floor . As he tried to stand , he was shot again , this time in the temple . <p> He struggled to find his gun , which he 'd dropped as he collapsed to the ground . Once he grabbed it , Stotler fired once in the direction of the closet . Bleeding from bullet wounds to his face and right shoulder , Stotler managed to get to his kitchen , where he called 911 . He did not see the intruder again . <p> Stotler was rushed to the hospital and underwent emergency brain surgery . He remained there for the next seven weeks . At the time of his testimony , in October 1998 , he still had bullet fragments lodged in his brain . <p> Although Stotler identified Irons in court , he had not been able to do so immediately following the burglary . According to testimony from Detective John Neske , O'Fallon police were originally alerted to then-16-year-old Irons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day in the neighborhood by a number of witnesses . Irons , who declined to comment for this story , testified at the Oct. 9 , 2019 , hearing that it was n't out of the ordinary for him to be there , even though he was black and the neighborhood majority white . By that time , Irons had dropped out of high school , but he had friends and acquaintances -- including those to whom he sold marijuana -- in the area . <p> According to his testimony from that October hearing , Irons acknowledged that he 'd been in the neighborhood that night with a gun , which Irons says was a .38-caliber . Stotler had been shot with a .25-caliber gun . Capt . Jerry Schulte of the O'Fallon Police Department had told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that Irons was named a suspect after mentioning the shooting to a friend . Irons has denied this allegation . <p> The gun that was used to shoot Stotler was never recovered . Despite telling Neske in February 1997 that he was uncertain about who shot him , Stotler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DNA or fingerprints belonging to Irons were found at the scene . <p> Despite the lack of physical evidence , Irons was convicted of burglary and assault in 1998 , after being tried as an adult because of a previous charge . <p> At the age of 18 , Jonathan Irons was sentenced to 50 years in prison . <p> Maya Moore , with her mother , Kathryn , spent her first 11 years in Jefferson City , Missouri , before moving to Atlanta , where she became one of the most sought-after recruits in the nation . Nina Robinson <p> THE SAME YEAR Irons was arrested and charged , Maya Moore was a rambunctious 8-year-old growing up in Jefferson City , Missouri -- a small-town kid who went to church every Sunday with her mother and godparents . Moore lived in Missouri 's capital until she was 11 , then moved with her mother to Charlotte , North Carolina , before settling in Atlanta the following year . It 's always been the two of them . Even today , they live next door to each other . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moore had also begun to explore her faith . She 'd gone to church with her mother since she was a child but says that in middle school she focused more attention on her faith after her mom lost her job , which had brought them to Atlanta . Moore and her mom began attending World Changers Church International , a nondenominational global ministry headquartered in Atlanta . The church 's pastor , Creflo Dollar , is known for preaching " prosperity gospel " -- that faith in God can lead to material gain and help followers triumph over adversity . " My faith is the core of who I am , " Moore told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2010 . " I feel like everything I do stems from that . " <p> It was Moore who encouraged her mother to take them to church every Sunday in Atlanta . Without a relationship with her biological father , Moore says she found her identity in God . " It hit me so hard when I was in middle school that God is my father and he is my identity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He is my security . He is what matters most about who I am . I 've become such a believer in the beauty and power and need for fathers , especially godly fathers . And whatever our culture says , I 'm convinced that the best way for kids to grow up is with their mom and their dad . " <p> Moore has never been public about her relationship with her father , Mike Dabney , who was a star basketball player at Rutgers in the 1970s . The identity she found in the wake of Dabney 's absence became foundational to the person who put on a basketball jersey nearly every day for most of her life . " I was trained in the faith before I was trained as a national champion , " Moore said . <p> Moore attended Collins Hill High School in Suwanee , Georgia , a suburb of Atlanta , where she won three state championships and led her team to a 125-3 record . She received the Naismith Prep Player of the Year Award her junior and senior seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ award multiple times . <p> " Everybody was talking about this young kid that was just this phenom , " says UConn women 's basketball coach Geno Auriemma . " I usually do n't get that excited about ninth-graders . Maya always had this presence that maybe she was born with . Your eyes were always drawn to her . " <p> Moore has long said that her faith has been as integral to her athletic success as her skill itself . Athletes in Action , a Christian sports ministry , became an essential part of Moore 's life at UConn . While a student , Moore regularly participated in campus Bible study sessions . Following her freshman year , she attended AIA 's Ultimate Training Camp , which merges athletic competition with faith exploration in a summer camp environment . She worked as an intern at the camp for two additional summers . <p> Moore 's faith , sources close to her say , shaped her journey to becoming one of the greatest basketball players in the world . By all accounts , that same faith in God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . <p> Her collegiate r ? sum ? is staggering : Maya Moore led UConn to a 150-4 record in her four seasons , with four consecutive Final Four appearances and two national championships . Jamie Schwaberow/NCAA Photos/Getty Images <p> BACK IN JEFFERSON CITY on that sunny October day , Judge Daniel Green calls Irons ' case from the bench . It 's been 10 months since Irons ' legal team filed the petition that led to this hearing and over a decade since Reggie Williams , Moore 's godfather , discovered a piece of evidence that Irons ' team plans to present today . The catalyst was Moore , who had met Irons through Reggie and Cheri in the summer before her freshman year at UConn . According to The New York Times , Moore had seen Reggie reviewing Irons ' legal documents during a family vacation in her senior year of high school , became interested in the case and visited Irons in prison for the first time during that summer of 2007 . <p> " Until Maya Moore got involved , Irons just really did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Irons ' attorney Kent Gipson . " It 's big to sacrifice a year of your career in your prime to do that . " <p> Back in August , after months of motions and extensions and exhibit filings and updates , Green , the judge , had set this date to hear arguments in the case . Today , Irons ' legal team begins by calling Reggie Williams to the stand . Williams ' testimony focuses on the longevity of his relationship with Irons and his intimate knowledge of the path Irons has taken through the legal system following his conviction . Williams , who has worked for State Farm for 33 years in both underwriting and claims investigation , says Irons gave him power of attorney in 2005 , after he had shown a keen interest in the case , and Williams spent years poring over the materials contained in the three boxes of evidence given to him . <p> In 2007 , he took these materials to a University of Missouri law professor , who referred Williams to one of his students for help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to the O'Fallon Police Department to review additional files . Williams , who declined to comment for this story , testified that once they were allowed inside the police department , Williams asked to see police reports . He was handed a blue folder stuffed with documents . <p> He paged through them and discovered something that caught his eye . " It was a latent fingerprint report that I had not seen before , " he says today on the stand . Irons ' team then calls Irons ' original defense attorney , Christine Sullivan . <p> The report , Irons ' lawyers argue , raises questions about the conduct of the prosecution in Irons ' original trial . The document is not the same report that was given to Irons ' defense attorney in 1998 . At the time of Irons ' 1998 trial , the fingerprint report indicated that the two fingerprints found on the storm door leading out of Stotler 's home belonged to Stotler . But this report , which Williams found two years into his investigation , indicates that only one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveals , does n't belong to Irons . <p> " Explain the significance of the fingerprint evidence to your defense , " says Jessica Hathaway , one of Irons ' attorneys . <p> " That someone else was in or out of that house that left the print on an outer door , " Sullivan says . " Not Jonathan , not the homeowner , someone else . " <p> A choked sob comes from the corner of the room . Tears stream down Irons ' cheeks as he gasps for air . This is the argument upon which Irons ' appeal hinges . Moore presses her lips together and grips the railing in front of her . Her knuckles tighten and the tension ripples up her forearm . Green calls for a recess . <p> The room empties . Moore stands in the hallway surrounded by her family . Irons is off to the side , flanked by corrections officers . They are n't allowed to speak to each other . <p> " I 'm heartbroken that we ca n't console him as part of our family , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering injustice is that pain . " <p> Twenty-one years after his conviction , Irons has finally received another day in court , but he will have to wait weeks , maybe months , to find out if Green believes him . <p> Days after the July 2016 killing of Philando Castile at the hands of a police officer in Minnesota , the Lynx wore shirts supporting Black Lives Matter and victims of police violence . In response , four off-duty officers working the game walked off the job . David Sherman/NBAE/Getty Images <p> AS THE MINNESOTA Lynx entered Mohegan Sun Arena for shootaround on July 7 , 2016 , head coach Cheryl Reeve pulled aside her four captains : Lindsay Whalen , Seimone Augustus , Rebekkah Brunson and Moore . The Lynx were 15-3 and preparing to face the Connecticut Sun for the first time that season . <p> The night before , on July 6 , Philando Castile , a cafeteria supervisor at J.J. Hill Montessori School , was shot and killed by a police officer in Falcon Heights , Minnesota , a suburb just east of Minneapolis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sterling was killed by police in Baton Rouge , Louisiana , in the same neighborhood where Augustus grew up . <p> Since the death of Michael Brown , an 18-year-old black man , on Aug. 9 , 2014 , the issue of police violence against black people had reentered the public consciousness . But the deaths of Sterling and Castile struck a specific chord for the Lynx , both because they came so close together and because they occurred in familiar and cherished places . <p> In a moment that echoes now , almost four years later , Reeve looked to her captains . " Let 's use our voices , " she said . " What do we want to do ? " <p> After the game , on the bus to the airport , the answer began to take shape . Moore and Brunson led the conversation in the following days , Moore guiding her teammates through the process of choosing the words they wanted to use . She proposed where to put them on the T-shirts they eventually debuted on July 9 , 2016 -- three days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game against the Dallas Wings . The black shirts read , " Change starts with us -- Justice &amp; Accountability . " The names Philando Castile and Alton Sterling were displayed on the back , along with the Dallas police shield , honoring the victims of the July 7 , 2016 , attack on Dallas police officers that had claimed five lives . In bold white letters , " Black Lives Matter " stood out on the back , underneath the names and shield . <p> " If we take this time to see that this is a human issue and speak out together , we can greatly decrease fear and create change , " Moore said during a pregame news conference . <p> The Lynx 's public display sparked demonstrations across the league . The Phoenix Mercury , Indiana Fever and New York Liberty wore similar T-shirts and were fined $5,000 for breaching the WNBA 's uniform guidelines -- before the league withdrew the fines two days later . <p> Four days after the Lynx had donned their shirts , LeBron James , Dwyane Wade , Chris Paul and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and encouraging athletes to participate in creating change . Later that summer , 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick began to kneel during the national anthem . <p> After the Lynx 's demonstration , the league had sent out a memo reminding teams of the uniform policy . The Lynx never wore the shirts again . The WNBA 's most dominant team had walked out on a limb , but not far enough to snap the branch . <p> But for Moore , something was giving way . Her relationship with Irons and her belief in his innocence had long been a personal conviction and a private cause , she told ESPN 's Dan Le Batard in April , but the events of 2016 showed her that she could have an impact on issues of criminal justice publicly . <p> Four months after the Lynx had donned those shirts , they lost the 2016 WNBA Finals to the Los Angeles Sparks on a last-second putback by Sparks forward Nneka Ogwumike . It was Moore 's fifth WNBA Finals in six years , on the heels of four consecutive Final Fours in college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offseasons in China . She had won the EuroLeague women 's championship in Istanbul in April 2012 , just six months after the Lynx won the 2011 WNBA title and just seven weeks before the first game of the 2012 WNBA season . In the middle of the 2012 and 2016 WNBA seasons , she had played with Team USA in the Olympics . She had played in the 2014 FIBA World Cup and had been an All-Star in four of her first six seasons . <p> For six long years , Maya Moore had been consumed by chasing basketball success without respite . Without time to be with her family . Without time to get Jonathan Irons out of prison . <p> Some months after the Finals , Moore , along with teammate Lindsay Whalen , flew to Fort Lauderdale , Florida , to train with skills coach Ganon Baker . Moore had played in the Rio Olympics three months earlier , in July , winning her second gold medal . When considering the motivations for why she stepped away from the game a year ago , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time we got to Rio , there was a difference about her , " Auriemma says . " She just did n't have the electricity coming out of her . " <p> After consecutive days of two-a-days in Fort Lauderdale in the spring of 2017 , Whalen and Moore took a night off . They 'd booked a suite at the Hilton Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort and decided to have dinner at Ilios , the hotel 's restaurant . <p> It was during a conversation there that Moore first told Whalen about Irons -- and her family 's advocacy on his behalf . She told Whalen about the case . About her godparents . About what she saw as the injustice facing a man she considered family . About how other than training , this was what she 'd been focused on all offseason . About how personal this fight was to her . <p> IT 'S DEC. 9 , 2019 , in Jefferson City , and Moore and her camp roll into town for yet another hearing . During the October evidentiary hearing -- when the fingerprint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief had filled the room . Today , a rainy Monday in central Missouri , the hearing takes all of five minutes . Green orders the fingerprints , the ones discovered by Reggie Williams in 2007 , to be run through a process called the Automated Fingerprint Identification System , a central database used by law enforcement to identify people whose prints had previously been entered into the system -- but those results wo n't be ready for weeks . <p> The fingerprints are crucial to Irons ' case for several reasons . They could belong to someone else in the system , casting further doubt on whether Irons committed the crime . But in the state of Missouri , a person 's innocence is , in some ways , irrelevant . Legal precedent in the state holds that unless a prisoner is on death row , proven innocence is not reason enough to be set free . Petitioners must prove that they have been denied a constitutionally adequate trial . <p> To that end , the existence of the report as new evidence could also be enough to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conviction could be void . That 's because the suppression or altering of the fingerprint document could constitute a violation of the Brady rule , which mandates that the prosecution turn over all exculpatory evidence to the defense pretrial . Failure to do so is a violation of a defendant 's due process . <p> " I think it 's pretty clear the prosecution either altered or suppressed that report , " Gipson says . " And then misled the jury to think that all of the fingerprints that were found on that door , which was the only possible exit point of the burglar , belonged to the victim . " The Missouri attorney general 's office declined to comment for this story , citing ongoing litigation . <p> But even a ruling in Irons ' favor does not guarantee his release . The state could appeal , or he could be retried . And so this is how it goes . Process begets more process . Hearings beget more hearings . Motions result in countermotions . Decisions are appealed , and that process can feel interminable -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocence does not guarantee freedom . <p> The night before the 2018 WNBA All-Star Game in Minneapolis , Maya Moore held a private dinner with some of her closest confidants , revealing to them her deep commitment to criminal justice reform . M. Anthony Nesmith/Icon Sportswire <p> BACK WHEN MAYA MOORE was still one of the best basketball players on the planet , Cheryl Reeve walked into Cosmos Restaurant at the Loews Hotel , right across the street from the Lynx 's home court and practice facility at the Target Center . It was July 27 , the night before the 2018 WNBA All-Star Game in Minneapolis . <p> Reeve walked past the towering glass behind the bar to a private room in the back , where she was joined by Lynx forward Rebekkah Brunson , who sat across the room .

This was the same player whose wingspan had been plastered on a downtown billboard in a rendering of Jordan 's iconic pose . The same player who , nine months earlier , had delivered Reeve her fourth championship in seven years .

Three months later , Irons remains incarcerated , as the state has appealed the ruling to the Missouri Supreme Court . Jeff Haldiman/The Jefferson City News-Tribune/AP Photo <p> IT 'S A COLD , rainy March morning in Jefferson City , and Cheri Williams pulls into the familiar courthouse parking lot in an old red pickup truck . Her sons step out of an adjacent car , both wearing suits . As the rain pours down , they scramble to take photos with one another . Cheri leaves them outside . In the time since the hearings began , over a year ago , she and her husband , Reggie , have moved to Atlanta . They join Maya and Kathryn at church in Atlanta most weeks . They 've all made the trip back to Missouri for this . <p> The hallway outside the courtroom is loud , family and friends and onlookers chattering before the day 's proceedings . They hug , shake hands and smile . " Today is the day , " they say . <p> Moore stands silently in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her body . She shushes her jubilant loved ones before they enter the room . Irons ' case is scheduled for a counsel status hearing -- where the lawyers give an update on the case and schedule a date for the next hearing . <p> The clock ticks past 10:30 a.m . Green enters the courtroom 10 minutes late . Many cases are scheduled to be heard in this time slot , but Green starts with Irons ' . He reads the decision from the bench , in a manner so blunt and perfunctory that it 's almost absurd to think that two sentences could undo two decades of a life . <p> As he speaks , Moore swallows and tightens her lips . The sentences are a jumble of legalese -- habeas relief , conditional writ , Brady claim -- but six words stand out . <p> " ... orders that his convictions be vacated ... " <p> A sigh ripples through the courtroom , followed by a round of applause . Moore puts her head in her hands and cries . Kathryn envelops Maya in her arms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own eyes . <p> In his judgment , Green found that there was , in fact , a Brady violation . He wrote that Irons ' " due process rights were violated by the prosecution 's suppression of material exculpatory evidence . " That evidence was the fingerprint report discovered by Reggie Williams in 2007 . <p> There are , however , conditions to Green 's ruling . The state could appeal his judgment , and even if it is upheld , Irons would not be eligible for immediate release , as the county that originally tried him could elect to do so again . But those are details to be litigated another day . Green calls for a recess , and the celebration spills into the hallway . Moore and her loved ones take pictures . " Short people in the front , " Moore urges as they try to arrange themselves in the small hallway . <p> " That 's everyone other than you , " someone shouts . <p> Everyone laughs . <p> Moore 's phone rings . She tells everyone to be quiet . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in delight . And as Moore delivers the news , Irons ' sobs echo through the phone . <p> " I 'm free , " he sings through the phone , the notes wafting through the hallway . Tears stream down Moore 's face . " Hallelujah ! I 'm free ! " <p> PASSION CITY CHURCH is a sprawling white building north of downtown Atlanta . At the intersection leading to the large nondenominational church , police officers control traffic at the stoplight on Sunday mornings . There 's an overflow parking lot down the street that has shuttle service to the church doors should any of the thousands of congregants not get there early enough to secure a closer spot . Greeters steer the crowd through the entrance . The white walls reach high with single-word signs : Bloom . Kids . College . Resources . Less than 100 feet from the main sanctuary , there 's an overflow room where the service is streamed to those who ca n't find a seat . There 's a second location 10 miles away in Cumberland where the service is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanctuary , light blazes through 2,265 lightbulbs to form the towering words " Jesus Is Life . " <p> When Moore was in high school , 29 miles from here , people often referred to Gwinnett Arena as Maya Temple , because her teams played in four consecutive state championships there . But Passion City is her spiritual home . She 's in the church choir . She has appeared on its podcast , talking about her faith and criminal justice advocacy . It 's here where for several years -- in the dark , club-lit sanctuary -- Moore and her family have heard messages and sermons focused on knowable truth , radical grace , whole-life worship and community of faith . When Reggie and Cheri moved to Atlanta six months ago , they began attending church at Passion City with Moore . <p> On most Sundays , this is where you will find Maya Moore . As for Jonathan Irons , he is still in prison , though perhaps not for long . On March 23 , the state of Missouri appealed Green 's decision , but on April @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacate Irons ' convictions . That decision put a 10-day clock on the state and St. Charles County to decide whether to retry Irons , but that clock does n't start immediately . Missouri had 15 days to file a motion for another hearing , which extended the timeline a month . That motion was denied on May 22 . The state filed an additional motion on June 8 , requesting that the case be transferred to the Missouri Supreme Court . That decision could take another month . If that motion is denied , St. Charles County can elect to retry the entire case . <p> So Jonathan Irons likely would n't be released for at least another month . And if St. Charles County decides to retry Irons , he might not get out at all . As for Moore , she has committed to sitting out the 2020 WNBA season as well -- should one be played . And she has spoken about the criminal justice system beyond Irons -- the need for prosecutorial reform and for frank conversations regarding the nation 's long-standing racial divide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brees ' apology for his original comments about the right of athletes to protest by kneeling during the national anthem -- and the heated response from his fellow athletes in the wake of the killing of George Floyd -- Moore was steadfast in her stance : <p> " There are so many , namely black and brown bodies , in America who have experienced a different America than what the mainstream American flag symbolizes , " she told ESPN 's Jeremy Schaap . " For centuries in this country , black people were seen as three-fifths of a person , and so when you hear the national anthem or you see an American flag as an African American person who has experienced the effects of that dehumanizing existence , it 's not going to mean the same . Now , just because it does n't mean the same does n't give you the right to destroy , but at the same time , we have to acknowledge that there have been inconsistencies with who we 've been as a country . " <p> But her advocacy , for now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the best ways I can continue to help is to continue to tell Jonathan 's story well , " Moore says . <p> So will Maya Moore ever return to basketball ? It is a mystery that those around her continue to ponder -- a chorus of voices , some disappointed , each as curious and speculative as any fan would be . <p> " I do n't think she 's coming back , " Auriemma says . " I have no knowledge of that . I 'm just guessing . I think about this myself too . I think about , like , Bjorn Borg was the best tennis player in the world . He goes , ' I need a month off . ' One month turned into , like , 20 years . " <p> " I hope so , I really do , " Whalen says . " She 's one of my favorite players ever . I 'm just a fan of women 's basketball and a fan of elite-level athletes . But I mean , I ca n't call it either way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know , " says former UConn teammate Kelly Faris . " As much as I want to know , I try to leave that out of the conversation because I know at some point that 's not an easy thing for her to decide . " <p> " I think that she 's retired , " says Las Vegas Aces forward Angel McCoughtry . " She gave so much at such a young age , and we just pulled from Maya . We took from her . Do I wish she would come back ? Hell yeah . I miss Maya Moore . " <p> " Maybe she 'll move on to somebody else 's trial ; maybe she 'll continue to pursue criminal justice for all and not because it 's this thing that is personal , " Brunson says . " I 'm sure she has a lot to offer the game if she wanted to come back to it . The fans would love to see her come back and play again . But who knows ? " <p> " For you , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says former Lynx and USA Basketball teammate Asjha Jones . " But what if that 's not what she 's interested in anymore ? " <p> In the days following the March verdict , Moore offered comments about the motivations for her continued support of Jonathan Irons . " Even though we are very excited and grateful , we are also frustrated because Jonathan is still not a free man , " Moore said on a media call the day after the ruling . <p> But she offered little clarity regarding her future . <p> " I have just been trying to take it one season at a time , one day at a time , " Moore said . " This is a real-life situation . It 's not a cause to me as much as it is a real person 's story . I definitely see myself having purpose in this criminal justice space because , unfortunately , there 's so much work to be done . <p> " When next spring rolls around , I 'll be willing to discuss what the future will look like , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what 's going to happen next , but all I can really say right now is what this year is going to look like . " <p> THIRTY MINUTES AFTER Green hands down his ruling in Jefferson City in March , Moore huddles with her family and Irons ' lawyers in a meeting room on the second floor of the public library , two doors down from the courthouse . The rain pours outside , and the library is the only refuge available . <p> Moore opens the door to a wood-paneled room . Even now , she is strategizing . There is no champagne or celebratory cake . She might have felt joy in the courthouse , but as long as Irons remains in prison , that emotion is fleeting . When a visitor asks Moore what Scripture has been guiding her throughout her advocacy of Jonathan Irons , she takes a deep breath and furrows her brow . <p> " God says : Mankind , God has given you one thing to do , " she says , leaning against the frame of the door . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your God . That 's what I 've been trying to do . "

A perfect synthesis of our two souls : clothes to wear at any time of the day in order to feel good . And this is only the beginning , as our conversation has just begun . " <p> The collection 's objective , according to a press release is " identifying and following a new path of masculine elegance that is also wearable for women , the frank and authentic conversation between two apparently distant worlds defines an immediate and contemporary wardrobe . A new vocabulary that proposes aesthetic canons that are as free from pre-built models and gender paradigms as possible . " <p> The collaboration features lightweight suits that just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a second skin . Belts and accessories are decidedly bohemian , tied around the waist and falling a bit above the knee . Streetwear aesthetics with brand names in bold typeface are seen here , as well as pinstripe creations in loose fits reminiscent of zoot suits . A heavy wool cardigan was paired with what appears to be track pants , in keeping with the current age of casual comfort . <p> As BusinessWorld noted about the fashion shows shown via livestream earlier this year , a lot of drab and sober grays were on the color palettes on the runways , and Zegna was no exception . The Modern Tailoring collection , with a more classical bent , also uses recycled fabrics , and follows the same principle to #UseTheExisting . " It is our aim to produce pieces with style that are long-lasting and responsible , " said a release . The more casual and forward Zegna collection , meanwhile , praised the modern dandy with eye popping shades of red , with a nod towards streetwear but still distinctively preppy ( think of a schoolboy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The meeting of two worlds is n't limited to the aesthetic . It extends to the material , seeing as a lot of the pieces were executed in an innovation called Techmerino , a fabric exclusive to Zegna , made of Merino wool that had undergone processing in order to enhance it . " The notion that there is no luxury without sustainability is the only way forward , " said Mr. Sartori . <p> The collections had already been seen earlier this year . Its first ever collaboration , with American brand Fear of God , was previewed last March in Paris , while its XXX collections were seen at Milan Men 's Fashion Week .

@@72026236 <h> The megacity is dead . Long live the megacity <p> Easing lockdowns around the world present an opportunity to go back to the drawing board for many economies . In Asia , densely packed urban centers are a good place to start . The trick for planners will be to minimize disease outbreaks without quashing the promise of employment that has made cities a magnet . <p> By 2025 , the world will have 37 megacities -- defined as having at least 10 million people -- and as many as 20 of them will be in Asia . Two-thirds of the region 's population will be living in urban areas by 2050 , compared with 20% in 1970 , according to the Asian Development Bank . Bustling metropolises have become a symbol of rapid growth across the continent , which has reached a level of urbanization in less than a century that took more than twice as long in other parts of the world . <p> For decades , this transition was a one-way ticket to economic boom . With the coronavirus outbreak , however , we 've seen cities become hotbeds of infection , where vast concentrations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a halt . But while de-clogging seems like a good idea on paper , is it desirable or even feasible ? Working remotely from the suburbs sounds great if you live in a congested downtown district , confined to four walls and a small bathroom with screaming kids . The reality in many rural areas , however , is poor infrastructure , subpar schools , and scarce medical clinics , not to mention limited delivery options . <p> In Indonesia , officials are getting cold feet about the construction of a new capital , which was intended to take the strain off overcrowded and sinking Jakarta . While I had reservations about the prospect of creating a city from scratch , the government was correct in identifying a problem . Spreading some wealth beyond the island of Java would be welcome , too . Sadly , the vision is being subordinated to the emergency of the day , just when an alternative is needed most . President Joko Widodo says there are better ways to spend $34 billion . Indonesia ca n't print rupiah indefinitely and no politician wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slip back into poverty . <p> In the Philippines , meanwhile , the coronavirus has given fresh life to proposals for thinning out Manila , one of the most heavily populated cities on earth and the country 's virus epicenter . President Rodrigo Duterte is offering to pay people to leave the area , which generates about one-third of gross domestic product . Yet skeptics of his " Back to the Province " program point to the centuries-old centralization of power in the capital -- Imperial Manila , Duterte calls it -- and shrug . People have preferred to emigrate rather than leave the city , which has made the Philippines a global hub for the export of labor , as I 've written . Unless centers of capital and government are prepared to surrender control to regions , along with taxation authority , the boonies just are n't going to be attractive enough . <p> Liew Ching Tong , a Malaysian senator and , until March , deputy minister for defense , has an idea along those lines . In a presentation last month to the Institute for Democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liew proposed significant reforms to local government financing : Give Malaysia 's 13 states the ability to share income-tax power with the national administration . Right now , the provinces are largely dependent on grants from the central government and often need its approval before borrowing . Their only meaningful ability to generate revenue is from land sales and natural resources , which tend to exacerbate environmental degradation . <p> This federal-state dynamic puts local projects at the mercy of political winds from Kuala Lumpur . In the state of Penang , for example , anticipated bond sales are intended to fund an overhaul of public transportation . The proposal -- approved by the last coalition government , which dissolved three months ago -- is now in jeopardy of being revoked , says Tricia Yeoh of IDEAS . Only by empowering states to control their finances can they develop good infrastructure and support the high living standards that will attract the best and brightest . <p> The good news for city dwellers is that the coronavirus has opened the door for some creative urban planning . In Singapore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city-state 's signature high-rise public housing , recently discussed dividing the country into relatively self-sufficient regions to help contain viral outbreaks down the road . Future HDB dwellings should have drone parking zones in place of car spaces , given the critical role of delivery services during this outbreak , Chief Executive Officer Cheong Koon Hean told a forum on June 3 . <p> Asia 's megacities wo n't disappear , nor should they . But if we 've learned anything from the coronavirus , it 's the danger of concentrating too much human capital in one physical location . That 's why Asians of the future need to have desirable alternatives , which means finding the right incentives , not just telling people to pack their bags and head to the hills . Cities have been fun places to live for the region 's burgeoning middle class . To keep urban areas prosperous and healthy , though , the hinterland needs to be revitalized , too . 
@@72026237 <h> Why the IATF 's strategy did more harm than good <h> Numbers Do n't Lie <p> By Andrew J. Masigan <p> British banking giant HSBC recently published its forecast for the Philippine economy and the outlook is bleak . After clocking-in a 0.2% contraction in gross domestic product ( GDP ) in the first quarter , the bank forecasts a deep contraction of 7% in the second quarter , another contraction of 4.3% in the third quarter , and yet another shrinkage of 3.9% for the fourth quarter . This will bring the full year contraction rate to 3.85% . The last time the Philippines posted negative growth was in 1998 . <p> HSBC 's forecast coincides with the projections of the National Economic and Development Authority ( NEDA ) which predicted an economic contraction of 4.3% to 4% . <p> As of this writing , 4.9 million Filipinos have already lost their jobs and unemployment is now at an all time high of 17.7% . Out of the 998,342 micro- , small- and medium-sized enterprises ( MSMEs ) in operation , it is estimated that at least 40% will not survive the quarantine and its aftermath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoided had the Inter-Agency Task Force on Emerging Infectious Diseases ( IATF ) not prescribed such harsh quarantine measures . Granted , a level of lockdown was necessary to contain the spread of the virus , but the Enhanced Community Quarantine ( ECQ ) and even the General Community Quarantine ( GCQ ) were too severe and needlessly destroyed parts of the economy . It relegated millions to unemployment and drove thousands of MSMEs to insolvency . <p> If the IATF took the advice of the business sector , it would have adopted Vietnam 's strategy . Vietnam addressed the pandemic by immediately declaring a travel ban on China . It embarked on aggressive contact tracing and focused its quarantine efforts only on the hotspots -- the very streets , buildings , and neighborhoods where those infected reside . Meanwhile , it allowed the economy to keep operating including all facets of commerce , factories , and services . <p> Vietnam 's strategy proved more effective . Its infection rates are down and so are its death rates . The economic impact on MSMEs and job losses was minimized . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still forecasted to grow by 1.6% this year . <p> In contrast , the IATF prescribed a shot-gun approach to address the pandemic in the Philippines . Instead of closing only the barangays where infections were recorded , it chose to close the entire island of Luzon and key cities in the Visayas and Mindanao . Its strategy consigned the 10 industries mentioned above to the brink of death . It caused our economy to spiral into recession . <p> What burns acerbically is that despite such draconian measures , infections in the Philippines are still on the rise . The IATF ca n't even determine where we are in the infection curve since its base data is grossly inaccurate . Let 's not forget , the IATF only started to talk about ramping-up testing and tracing in April when it should have done it in January when the first COVID-19 case was discovered . Even today , it has yet to achieve 30,000 COVID-19 tests per day . <p> The militaristic quarantine measures that Health Secretary Francisco Duque , General Carlito Galvez , and the rest of the IATF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damage than good . Curiously , none of the members of the economic team are represented in the IATF , which is probably why Duque and Galvez implemented their shotgun strategy without regard to the effects it would have on the economy . <p> Unfortunately , President Rodrigo Duterte , who has the last say on the matter , was not able to discern the faults in the IATF 's militaristic plan . Sadly , our jobless countrymen and bankrupt MSMEs must bear the brunt of his lapse in judgement . <p> A V-SHAPED RECOVERY In the early days of the ECQ , the IATF used fear to scare the public into obeying the harsh measures of the quarantine . As a result , the populace became excessively fearful ( and paranoid ) of both infection and arrest . <p> As we begin to re-start the economy , the fear that the IATF perpetuated has become the greatest barrier to recovery . See , fear prevents people from going out to consume goods and services . Fear causes a drop in consumer demand . A drop in demand translates to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequently causes more layoffs and more companies going belly up . <p> The IATF failed to realize that fear will destroy the very foundation of our consumer-driven economy . This is why a V-shaped recovery is not something we can expect . The use of fear was another miscalculation of the IATF . <p> LONG-TERM RECOVERY The NEDA and the Department of Finance ( DoF ) were banking on the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act , or the CREATE Law , to facilitate our long term recovery . Apart from lowering the tax burden of local firms ( to help them survive ) , CREATE would have made us more competitive in the race to attract foreign investments , what with the flexibility to tailor-make incentive packages for them . The entry of foreign investments is vital to rebuild our industrial base and provide jobs for our displaced countrymen . <p> But despite the urgent call of NEDA , the DoF , and 31 business organizations from the private sector , the self serving clowns in Congress chose to prioritize the passage of the Anti-Terror Bill over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CREATE and our economic recovery program in limbo . <p> In one fell swoop , the IATF destroyed our once strong economy through its wrong strategy and many missteps . Congress just made our recovery harder to achieve . Sorry to say but the manner by which this pandemic is being handled is a disaster .

@@72034231 <h> Out From The Box : Learning as a Life-Long Investment -- even for coaches <p> In a recently-released statement by the Basketball Coaches Association of the Philippines , the group questioned the intentions of the coach Tab Baldwin in conducting Coaching Clinics with his World Hoop Clinics . <p> Quoting a portion of the statement , " He has been conducting basketball clinics in the last couple of years that cost more than what some coaches make in a month to participate in . In fact , his clinics are one of the most expensive ones in the country . " <p> In both the academe and in basketball coaching , there are common principles that apply . Let me share to you some points : <h> Investment of Time and Effort <p> I 've been teaching for nearly a decade . I told myself when I responded to the vocation teaching that before turning 40 years old , I must finish my Master 's Degree . And I did -- before I turned 37 . <p> One must invest time , money , and effort to reach that certain point , because in the academe , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In the university with which I am presently affiliated , the minimum qualification to teach at least in the Senior High School is a Master 's Degree and a professional teaching license . Without those , you can not be tenured or regularized . Education as a profession requires you to spend a portion of your earnings , devote your time and effort , and make sacrifices in order to achieve higher learning and become a better teacher . <p> Similarly , a basketball coach goes through the same experience . <p> After all , the job is not secure . There is no certainty of tenure when you take on this calling -- as the saying goes , a basketball coach is only as good as his last win . They devote sleepless nights to strategize and make game plans ; review their opponents and think about the next game after . They also have to invest in the right set of people to work alongside . <p> In this industry , long , time-tested , and honest partnerships are scarce even with the sense of ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your close associate today could be a potential rival for your position tomorrow . <h> Monetary Investment <p> As mentioned earlier , in the academe , in order to improve and reach the upper echelons of the institution , you must invest in higher learning . It will not come cheap ; one needs to sacrifice money in the name of personal and professional development . <p> Yes , there are scholarship grants available , but you will still spend for the instructional materials you 'll be needing . <p> In basketball coaching , it 's the same . <p> The way the game was played months before is not the way we play the game today , and will not be the way we play tomorrow . A good coach must be quick to adapt to the ever-changing landscape of competitive sports . As the Greek Philosopher Heraclitus will put it , " You can not step on the same river twice . " <p> In order for coaches to develop their craft , they too must enrich themselves through further coaching training and updated knowledge , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you really want to learn , you will be willing to spend for quality and that means shelling out . There 's no such thing as a free lunch . Quality learning is not cheap learning . <p> Yes , there are free resources around , but those can only take you so far without further investment . <p> In the three years of Coach Tab Baldwin 's World Hoop Clinics , we can not deny the quality of the coaches , both international and local , whom he invited as resource speakers for their particular expertise in the game . <p> For basketball coaches , it would be a mortal sin to pass up listening to the likes of Pero Cameron , Paul Henare , Natxo Lexcano , Nenad Trunic , Mark Dickel , Norman Black , Jimmy Alapag and Franz Pumaren , among others . Attendees have asserted that the fee was cheap in exchange for the things they learned and the new tricks they brought home . Quality does not come cheap in some instances , and if coaches would want to invest for their development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even coaches who tap financial patrons just for them to be sponsored to attend coaching clinics abroad . Are n't we happy that Coach Tab has been bringing in the same here ? <p> In both the academe and in basketball coaching , the money that you invest for your personal development has a lasting lifetime value . The amount you will shell out will lead you to countless opportunities . <p> The World Hoops Clinic organized by Coach Tab Baldwin is a big shot in the arm for basketball coaches determined to learn and further their career in the profession . For three years , coaches have been blessed to learn from top notch local and international mentors who can not be seen here everyday . We can not afford to be slow if we want to develop our coaches , who will in turn develop our players . Let 's not waste something good in our midst . <p> Let this be a uniting point instead of a divisive one , because Coach Tab and his coaching clinics work towards the same goal as his critics -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Philippine basketball as a whole .

@@72045238 <p> Seven months on from the finale of the 2019 season , Formula One cars will finally return to racing next weekend at the Red Bull Ring in Austria . The race will be held behind closed doors , with no fans or VIPs in attendance , and access to the circuit will be limited to those with essential jobs in the sport . <h> Editor 's Picks <p> The return comes 16 weeks on from F1 's decision to abort the original season-opener in Australia due to a confirmed case of coronavirus within the paddock , and the sport , alongside its governing body the FIA , is going to great lengths to provide as safe an environment as possible when it returns . As a result , F1 's " new normal " will be anything but normal for those familiar with the workings of the paddock . <p> Provisions for coronavirus testing , personal protective equipment ( PPE ) and social distancing have been planned in depth , with each team creating its own social bubble to minimize the risk of an outbreak spreading . Track-and-trace mechanisms will also be in place so that suspected cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 74-page document entitled " Return to Motorsport : In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic " , the FIA has detailed its recommendations , while some sections of the sporting regulations have also been tweaked to help make procedures as safe as possible . The following is a brief summary of those documents , highlighting the points that will be most obvious for fans watching on TV . <h> Testing and PPE <p> Lewis Hamilton gets belted into his Mercedes by a mechanic wearing PPE . Mercedes <p> Before traveling to the circuit , all F1 personnel must be able to prove they have had a negative COVID-19 test . Once on site , they will be tested every five days and will be tested immediately if they report symptoms . <p> Use of a track-and-trace app will also be mandatory for all team members at the event , so that those who have been in close contact with a positive case can be easily identified , quarantined and tested . <p> On top of that , there will be temperature checks when entering the paddock , social distancing measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and mandatory use of face coverings for the vast majority of the time at the circuit . The type of covering -- mask or shield -- will depend on the job being done and the proximity to other team members , but anyone whose job involves working across different teams with need to wear full PPE . <p> A number of teams have already tested old cars or completed filming days to get used to the new measures , and of all the restrictions being put in place , the physical wearing of PPE could be among the most challenging over a race weekend . <p> " I think in a very basic way the biggest challenge , especially for the guys in the garage , will be to wear the mask at all time , " Ferrari sporting director Laurent Mekies said in an interview with select media this week . " We have started to get used to it , as it 's becoming part of our normal life . <p> " Even though I 'm not wearing it here for the purposes of this interview , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the factory and the office , but it 's one thing to wear it in an office environment , it 's something else to wear it when it 's 40C or very hot at the race track . We think this will be the biggest challenge . <p> " We will do training to get used to it . We 're trying to put in place some measures , in terms of breathing exercises , and having some breaks to have time to do these exercises and keep in the best possible shape . " <h> Team bubbles <p> Mechanics will work in sub-bubbles within teams to avoid the potential spread of the virus . Ferrari <p> Key to the FIA 's plan is the division of the teams , and other key members of staff such as marshals , into social bubbles so that an outbreak of the virus does not spread across the event . By limiting the amount of people at the venue to essential staff and minimizing their interactions with others , the hope is that any outbreak will be more easily contained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 staff members compared to the 130 that could sometimes be expected at busy races in previous years . The core team of engineers , mechanics and technicians that have a direct impact on the performance of the car over a weekend -- known as operational staff -- will remain capped at 60 as it was in the past , meaning that it is mainly marketing , PR and catering staff that have been cut . <p> Most teams are then expected to create sub-bubbles within their team bubble , so that if a positive test comes back it can be easily traced and will only impact a small number of team members rather than the entire garage . However , the teams are allowed to decide how they mix those sub-bubbles if a job on a car , such as an engine change , require mechanics from one side of the garage to help on the other . <p> " You are forced into operating your team as a bubble by the FIA , but the fact that we are going to design sub-bubbles inside it is our responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we say , to be as resilient as possible in case of a positive case . <p> " So depending on how we design the bubble limits the interactions and contact between the people , and we are trying to design it in a way that does not affect our operations . In the case of changing an engine , if we need to do something like that and break the sub-bubble to go after an operational need like the one you mentioned , we can perfectly do it , but what it means is that as a team we will be a bit less resilient in case one of these people would be unfortunately testing positive . " <p> The team hospitality units will not travel to races , with catering facilities being laid on at the circuit and back at block-booked hotels where team members will be expected to stay during downtime . <h> What if there 's a positive test ? <p> Isolated cases will not result in the event being called off , but those who have been in contact with a positive case will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work . <p> " There is a risk that if one single person in the team tests positive the whole team is immediately out for the time of the test , which can take 24 hours , " Renault team principal Cyril Abiteboul said . " We can see that if that positive case is happening on a Saturday morning , you are not going to qualify and participate in the race . So I see that we still need to have some discussion on how to balance the risk and share some common sense . " <p> Drivers are included in the tests and would also have to enter quarantine if they return a positive result . Reserve drivers will be called upon to replace race drivers if necessary , with , for example , Mercedes Formula E driver Stoffel Vandoorne on standby to replace Lewis Hamilton or Valtteri Bottas if needed . <p> And just as reserve drivers will be on call in the event of a positive test , the teams will also have mechanics and engineers in reserve and ready to fly out to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this race a bit like the races we used to go to that needed a visa that took a long time to be issued , well we have done the same here in that spare people will be anyway performing the COVID test here at the factory in such a way that they are able to jump in if we need to replace some of our people at the race track , " Mekies said . " Of course , there is a limit to what we can do , because it 's not like we have a second race team ready to go , but yes , we are ensuring that a number of additional people that are not planned to go to Austria are preparing themselves to meet the regulations should they need to go . " <h> During the race <h> The grid <p> The Red Bull Ring will host the opening round of the championship . Mark Thompson/Getty Images <p> The FIA has modified the regulations surrounding the buildup to the race in order to minimize the amount of people on the grid and ease their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often hectic , with late adjustments to the cars and a sudden rush of mechanics back to the pit lane in the minutes before the lights go out for the formation lap . <p> The sporting regulations have been tweaked to limit each team to 40 personnel on the grid , and without the usual prerace ceremonies , the pit lane will now open 30 minutes before the formation lap rather than 40 minutes . The pit lane will close 20 minutes before the start of the race , at which point all cars should be on the grid , while tires must be fitted to the car with five minutes remaining rather than the usual three ( in-race penalties will be applied to any team who fails to do so in time ) . <p> With three minutes remaining , no more than 16 team members will be allowed to remain on the grid , with engines firing up with one minute to go and all equipment off the grid by the 15-second signal . <p> By creating more time to allow the movement off the grid but limiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ race , the FIA hopes to minimise potential contact between team members from different bubbles . <h> Marshals <p> Trackside marshals are essential to the safe running of races and are the first on the scene at an on-track accident . In previous years at the Red Bull Ring , their number has exceeded 350 , but the FIA has suggested reducing numbers at each post around the circuit . <p> However , the Return to Motorsport document makes clear that " a fundamental requirement to maintain safe conditions for running a competition through observation , signaling , intervention and the provision of appropriate emergency services must still be respected at all times " . <p> The FIA goes on to detail how the amount of marshals at each post , which sometimes exceeds 12 under normal conditions , could be reduced by combining roles such as the " observer " and " communicator " and limiting the amount of flag marshals from four to two . At low-risk posts the FIA also recommends reducing the numbers even further , but the emphasis is on making such judgements on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Pit stops <p> In-race tire changes are among the most visible examples of teamwork during a race weekend and , unfortunately , impossible to apply social distancing to . Although a successful pit stop will see the car stationary for little more than two seconds , as many as 20 mechanics work in close proximity to do so and there is an obvious risk as a result . <p> The crews will continue to be made up of a mix of the two sides of the garage , although any opportunities to reduce the number of mechanics taking part may be taken . Fortunately , a race pit stop requires helmet and face coverings by regulation , so a level of protection is already in place , but when watching on TV , it 's unlikely you 'll notice a difference . <p> " They are a little bit affected because , for global responsibility , we have tried to take as little people as possible to the race track to be at the limit , " Mekies said of Ferrari 's plans .

Instead F1 is considering a presentation with distanced individual podiums for the top three drivers and trophies in place before the ceremony rather than being handed over by dignitaries . <p> With no fans , and the mechanics unable to stand shoulder to shoulder around parc ferme , it is likely to make for an unusual atmosphere -- but a race win is still a race win , regardless of social distancing .

Unlike when you watch him haring down the wing , showing a pace that even outstripped Leroy Sane and Raheem Sterling at Manchester City , this time he slowed everything down .

But like Matondo plays football , there are a number of directions you can take to get to the top . Within Schalke circles , the club believe Matondo has the talent to become the next Timo Werner , sources have told ESPN . <p> " I was getting the rough treatment at youth football , when I was doing well , " Matondo tells ESPN . " You have to mature and not lose your head .

Then he 'd attack the full-back and either get floored by a lazy tackle or , if he 'd hurdled it , be arching into the penalty box , looking for an opportunity to shoot or tee up a teammate . He 'd play off the right , off the left , or up front , doing whatever the team needed . <p> Rabbi Matondo left England a relative unknown , but he has become a regular starter in the Bundesliga and is now drawing attention from the Premier League 's biggest clubs . Mario Hommes/DeFodi Images via Getty Images <p> Matondo always had that pace ( he 's now the third-fastest ever player in the Bundesliga , at 35.97 km/h ) -- and it could have led him down a different sporting path .

But he learnt a huge amount across his three-year spell from 2016 to 2019 . He remembers constantly keeping an eye on Sane and Sterling when he trained with the first team , and recalls the chats he had with manager Pep Guardiola . <p> " He has you screwed on ; you 're a bit star-struck around him at first , " Matondo says . " He 's won the Bundesliga , the Champions League , he 's coached Lionel Messi , Xavi ... Andres Iniesta ! You think , ' Wow , he 's giving me advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaking with Messi ! ' The biggest thing he said to me was , as I 'm quick , I had to slow down in the final third and work on my end product , while working hard on the pitch . " <p> Back then , Matondo was stuck in the " promising youngster " category , the sort of player who might get 10 minutes at the end of a league or cup game that had long been decided . He could have settled for the handful of opportunities to break through , but instead joined Schalke for a reported ? 10 million fee on a deal that runs through 2023 . <p> " They Manchester City knew it was getting to that sort of time where I was thinking it was the right move for me , " Matondo says . " They tried to keep me , but they respected that I knew I was doing what I thought was the right thing for my career . I liked the vibe I was getting from Schalke and the manager at the time , Domenico Tedesco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and telling me what he could get out of me . <p> " I loved the atmosphere at the Veltins-Arena , so I thought this was the right platform for me to improve and showcase my talent , and hopefully get to the level I believe I can get to in the future . " <p> By March 2019 , Tedesco had been sacked and eventually replaced by ex-Huddersfield boss David Wagner . The new coach was impressed by Matondo , who has clocked up 19 appearances this term ( he has played the third-most minutes for a teenager in the Bundesliga this season , behind Bayern Munich star Alphonso Davies and Cologne 's Noah Katterbach ) . But it has been a turbulent season at Schalke 04 , who have not won in the league since mid-January . <p> " We have no excuses , and as a team and individuals , we know things must improve , " Matondo says . " We have internationals and other good players , and while you can look at the reasons for bad results , we need to get back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of the season . <p> At just 19 , Rabbi Matondo is already a full international for his native Wales .

They had debutant 19-year-old Can Bozdogan playing , and just seven players ( including two goalkeepers ) on a bench usually reserved for nine . But then came defeats to Eintracht Frankfurt and a hefty 4-1 loss at home to Wolfsburg . It embodied Schalke 's turbulent , unpredictable season -- one step forward , then a huge stride backward . The injury list makes for dismal reading , but Matondo does n't want pity . Instead , he 's far more concerned about repaying Wagner 's faith . <p> " I have spoken so highly of him Wagner and I will always do that because of the things he 's done for me , " Matondo says . " He 's been great at giving advice to me on what I can improve on , and what I can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my game , on and off the ball . Now in these tough times where we 're defending a bit more than we 'd like , he 's been there encouraging me and improving my defensive side . But hopefully the attacking side can come out a bit with some more goals and assists . " <p> Matondo is proudly Welsh ; his Congolese parents moved to Cardiff when Matondo was 2 years old . He has four Wales caps to date and has those shirts with him in Gelsenkirchen as mementos . <p> He talks with a maturity and awareness beyond his years and he feels that is in part due to his exposure to first-team football . " You 're there with players who have done it and have so many appearances , " he says . " You have to grow up . And learn to take things one step at a time . But also , when you move abroad on your own , the culture is different , you have to mature in a different sort of way , or else otherwise it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of it .

" I totally respect what the guys have done . Marcus Thuram , Jadon Sancho , Weston , Achraf Hakimi -- all the other players have got involved .

" <p> There 's unfinished business for Matondo in the Premier League , and he will likely move back one day , but in contrast to how he lives his life , there 's no rush over that side of things . He 's frequently linked with Manchester United , while AC Milan have also been keeping a close eye on his progress , but he 's taking everything at his own pace . <p> " The only thing I 've got on my mind is the situation Schalke are in right now , and how we can bounce back from that , " he says .

We are all heartsick over what is happening . <p> Our economic managers are working hard to find solutions to propel us through the crisis .

At this writing , the BIR also still allows the online withdrawal of protests to qualify assessments as delinquent accounts , to enable taxpayers to avail of the amnesty . <p> A bigger measure is House Bill ( HB ) No. 6765 or the Digital Economy Taxation Act . HB No. 6765 seeks to institutionalize the tax rules for the digital economy , with provisions such as imposing value-added tax ( VAT ) on digital advertising services , subscription-based services , and other services rendered electronically . Another provision in the bill requires suppliers of digital services , network orchestrators , and electronic commerce platform providers to have a representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to allow regulators to catch up with developments in electronic or technology-based transactions . <p> The digital economy is said to be the new frontier of taxation .

However , challenges on the implementation of the related tax measures are expected , as transactions could cut across multiple countries . Perhaps some things must be threshed out before Netflix becomes more expensive . <p> Taxation does not always mean higher taxes ; sometimes , it means less if it is to foster recovery and growth . With the Corporate Income Tax and Incentives Reform Act ( CITIRA ) repackaged as the Corporate Recovery and Tax Incentives for Enterprises Act ( CREATE ) , there is a proposed outright cut in corporate income tax ( from 30% to 25% ) effective July , along with succeeding rate reductions ( 1 percentage point decrease at a time ) starting with 24% in 2023 until the rate reaches 20% by 2027 .

The " enhanced " NOLCO will extend the carry-over period of net losses ( for non-large taxpayers ) in 2020 from the current three years to five years . This will allow non-large taxpayers to deploy their losses in 2020 as additional deductions to their taxable income between 2021 and 2025 . <p> However , as the scale of the problems brought about by the pandemic is unprecedented , both large and non-large taxpayers may need the longer carryforward . Some might have considered five years not long enough . Even before the pandemic , other Asian countries were allowing five-year carryforwards of losses . Developed countries are allowing operating losses to be carried forward indefinitely . NOLCO provisions are built into the tax codes of most countries so that companies are taxed on average profitability over time . Through NOLCO , it is hoped that a business that sustains losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits when the firm recovers . <p> How about a " loss carryback " provision ? This would allow a taxpayer to carry its loss back to offset taxable income during the prior year , generating a refund of taxes paid in that earlier year . While carryforwards are good for times of recovery , carrybacks can provide added relief during a crisis -- relief that is badly needed by our micro , small and medium enterprises . <p> Our tax policies are rapidly evolving along with the new norms . Who knows , tomorrow , we may be talking about VAT cuts for certain products and services , as other countries are doing . <p> There is no playbook to get us through the crisis . The most we can do is to anticipate , prepare for , respond , and adapt to the ever-changing landscape if we are to rebuild a better tomorrow . I believe the Filipino can do this .

On the bright side , you no longer have to bring different kinds of devices to pass through the ETC lanes of various expressways across the country .

@@72079238 <p> As NBA teams get situated in the Orlando , Florida , bubble , one question that has persisted since the start of the coronavirus pandemic is not only what happens if a player tests positive for the virus but also what lingering effects might follow . <p> " There are unknown effects it has on lung capacity , unknown effects it has on cardiac health , " said one general manager of a team entering the NBA bubble , speaking on the condition of anonymity . " What if a 24-year-old catches it in Orlando and , in 14 days , he quarantines and is fine , but then he has these everlasting heart problems ? Or he gets winded so easily , or he becomes a little bit too susceptible to fatigue ? ... These are all the unknowns . " <p> There is a multistep process for anyone who tests positive , and it includes a two-week period -- either from the first positive test if the player remains asymptomatic or from the resolution of symptoms -- after which a physician will make a determination that isolation can end . The player will then take a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . <p> Each case will be handled based on its own needs , but John DiFiori , the NBA 's director of sports medicine , told ESPN that the timeline for any player to return from a confirmed positive case is at least two weeks . <p> " Everyone needs to understand that if someone were to test positive , it 's quite likely that they wo n't return to the court for a minimum of two weeks -- minimum , " said DiFiori , who is also the chief of primary sports medicine and attending physician at New York City 's Hospital for Special Surgery . " It may be even a little longer than that , depending on the individual circumstances , and then you need some time to get reconditioned . <h> Editor 's Picks <p> " Anyone who 's been out of training for two weeks is going to need time to recondition , " DiFiori continued . " These things are important for everyone to understand .

" <p> Matthew Martinez , a consulting cardiologist for the National Basketball Players Association , separately echoed that point to ESPN and said rest is key after a confirmed positive test because doctors believe that " the amount of cardiac damage can increase if you continue to exercise in the face of an active infection . " <p> Martinez noted , " So you 're somebody with a low-grade fever , and you have a little bit of symptoms . And , a week later , you 're fine . Do you have cardiac involvement ? Now , if you 're a regular person , like me , and you 're going to go do your two- to three-mile runs every day ... that 's a different discussion than if you 're a professional athlete . <p> " So that 's the reason why we worry about it that that high level of exercise intensity can increase your risk of having an adverse event @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Any player who tests positive for the virus must undergo a " COVID-19 Pre-Participation Cardiac Screening " in accordance with CDC protocols before beginning team-organized activities , according to the league 's health and safety protocols . <p> The reason the league and NBPA have focused specifically on the heart is myriad , but , according to a memo to teams on June 15 , the basis for cardiac screening during the pandemic is tied to recommendations from the American College of Cardiology 's Sports and Exercise Cardiology Council , along with feedback from consulting cardiologists for both teams and those who work with the NBPA and NBA . <p> " They reflect a current consensus approach , recognizing that the complete clinical picture of COVID-19 and potential effects on cardiac health , including myocarditis in particular , are not yet fully understood , and may be modified in the future to reflect new information , " the league wrote in the memo . <p> The recommendations from the American College of Cardiology 's Sports and Exercise Cardiology Council note that " Acute cardiac injury ... occurs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is significantly higher compared with the approximately 1% prevalence in non-COVID-19 acute viral infections . " <p> It further states that myocarditis -- an inflammation of the heart muscle -- from a myocyte invasion caused by the virus " could result in cardiac dysfunction , arrhythmias , and death . " <p> DiFiori said that much of what the league and its partners have learned about how the virus affects the heart is derived from studies of patients who have been hospitalized with COVID-19 . <p> " That data does show that there are probably two different ways that the virus can affect the heart , " DiFiori said . " One of those is a direct effect of the virus itself on the heart muscle and the heart function , and the other is sort of an indirect response where the virus stimulates a massive inflammatory response , and that inflammatory response can affect heart function . " <p> With respect to the coronavirus , DiFiori said , " We know that individuals who contract viral illnesses of a number of different types can develop myocarditis . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ training with a possible underlying concern for myocarditis can be a major concern . So , we have to be very cautious with that possibility . " <p> Are NBA players ' hearts more at risk ? <p> " We have no reason to believe that any athlete is at higher risk for a complication and cardiac complications related to the coronavirus than anyone else , " DiFiori said . " There 's no reason that we know that would suggest that right now . " <p> Martinez , who is also the director of the Sports Cardiology and Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy Center at Morristown Memorial Hospital in New Jersey , said doctors also believe preexisting conditions such as hypertension , diabetes or a prior heart attack can increase the risk of COVID complications . <p> " In the NBA , we worry a lot about player cardiac safety and evaluate annually for diseases that increased risk such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy where the heart muscle is thickening because of a genetic predisposition , " Martinez said . " For this disease , the NBPA and NBA continue that trend of taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions about whether the virus can have any lingering respiratory effects -- especially for athletes . <p> " There have been discussions and considerations among the sports medicine community , and specialists in cardiology and pulmonology , " he said . " I think the reason that we 've focused right now more on the cardiac side is because of the potential serious immediate consequences in the short term of not managing that aspect very cautiously . " <p> He added , " Myocarditis is a serious cardiac condition that you want to avoid and be very managed very carefully if it develops . " <p> If the cardiac screening were to reveal anything unusual , the ensuing steps would be determined based on what was found , DiFiori said . <p> " That would be highly individualized , depending upon circumstances , " he added . " You really ca n't summarize that in any neat little package because it would obviously involve additional diagnostic evaluation . " <p> With respect to any long-term issues , DiFiori added , " It 's very difficult , I think , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about potential long-term issues . The one thing that we would say is , listen to your physician and manage it appropriately . " <p> He added , " If you do n't feel well , do n't try to push through this . This is not a situation where anyone , whether you 're an athlete or not , should try to push through or minimize symptoms or try to ignore symptoms and try to push through to try to continue to work or continue to play a sport . " <p> One NBA athletic training official of a team inside the bubble pointed out that if a player who tests positive shows symptoms , they almost certainly would n't be able to do any training or rehab work that would enable them to play immediately after two weeks or however long they might be out . <p> The league and NBPA have , in general , focused more on the heart in recent years , and part of those efforts are tied to the health screenings the NBPA instituted for retired players in the wake of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Basketball players have the highest incidence of sports-related sudden cardiac death ( SCD ) in the United States among all athlete groups , " a 2016 study by NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Columbia University Medical Center reported .

" <p> DiFiori noted that the league has helped with publishing multiple studies in recent years based on data collected as part of their routine cardiac screening , but it is still learning more about the virus . <p> " It 's only been around now for six or seven months , " he said , " and we 're learning that it is very unique , and we do n't have a very good model in terms of other viral illnesses that seem to be able to consistently be applied .

If you 're exposed to drugs at a young age , and that 's the only part of your brain that 's well developed , poor you !

The former Catholic choir girl says she felt goosebumps . <p> " Ang maganda kasi nakahiwalay talaga si babae at si lalaki sa kapilya . ' Yun ho talaga ang nagustuhan kong una . Sa Katoliko , makikita po natin sama-sama . Ang ingay , di ba ? Imbes na manalangin ka eh maririnig mo talaga . Sa Iglesia , yung solemne ng pagsamba talagang maaano talaga ng isang tao ( It 's good that they separate men and women inside the church . It 's the first thing I liked . In the Catholic church , you can see that they are mixed . It 's noisy , is n't it ? Instead of praying , what you hear is the noise . In Iglesia , you can feel the solemnity of going to church ) , " Dory narrated in an interview with Rappler at her residence in barangay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how the recruitment begins for converts like Dory . One is invited to an Iglesia service and is later encouraged to study the 24 doctrines of the church , all of which he must accept if he wants to be a member of the church . <p> That 's not all . There 's a 6-month-long process called " Pagsubok " or trial , where recruits have to go to church regularly . Only after they 've complied with these requirements can he be baptized to become a member of Iglesia . <p> For children who grew up going to the church , called " Handog , " like former Alagad representative Rodante Marcoleta , the doctrinal studies usually begin at 10 . <p> The doctrines must be followed strictly and members are monitored by their respective overseers . Disobey and one may face the threat of expulsion from the church . <p> This strictness that turns off outsiders is the very same strictness that lures the believers . " Kung hindi tayo babawalan , tuluy-tuloy na nakakagawa tayo ng kasalanan . Sa Iglesia talaga , halos lahat na lang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ang pamumuhay , " said Dory . ( If there are no prohibitions , we continually commit sin . In Iglesia , almost all prohibitions that can be applied are applied so that one 's way of life does not go wayward . ) <p> When asked what he does when he disobeys the doctrines , a young member of the church said , " I pray that they do n't find out . I pray that I do n't die or get kicked out of the church before I can change my ways . " <p> Members who have been expelled may return to the church as " Balik loob . " They will go through " Pagsubok " again . <p> Life-changing <p> Dory 's mother was the first to join INC . Dory recalled how she tried for 5 years to evade her invitation to attend a service . When in 1986 she finally caved in , she said she got goosebumps when she entered the Church in Cogeo . <p> The minister 's message struck her to the core , too . " Tungkol po yoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anak . At ang dapat na ibigay na paggalang sa magulang nila , " Dory said . ( It was about parents and their children . Parents should love their children and children should respect their parents . ) <p> She comes from a broken family . Her parents separated when she was young and her mother later had a relationship with a married man . When her mother joined Iglesia , their lives changed . Her mother told her partner to go back to his wife even if they already had kids . <p> " Ito yung naging buhay niya . Pumasok siya sa ganoong sitwasyon . Noong nag-Iglesia siya , automatic na noong nalaman niya na ang aral ay bawal pala ito , nagdesisyon siya . ' Maghiwalay na tayo bumalik ka na sa pamilya mo kasi eto na ako . Doon po siya nagbago . Bawal pala yun , " Dory recalled . ( This became her life . She got herself into that situation . When she converted , it became automatic -- when she found out it was prohibited -- she made a decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family because this is what I am now . That 's when she changed . She found out it was prohibited . ) <p> Now married with 4 children , Dory goes to the Iglesia church inside " Erap City " in Montalban , Rizal , where many residents are Iglesia members . There are several INC churches inside the socialized housing city , too . <p> Dory said the doctrines of Iglesia on the family are what she values best up to this day . <p> ERAP CITY : Iglesia ni Cristo has a number of churches inside the Montalban 's socialized housing city . <p> Rappler photo <p> Basic services <p> Iglesia ni Cristo has a centralized structure akin to a government . It has its own rules and systems governing its own people . INC also provides its members a wide array of services . <p> " The church has a centralized structure . It 's like government . Kung ikukumpara mo , may tinatawag silang purok . ' Yung local , that is the town . Pagkatapos regional at national , " explained Marcoleta . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a purok . The local structure is the town , then regional and national . ) <p> It 's a top-down organization that allows the INC to cascade its instructions down to the members and see to it that they remain faithful to the doctrines . Dory , for example , serves as the overseer of about 100 Iglesia households in barangay San Isidro in Montalban , located just outside Erap City where they go to Church . <p> It 's the same cohesive organization that allows the church to assist its members in their basic necessities like housing and employment . " It 's a way of life that traverses into the economic aspect of their members and how members exercise their political rights . It 's all part of the doctrines , " Marcoleta explained . <p> Dory is not only the spiritual adviser for the INC members in the neighborhood , she acts like a barangay captain of sorts , assisting them when they need financial assistance from the municipal hall . She even talks to Meralco personnel to beg that they do n't cut electricity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The church has its own job placement office to help members find jobs . Dory 's daughter is a beneficiary . She got a job in SM , one the companies that prefers to hire Iglesia members because they are not allowed to join unions . <p> Housing for members is one that INC has also put a lot of focus on . It was because of INC 's request from the municipality that Dory and her Iglesia neighbors found a place at the government relocation site outside Erap City . <p> " Kami na-relocate dito from Antipolo . Ang Iglesia ang nag-asikaso . Sila po mismo nag-request sa munisipyo na dito kami sama-sama ilagay . Kung nasa ibang relihiyon ka naman , baka kung saan lang kami natapon , " said Dory . ( We were relocated here from Antipolo . Iglesia arranged everything . They were the ones who requested from the municipal government that we be put here together . Had we been with another religion , we would probably have been thrown elsewhere . ) <p> ' Complete communities ' <p> INC members are usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a challenge for members to live in a neighborhood of different religious sects . Dory and her neighbors were likely put there because it 's just beside Erap City , where there are many INC members and several INC churches . <p> The socialized housing city served as the center piece of the housing program of former President Joseph Estrada , whom INC backed in the 1998 presidential elections . It 's no surprise that many INC members benefitted from the program . <p> And this is where members see the benefits of bloc voting . Politicians who have been endorsed by the Church have been very helpful to the members . " Kapag sinunod namin ang kaisahan namin sa pagboto , talagang mapapabuti ka . Sasabihin ng Katolikong kandidato , ibinoto ako nito kasi taga-Iglesia . Kahit papaano may tulong , " Dory said . ( If we follow orders on who to vote for , it works to our advantage . The Catholic candidate will say , I was chosen because of Iglesia . It helps . ) <p> In other parts of the country , INC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Tagumpay Village in nearby barangay San Jose , a gated community of INC members . Marcoleta also spoke of new houses they are building in typhoon-ravaged Tacloban City . <p> It can be difficult for INC members when they see other neighbors engage in activities forbidden in their doctrines . Dory said she has to remind fellow church members not to join when neighbors start drinking or to keep quiet when they are fighting . <p> " When the church builds , it builds a total community . We are now discussing if it 's possible for the church to build a powerplant . Even that one , iniisip na ( we 're still thinking about ) , " said Marcoleta . <p> Improving image <p> The homegrown church has its share of critics because of doctrines that dictate on its members and how it has used its bloc voting to advance its interests . But on its centennial year , the members are enjoying what they see as a marked improvement in their image to outsiders . <p> Marcoleta knows the big structures INC has been building has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asking : How come you are able to build a magnificent edifice considering the church is relatively poor and relatively small ? " ( WATCH : ' Largest theater on earth ' shows Iglesia influence ) <p> ( I really feel proud . All of a sudden , we 're getting attention . In my circle of friends , it 's only now that I 'm hearing them ask , " How does one become a member ? " I 'm not saying they will become members but that 's all I was asked . All these years they have not been opening up such an issue . " What 's the process there ?

@@72112230 <p> I 'm looking for a second car . I narrowed my choices to the Toyota Altis 1.6G , Honda City 1.3S and Toyota Vios 1.3 or 1.5 . <p> You can sense that my bracket is in the P800,000 area . My problem is in the fuel consumption.I travel from Malolos , Bulacan to Fairview , Quezon City via the North Luzon Expressway and Commonwealth Ave . everyday with a distance of 100Km back and forth . <p> I usually travel alone and will use this car with my wife and four kids sparingly during weekends . <p> Can you enlighten me with the average fuel consumption of these cars ? I presently use a Toyota Revo SR Diesel which runs 10km per liter . <p> Thank You ! <p> appletreemd <p> Dear Appletreemd , <p> Thanks for taking the time to write to us here at Top Gear . We 're always glad to be of help to our readers . Hope you enjoy reading our magazine as much as we enjoy putting it together every month . <p> The Honda City and the Toyota Vios are no doubt great for what you have in mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brands . Are you averse to getting a hatchback ? The versatility of the interior , combined with the lighter weight ( anywhere from 30 to 50 kilos ) help give you more bang for your buck , especially in terms of fuel consumption since it will be like driving with one person less in the car all the time . <p> I drive a hatchback myself everyday and I just love the practicality , ease of parking and enjoy decent fuel consumption of just under 9km per liter with mostly in-city , short , traffic , stop-and-go driving . Out on the highway , the efficiency goes up to about 12km per liter . And I 'm no tree-hugger so I drive at a decently fast pace . I 've also slapped on bigger and heavier 17-inch wheels which should hurt fuel economy but , in reality , not by much . Plus I 've got bolt-on modifications which should further hurt economy , but again , it 's hardly noticeable from when my car was completely stock . The point I 'm driving at here is that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the add-ons I 've put in . <p> But if you will be confined to a sedan in the B-segment category ( the segment you 're looking at ) , Toyota will be a better choice . It 's a simpler car , not as fancy as the City and cheaper if you know how to pick the right trim level . Also , Toyota 's engines have lots of low-end grunt compared to Hondas which really need revs to make power . In cut and thrust driving , and accelerating from low RPM 's to overtake without need for downshifting ( you encounter this a lot on the highway ) , Toyota 's engines , particularly the 1.5 liter 1NZ-FE fitted onto the Yaris nd Vios is hard to beat . <p> That 's not to say the City 's 1.5-liter engine is no good , but in terms of ease of use , Toyota 's engines are more effortless in feel . Flat out however , Honda 's will have the edge on out-and-out redline acceleration . It requires more effort on the part of the driver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time to spare before buying , wait for the Mazda 2 . It 's coming out this December , with the 5-door hatchback coming first , followed by the 4-door sedan 1st quarter of next year . It 's lighter than the Toyota Yaris , Toyota Vios , Honda Jazz , and Honda City weighing in at exactly 1,000kg for the 5-door , and 1,020kg for the sedan--lightest in the B-segment category . Suspension is rally good : sporty yet comfortable enough for daily driving on our poor roads . I had the chance to drive it recently in Thailand ( wait for it in an upcoming issue ) and came away impressed . <p> Do n't bother with the Altis . The body 's a smidge too heavy for the modest 1.6-liter engine .

My 19-year old daughter is presently driving a 2000 Toyota RAV4 ( AWD ) , which is a hand-me-down from myself . She is a student-athlete and she prefers driving an SUV because of the high ground clearance and , at the end of the day , the looks . Although the RAV4 is in very good condition even if it 's already 10 years old , I 'm planning to give my daughter a brand-new vehicle . <p> I am quite lost with the various small and medium SUV choices in the market , plus the fact that there are petrol and diesel considerations to think about . <p> I have made a long list of vehicles but I have yet to really narrow it down . By the way , it 's also a surprise so I have no idea what she wants .

These SUVs , with their ladder-frame chassis , will not offer the comfort and refinement of a unibody , car-based compact utility vehicle such as the Honda CR-V . <p> Continue reading below ? <p> As for the Ford Escape , it 's the least of my favorites as there 's nothing about it that I like . <p> The Honda CR-V is a safe choice but it 's very feminine for your athletic daughter . She might find it too girly , too mommy-like . But it is smooth , refined , spacious and it 's an excellent long-distance cruiser . <p> The Nissan X-Trail surprisingly is a favorite among female buyers . It 's got loads of space , the CVT is excellent and responds very quickly , the suspension has excellent balance of comfort and control--giving you confidence even on winding , bumpy roads . The driving position though is quite awkward for me although I am admittedly not the most athletic person in the world . My jaw gets the most exercise as I angrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RAV4 is old ( it 's the oldest in the current line-up of compact utility vehicles on the market ) so you 'll be buying something that is , by design and specification , three to four years older than everything else . It 's still a good , safe and solid choice but then the CR-V is slightly newer and has received significant suspension changes to improve ride quality further . <p> Continue reading below ? <p> The Mazda CX-7 is a surprise for me . Although the shape is n't macho and it 's quite plain and bare inside , it 's very classy when new . Tire noise is a concern on the highway but in-city driving is effortless and the vehicle is easy and fun to drive . The looks , though , are more modern-MPV than compact utility vehicle . <p> And lastly , the Subaru Forester . In the eyes of her peers , the Forester Turbo 2.5 XT is the most desirable , the most impressive compact utility vehicle to own . Fast , fun , versatile interior and surprisingly , the turbocharged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ version , which is slow and cumbersome , not to mention thirsty because the measly 150hp is burdened with carrying a heavy SUV with advanced AWD system that it wo n't ever need given its modest power output . If you 're going to buy a Forester , buy the turbo , or buy something else . This will also give you the best resale value among the vehicles in your list . <p> Continue reading below ? <p> Hope my thoughts on the SUVs you listed help .

@@72151232 <h> 1 . The champs ' defense : The most exciting nerd thing in the NBA <p> Nick Nurse 's funky zones get the attention , but Toronto 's base defense is one of the best night-to-night shows in the NBA . The Raptors in full flight are beautiful . <p> They make stuff like this look routine : <p> The Raptors give up the most 3s in the league , and the most corner 3s in NBA history . Opponents have hit a league-low 33.4% from deep . Toronto has gotten a little lucky , but the Raptors are also dictating the terms of engagement . <p> They sell out to make sure your best players do not get their favorite looks . That leaves shooters open , but Toronto is better than anyone at closing space . Pascal Siakam and OG Anunoby are long , fast , and hoppy enough to help and recover without requiring any rotations . When the Raps do toggle assignments on the fly , there are no hiccups . No one pauses to think . Each player knows what he should do , and has a deep , unspoken faith each teammate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team mind-meld -- the sort of shared knowledge and profound confidence players , coaches , and GMs spend careers chasing . <p> They discriminate in real time between so-so shooters and those who require constant attention . They are willing to live and die with role players shooting semi-contested 3s late in the shot clock . <p> And just when you think you have them figured out , Nurse injects matchup chaos . Against Miami this week , he had Marc Gasol defend Jae Crowder on the wing -- leaving Anunoby on Bam Adebayo , and Siakam on Jimmy Butler . Nurse picks defensive assignments by skill set as much as position . Gasol was fine chilling on the wing , waiting to pounce on drivers or jog at some Crowder non-corner 3 . <p> That randomness can throw off opponents for two or three possessions -- enough to swing a quarter . It 's wild to you , but not to them , and great power lies in the difference . <p> The matchup juggling confuses opponents in transition if the Raptors get a stop : Do we find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Any hesitation opens a window of space somewhere , and those windows are oxygen for Toronto 's transition attack -- the best in the league . <h> 2 . The bubble TV atmosphere <p> The bubble games look and sound fantastic on television . Watching the run of play , I do n't register anything new or unusual . The virtual fans are fun , including the celebrity pop-ins . During one Miami Heat game , the video board running along the sideline flashed a recorded image of Miami fans chanting , " Let 's go Heat ! " with the chant itself pumped in -- and it sounded like the real thing . <p> The NBA and its broadcast partners ( hi ! ) have shown shocking restraint with gimmicky camera angles . Thank the basketball gods , there has been no SkyCam . The low corner angle they use in snippets allows for a clean-ish view of the floor , and a greater appreciation of how fast these guys jet around . <p> I 've heard from players that the lack of a crowd feels awkward . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the quiet has benefits for TV viewers : We hear every " Hell no ! " from bench players mocking opponent shooters . Those shooters hear it , too ; the bubble is producing record levels of mean-mugging and bad words directed at bench jokesters . A reminder for refs : Shooters who return taunts at yappy benches should be immune from technical fouls. <h> 3 . Jimmy Butler 's 3-phobia <p> Butler 's aversion to 3s is reaching DeRozan-y levels : <p> Butler 's feet are straddling the arc before that pass arrives . He has zero interest in even looking at a wide-open bomb . Butler averages two 3-point attempts per game , his lowest figure since 2013 , and has hit a hideous 25% of them -- worst since his rookie season . <p> This has n't been an issue for Miami -- yet . The Heat rank seventh in points per possession and have drained a league-best 38% of their 3s .

Answer questions on the seeding games for a chance at a guaranteed $5,000 ! Make Your Picks <p> But there is not always a better shot around the corner . ( Adebayo was called for traveling in the above clip . ) There might not be time on the shot clock to generate one . Butler has hit just 32% on long 2s and 40% from floater range -- blah marks . <p> Miami 's best lineups center on two players who do not shoot 3s -- Butler and Adebayo . All three players around them almost have to be both willing and decent 3-point shooters , a construct that limits the combinations Erik Spoelstra can use . Two of Miami 's other starters -- Crowder and Kendrick Nunn -- barely qualify . Their remaining starter , Duncan Robinson , is one of the best shooters alive , but defenses have already started paying him more attention . They are going to face-guard him everywhere in the playoffs . <p> Butler was a league-average 3-point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to take , and make , a fair amount when defenders ducked under picks . The Heat would have a higher ceiling if Butler started doing that again . <h> 4 . Utah 's ninth man problem <p> Another ripple effect of Bojan Bogdanovic 's season-ending injury : The Jazz might not have any good options for their last rotation spot . <p> Emmanuel Mudiay got the first chance . Mudiay might grow into a solid scoring backup . He loves burrowing for floaters and long 2s , and has hit half his midrange shots this season , per Cleaning The Glass . He has the build to defend both guard positions . <p> But a dribble-happy type lacking a reliable 3-pointer is about the last thing Utah needs off its bench . Its top eight features four better ball handlers than Mudiay : Mike Conley , Donovan Mitchell , Joe Ingles , and Jordan Clarkson . At least two are usually on the floor . Mudiay provides zero spacing for them . <p> Quin Snyder pulled the plug in the second half Wednesday against Memphis and gave Rayjon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games to earn that ninth spot . If he does n't , the best and only option might be one Snyder appears not to like : an eight-man rotation . Utah should be able to craft one that does n't stretch anyone 's minutes too far . <p> Attacking Bridges one-on-one from a standstill is like exploring a black hole : It might be interesting for a few seconds , but nothing good is going to happen to you once you 're in the vortex . <p> Bridges ' arms are a menace to society . Devin Booker 's buzzer-beater against the Clippers on Tuesday was possible only because one of Bridges ' arms apparated into the path of Ivica Zubac 's outlet pass after an initial Phoenix miss . <p> If Bridges keeps improving his 3-pointer -- he 's up to 35% -- he will round into the perfect complement for Booker and Deandre Ayton : 3-and-D ace with just enough playmaking juice to keep the machine moving . He 's one of the league 's smartest off-ball cutters . <p> The Suns and Bridges are living proof that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match . The Sixers won praise on draft night in 2018 for flipping Bridges ( the No. 10 pick ) for Zhaire Smith ( No. 16 ) and an unprotected 2021 Miami first-rounder . In cold asset valuation terms , the Sixers won that deal . <p> Smith has played 143 minutes in 13 games . Bridges would be a snug fit next to Ben Simmons and Joel Embiid . Philly traded that Miami pick to the Clippers for Tobias Harris , and then re-signed Harris to a five-year , $180 million deal . <h> 6 . Devin Booker 's passing <p> No , I will not sell you any of the Booker stock I purchased while corners of the NBA derided him as some empty-calories loser . ( And , yes , Suns fans , I was one of the voices arguing Phoenix should not have been invited to the bubble . Even looking back today , I do n't think I was wrong given what we knew then and what the NBA 's priorities supposedly were -- i.e. , limiting potential viral hosts . The Suns entered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the playoffs , per our Kevin Pelton ! They have proven everyone and everything wrong : humans , math , machines . It is a remarkable story . ) <p> There has always been a weird disconnect between Booker 's reputation and reality . He entered the league known as a 3-point virtuoso -- maybe the next Klay Thompson -- but proved more scorer than shooter . He can get buckets in any style , from any spot . As soon as Phoenix gave Booker the ball late in his rookie season , he showed way more passing chops than anyone -- including team higher-ups -- knew he had . <p> " We saw him as a traditional shooting guard , " Ryan McDonough , the former Suns GM , told me in 2016 . " To see him run the pick-and-roll , and make plays at this level -- that has surprised us . " <p> Booker has dished almost seven dimes per game over the past two seasons . He navigates the pick-and-roll with a cadence that is somehow both smooth and unpredictable for defenses . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manipulator . He is a master at keeping options open , and disguising which one he prefers . <p> He has slung some passes in the bubble that make you think , " Wait , was that Luka Doncic ? LeBron ? " <p> Booker suckers him with a glance at Ayton . Finney-Smith lurches there . Booker whips the ball to Johnson while Finney-Smith is leaning toward Ayton . Finney-Smith has no shot to recover . <p> Booker zooms around Ayton 's pick and decelerates into a languid right-handed dribble . It 's unclear if Booker is going to dribble again or gather the ball . ( Booker can gather and flick layups without using his left hand -- adding disguise . ) <p> Booker also shifts to his right , hoping to drag Zubac a few inches that way -- providing Ayton space to zip to the rim after Booker 's nifty pocket pass . That 's mean . <p> Look how quickly he digests that the correct pass out of this post-up from Thursday 's win was not to the cutter -- but to the shooter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the way : Booker is 23 . <p> Rubio is playing some of the best ball of his life . Phoenix also chased Malcolm Brogdon last summer , and he is a more obvious fit on offense next to Booker . " Phoenix was very serious , " Brogdon told me in the fall . " That was definitely a possibility for me . " But Rubio 's good , and Phoenix needed someone good . <p> Booker might be Exhibit A in why the NBA should have included seeding games in awards balloting . He was a borderline All-NBA candidate , and he would have leapfrogged onto more ballots . <p> As the No. 1 option of a skeleton crew , LeVert has gotten to test his one-on-one game in new ways and from new places . He has gravitated to the left wing . He has a lethal first step going baseline , and he sets defenders up for it with twitchy jabs and fakes : <p> When defenders sit on that move , LeVert baits them with a head bob before bolting to his right : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Orlando , up from 9.9 pre-bubble , per Second Spectrum . His efficiency has skyrocketed : almost 1.2 points per possession , a mark that would rank in the top five among players who have recorded at least 50 isos . LeVert has also drawn shooting fouls on 17.5% of those plays , which would just about top the league for the season , per Second Spectrum . <p> It 's unclear how this translates to a world that includes Kevin Durant and Kyrie Irving -- provided LeVert is part of that world next season . LeVert going Skinny Melo would be useful when one or both stars rest , but I doubt they 'd be psyched about it becoming a huge part of Brooklyn 's core offense . ( Four efficient bubble games is not evidence it should be . ) <p> LeVert has dished zero dimes out of his isolations in the bubble , and his assist rate on those plays overall is middling , per tracking data . LeVert has good vision and is smart using his arrhythmic off-the-bounce game to unlock passing lanes . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prone . <p> More pressing for next season : LeVert has to prove he can hit catch-and-shoot 3s consistently . He 's up to 36% from deep this season , but he has nailed about 40% of pull-up triples -- and an ugly 31% on catch-and-shoots , a really unusual split . LeVert was only 18-of-66 on catch-and-shoot 3s last season and has never hit better than 37% in any season . <p> LeVert has back-end All-Star potential . His one-on-one prowess in Orlando is a great sign . But he has to be the right kind of third star in Brooklyn . <p> Holy god . Even after coming back to earth against the Suns , Warren is leading the bubble in scoring , averaging 34 points on a preposterous 59/54/86 shooting line -- and , yes , there should absolutely be an official Bubble Scoring Champion , with a bubble-shaped trophy and everything . <p> He is jacking 3s off the dribble with zero hesitation when defenders skitter under picks : <p> Warren is 5-of-12 on pull-up 3s in bubble games . He had tried just 16 such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was 15-of-60 on pull-up triples combined over the first five seasons of his career . If Warren really has this shot in his bag , he will become a dangerous three-level scorer . He is shooting a career-best 74% at the rim , and walked into the league with one of its silkiest floater games . He never turns the ball over . <p> As I 've noted before , Warren has bought in on defense in Indiana -- against both wings and power forwards -- after showing passing interest in Phoenix . Warren deserves a ton of credit , but so do the Pacers -- and especially Nate McMillan -- for building a culture that will not tolerate any less . <p> McMillan is a little Tom Thibodeau-ish in that his offenses have been stodgy and almost anti-modern , but surprisingly effective in some seasons . ( He presided over two top-10 offenses in Portland . ) Pending Victor Oladipo 's presence , the Pacers are of the right collective age to take another mini-leap next season . It is fair to ask if reinventing the offense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coach to do it . <p> What is indisputable : McMillan makes every player earn minutes on defense , and his teams make opponents earn every point . <p> Everyone outside Oklahoma City loves Beverley 's game -- snarling , in-your-jersey defense , trash talk unfurled in every direction . After arriving in the Chris Paul trade , he helped the Clippers form an identity that appealed to Kawhi Leonard and Paul George . <p> One small nit to pick : <p> Yeah , that 's a nice closeout from Dion Waiters . But that has be a 3 or an instant catch-and-go drive . Instead , the Lakers reset their defense . Beverley gets the ball to Zubac with almost no advantage , and the possession peters out into a shot-clock violation . <p> A lot of the Clippers can be over-deliberate , though that does n't matter with Leonard . He can do what he likes . But their offense could use more flow against elite defenses . Beverley acting with consistent decisiveness would help . <h> 10 . Washington 's striped socks <p> There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've wrung something from the experience . Troy Brown Jr . and even Jerome Robinson are getting ballhandling reps that might prove useful next season , when Bradley Beal and John Wall return . Washington really needs Brown to develop into a starter-level wing , and his performance in the bubble has been encouraging . He has always been a smart cutter and extra-pass type . <p> Most important : I was reminded of how snazzy the Wiz look in their stars-and stripes uniforms , down to matching striped socks most of the players bust out : <p> Washington has gradually excised Wizards-related images and wordmarks from its art -- basically everything but the Wizards name itself . That has been pleasing . These socks rule .

The club was a hub for counterculture , and it seemed natural that LGBTQ+ people would gravitate towards people who did n't bat an eyelash over free , unabashed expression . <p> Whenever the opening riff of Robyn 's " Dancing on My Own " played , bodies stampeded to the dance floor , pressed closely to each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and unlikeliest of queer anthems ( i.e. songs that make gay people scream ) -- sometimes , odd interjecting calls for a couple to " MOMOL . " This was one of the clubs where Sarah G 's " Tala " was put on rotation early , arguably preempting a craze several years later . <p> Future -- as it was diminutively and fondly known -- was such a cramped room and impossible to dance in it ... by normal standards . But that made it such a character of its own , and even more interesting characters spilled onto the curbside of General Malvar Avenue , huddling in circles and holding council while clutching beer bottles . <p> This was the scene on a busy weekend , but it 's difficult to pinpoint when it started to look like this . There are few milestones to mark exactly when the place became a go-to for the LGBTQ+ community . It 's probably easier to specify -- as individuals -- when it became a habit for them to unwind at the Cubao haunt . <p> Today x Future announced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afloat in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic and climate of uncertainty . <p> Many of its regulars asked in the wake of the shocking news : " How do you even mourn a place ? " After all , it was a home to many queer and trans individuals ; there , they felt at ease and accepted . <p> Its " last hurrah " was its annual Pride afterparty , " Money Success Fame Glamour " -- broadcasted online in these exceptional circumstances . The symbolic weight of that ca n't be understated . <p> Until the owners had to turn over the keys to the landlord , its legacy -- especially among the queer community -- remains formidable and one of a kind . <p> Here , the founders themselves , DJs , and promoters put on record what made Today x Future the LGBTQ+ haven that it was . <p> Days of future past <p> Today x Future first set up shop at Cubao Expo , a burgeoning creative enclave whose heyday was in the late oughts . <p> Sharon Atillo ( Co-founder ) : I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hanging out , at a store called I Love You . There 'd be a lot of slow nights and so to pass the time we 'd drink , and of course , we 'd need music . Chie Casta ? eda was the first person we hung out with actually as he was a regular at the record stores in Cubao X , then he brought his sister Leah to our store . So at first it was just my laptop and Leah 's speakers which we called " woofer , " I think . <p> The music was of my era and the Fluxxe party series era ... Some Joy Division , New Order , the Killers , Human League , some new wave .. I 'm not very good at music genres ... We did n't have techno then , and I do n't think there was house on my laptop . <p> So we 'd have drinks and later on we 'd be dancing like crazy people inside the store . Then later on some friends would join , and I think maybe weeks after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could be a caf ? /bar . <p> Then we got to have proper DJs with proper music set up and line up with different genres daily ... This pre-TxF nights resonate so much because I think that the energy we had those night totally carried on towards the " future . " <p> Leah Casta ? eda ( Co-founder ) : Today x Future began in 2008 , when I was still moving on from a bad relationship . I thought I 'd put my little savings into something productive or else , I 'd be dead broke . <p> My music roots come a long way , my brother , Chie , being my mentor . From the Beatles to ' 90s alternative , to ethereal and indie pop to techno . <p> The scene mostly consists of my friends from the creative and events industry . These are the people I grew up with . The people I went to raves with or did fashion shows or shoots with , to the people I did events with -- fashion , arts and the band scene back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesy of Jujiin Samonte <p> Samantha Nicole Samonte ( Part owner and DJ ) : I started going during the earliest years of Future back when it was in Cubao X and when we could all stay until 6 or 7 AM . <p> It was an irresistible , beautiful , liberating mess that I kept going back to ! The place and people were authentic , the music was genre-spanning , from indie pop and alternative to dubstep , electro and a ton of local indie bands and DJs playing all the time . As a newcomer , I was introduced to a good number of people I looked up to in the art and music scene , and it was lovely getting to know them outside of stages or art galleries . <p> It was always the thematic weeknights that I loved going to the most . The weekends were a given big fun but back then , Leah told me to come more often during weekdays because it 's when the subculture really shined . There were film showings , retail popups , endless conversations , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered in sand when The Beach was shown , and really fantastic music was being played by the DJs , primarily by Chie . <p> Of course , the cast of characters wow just as uncompromising as the vibe and place . You could really feel the culture alive and thriving there . Living in Las Pi ? as then , I did n't care that I was burning so much taxi money going back and forth just to be there . Then I lucked out and married into the Future family . Hahaha ! <p> Jujiin Samonte ( Promoter &amp; DJ ) : Today x Future was the extension of the offbeat , bohemian fashion paradise that was the I Love You Store ( my favorite store to visit to shop and be inspired at that time ) . The store ( 2nd floor ) was n't just enough for its patrons so the bar ( 1st floor ) made sense . <p> My friend Paulo Castro told me about the place . He ( and Jujiin Samonte his boyfriend ) introduced me to everyone . I fell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fakk , I found my people ! <p> Most of the people who frequented Future were people from fashion and art . <p> Photo courtesy of Jujiin Samonte <p> Karlo Vicente ( Promoter &amp; DJ ) : I was actually at the opening night ( when it was still called I Love You x Future ) . However , I ca n't remember much from that night LOL . During the first few years , I went there a lot . When Future was still in Cubao X , I think there was a time , until very early 2010 , when I went there almost every night . ( I think I only stopped going because I moved to Singapore for a while , but even then , I 'd sometimes fly back and go to Future -- like straight from the airport , grab a drink and meet everyone at Future . ) <p> In those days , whenever I went to Future , it 's like just people who know each other . But a big crowd of people who know each other -- a mix of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd . And people dressed up . Well not all , of course , but a lot of them anyway . You can dress up or dress down , do whatever you like . <p> Also , on weekends , I remember it usually ended late . There were nights when I 'd get there at 2 or 3-ish , and it did n't really feel that late . We usually stayed until around 6-ish/7-ish , and Chie would play the last song : " Just Like Honey " by The Jesus And Mary Chain . They also sometimes put the DJ on the roof . This was when they were still in Cubao X. <p> But there were also periods around 2012 until maybe 2015 when I went to Future almost every night . I spent a lot of my very extended youth at Future . <p> Photo courtesy of Jujiin Samonte <p> Xtina Superstar ( DJ ) : I remember it being chill and more relaxed . It was a place to see familiar faces . <p> Melvin Mojica ( Promoter &amp; DJ ) : My first visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like visiting a friend 's house -- eh kasi nga ( because ) my old friends were the ones behind it , so swabe lang . ( It was cool . ) Fun . <p> Julianna Force ( Promoter &amp; DJ ) : My first ever visit at Future was when it was still at Cubao Expo and it was a Panty Monsters event . It was overwhelming for someone like me who was a house party/DOTA girl , but girl , the scene was amazing ! Everyone was just so cool ( well , not everyone , but most of them were ) and the energy was super fun . <p> My first few visits were honestly very awkward cause I was " hanging " with the regulars as a newbie , basically like a freshman trying to impress the seniors . Despite that , I never did not enjoy a night at Future . <p> Jer Dee ( DJ &amp; illustrator ) : My first time at Future was in 2016 . It was a Friday night ; I went at around 9:30 PM to meet up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got there , the only people inside were myself , the manager , and the bartenders . <p> It was only later on that I learned that the crowds only filled up after midnight . So I stuck around , alone on the couch , appreciating the interiors because it felt like I was in a house party -- that was the first vibe I got inside Future . <p> I considered leaving after finishing my bottle of beer who the hell waits for another 3 hours alone in a bar ? An introvert 's nightmare . <p> Then the DJ started to play . I think it was an indie set : Lykke Li , Passion Pit , MIA , MGMT -- very early 2010s/hypem era , lol . I was really surprised because I 've never heard any of these songs played in other bars . <p> Then I started hanging around the dancefloor bopping to the music , only to realize 3 hours have passed when my friend finally showed up . We went outside to go for a smoke and I was even more surprised that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even worked with -- were also there . <p> Kim Galanza ( Promoter &amp; DJ ) : As someone who was " fresh-off-the-boat " coming from Iloilo City -- a provincial boy -- and who only saw and imagined being in the scene through features in Preview magazine ( at that time TxF was still in Cubao Expo ) , the very first time I stepped foot was pure euphoria . <p> Obviously , I fell in love with the music and the people . I knew it was where I wanted to be from the moment I stepped in . Then fast forward to actually being accepted and finally being part of the family , it was n't even validation , it was pure outright acceptance , that I , a lost little gay boy from Iloilo , could belong to a community with like-minded ideas &amp; tastes . <p> Not only was it a blanket of comfort that eased a level of loneliness being away from home but it also paved way for personal growth . If I could sum it up as best as I could , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regular to being a part of the family -- TxF was able to help me shed layers , distilling me into something pure , into the person who I am now . <p> Christine Ferrer ( Manager - 2017-2019 ) How can you describe in a few sentences a place many grew up with and considered as their home and safe space ? <p> Ever since Future opened its doors back in 2008 , it was already different . Wide genres of music , art , fashion , and film emanated from its walls . Over and above all is the sense of acceptance . There is a relief in finding a safe place , where one can experience freedom in finding and being yourself . <p> Building a haven <p> Sharon : It was n't planned to be a safe queer space and I think at that time gender labels were not so much of a thing yet . We just had lots of happy and gay friends who were creative and that was all . <p> I guess the moment when we moved to Malvar Street was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attracted even more people eventually and I guess people of similar frequencies just gravitated to us . What made us a favorite is maybe because we were a place you could let your hair down -- no judgements -- with people who knew how to have FUN . <p> Leah : It just became what it was because Future was welcoming to all . As far as I could remember , no matter your gender , if you are ridiculing a guest of mine , or anyone for that matter , I will personally kick you out . A lot of Cubao X kids can attest to this , hahaha ! <p> I think it was also because of the power of social media . Before , we would do text blasts and would print flyers for people to come . Now , it 's very easy to spread the word or create a buzz about something online . <p> Samantha Nicole : Considering how fluid , welcoming and non-judgmental Future is , it naturally attracted queer people . Everyone desires a sense of belongingness and freedom of expression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do remember when we started to attract more from the community is when it became like an unofficial afterparty place post-Pride march and we opened up more nights to various regulars who became our promoters . It was like a floodgate that Future welcomed with open arms , hahaha -- so much so that we had to impose a small cover charge just to control the crowd that would come on weekends . <p> We knew that a lot of our friends and regulars who attended Pride March in Marikina Sports Complex would flock to Future after . Beneath the loud music blasting from the speakers , there was an unmistakable low hum , building up , slowly getting louder . <p> Lo and behold , there was a sea of people . What greeted me was a joyous sight : Crying , dancing , hugging each other while exclaiming " Happy Pride ! " That was a pivotal moment for me : seeing them all proud , full of love . All of them at Future because they are home . <p> Leah : I grew up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making sure everyone has a good time . I guess that carried over when we started Future . We always want you to have the best possible time without any worries and maybe it could become your second home . <p> We also made it a point to teach our staff and security that every person who comes to Future is important and must be treated with respect ; that they were n't just guests . They can become family and friends . <p> Photo by Mersi Carballo from Facebook/Today x Future <p> Sharon : Sometimes , I 'd arrive early and I 'd realize there 'd be a lot of people coming in and I did n't know who they were ! <p> Samantha Nicole : Like what Sharon said , when we would come in , we started seeing unfamiliar faces , which was great ! Our community was growing , and many of them would come even on weekdays when we would play music they may not be familiar with , but we 've been playing in Future for the longest time . <p> Apart from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sharon , Chie , Austin Casta ? eda , and I and all the other regulars and TxF team would welcome newcomers to the place -- we make them feel like this is the place where you can be who you really are . No pressure , no pretense . These newcomers remember that and then the next time , they 'd bring more their friends , and those people would bring theirs and so forth . <p> I think all those free shots and birthday pizzas also helped , hahaha ! But really , it was such a natural and sincere way of building something that lasts a long time . <p> Darryl : Basta nakita namin kada party , parami nang parami ang pumupunta . Mga kaibigan . Mga ' di kakilala -- na sa kalaunan , naging kaibigan na rin . ( We observed that every time there was a party , more and more people came . Friends and strangers alike , who later on became friends . ) <p> Kim : I would like to see it as a diverse haven for everyone . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an audience . It did not matter what part of the gender spectrum you are . It just embraced you for ( being ) who you are . <p> To me TxF unfolded before my eyes as an LGBTQ+ haven as it openly embraced everyone to its doors sans judgment giving everyone a piece and taste of who they were regardless of your taste in music , or your ideologies . <p> Julianna : I will credit the founders of TxF for it being a safe space for all , including the LGBTQ+ . <p> It has always been open to all music genres and all humans which made it a haven for us because being queer , all you want is to belong . We felt like we belonged in TxF . <p> Karlo : Well , I ca n't speak for an entire community , but I think being in a crowded space , seeing people you know , or at least relate to , is usually fun . And having somewhere to do that regularly made it special , I guess . <p> Xtina : Speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of clubs would n't let me in because I am a trans woman . ( See : dress code policy ) . <p> TxF was one of the few establishments thats would welcome me with such warmth , regardless of my gender , or the clothes that I choose to wear . <p> It felt like home to me . That 's when I noticed it becoming a safe space not just for me but also for the other LGBTQ+ individuals who felt invalidated by society because of their gender/expression . <p> Melvin : I 'd like to think na the LGBTQ+ crowd loved going there kasi walang ( there was no ) discrimination . We look after each customer . We make sure they get a proper ride home , or something . <p> Jer : It 's this little discreet bar tucked between unassuming buildings that looks so dormant in the morning , but lights up so bright at night . The size of Future is not that huge , so everything feels so intimate and there 's a certain safety that comes with it being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where people from all walks of life gather together and you can strike up a conversation with anyone and go home learning something new . <p> On top of that , I feel like Future is a space where you can freely express yourself without any homophobic judgement from others . <p> Photo courtesy of Jer Dee <p> Julianna : Being part of the LGBTQ+ or just being different in general always has a feeling of displacement and discomfort with your identity or an element of being conscious about your difference from others . <p> And that because TxF welcomed everyone , there was naturally a space for us in it . It 's like how they always said it , TxF is not a gay bar but it 's a place where everyone is welcome . <p> Kim : Egos were shed as you entered , from the doors to the dancefloor , TxF gave an extra later of comfort and safety to the LGBTQ+ crowd -- something that is essential when you are in a place you call a haven . It 's like a table that housed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone just purely connected . <p> Jujiin : Build a house . Light a disco ball . Play music . Welcome everyone . The LGBTQIA+ crowd will find you and love you and cherish you . That 's what TxF had done . <p> It did n't need to act cool . It did n't need to trumpet its support for the LGBTQIA+ at the start because it was n't really the idea during its inception . It was authentic . <p> It was simply seeing every person and it was enough . It gave us a real sense of belonging ; that anyone could feel safe being themselves . <p> Christine : For some , the refuge extended into becoming a lifeline . Future drew out the best in people , whether sharing the love for music and the arts , learning to spin , dancing their hearts out , building friendships , finding that special someone . It was a belonging . <p> The Future will always go on . <p> Party monsters <p> LGBTQ+ subculture flourished at Today x Future . Ever a hospitable environment for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the club hosted regular parties thrown by its queer pioneers . Some of these branched out and even went on to become institutions in their own right . <p> Xtina : Panty Monsters is a collective of creative individuals which included Jujiin and I. <p> Jujiin : It started when Lotho Lotho ( fashion stylist extraordinaire , now based in Dubai ) came up with an idea to form a group of fashion misfits for parties . Our answer ( or more like a f*ck you ) to exclusive fancy clubs with strict dress codes was to wear " panty " . The name " monster " was added as a wordplay from Michael Alig 's Party Monster ( a group of club kids ) <p> Every Panty Monsters night was a sardinas party . The queer population suddenly had a home ! Na na-extend hanggang Poison Wednesdays na laging puno sa linggu-linggong ginawa ng diyos . ( It branched out to Poison Wednesdays , which has always been jampacked every week that the Lord has made ) . Thanks to Lotho and Future . <p> Xtina : It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with overflowing personalities . It 's like a circus of amusing individuals having the best time of their lives on the dance floor . <p> So many unforgettable moments , but the one that struck my mind was when we played at Malate for their Pride party . We were all dressed in flamboyant outfits ( I was wearing a tanga so I was basically half naked , lol ) , and then I remember the party ending at 6 AM , so we had to walk far to get to the main road just to get a ride . <p> We ended up standing beside the gutter of the road , until the sun hit us like a spotlight . Everyone who was just about to start their day was staring at us , probably thinking , " Why are they dressed like that ? " <p> To me that moment was memorable because it felt liberating knowing that we did n't really care what people think about us . It was such a glamorous moment . <p> Photo courtesy of Karl Leuterio <p> Melvin : Two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I was up for it . This was the time na I was almost there every night . My mother thought I was working for a beerhouse kasi I called it Beerhouse Disco with pole-dancing Kate Moss and Devon Aoki on the poster designed by my other friend Nimu Muallam . <p> My parties -- well , we called them events -- were like Prom parties . I never had a Prom kasi . After Beerhouse Disco , I called it Disco Prommm . I eventually got tired of calling it Disco hence , Dancechalant and effortLAST . Those last two names were my favorites . Feeling ko ang genius ko.Haha . In my opinion , ang ganda ng mga posters . <p> All my parties naman walang nilangaw ( went ignored ) . Thank God ! Beerhouse Disco was on a Friday , so they thought of putting me on a Saturday . I think it was a big deal kasi the owners believed na kaya mong punuin yung venue ( that you could fill up the venue ) . My usual customers were mostly college kids to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sweldo ( pay ) . <p> Julianna : Bad Girls was about pushing my Ariana Grande agenda , to be honest . Hahaha . Just kidding . For me , it 's about loving pop music , enjoying it with people who love it too and not caring if some people think it 's low brow . ( It 's all about enjoying music you like , and you love pop music . ) <p> The first ever Bad Girls party was back in 2014 . Karla , Judd Figuerres , Mikee Rayos , and I were part of the original ensemble . We started it by asking Austin Casta ? eda if we could host an event just because we wanted to celebrate the iconic American Horror Story : Coven season . As in that was it . We really just loved it and thankfully Austin gave us a Wednesday . <p> We stopped for a bit , and then there was the new incarnation with just me and Karla which started in 2017 ( Thank you so much Sam , Leah , Sharon and Austin for giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think what made Bad Girls stand out was that we were doing thematic nights like Coven , Carnival and Mean Girls . TxF also did n't have a dedicated pop night , which Bad Girls provided And Bad Girls being one of TxF 's well-attended and quite high earning events adds to it being a stand out . We 're really proud of that . Teehee . <p> Photo courtesy of Joseph Pascual <p> Jer : Bad Girls is a pop music-focused Saturday event held by Julianna Force and Karla Ynzon . It 's usually at this night where you can hear the gay bops : Ariana Grande , Lady Gaga , Carly Rae Jepsen , Whitney Houston -- you name ' em . <p> What I love about Bad Girls is it 's unapologetically pop . Feel-good , diva diva &amp; birit pop without judgement . You can literally play High School Musical songs , and the crowd will go nuts -- I love that . I have n't seen that anywhere else . <p> Julianna : As 1/2 of Bad Girls my role was basically the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the machine that dealt with everything else behind the scenes . As hosts , we would choose the DJs ( and that just basically boils down to if we like you ) , make the poster ( who in the years of Bad Girls , a lot have contributed like Keb Toralde , Mikee Rayos , Jox Gonzales and for the very recent ones , Jer Dee ) , and come up with the event names which is the hardest thing and its mostly just random things in my head . ( One of faves is Seashells Seashells by the Future . Super nonsense , but I was laughing at that so hard ) <p> JULIANNA FORCE . Photo courtesy of Joseph Pascual <p> Jer : I usually do the posters for these events especially the latter ones , from 2017 onwards . It started with Julianna asking me to do their Halloween poster in 2016 . I loved it , and she loved it as well . From then on , I regularly made their posters up until the end . <p> I made sure to make the posters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in line with the lo-fi aesthetic of their posters . It was kind of a creative outlet for me as well because these are the types of work that I 've dreamt of doing as an illustrator and I 'm so glad that they 've given me the opportunity to contribute to them . <p> On top of that , I get to spin/do DJ sets as well . My timeslot is usually at 11:30 PM to 1 AM , which is usually the time where people arrive . I actually love playing at this time because I get to play deep cuts from various pop stars instead of the " Break Free 's , " the " Run Away with Me 's , " and all that . <p> Photo courtesy of Joseph Pascual <p> Karlo : I started as a promoter at Future quite late . I started DJing at Future back when it was still new . But doing parties at Future , I think I started in 2015 . <p> I posted something on Facebook saying I wanted to do an all-Italo disco night , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did one at Future . I called it Sadomasodisco . ( I did two of those nights in the same month -- one at Future , one at Mao Den . But the first was at Future . ) <p> It was kind of a last minute thing . One night , Samantha sent me a message saying they had a free night . She asked me if I had an idea for a party , and if I wanted to take the date . I said yes because I already had this idea for a party anyway . <p> At that time , I wanted somewhere I can play and listen to 80s electro , new beat , a mix of new wave , cold wave , a bit of industrial , and slow , minimal , organic techno -- I really did n't want to use the word techno , but yes , something in that direction . I did n't think anyone was doing something like that here . <p> She gave me June 3 , and when she asked me it was already almost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just be a one-time thing , but it ended up being monthly ( well , not at first , after a few months ) . <p> Kim : We were lucky that me and Mersi , one of my closest and one half of The Koolaids ( our DJ duo ) , were asked by Leah to create something new for Future . We started with RATCHET ! a more pop-oriented foray ( that began its mid-week parties and eventually got bumped to a weekend ) . <p> However , me and Mersi also grew out of that , and really found our love for house and disco , thus The Rhythm Agency was born . The Rhythm Agency was our nod to early 90s Chicago House but we trickled to disco or nu disco , and sometimes a bit of techno , but its core was really for the kids to get to know what house music was all about . <p> Karlo : The music at Blitz , I think , is different from the other events at Future . It 's not as commercial as the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights . As for the regulars , I just ask my friends to come , and thank god some of them come . <p> At first , I just wanted Blitz to have a " sound . " I usually get the same people to play , and then add others to the rotation especially when I see someone whose sound I like . Of course , the sound has evolved from the first one , but there 's still a bit of that in there somewhere . <p> I just tell the DJs/musicians to play whatever they want . I do n't really like dictating . I trust their taste anyway . And I sure hope they like that . <p> The sound of the future <p> Music programming at Future was as diverse as its crowd . The club held fast to the queer roots of dance music , as well as the special place that pop anthems hold among members of the community . <p> Xtina : I think music played a big part in establishing TxF as an LGBTQ+ haven . It 's what brought everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since day one TxF gave DJs like me the freedom to play whatever music we want and I will be forever grateful to Leah , Sharon , Austin and Sam for that . <p> Melvin : Future was all about inclusivity more than anything else ! <p> Kim : The TxF sound really has evolved but did not really divert from its core . It changed because it had to give way by a level or two to new eras . From a late Tuesday night discussion I had with other hosts , it could be a generation thing . It 's adapt or die . <p> And this is where the themed nights played its role . From Ruthless that housed experimental and noise , to Up North that catered to hip-hop . <p> It would n't be TxF if you do n't play the good classics from Robin S , Crystal Waters , Moloko , Armand Van Helden ( just to name a few staples ) . TxF was always a time capsule bringing you every classic imaginable . It 's a neon ballroom of sorts fusing together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the classics , that 's non-debatable . <p> Photo courtesy of Karla Ynzon <p> Jer : I think it 's the fact that queer people are more receptive towards pop music and the fact that the management has nights dedicated to wildly different genres I think played a huge part on it being a safe space for queer people . <p> At a 1AM set -- arguably primetime hour on Future where the dancefloor is packed , you could play a song by Robyn then switch it up to a Sarah Geronimo song then you 'll have the gays shrieking . <p> I really could n't see this happening anywhere else . The gays live for pop music , and I love how Future gives us the opportunity to bop to that . <p> Karlo : Variety is always good and keeps things from getting boring , and can you really accuse the LGBTQ+ community of being boring ? <p> Christine : Music at TxF for me was the best . Since way back , one would hear playlists not usually heard anywhere else . <p> I loved it when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and making them feel . I am glad there is a place that broke barriers for them . Some nights when they sway and sing their sad but hopeful hearts to Robyn or Carly Rae , I see how music heals and remind them everything 's going to be all right . <p> " l am human and I need to be loved / Just like everybody else does , " sings The Smiths . We need music to get by . Thank you , TxF .

@@72160230 <h> Revitalizing these four areas will help developing Asia cope with the new normal <p> TO DATE , more than 700,000 people around the world have died from the coronavirus disease 2019 ( COVID-19 ) . The pandemic has brought despair to countless families and caused unprecedented economic damage . The response has been significant : governments halted global travel , imposed nationwide lockdowns , quarantined large swaths of the population , and scaled up medical care services . Governments have also funded the development and production of testing technology , in addition to the ongoing search for a vaccine . <p> Yet , it is widely accepted that even when a vaccine is ready and effective , the virus is likely to persist given challenges associated with universal vaccination . The highly contagious nature of the virus means that where there are resurgences in cases , areas that have reopened will need to reimpose restrictions . This is the pattern that we are seeing playing out in several countries including Kazakhstan , the People 's Republic of China , and , most recently the Philippines , where more than 27 million people in Manila and surrounding provinces returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must learn to live with the virus . In this uncertain " new normal , " the prospects for rapid economic recovery are limited . A return to business-as-usual looks unlikely , too , and may not fully restore the economy . Focusing on high-impact segments of the economy is therefore an efficient approach to reaching a new normal . <p> Revitalizing four key areas can help developing Asia cope with the new normal and find a path to economic recovery . <p> First , revitalize the health sector . Due to the lack of long overdue investment , there is a significant gap not only in hospital infrastructure , but also at the primary care level including human resources necessary to staff effective health systems . In response to the pandemic , developing Asia has made record investments in strengthening the health sector . For example , the Indian government in April sanctioned approximately $1.9 billion to address the immediate gaps in strengthening the COVID-19 response by scaling up delivery of services . This was followed by the recent announcement of a major program to comprehensively strengthen the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uzbekistan , and Kazakhstan have adopted similar approaches in their pandemic response plans . There is also a sizable gap in health-related sectors such as pharmaceuticals and health insurance . Current levels of investment are insufficient to achieve Universal Health Coverage ( UHC ) , however , countries have committed to achieving UHC by 2030 . ? The health sector has huge growth potential . <p> Second , revitalize the social protection sector which remains fragile and underfunded in developing Asia . In response to COVID-19 , great efforts have been made to ensure that affected populations are covered by social safety nets . For example , in the Philippines the government introduced an emergency subsidy program to provide monthly cash payments to 18 million low-income families for two months . In India the government announced a scheme to provide free food to 800 million people until November 2020 , as well as direct cash transfers and free cooking gas to women , the old , and socially disadvantaged groups . The Pakistani government has allocated $1.2 billion for emergency cash transfer payments to 16.9 million poor households including daily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to develop , including establishing disaggregated databases , registration and monitoring systems , and strong budget support . The development of the social security sector will help promote economic inclusion and sustainable growth . <p> Third , revitalize digital technology . The pandemic is transforming people 's behavior and social norms . Working from home has completely changed people 's mindset . Web-based collaboration and sharing platforms have been widely recognized for their effectiveness in facilitating remote collaboration and co-working , while webinars are successfully replacing physical seminars . More importantly , digital technology has been widely and effectively used to promote trade and tourism , support small and medium-sized enterprises , and boost microfinance . It is being used increasingly in government , procurement , and education . Strategically developing digital technology will have a huge impact on the quality of growth . <p> Fourth , revitalize the global supply chain . During the great lockdown , the global supply chain virtually came to a standstill , resulting in incalculable job losses and economic damage around the world . For example , Bangladesh 's exports of apparel products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while international contracting projects in Pakistan , Nepal , Uzbekistan , and Georgia were largely suspended due to the interruption of raw materials supply . The pandemic has highlighted the need for urgent reform of the global supply chain . We must pursue high-level multimodal transport , more effective trade facilitation , and stronger trade and supply chain financing mechanisms . In addition , further enhancing the international network of global supply chains will help to ensure that goods continue to flow in the face of disruptions . The global supply chain is the main artery of the world economy and its smooth flow is the basis of economic recovery . <p> Developing Asia has experienced many crises and disasters and has always bounced back . Following the Asian financial crisis , which severely hit the banking sector , the region adopted painful but necessary regulatory reforms of its systemically important financial institutions . These reforms introduced vital resilience into the Asian banking system , enabling it to survive the Global Financial Crisis a decade later .

Specifically , it is calling for an alternative program that " fits the current situation of Filipinos and is relevant amidst the pandemic ; gives students who could n't enroll a chance to learn when they are financially ready ; primarily considers the safety of teachers , students , and parents ; does not burden them of strict requirements , evaluation , and grading system ; and that which helps the youth face and overcome the challenges brought about by the pandemic . " <p> While it is urgent to call for an alternative education program , it is equally urgent to seize this chance to call for and work on the overhaul of our education system which is currently patterned after the demands of the global market . <p> Schools are run like factories to produce professionals who will then maintain exploitative systems .

More online learning software will surely appear soon , posing as necessities . Meanwhile , stories of precarity keep on surfacing as we approach the supposed opening of classes .

Palatino ( 2020 ) articulates it best in Pedagogy of the Digitally Oppressed : " This has harmful consequences to students who might wrongly assume that their life stories have to garner social media boosting as a prerequisite for acceptance in society . Or they could disown their local cultures , habits , and ideologies because they diverge from the popular norm . They might reject their framing of the world because it does not adhere to existing categories or it is deemed archaic for digital sharing .

While educators , curriculum developers , and legislators are preparing and lobbying for an alternative education program , students can start unlearning things instilled by the current education system designed just to export labor and serve capitalistic interests . Not worrying about lessons , tasks , and grades , students can focus on reconnecting to society , processing the discourse of their immediate reality -- the pandemic 's urgent threat to health and the current regime 's threat to sovereignty -- from which the walls of the school have already alienated them .

@@72195234 <p> TAMPA , Fla. -- At the end of Wednesday 's training camp practice , Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady found a leaping Scotty Miller -- a virtual unknown to most of the NFL last season -- in the back of the end zone on a post route for a touchdown . Miller raced over to Brady to celebrate . <p> " Good job , Scooter , " Brady said as the two high-fived before offensive coordinator Byron Leftwich joined in . On the first pass play of their first day in pads this week , Miller was on the receiving end of a jaw-dropping play-action deep pass -- one of the many " dimes " coach Bruce Arians alluded to Brady hitting each day . <p> Miller looks like a totally different player this year . He was n't active for the first two games last season before finishing with 13 catches for 200 receiving yards . Now he 's making some of the biggest plays of camp and building his case for the third receiver spot . Much of that goes back to No. 12 and the confidence he 's infusing in teammates . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Miller , one of several players who joined Brady at Berkeley Prep in Tampa for throwing sessions this summer . " We were working out , trying to get on the same page because we did n't have the chance to do OTAs and stuff like that . " <p> Just one week into training camp , it appears that Brady is putting the Bucs ' offense -- particularly its strong cast of receivers -- in a good spot , even as the 43-year-old signal-caller transitions to his first new system in 20 years . <h> Ball placement and YAC <p> They 're still taking shots down the field in Arians ' " no risk it , no biscuit " offense , but those shots seem more selective and are sprinkled into a more dynamic screen and intermediate passing game , one that has evolved to favor what Brady does best : methodically dink and dunk and exploit matchups . <p> " We 're going to have to work as hard as we can and not waste any minutes of any day trying to get used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to embrace the challenge and see it as an opportunity to see what we can become . " <p> " If everyone 's covered , Tom 's going to find an area to throw the ball to where you can go up and make the play , " Rob Gronkowski said . Cliff Welch/Icon Sportswire <p> His receivers are adjusting well so far . Brady 's ball placement has looked consistent , which should result in more yards after the catch . <p> " He really does a good job of putting the ball in a spot where you have the opportunity to make plays and run after the catch , " tight end O.J. Howard said . " It allows the defender not to make a play on it . " <p> On one play , wide receiver Mike Evans -- known as a long strider and not necessarily for his work in the short passing game -- caught a quick pass underneath on the outside .

He always knows where all the zones are , where all the openings are gon na be within the defense . So if you can be on the same page with him , you 'll find ways to get open and get the ball . " <p> Brady can open a new dimension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5.60 yards after the catch with Brady from 2001 to 2019 -- second in the league in that span . That was n't just because of shorter passes , on which it is easier to accumulate yards after the catch , as the Patriots ' 11.66 yards per reception were eighth in the NFL . The Bucs averaged 4.52 yards after the catch per reception the past five seasons -- second-worst in the NFL . <h> Quick decisions and spreading the ball <p> Another area in which Brady impacts the Bucs ' passing game is the speed with which he gets rid of the ball . Early in camp , Brady attempted to hit running back LeSean McCoy with a jump pass , but McCoy could n't get his head around quickly enough because the ball came out so quickly . Evans also was n't ready on a throw . <p> Arians believes this has less to do with mechanics and more to do with decision-making . The past five seasons , Brady averaged 2.31 seconds in the pocket per play , versus Winston 's 2.43 seconds , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the depth of a quarterback 's drops , though ; a five-step drop will mean getting the ball out much more quickly than a seven-step drop . <p> " Tom might process it a little bit quicker , so the ball comes out fast , " Arians said . " We 've got to get our head around , and the guys know when they put their foot in the ground , the ball 's probably going to be there , so get your head around faster . " <p> Brady brings more than just confidence and fundamentals to the Bucs ' receiving corps . He 's spreading the ball around to guys other than Pro Bowlers Evans and Chris Godwin . They accumulated nearly 57% of the Bucs ' receiving touchdowns and more than 54% of their receiving yardage in 2019 before both suffered injuries that ended their seasons . <p> Last season against New Orleans -- one of the teams to beat in the NFC South -- the Saints ' defense eliminated both Godwin and Evans , and the Bucs did n't have many answers beyond getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' defense did that in Wednesday 's practice . <p> " A couple times they went double-double -- doubled Mike and Chris -- and we have to find the other guys , " Arians said . " Tom 's really good at finding that . " <h> Brady vs . Winston : Target shares , 2015-19 <p> A look at how Tom Brady compares to Jameis Winston on distribution of targets among their top five receivers the past five seasons . <p> Brady 's top 5 <p> Targets <p> Winston 's top 5 <p> Targets <p> Julian Edelman <p> 17.6% <p> Mike Evans <p> 25.1% <p> James White <p> 14.7% <p> Adam Humphries <p> 10.5% <p> Rob Gronkowski <p> 12.1% <p> Cameron Brate <p> 10.5% <p> Danny Amendola <p> 6.8% <p> Chris Godwin <p> 8.8% <p> Chris Hogan <p> 5.6% <p> Charles Sims <p> 5.3% <p> Brady believes there 's no such thing as " dead routes , " which is n't the case with every offense . With Brady , even receivers who are covered can be targeted . <p> " Never give up on your route , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Gronkowski , who won three Super Bowls with Brady . " If everyone 's covered , Tom 's going to find an area to throw the ball to where you can go up and make the play and not have the defender make a play . So always be ready for the ball in any place where you can make a catch . " <h> The details that are important to Brady <p> Brady has a track record of coaching his receivers on everything from where they should be in their routes against different coverages -- routes vary between man and zone defenses -- to how to anticipate his throws . He also likes to read body language . He needs indicators of when receivers are going to make their breaks so he can get his timing down . <p> " When it comes to routes , he 's very detailed in how he wants us to run certain routes to protect the throw , " Evans said . " If we 're running an out breaking route , the DB can cut it . So you have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He just harps on it more than others . " <p> " When it comes to routes , Brady is very detailed in how he wants us to run certain routes to protect the throw , " Mike Evans said . Cliff Welch/Icon Sportswire <p> " One of the big things he harps on is just keep your arms pumping as a receiver so the defensive back never knows if you 're gon na shut it down or take it over the top , " Miller said . " I would say just little things like that . " <p> Brady has provided a heavy amount of input to the coaching staff , something wide receivers coach Kevin Garver said he has been receptive to , as most players already view Brady as essentially another coach on the field . That 's part of the collaboration that made coming to Tampa appealing to Brady . <p> " Tom has been around a long time , seen a lot of defenses , a lot of different receivers , played with some great receivers , " Garver said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to routes . Some of those things we collaborate on , whether it 's him and Byron Leftwich and then Byron passing the message on to me , or Tom and I having conversations about where he sees things and where he wants receivers to be . " <h> Deception and play-action <p> Then there 's the way Brady manipulates defenses with his eyes . Winston sometimes telegraphed his throws by fixing his eyes on his target , whereas Brady is savvier at looking off safeties , which can get defenders out of position and give receivers more space . <p> The same applies to the way he sells his play-action and pump-fakes . Brady 's 5,320 passing yards on play-action passes over the past five seasons are second in the NFL behind that of Matt Ryan , showing that Brady can get chunk plays when he gets receivers one-on-one . <p> " It 's just hard for a deep safety to try to read him because he 's just so locked in , trying to use different things to get a safety off leverage , " second-year safety Mike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play-actions -- it 's hard to find out where the ball is . He 's real good at it . He places the ball where it needs to be , where only the receiver can get it . " <p> Although Brady brings many attributes that should enhance the Bucs ' offense -- even in the twilight of his career -- the Bucs ' receiving corps will undoubtedly bolster his performance as he vies for a seventh Super Bowl ring . One of the issues he experienced with the Patriots last season was that he did n't have enough weapons . When teams took away James White and Julian Edelman last season , the Patriots ' passing game was grounded . Plus , Brady 's 16 dropped pass attempts to wide receivers last season were the most in the NFL . The past three seasons , he has had 40 drops , tied with Derek Carr for second in the NFL and just behind Philip Rivers , with 41 . <p> Brady has n't had a receiver with Evans ' catch radius since Randy Moss . He has never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Godwin , who competes for the ball and seldom drops a pass . Watson continues to make plays over the middle in traffic . In Miller , Brady has elite downfield speed . Plus , he has arguably one of the league 's most talented trios of tight ends in Gronkowski , Howard and Brate . <p> " It 's a good , hard-working group , " Brady said of his targets . " Really smart players , and it 's going to be up to all of us to come together and to see how we can make it all work . "

@@72203238 <p> ( CNN ) -- Walmart is partnering with Microsoft in an attempt to buy TikTok , as the popular yet embattled short-form video app seeks a US buyer amid intense political scrutiny . <p> The retail giant told CNN Business Thursday it is participating in the negotiations with Microsoft over a potential deal . CNBC was first to report the effort by the two companies . <p> Walmart said its interest in TikTok stems from the way the app has " integrated e-commerce and advertising capabilities in other markets " and could bolster its access to consumers . <p> " We believe a potential relationship with TikTok US in partnership with Microsoft could add this key functionality and provide Walmart with an important way for us to reach and serve omnichannel customers as well as grow our third-party marketplace and advertising businesses , " Walmart said in a statement . " We are confident that a Walmart and Microsoft partnership would meet both the expectations of US TikTok users while satisfying the concerns of US government regulators , " <p> The announcement comes hours after TikTok CEO Kevin Mayer quit his job as the the video-sharing app faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese company , Bytedance . <p> " In recent weeks , as the political environment has sharply changed , I have done significant reflection on what the corporate structural changes will require , and what it means for the global role I signed up for , " Mayer said in a memo to employees that was obtained by CNN Business . " It is with a heavy heart that I wanted to let you all know that I have decided to leave the company . " <p> In his letter , Mayer said to expect " a resolution very soon " -- a phrase indicating that a deal could be reached within the next week , according to a person familiar with the talks . <p> TikTok hired Mayer , a former top Disney executive , less than four months ago to run the app , which is the first owned by a Chinese company to gain significant traction in western countries . In addition to his CEO responsibilities , Mayer became chief operating officer of ByteDance , TikTok 's parent company . <p> Since then , though , TikTok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump has threatened to ban the app if it is n't sold by ByteDance . <p> " We appreciate that the political dynamics of the last few months have significantly changed what the scope of Kevin 's role would be going forward , and fully respect his decision , " a TikTok spokesperson said in a statement . <p> In his own memo to employees , ByteDance founder Zhang Yiming said he understood " that the political circumstances we are operating within could have significant impact on Mayer 's job in any scenario . " <p> Zhang said Mayer spoke to him before quitting and that he wished Mayer well . <p> " I want all of you to know that I really appreciate the endless hours that you have worked , shutting out the noise around us to focus instead on our mission and what we are building for those who rely upon our platform , " Zhang wrote . " The entire team is doing an incredible job , competing effectively against some of the biggest technology companies in the world to win the hearts and minds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience . " <p> Even before Trump issued executive orders calling for TikTok 's ban , the company was rethinking its corporate structure . The Wall Street Journal reported in early July that ByteDance was considering establishing a headquarters for the video app outside of China or a new management board to distance the service from the country . A TikTok spokesperson told CNN Business at the time that it was " evaluating changes . " <p> Mayer 's departure is a " huge setback for the company , " said Edith Yeung , who spent years investing in Chinese companies with venture capital firm 500 Startups . She is a partner with Race Capital , investing mostly in US firms . <p> " A leader can not jump ship in the most critical time for a company , " she added . <p> According to Trump 's executive orders , TikTok poses a national security threat because the app collects a lot of data on users , which " threatens to allow the Chinese Communist Party access to Americans ' personal and proprietary information . " <p> The move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has already ensnared other Chinese apps and tech firms , such as Tencent-owned WeChat and Huawei . <p> TikTok has sued the Trump administration over the initial executive order , calling it " heavily politicized . " The company said Trump 's order illegally rests on emergency powers law in ways that do not apply to TikTok . The company has also said that it stores data on its US users in the United States and in Singapore , and that it would refuse any request by the Chinese government for US user data . <p> TikTok has 100 million users in the United States . The company has explored selling its US business , which industry experts say is worth between $40 billion and $50 billion , to Microsoft and reportedly to Oracle as well . <p> Microsoft said it is exploring a deal to buy TikTok 's operations in Canada , Australia and New Zealand , as well as the US business . <p> " The role that I signed up for -- including running TikTok globally - -- will look very different as a result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off of the US business , " Mayer said in the memo to employees . " I 've always been globally focused in my work , and leading a global team that includes TikTok US was a big draw for me . " <p> ByteDance launched the Chinese version of TikTok , called Douyin , in 2016 . The international version debuted the following year and has grown to become one of the most popular social media apps in the world . As of July , TikTok said it had nearly 690 million global monthly active users . <p> That still trails Facebook 's 2.7 billion monthly active users , but the app is also considerably younger than its US rival . By August 2020 , TikTok said it had surpassed two billion global downloads . <p> Vanessa Pappas , the former YouTube executive who joined TikTok last year to become general manager of North America , Australia and New Zealand , will serve as interim head for TikTok globally , according to Mayer 's memo . <p> Pappas tweeted Thursday that she was " proud and humbled " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing what we 've accomplished in 2 years , I have no doubt what we can accomplish in this next chapter ! " she said . <p> If Mayer had stuck it out , " he would be running one of the biggest social media companies in the world , " Yeung said , though she added that " no American would blame him for quitting . " <p> " I wish he would hang in there , " she said . " He could change the course of China-US tech history . Oh well . "

@@72215237 <h> Signs And Wonders <p> A group called The Mayor Rodrigo Roa Duterte National Executive Coordinating Committee ( MMRI-NECC ) has called for the establishment of " a revolutionary government . " <p> This is a roguish exercise in military adventurism . It is devoid of sound rationale . It is also ironically self-contradictory . The President has currently distanced himself from the absurd proposal . <p> This is a good move as experts and constitutionalists have critiqued the alternative set-up as illegal and violative of the constitutional framework under which the President himself was elected . We hope he remains opposed to the idea . <p> National Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana immediately declared the proposal unconstitutional and called for investigation of its proponents . In the same vein , Armed Forces of the Philippines ( AFP ) Chief of Staff Gen Gilbert Gapay assured the public through the AFP spokesman , Major Gen Edgard Arevalo , that the AFP " will uphold ( its ) sacred obligation and rejects the establishment of a revolutionary government . " <p> Senator Joel Villanueva urged the government to criminally charge the proponents ascommitting an act of inciting to sedition pursuant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected the idea , saying a revolutionary government would turn the country into " a rudderless ship launched without a compass nor an agreed destination . " <p> Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque was suspiciously more tolerant , dismissing it by saying that the organizers " are free to publicly express their opinion . " In fact , while the Integrated Bar of the Philippines dismissed the call for a revolutionary government as another exercise of freedom of expression , it was also emphatic in clarifying that it should be denounced and discouraged from progressing into actions that violate existing laws . <p> The advice for caution has a basis . <p> We must remain vigilant . <p> We agree with Justice Antonio Carpio in describing Roque 's weak reaction as " intriguing . " Roque stated that the call for a revolutionary government " does not enjoy any support from the government right now . " Justice Carpio suggested that this implies " there may be government support in the future . " <p> Justice Carpio also called out Chief Presidential Legal Counsel Salvador Panelo 's explanation that " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not from a single organization or an individual . " This means that " if there are more groups supporting the call , Mr. Duterte may consider it . " <p> This is dangerous . A glaring red flag that must not be ignored . <p> Bayan Muna Rep. Carlos Zarate calls the proposal out as " just another ploy in the arsenal of schemes of the pro-Duterte camp to perpetuate themselves in power . " <p> On the same issue , Vice-President Leni Robredo was both firm and conciliatory . She denounced the exercise while urging the National Government not to tolerate the distraction . She reminded that priority must be given to the fight against COVID-19 and to ushering in economic revival . <p> As if COVID-19 was not enough to paralyze the economy , it is extremely frustrating that there are those who wish to add obstacles to our already challenged recovery . They are adding fuel to the fire that continues to ravage lives and business . <p> From an economic perspective , the call to junk the Constitution adds serious harm . Advocacy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We recall that in the 1970s , martial law dampened investment and business and depended on foreign borrowings to produce growth . Dollar salting was rampant and remained so until the late 1980s . Until this recent pandemic-driven recession , average economic growth was lowest during the Cory years which were punctuated by political uncertainty following the seven coup attempts . <p> It would be useful for public policy makers to remember that when assessing the business potential of , say , emerging markets , investors normally consult the World Governance Index which employs several indicators . Rule of law is one of them . <p> The metric shows that in the last seven years through 2018 , the Philippines has exhibited a constant downtrend starting 2016 . In 2018 , our latest index for rule of law was just a little over a third of Singapore 's rating , 34.13 versus 97.12 . Membership in the Philippine Economic Society is not necessary for anyone to know that this index could drop like a rock should the movement for a revolutionary government take root in the Philippines . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A country that does not respect the law and the Constitution plays good host to corruption . This is not rocket science . In its latest corruption ranking for 2019 , Trading Economics rated us at 34 out of 100 . This puts the Philippines at 113th among 180 countries . Among the ASEAN 6 , the Philippines ranked lowest at 113th . Singapore ranked at 4th ; Malaysia , 51st ; Indonesia , 85th ; Vietnam , 96th ; and Thailand at 101st . <p> This is our current ranking under a constitutional democracy . Imagine how we would fare under a revolutionary government ? <p> We also remind policy makers that when assessing a sovereign 's credit worthiness , Credit Rating Agencies ( CRAs ) look at the quality of governance and politics . The scoring employed by CRAs such as Fitch Ratings , Moody 's and S&amp;P cuts across more than 150 countries . Their sole purpose is to assess if a jurisdiction or corporate entity can afford to pay back its creditors . <p> Politics and governance are key determinants considered critical by these CRAs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigns a weight of 19.6% . Political risk is also assessed . Moody 's focuses on institutional framework and political risk as part of susceptibility to event risk . S&amp;P assigns 25% importance to institutional and governance effectiveness . Predictability of policy making , political institutions and civil society are primary considerations . <p> Investors rely heavily on these credit assessments before they embark on doing business . Investors enthusiastically subscribe to periodic updates on key economies including emerging markets . <p> Even a whiff of establishing a revolutionary government will make us unattractive to capital investment . Multinationals and venture capitalists will not risk sinking in millions of dollars in unstable soft states . More so during this world-wide pandemic . God-forbid that we return to a junk credit rating ! This would make it impossible for us to grow beyond current potential capacity because it would then be necessary to borrow one 's way to higher and more sustainable economic growth . In these pandemic times , tight debt spreads and credit default swaps are game changers . <p> Finally , we stress that in its annual surveillance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fund is also mindful of politics and governance when making its macroeconomic assessment . This is even more true in the context of increased global uncertainty . As the Fund confirms , " uncertainty reduces the willingness of firms to hire and invest , and of consumers to spend . " <p> This is also the position of the World Bank : " If a country does not need to worry about conflicts and radical changes of regimes , the people can concentrate on working , saving and investing . " <p> Based on its new quarterly measure of uncertainty , the World Uncertainty Index ( WUI ) , the Fund found some interesting insights about uncertainty and politics . Uncertainty is high in low-income economies because , among others , they suffer from " more domestic political shocks like coups , revolutions , and wars . " The Fund also found that an inverted U-shaped relationship between uncertainty and democracy exists . A revolutionary government will certainly move the pendulum closer to uncertainty and economic whammy . This would result in " significant output declines . " The " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions . " <p> We reiterate that our focus today should remain on controlling the pandemic and working for economic recovery . Even children know that these are the real problems we must now address . <p> Those who champion the formation of a revolutionary government should go out of their tunnel to see that they might be unwittingly advancing a perverse revolution in economic fortune . It might be what Marx referred to in 1843 that while reason has always existed , it does not always come in reasonable form . <p> Diwa C.

Photo by JOSEPH PASCUAL <p> Manila ( CNN Philippines Life ) -- On June 18 , Today x Future announced on Instagram that they would be closing their doors permanently . The Cubao branch had been operating for nearly twelve years . Beloved by musicians and the queer community alike , TxF was considered a second home to its loyal patronage , well-known for its welcoming atmosphere and its promise , always , of a good time . <p> The enhanced community quarantine has put the nightlife industry on a tentative hold , leaving owners to scramble for a means to get by . In its earlier weeks , a campaign was mounted to #SaveOurFuture by forwarding donations and making advance purchases . Now , with the news of Today x Future 's closure , it was difficult for many to witness the end of an era from behind their screens . With no proper send-off party , people were quick to share images of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hashtag #KwentongTxF was used on Twitter to recount the glorious , the hazy , and the ( more often than not ) embarrassing times spent along Cubao Expo ( its first location ) and General Malvar . It was clear that over the last decade , many found their own voices and their own kin in Today x Future . <p> One of the remarkable things about the space is how it became home to many creatives from different generations -- starting from the founders themselves . Many of the country 's best fashion designers , artists , photographers , DJs , and musicians call Today x Future home . Here , they recount how the space is more than just a bar but a nerve center of creativity and collaboration . <p> Leah Castaneda ( co-founder ) : I 've been living in Cubao for more than 40 years and have been frequenting Cubao X ever since . When I Love You Store finally moved there , I would just walk there to visit Mimi one of Sharon 's business partners back then , whom I 've been friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designing clothes for Milkwear . They asked me if I 'd like to put up a cafe on the first floor ' cause they needed someone to half the rent with and collaborate with . I just said " yes ok , " not knowing anything about running a cafe though I know I am very good at hosting parties . <p> Soon , I had to decide the name . Since we 've been calling it future ( meaning our future spot during construction ) , I just said , let 's just call it Future since we 're already used to it . We merged and named it I LOVE YOU x FUTURE , which eventually evolved to Today x Future when ILY closed . <p> My brother , Chie , helped us a lot especially with the music direction and film showings we would have every week . We used to go to raves together and even had a Thrift Thursdays night in ABG 's where he would DJ and my friends and I would sell our stuff . Let 's just say we 're greatly influenced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother , Austin , to join the team and manage the bar . <p> Yes , it was exactly how we imagined : a place for music , arts , and literature . We just never imagined or expected the impact that we 've shared with the community . <p> Sharon Atillo ( co-founder ) : What we did not imagine though was that , as fun as it was making and working on TxF , it was also as hard making everything work . <p> Samantha Samonte ( DJ and part-owner ) : It was natural guidance that I received because it was a nursery for us misfits who are trying to find ourselves . It highlighted my love for music and arts , and taught me how to gain my own footing . Also being mentored by Leah all these years meant learning so much , from throwing clever events and talking to clients to making the most of littlest resources . <p> Sharon Atillo : Everything I did was for TxF -- and it 's still my way of life . Working in an office doing 9-to-5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 24/7 . <p> TxF became a place that we made because it was possible to make it . Somehow it felt like it was served by fate that we build this place ' cause we did n't fit in anywhere else . I guess that 's why so many have been affected by its closing because they also grew up with us . They look at pictures of themselves when we were still at Cubao X and say , " OMG I was still in college then ... I was so poor then ... I was so thin then ... " To quote one of our regulars : " We were all broke but we were happy . " <h> Sharon Atillo . Photo by JOSEPH PASCUAL <h> Leah Casta ? eda ( center ) . Photo by JOSEPH PASCUAL <p> Leah Casta ? eda : It was n't just a party ; it was an education of all sorts . It gave me a sense of fulfillment because we were able to contribute to the culture and provide a space for everyone . I agree with Shar ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we learned so much from our community too . We all grew up together and built each other up . <p> Perhaps the best asset of TxF was the music . People would always remember their favorite tunes , even long after their hangovers . Even international musicians , from Ladytron to Kings of Convenience , have played DJ sets in Future . <p> Diego Mapa ( musician ) : I first suggested to Leah their first CDJ kit : it was a Gemini mixer with 2 CDJs ... the most affordable at that time in the market . It 's not very good actually ; it did not last very long because of everyday abuse , but it kick started TxF to be a dance club . <p> I was able to DJ there so many times , it is there that I learned how to read crowds when DJ-ing . Learned all sorts of music from the other DJs . Also learned how to host a party , whether putting up my own DJ show or even hosting a party at home . <p> That 's what Leah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people , how to connect with guests . They also have good taste in clothes , music , and all sorts of pop culture . But the music being played there , especially in the earlier years , greatly influenced my taste in music . <p> Gian Romano ( fashion designer ) : Some of my best sets were played there . Sets that , at the end of the night , I wish I could remember the track sequence . <p> Petra Magno ( writer ) : My friend Carina Santos and I ran a music blog called " Warmest Corner , " and maybe that 's how we ended up behind the DJ booth one night in 2012 , armed with an iTunes playlist that we put together . I do n't remember exactly how or why we were blessed with that , but that was the first time I felt the thrill of watching people dance to music that we had intentionally chosen and arranged . That was also the night I discovered that dancing to Robyn , in a dark room with a disco ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( DJ ) : When I first played as a DJ , it was just a random request from Austin to make me come out more . I did n't think it was going to go anywhere after that , to be honest . But here I am now ! <p> Karlo Vicente ( DJ ) : I remember years ago , no one was really doing disco , and we were already doing regular disco nights at Future . They gave me a space to do my program , Blitz , which I did n't really plan , as it was sort of a last-minute thing . I thought it was just a one-time thing , but it became a monthly party . It 's now in its fourth year . With my parties , I know these do n't really make a ton of money , but Future gave me a space to do it . <p> Kim FG ( DJ ) : I was fresh-off-the-boat from Iloilo , wide-eyed and wanted to take it all in , freedom away from my parents , the excitement of falling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Kylie Minogue concert in Araneta and sat beside Mersi Carballo 's older brother and sister , singing out loud to songs . After the concert , they invited me to hang with them at Future , so I went and it was love at first sight . The people , the music , the euphoria of it all was a lot to take in . It was where I knew I wanted to be . <p> Mersi Carballo ( photographer ) : It was a whole different world to me , but the patrons and owners were so warm and open and made me feel at home right away . It definitely made a huge impact on my music taste . I discovered indie music there and learned how to spin . <h> Kiko Escora . Photo by JOSEPH PASCUAL <h> TxF 's Chie Casta ? eda with Diego Mapa . Photo by JOSEPH PASCUAL <p> Michael Benedicto ( musician ) : The Future kids are big fans of indie pop , hosting regular shows around that type of music in its early days . Our band Outerhope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got invited to play in productions like Strict Rules of Polite Society and Strangeometry . From there , Future became a staple in our lives both in and out of performances . <p> Diego Mapa : My favorite was when The Diegos opened for Reuben Wu 's DJ set ( Ladytron ) . Erlend Oye and Jens Lenkman visited TxF ( the latter did an impromptu DJ set ) , The Whitest Boy Alive crew also did an impromptu DJ set once , The Pains Of Being Pure At Heart also partied in TxF . Lastly , the legendary DJ , Keb Darge performed there , and they had a problem with the DJ mixer which , ahem , I had to go home , I think , to supply mine . Good times ! <p> It was n't uncommon to pivot back and forth between creative fields through Today x Future . It held the intersection between different subcultures and demographics , making it very easy to try new things . <p> Mike Lavarez ( DJ and fashion designer ) : I was one of the " Season 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the designers of I Love You Store . Later on , our family grew and it became a haven for upcoming designers , artists , musicians , etc . It started making noise in the music , fashion and art industries because we hosted avant-garde fashion shows exhibits . It was where the Panty Monsters started ! <p> Ziggy Savella ( fashion designer ) : As a baby gay fashion designer then it was such an amazing place to be . You get to meet all the designers you would read about in magazines , be able to talk to the people you usually just stalk on Live Journal . We all share the fashion , music , and the space like we are all equal . <p> Sean Bautista ( DJ and designer ) : They embody an aggressive punk and DIY attitude that 's not devoid of its love for community and each stakeholder in its ecosystem . Its circular and inclusive approach has taught me that every voice in your community matters . <p> Kiko Escora ( DJ and artist ) : By default , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young ones , and/or the under exposed .

It created a safe space where there was no prejudice and pretension . It was an amazing community , a second family . <p> Pau Tiu ( graphic artist ) : I think having our studio ( Bad Student ) right next to the place has been such a cool experience for us . We would always mention TxF whenever someone asks us where our studio is located and people would instantly recognize the place . It 's a nice icebreaker when meeting new people/artists . <p> Elyoo Dela Cruz ( illustrator ) : Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do and as a ( then ) young creative . I think this has helped me to be more at ease with myself and I felt free to experiment and find my own voice/style . <p> Julianna Force ( DJ ) : I do n't think you can ever be at Future and not grow as a person , because all the people there are brutally honest , but they always come from a good place . <p> Jer Dee ( illustrator ) : In 2017 , Julianna Force -- one of the hosts of Bad Girls -- asked me to make an event poster . Her only brief was to make it fun . At the time , I was still struggling trying to find my aesthetic as an illustrator . When I finished that first poster , something clicked -- I really loved it . I felt that I finally figured out what I wanted to create moving forward . Bad Girls became my avenue for creating artworks I would n't be able to create anywhere else : loud and queer . <p> Isola Tong ( artist and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eccentric taste , and very few people in Manila could relate , but I found a place where I could listen and play and share my obscure musical interests . I think the place provided me a space to express and gain confidence creatively and provided chance meetings with creative people who helped me eventually with my career and self-discovery . <p> James Grr ( DJ and photographer ) : TxF gave me the opportunity to play around with my photography covering certain parties and was even able to participate in a group exhibit . I made flyers for some of the nights I threw and this is where I played my first ever DJ set . I 've learned so much about photography and DJ-ing just by hanging out with my friends on quiet weeknights . All these skills are basically the ones I 've been using to make a living . Without TxF , I 'm not really sure what I 'd be doing right now . <h> The TXF disco ball . Photo by JOSEPH PASCUAL <p> Juan Miguel Severo ( poet and writer ) : In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People are politically engaged , and unapologetically queer and involved in the struggle of the LGBTQIA+ community . We need people like that to keep us grounded and not lose sight of what matters . There is a movement happening amid the struggle , and being at TxF never failed to remind me that I should participate in it . <p> A Today x Future regular would n't be without a number of war stories and oddities under their belt . It 's a trademark of the brand . When asked about a favorite TxF moment , " too many to count " is often the usual response , or perhaps , the decent one . <p> Janine Gutierrez ( actress ) : Last time I was there was the " Babae at Baril " and QCinema afterparty and it was perfect because TxF always felt like a haven for celebrations . People spilling out into the street , talking to everyone you bump into , not knowing who you 'll see but feeling like everyone came there together . It felt like a community , a collective that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world for all your wild ideas . <p> Petersen Vargas ( filmmaker ) : I shot a portion of BP Valenzuela 's " Steady " music video in Future . The ending scenes to the pilot episode of my queer series " Hanging Out " was written with TxF specifically in mind . Future , in retrospect , has always given me a clear vision of how it must be to feel like a queer boy finally taking claim on his own body and heart . <p> Raya Martin ( filmmaker ) : I have so many core memories at Future but some surreal ones include hanging out with visiting artists like Antoine d'Agata on a Cubao crawl , or dancing with Christopher Doyle on a slow weekday because he wanted a break from shooting a film . <p> Dex Fernandez ( artist ) : I threw a GaraParty in TxF back in 2016 . That 's when I painted the garapata mural outside and so I ' garapatized ' the interior as well with thousands of neon and glow in the dark stickers . <p> I was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden a friend passed out in my face . One of my friends told me about him falling on the floor and my reaction was " Just ignore him , give him a break " and we continued dancing . I lost sight of him . Another friend dragged me outside to check on him . He got hydrated and ventilated and brought back to normal . I asked him how he was , and he replied , " Walangya ka , munting na akong mamatay ! " <p> Neal Corpus ( editor , stylist ) : There are funny memories ranging from sitting on the street in a circle to badly flirting with boys to drunkenly fighting over a fresh pack of cigarettes only to end up spilling it on the floor , but my favorite memory one has got to be hearing Robyn 's " Dancing On My Own " for the first time and seeing everyone rush in after just hearing the first few notes . <p> BJ Pascual ( photographer ) : I had a long and very stressful shoot around Eastwood , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that night . It was a bit early and no one was there . Mike behind the DJ booth , me on the dancefloor , just us two . He played one of our favorite songs , " Lost on the Way Home " by Chromeo and Solange , but with the tempo heavily slowed down . It 's my first memory of Mike was at Future back in Cubao Expo , more than 10 years before we even got together , and I already had a crush on him back then . Fast forward to a decade and we 're together alone in ( almost ) the same bar . <h> " I do n't think you can ever be at Future and not grow as a person , because all the people there are brutally honest , but they always come from a good place .

Stayed the whole night until closing time . We did this every Monday and even started calling Monday nights " Chickenlambing Nights . " I know it 's not the most eventful memory , but it 's one that 's I 'll always be fond of . <p> Diego Mapa : I forgot what party it was , but it was late , everybody was happy with their own groups of company , scattered around the bar , chatting , some dancing away . The music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think Sharon , one of the owners , attempted to leave . So , when she drove by , she had to open her window to say goodbye . She was n't escaping , she was casually leaving . When she said goodbye , in a second , a hoard of friends opened all the doors , occupied the car , people on the roof dancing , people sat on the hood , sat on the back hood . The party , transferred to the car as if it 's an extension of the bar . Obviously , she stayed longer . <p> Pau Tiu : My best friend and I were hanging out in Katipunan and we got bored . We went on Reddit to find people who were game to hang out and one guy replied and said that he was just around the area . Turns out , this guy was a magician ? He showed us some card tricks ( think David Blaine-ish ) and a cool mobile app he was developing . The place we were drinking at was about to close so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're there I did n't realize that I was wearing slippers and the bouncer told us he could n't let us in . So this guy told us to wait and ran to his apartment that 's " 15 minutes away " from TxF . We waited for 30 minutes and thought that the guy ditched us so we decided to just call it a night and go home . As we were about to leave , we saw him running with a pair of shoes in his hand . This dude came through ! When the night ended he told me that I can keep the shoes as a remembrance . <p> Celeste Lapida ( filmmaker ) : There was a night when Nadine Lustre came , and everyone repeatedly asked each other " Nandyan si Nadine ?

I use these travel opportunities to study the best practices of communities , cities and even companies abroad . This helps me in putting together bills or legislations and implementing projects for my advocacies , " said Villar . These educational tours with local government officials is not financed by government but by Senator Villar 's private money . <p> Farm Tourism Development ( France , Taiwan &amp; Thailand/2015 &amp; 2016 ) <p> For instance in 2015 , while in the process of drafting a bill to encourage agricultural tourism in the country , Senator Villar visited not only farm tourism sites in various parts of the Philippines , but she also made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as in Taiwan , Thailand and France . Villar 's first visit in France in July 2015 was upon the invitation of an association of farm schools there . The senator was surprised to know that there are thousands of farm schools in the First World country . <p> Rungis International Food Market -- France <p> Villar is the primary author and sponsor of Republic Act No. 10816 or the Farm Tourism Development Act of 2016 that is widely praised and credited for boosting agriculture-related tourism in the country . The said law paved the way for an increasing number of farmers , farm owners and farming communities to enjoy the benefits of converting their farms into farm tourism sites . They have multiplied their earning sources -- from their crops , from the tourists ' who visit their farm and buy products as well as from the tuition fees of the trainees in their farm schools . <p> " In the last four years , since the law was passed , there has been a huge increase in farm tourism destinations all over the country .

Many of whom have credited the senator for the turnaround in the agriculture sector in their city or province . For instance , Albay Governor Al Francis Bichara profusely thanked Villar when the province recently won TESDA 's National Kabalikat Award . The governor said in 2017 , Villar brought him along with other government officials to tour the best and most modern and state-of-the-art agricultural farm technologies in Israel . He said the trip inspired him " to innovate and adapt , to think global yet local . " He said Albay Farmers ' Bounty Village Farm Schools and Assessment Center was patterned after Israeli ingenuity but Filipino designed . Located in Camalig , Albay , it helps improve the lives of the Albayano food producers through entrepreneurship and farm enterprise capacity-building . <p> Agri Hydroponics Technology ( Israel , 2017 ) <p> Villar considers the said trip to Israel as one of the most insightful and memorable too since it made them realize that ingenuity and innovation coupled with technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Israel is mostly desert , they lack water . They have desalination plants in order to have potable water . They do n't have agricultural land . And yet agriculture is thriving , in fact , they export vegetables . It 's about technology . They grow plants using aquaponics or hydroponicsand use desalinated water . Since desalinated water is expensive they use water by droplets , the water controlled by a computer " . Villar has an urban aquaponics project in a poor community in Las Pinas . <p> Agri Hydroponics / Dairy -- Israel <p> Cacao ( France , 2017/Indonesia , 2018 ) <p> In 2017 , Villar was part of a Philippine delegation to France , where she visited the headquarters and factory of French chocolate manufacturer Valrhona in Tainl'Hermitage ( 600 kms from Paris ) . At the end of the visit , Villar invited the Valrhona officials to visit the Philippines and to source cacao from the country . Valrhona sources cacao from eighteen countries and the Philippines can be one of them . <p> Valrhona Chocolates Factory -- France <p> She also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in July 2018 . Villar really believes that the country has what it takes be at the forefront in cacao . The Philippines started cacao farming in Asia , it was here where first cacao in the region was planted in 1670 and the country already has commercial production as early as the 1950s . She included cacao planting as intercrop to coconut in the Coconut Farmers and Industry Trust Fund Act ( Senate Bill No. 1052 ) to be financed by the coco levy fund <p> Cacao Buying Center of Cargill -- Indonesia <p> " We have to work harder because we can not even meet our local consumption requirement of 50,000 metric tons . Local supply is only about 12,000 metric tons . Why do we still import cacao and cacao products to serve the local demand ? When in fact we are in the best position to fill the supply gap in the world cacao market , because we are a coconut producing country and cacao is intercropping to coconut " cited Villar . According to the roadmap of the Philippine Cacao Industry Council , the goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both for export and domestic market . Villar also learned about the sector in her Indonesia trip in Jakarta and Sulawesi . She saw a very good working model there when she visited a cacao farm owned by a smallholder farmer being trained by a European NGO . " We also visited the office of American company Cargill in village , where they have a buying station for cacao . Beside the buying station is a Bri bank ( Bank Rakyat Indonesia ) representative where farmers deposit the proceeds of sales and they borrow from Bri bank . Bribank ( Bank Rakyat Indonesia ) is the biggest bank in Indonesia , government owned and their portfolio is 80% for small , medium &amp; micro enterprise and yet most profitable . <p> According to Villar , a mere 10 percent share in the world supply can provide a profitable income to the country 's cacao producers . The global demand for cacao products is expected to have reached between 4.7 million to 5 million MT by this year . Meanwhile , the cacao global shortage is predicted at one million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2017 <p> Villar also visited the Ferme de la Bourdaisi ? re , a permaculture micro-farm in Montigny-sur-Loire , located on a 1.4-hectare plot behind the Chateau de la Bourdaisi ? re . The farm uses sustainable farming practices . It does not use pesticides or chemical and synthetic fertilizers , has a zero-waste policy , and low energy consumption . Villar said such type of farm could be adapted to the Philippines with farmers having small plots of land and little capital . She now incorporates the said sustainable principles in Villar SIPAG farms and farm schools in Las Pinas , Bulacan , Iloilo and Davao City . It will also solve our problem of 38% degraded Philippine soil and the solution is we compost organic wastes and bring them back to the soil according to UN FAO . <p> Ferme de la Bourdaisi ? re -- France <p> The senator also visited a 100-hectare wheat farm outside of Paris that left an impression on her because of how it was run by its owner .

He runs the farm and takes care of his parents there , too , " recalled Villar , who has been encouraging the Filipino youth to make a career in agriculture since Filipino farmers are already growing old , with age averaging over 57 years old . <p> Dairy ( India 2018/Israel 2017/Thailand 2016 ) <p> In India , Villar and her entourage studied the dairy sector since it is the biggest dairy producers in the world . Dairy centers and farms there are mostly run by smallholder farmers and cooperatives . The senator urged the Department of Agriculture through the Philippine Carabao Center and the National Dairy Authority to increase milk production which up to now is at a dismal level of less than one percent of demand.They have two processing plants one owned by the government being supplied by farmers and one owned by dairy cooperative earning billions of dollar . <p> Dairy Farm -- India <p> In Thailand , the senator was able to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a 400-hectare farm that has many areas -- souvenir stores and restaurants in front a processing area where they make various milk-based products such as milk , popsicles , ice cream etc. ; then there 's the farm area where the cows are kept and cared for and then there 's a grass plantation area for the cows ' feeds . It is a one-stop site , fully functional and sustainable . Something that our very own Philippine Carabao Center can be , " said Villar . <p> Israel where each cow produces 40 liters of milk everyday because of better quality of cows and better quality of cows food . <p> " So much to learn out there " <p> " There is really still so much to learn out there , from other places and people . We can adopt the best practices of others and recalibrate them for our own requirements or circumstances . That is a winning strategy of many successful leaders and businesses , so we can do the same in developing our country 's agriculture . We have all the natural resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our people 's needs and aspirations , " says Villar . <p> Some of the other best practices and programs that Villar and the other local government officials that travel with her have studied and learned from their trips are as follows : <p> Farmers ' Market : In Japan , they learned about a good model for the so-called farmers ' market where the owner provides the building and the farmers provide all the goods for selling . The owner just gets a percentage of the sale and gives the rest to the farmers ; <p> Conference -- Japan <p> Hybrid Rice : In Hunan , China , they show the research station -- Hunan Hybrid Rice Research Center of Hybrid Rice with Hybrid Rice Expert , Prof Yuan Longping.Yuan Longping ( Chinese : ? ? ? ; born September 7 , 1930 ) is a Chinese agronomist , known for developing the first hybrid rice varieties in the 1970s.Hybrid rice has since been grown in dozens of countries in Africa , America , and Asia -- providing a robust food source in areas with a high risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Father of Hybrid Rice " by the Chinese media . <p> Hybrid Rice -- China <p> Bamboo : In China , they studied about all things bamboo and how they produce so many items , products and materials out of them . They have 20,000 hectares bamboo shoots plantation with bamboo processing beside it . They have state-of-the-art bamboo processing factories . It inspired Villar to put a bamboo processing factory in Las Pinas to help spur the bamboo industry 's growth . Villar also filed Senate Bill 716 or the Bamboo Industry Act to institutionalize the Philippine Bamboo Industry Development Program and strengthen the government 's efforts in encouraging bamboo plantation , research on its development and utilization . Bamboo , she cites , is a good cash crop for Filipino farmers and source of livelihood in poor communities . <p> Bamboo Plantation in China <p> Wetland Protection : In Hong Kong and China back in 2016 , they visited the Hong Kong Wetland Park &amp; Museum , and China/Xixi Wetland Park , Hangzhou , China among others . It served as an inspiration and basis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Las PinasParanaque Wetland , located off Manila Bay , which Villar saved from being reclaimed . <p> Wetland Parks in Hongkong and China <p> Green School : In another trip to Indonesia in 2017 , they learned about environmental sustainability in a so-called Green School in Bali . The Senator , in her capacity as the chairperson of the Senate Committee for Environment and Natural Resources , toured the school for benchmarking on how to instil a deeper sense of environmental stewardship among Filipinos and on practices pertaining to the proper conservation of natural resources and waste management . <p> Green School in Bali Indonesia <p> Food Fair : In Germany , Villar attended the Anuga Food Fair in Cologne where she noticed that coco sugar and coco water were the most popular products in the expo , but from other countries and not from the Philippines . Thus , she continues to support the coconut industry through various programs and legislation , so they can produce and market products from coconuts . <p> AnugaFair -- Cologne , Germany <p> Food Security : Villar also attended the World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ th Plenary Session of the Committee on Food Security of the United Nations ' Food and Agriculture Organization or FAO in Rome where she presented the status of the agriculture and food security in the Philippines . <p> UN FAO Rome , Italy <p> Plastic Recycling : In Mexico , in December 2019 , Villartoured Coca Cola 's PETSTAR Recycling Plant Facility in Toluca , Estado de Mexico to study the best practices and benefits of operating a successful bottle-to-bottle recycling system as a viable and strategic solution to address the plastic waste problems . <p> Coca Cola Plastic Recycling in Mexico <p> Villar 's committee is working on amendments to the Solid Waste Management Act of 2010 to institutionalize the practice of Extended Producers Responsibility or EPR , especially in industries that generate plastic wastes . She also established the Villar SIPAG Waste Plastics Factory in Las Pinas for Luzon , San Miguel , Iloilo for Visayas and Cagayan de Oro City for Mindanao , which turn waste plastics into chairs that are donated to public schools and farms schools all over the country .

The brand introduces the Ref. 7234G-001 Calatrava Pilot Travel Time , inspired by the brand 's aviator 's watches from the 1930s . It 's also a slight update from 2015 's Ref. 5524G . <p> The updated version has two time zones ( in white or rose gold and with two case sizes ) as well as the Alarm Travel Time , a grand complication with a 24-hour alarm , not counting several limited editions .

This may be attributed to the late registration of deaths , as recorded by the Philippine Statistics Authority in the first half , and discussed and analyzed in detail in an earlier article . <p> ABS-CBN Data Analytics <p> But there is also a worrying trend developing over the last few days . On October 11 , the DOH announced 83 deaths , the fourth straight day of more than 80 fatalities reported . Some are indeed deaths from previous months , but a substantial portion of the reported deaths are coming from October . <p> As a result , the number of COVID-19 fatalities in the Philippines is growing faster than the number of cases confirmed , raising the case fatality rate of the Philippines to its highest level since August 4 . <p> ABS-CBN Data Analytics <p> Looking at case fatality by region in the Philippines , we find the National Capital Region 's ( NCR ) rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because NCR has the most confirmed cases at 173,917 , and the most number of deaths at 3,046 .

As of October 10 , only 1 region in the Philippines had an intensive care unit ( ICU ) bed occupancy over the danger zone threshold of 70% , CARAGA .

That is bad news for the most vulnerable , senior citizens . The data show Filipinos aged 50 years and above have a higher chance of dying from COVID-19 than the national average . <p> ABS-CBN Data Analytics <p> The high incidence of COVID-19 in young adults and adults , coupled with the high vulnerability of seniors , has resulted in more than 80% of the reported COVID-19 deaths coming from the ages 50 and above .

It is heartbreaking to think of how many elderly loved ones have passed on because of this pandemic without receiving the appropriate care . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it can easily do so again between now and December . Authorities were already warned of the alarming number of deaths involving patients who never received hospital care .

Yet the number of such cases doubled as well . <p> Flattening the curve by preventing the younger population from spreading the disease using measures such as face masks , face shields , and physical distancing is key . There is evidence of this already working considering the slowing in daily reported cases . This is a great development , especially for the vulnerable elderly .

@@72345235 <p> On October 12 to 18 , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and the World Bank ( WB ) gathered the world 's finance officials and central bankers in their annual Joint Conference , held online for the first time . The main agenda : how to address the world 's health and economic crises through new loans , new financing mechanisms and new programs to ease the debt servicing burden of borrowing countries . <p> But outside the IMF-WB Conference , another and bigger gathering was taking place . Through a Global Week of Action for Debt Cancellation ( GWADC ) , trade unions , farmer organizations , Church groups , civil society movements and other organized sectors of society around the world held daily protest actions , online and on the streets , against the failure of the twin international finance institutions ( IFIs ) , G-20 governments and big private banks to address the debt crisis of the developing countries and the survival needs of humanity in Covid times . Over 550 civil society and people 's organizations from 93 countries participated in the week of protest action ( October 10 to 17 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call for the cancellation of unjust and usurious debts , the use of resources freed from debt to cover the vital health and life needs of the people , and the establishment of a new people-centered global financial architecture under the UN system . <p> The GWADC was organized by the Asia-Pacific Movement on Debt and Development , Action Aid , Oxfam International , Jubileo Sur Americas , African Forum on Debt and Development , European Network on Debt and Development , Fight Inequality Alliance , and numerous national organizations representing millions from all regions of the world : Latin America , Africa , Europe , North America , Middle East and Asia-Pacific . The daily protest actions were capped on October 14 by a global concert-rally , held online for half a day , featuring singers , poets and testimonies of people from all walks of life against unjust debt . The GWADC was a demonstration of people 's unity and solidarity against the failure of the international creditors led by the twin IFI sisters to find decisive solutions to the multi-sided crises facing humanity due to the twin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the IMF-WB Joint Conference , officials were claiming that they were hard at work finding such solutions . The information bureaus of the twin sisters were busy releasing daily communication bulletins on the various " development initiatives " that the IMF and World Bank have lined up to ease the debt burden of developing countries , bolster their efforts to contain the Covid spread and manage the health-economic crises affecting their respective populations . <p> The IFI leaders also tried to project the image that they were listening to the CSOs ' pleas for debt justice . In fact , WB 's President Davil Malpass , in his remarks to the Development Committee of the Annual Conference , sounded like a radical activist . He said " we must consider debt stock reduction , " meaning the World Bank is pushing for measures that go beyond the cosmetic " debt relief " program . He declared : " Otherwise , there 's no light at the end of the debt tunnel for the people in the debtor countries . " He also cited the need for changes in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inequities and stop the " net transfer of resources . " <p> Aha , " net transfer of resources " ! What does this mean ? <p> The World Bank failed to elaborate what the transfer mean . However , net transfer of resources is indeed at the heart of the inequity in the present debt and financial architecture . By borrowing and accumulating debts , developing countries end up transferring more capital resources to the creditor governments and the big global banks . The equation easily becomes negative for the borrowers because of the requirement of the creditors for the continuous servicing of principal and interest for debts that keep swelling or piling up due to debt rollovers , growing debt servicing burden , debt restructuring programs and the failure of the borrowing countries to meet growth targets under tough austerity program and questionable policy conditionalities imposed by the creditors . <p> The last , questionable policy conditionalities , include the neo-liberal structural adjustment policies which paralyze a debtor country 's capacity to shape its own economic program based on its existing level of development and development priorities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underdeveloped borrower country to adopt a one-sided unilateral trade liberalization program can lead to an unequal trade arrangement pattern : exportation by the said borrowing country of cheap unprocessed raw materials and the importation of expensive finished products . This , in fact , is at the roots of the present debt crisis facing a number of African countries , whose earnings from commodity exports have been dwindling under the Covid pandemic . <p> The unjust debt situation is further compounded by what the GWADC organizers dubbed as the " illegitimate " character of a large portion of the debts incurred by developing countries . The " illegitimate " debts are those " lent irresponsibly and unfairly , driven by predatory lending , used to finance harmful projects and policies , failing to comply with legal and democratic requirements , saddled with onerous and unjust terms , incurred by private corporations but assumed by governments or incurred through public guarantees of private profits , wasted or stolen . " <p> To complete the debt picture , some of the global creditors who are hiding behind the protective mantle provided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or private equity firms . They can withdraw from a market in a herd-like fashion after profit-taking from speculative investments ( stocks , currencies , land prices , futures markets ) , triggering in the process a capital outflow that can bring down economies of borrowing countries to their knees in a matter of weeks or months such as what happened during the 1997-1998 Asian financial crisis . <p> The Philippine debt history from the 1980s to 2010s is a classic illustration of the dynamics of the net resource transfer . The country spent through the decades over $100 billion servicing the original $26 billion bequeathed by the Marcos Administration ; yet , it still ended up with a bigger stock of debt that keeps growing up to the present . The decades of the 1980s to 2010s became " lost decades " for the nation in terms of growth because of a major stumbling block to development : the government 's subservience to the austerity program of the twin sisters , the one-sided trade and investment structural adjustment programs ( which wiped out large segments of domestic manufacturing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " arrangement ( a Marcos-era law requiring government to automatically allocate funds for debt service , no matter how big is the share of the debt service in the national budget ) . The Philippines was also forced to pay for debts used to finance odious and unproductive projects such as the Bataan nuclear power plant , whose cost was originally priced at $500 million but ballooned to over $2 billion without generating a single watt of power . And yes , the Philippine economic landscape is littered with debt cases in support of questionable and expensive infra projects . <p> Now the big question : was the recently-concluded IMF-WB Annual Conference able to address the inequities in the global debt architecture cited by WB President Malpass ? <p> Unfortunately , the results of the Conference , as summarized in the Communique of the Development Committee of the said Conference , indicate a big NO . The pro-people rhetorics of the leaders of the twin sisters do not match the debt programs that they are lining up on the ground . The overwhelming focus was on how to increase or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to ameliorate the debt burden of borrowing countries by extending the Debt Service Suspension Initiative up to the middle of next year . The DSSI , a project involving the G-20 countries , does not reduce the debt stock of developing countries .

" The award was institutionalized through Republic Act No. 7355 ( Manlilikha ng Bayan Act ) . <p> The awards follow the UNESCO 2003 Convention for the Safeguarding of Intangible Cultural Heritage , which proposes five broad domains in which intangible cultural heritage is manifested ( this according to a presentation during an online press conference on Oct. 26 ) : Oral traditions and expressions , including language ; performing arts ; social practices , rituals and festive events ; knowledge and practices concerning nature and the universe ; and traditional craftsmanship . <p> Dr. Felipe de Leon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it down to maritime transport , weaving , carving , performing arts , literature , graphic and plastic arts , ornament , textiles or fiber art , and pottery . <p> However , he also introduced a new category : ethnomedicine , or traditional healing .

As young adults on the quest of discovering who we are and who we are meant to be , the role of nation building has been firmly placed in our hands . Mentors from generations before have done their part in shaping the nation and are grooming us , the Filipino youth , to be the next change agents . <p> In our short stay here , we have witnessed the tragic effects of our nation 's most lamentable social ills : the orchestrated misuse of government funds , the systemic violation of basic human rights , and the continuous loss of life and property due to abandonment and greed . <p> Through all of these , it has become more and more apparent that our nation needs more Filipinos than citizens . <p> It is easy to imbibe " Filipino Pride " in our moments of triumph -- with every win of Manny Pacquiao , every article on the Philippines as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every tourist video espousing the natural beauty of our motherland . <p> But being Filipino is much more than a celebration of our collective successes ; it is also an inheritance of the not-so-beautiful aspects of this country : its culture of impunity , widespread poverty , and institutional corruption , among others . <p> As indigenous peoples ' rights advocate Lourie Victor says , " Being Filipino means accepting the beauty and the madness of this nation . " But more than just accepting its flaws , we are challenged to be the change we want to see in this nation , because we are indeed the future . <p> ' We are the future ' <p> We are the future of this nation because , in the most literal sense , we will one day become the generation that leads this country .

While there was the accusation she was an adulterer and so was hounded for her immoral act , there was also a version that says the murder was the community 's way to get back at Celine . She was supposed to have squealed to police about an incident that involved the beating up of two men who happened to provide shelter to a white woman who ran away from an abusive husband -- a husband with an influential position in a cultish Filipino fraternity . <p> When the men Celine reported to authorities were brought to prison , it could only have intensified the community 's resentment toward her . She was accused of adultery by members of the fraternity 's affiliate group called Maria Clara Lodge No. 15 . She denied the accusation , but was still ordered to " do penance while kneeling on beans , " according to a 1997 article in Filipinas Magazine written by Alex Fabros . Fabros , one of the interviewees in the documentary , a former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lodges were a powerful force .

They " made her crawl on beans , then picked stones out of a bag to decide who would start throwing them at her , " Shimizu wrote in a story for the women 's studies journal Frontiers . But Celine was able to escape . <p> " She fled to her sisters in Ventura , who reportedly gave her money to bring her husband back to the Philippines , " says the article on Recordnet.com .

" Perhaps Navarro cried out that she would report the incident to the police . Or maybe she was knocked unconscious . Whatever the case , someone panicked . She had to be gotten rid off . " So in the very early morning of November 20 , Celine was brought to Jersey Island where she would meet her end . It was the last time anyone saw her alive . <h> The confession <p> The following year , 1933 , a Pablo Bustamante confessed a crime to authorities at the San Joaquin County Sheriff 's Office .

They were commanded to dig up a hole . <p> " Once the hole was dug , the woman reportedly dragged a screaming Navarro from the car and pushed her down next to the hole , " said a quote from Codog in the Recordnet.com story . " Navarro struggled against her bonds and was heard screaming as the women kicked dirt into the grave and the men filled in the hole . Then there was silence .

More than a thousand Filipinos protested the stigmatization being created by the stories , according to Fabros , condemning how American media had misrepresented their race as a people into bizarre sacrifices and barbaric rituals . <p> Suspects in the murder were arrested but eventually acquitted . And up to this day , Celine never got the justice she rightfully deserved . Her story just became a tale people pass around . " Celine 's own story , whether adulteress , traitor , heroine , or prey shows she was an actional woman throughout her life . She moved here , lived a life with various versions of bravery and endurance , and finally saved her children before her death , " writes the filmmaker Shimizu on her subject .

But is that enough ? <p> If we may recall , the LTFRB 7 issued a suspension order against the entire fleet of EDC Liner when one of its mini buses figured in a fatal vehicular accident a few years ago in front of the South General Hospital in the City of Naga , which resulted in the death of 16 passengers . <p> Last year , the LTFRB suspended the entire fleet of Elavil Tours Phils. after one of its buses was involved in a road accident in Quezon Province which resulted in deaths .

" It was a different type of joy to be able to work in a space that , even if it was small , was just mine , " she says . " My workflow improved immensely , and I just went with it .

That 's roughly a 6-7% annual reduction in carbon emissions till 2050 . Just for perspective , this year travel and transport reductions and the economic slowdown from COVID-19 is expected to reduce carbon emissions by 7-8% .

Our economics 101 classes taught us the rainbow-shaped Simon Kuznets curve ( done in the 1930s ) which infers that inequality rises but eventually falls as the economy grows . There was even an environmental version of that curve by economists Grossman and Kreuger in the 1990s which promised the same relationship with environmental degradation and that eventually , pollution all got cleaned up as countries got richer .

But it goes beyond energy and anticipates dealing with the many adaptive challenges needed to redesign how we live , work , and do business in a changed world . <p> Secondly , we did n't feel it was appropriate anymore to use the word " sustainable " in a world that 's so badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the challenge of using the word " regenerative " instead , with all the responsibility it carries . We are not a full-on regenerative company today ; no one is yet . But we chose it deliberately to signal to our people that they have a license to adopt this new mindset as our inherent way of doing business and that it 's OK for them to " bring their values to work " every day . Being regenerative does n't scale if it only comes from the top ; it has to permeate the organization and how it does business day to day . <p> And thirdly , the word we used very deliberately was " collaborative " as we believe we can not do this alone . We ( that includes our PR and CSR professionals ) all have to stop seeing this as a competitive beauty contest . I keep stressing to our people that if we find ourselves ahead and alone at the finish line , we will have failed in our mission . This is a massive undertaking and we know we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honestly , these thoughts make me feel small and humbled . Because everything we 've been doing so far just feels like a tiny first step on a dangerous thousand mile journey . We 're all imperfect beings , with imperfect abilities , in an imperfect , maybe broken world , but it should never mean losing the courage to make things better . As the songwriter and poet Leonard Cohen wrote : <p> Ring the bells that still can ring , Forget your perfect offering <p> There is a crack in everything , That 's how the light gets in <p> -- " Anthem " <p> Let me close my remarks by saying that paradigm shifts of this scale and magnitude can never be easy , especially in the stage before there 's any momentum . But I take comfort in the transformation of a common caterpillar into something so functionally different and radically beautiful as a butterfly . Every caterpillar harbors dormant imaginal cells ; each waiting with the potential to transform into something else . As cells morph , the immune system of the caterpillar attacks them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the transformation persists and the number of imaginal cells multiply beyond a critical tipping point , the body stops fighting them , changes over and begins the process of nourishing those same cells instead . An unformed , embryonic wing may start out with just 50 cells but grow to as much as 50,000 when fully formed . The anguished and labored metamorphosis of a butterfly that can take to the sky in flight , only begins the moment it 's willing to give up being a caterpillar . <p> Once again let me thank the Management Association of the Philippines for honoring our journey with this award . It 's finally made sense of the times when we felt like the faint voice in the wilderness and our view of the world may not have been mainstream . Thankfully , the winds are changing profoundly now . But no matter where each of us are in this continuum of belief today , I feel with a mix of certainty and hope that we will all be helping each other along this same road very soon . We look forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we can . <p> Federico " Piki " R. Lopez is the Chair and CEO of First Philippine Holdings Corporation

@@72527230 <h> Cervantes : Medjugorje seer : ' After death , life continues ' <p> IT 'S not all frightening prophecies from Catholic mystics of our times . For example , through Austrian mystic Maria Simma , we learn from souls from Purgatory much about what happens after this earthly life , in the same manner that we enrich our knowledge of the afterlife from a nun 's experience with a departed soul as found in the Unpublished Manuscript on Purgatory . <p> One of my favorites is the account of Medjugorje visionary Ivanka Ivankovic-Elez whose mother had died two months previous to her first apparition of the Blessed Mother in 1981 . She asked where her mother was and the Blessed Mother replied , " She is with me . " This , expectedly , was followed by Ivanka 's request to see her mother . Then her mother appeared , approached and embraced her while saying " I am proud of you . " <p> It was n't the first meeting between daughter and departed mother , The two met at least five times since then . <p> Testimonies from souls in Purgatory and Vicka 's meetings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they confirm life after death . <p> Accounts of sorties to Heaven are also among my top favorites . On the much lower scale are testimonies of people who were allowed to see , even be in hell for a while . The latter serves only to remind me to be more cautious about my life . <p> The visionaries of Medjugorje , in the former Yugoslavia , now Bosnia- Herzegovina , are goldmines for interesting insights into spirituality , nay , Catholicism . Apart from Ivanka and her departed mother , many other most interesting information of various sorts have been provided by all six visionaries . <p> Let me share the words of visionary Vicka in her interview with Sr. Emmanuel during All Saints ' Day at the Medjugorje cemetery . <p> But first , here 's what Sr. Emmanuel noted before the interview : " Visiting the cemeteries of Medjugorje on All Saints Day at night is really moving since the multitude of vibrant , colored candles give them almost a fairy tale aspect . It is lovely to think that each candle represents a relative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dearly departed soul , helping them cross the threshold of Heaven . However , it would be a pity to wait for someone to die before helping him with our prayers , since the choices we make on Earth hold immense consequences . We do n't always realize this . " <p> Then , Sr. Emmanuel asked Vicka what would be the best way to transmit such thought to others . <p> Vicka replied , " As the Gospa ( Blessed Mother ) has told us , it is already here on earth that we each make the choice of going either to Heaven , or to Purgatory , or to hell . After death we then continue to live what we have chosen on earth . Each one knows how they are living on earth . <p> " As for me , I try my best to do all I can to go to Heaven with all of my heart . I have a great desire to go to Paradise since I am a Christian .. On earth some people choose Purgatory , that is to say , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and choose with the Gospel . <p> " Other people here on earth choose to do everything against God and against the will of God . In doing so , they choose to live in hell . They start a hell in their heart and after death it is the same hell that continues for them . What we become after death depends on us , since God has given free will to everyone . It is we who choose our future in all freedom . <p> " After death , life continues , our life on earth is a short journey , a kind of a walk ! The Gospa has said to us , ' Many live only for this world . They believe that after death everything stops , that it 's all over , that there is nothing more . ' ' No ! ' She said , ' this is a big mistake ! Life continues and after death there is eternity ! ' " <p> Another Medjugorje visionary , Mirjana , also gave interesting insights in an interview on June 19 , 2006 about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On this , Mirjana quoted the Blessed Mother to have said : " Do not think about the secrets . Pray , because the one who feels me as a Mother and God as a Father , that person has no fear of anything . " <p> Mirjana went on in her own words thus : " Our Lady says that only those who have not yet come to know the love of God have fear . But we , as human beings , always talk about the future -- what , when , where will happen . But who among us present here can say for sure that we will be alive tomorrow ? <p> " Our Lady has been teaching us that we should be ready this very moment to come before God . And in the future , God 's Will will be done , and our task is to be ready for that . And I would really like to tell you not to bother yourself with the secrets , but you should worry about your soul , because Our Lady does not want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of our heart . And that is why ... pray in order to get to know the love of God , and then you will not be afraid of anything . " <p> Then Mirjana was asked about the " signs of the times " referred to by the Blessed Mother in her messages . She replied : " I 'm so happy and glad you asked that question , because those messages are telling me a lot . Our Lady is addressing every single person individually . <p> " And now I 'd really like to recommend you to take those messages from your guide in English and go to a quiet place where you will be alone to pray , and to try to understand through prayer what God is telling you through those words - because your ' signs of the times ' could be completely different from mine . That is why I am not authorized or have the right to tell you the way I understand . You have to understand that through your own prayer on your own . It is definitely important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ( 2006 ) as well . " <p> Mirjana said , however , that " When Our Lady gives me a message Our Lady does not explain that message to me . Same as everybody else , I have to pray so that through this prayer I can realize what God wants to tell me .

@@72527240 <p> ( CNN ) -- Joe Biden was once again declared the winner of the US presidential election Monday after members of the Electoral College gathered in all 50 states and the District of Columbia to cast their ballots . <p> It 's a constitutionally mandated ritual that 's typically no more than a curious afterthought following a presidential election , but the ceremonial vote took on newfound significance this year as President Donald Trump and his GOP allies made unprecedented efforts to subvert the popular will of the voters and overturn Biden 's November victory . <p> The vote finally shook loose statements acknowledging Biden 's win from previously reluctant Republicans , but Republican-appointed electors in several states gathered to hold symbolic votes for Trump -- while a retiring Republican congressman announcing he was leaving the party over his colleagues ' unwillingness to move on . <p> The voting kicked off shortly after 10 a.m . ET , with Vermont 's three electors casting the first votes for Biden . All of the votes went as expected -- no states had any so-called " faithless electors " break from the popular vote . And all the battleground states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pennsylvania , Arizona , Michigan and Wisconsin -- cast their electoral votes for Biden . California 's 55 electors put Biden over the 270 Electoral College votes needed to become president shortly after 5 p.m . ET . <p> The Electoral College votes will next be sent to Congress to be counted formally next month . A group of House Republicans have vowed to object to the results in the key states , but they can do little more than delay the process and force a prolonged debate during the joint session of Congress , scheduled for January 6 , when the vote is finalized . <p> Trump has continued to spread false claims of widespread fraud despite courts in all of the battleground states rejecting his campaign 's challenges to the election . The Supreme Court dealt the final blow against his efforts to overturn the election result late Friday , dismissing a case brought by the Texas attorney general that sought to disenfranchise millions of voters in four states . <p> Wisconsin 's Supreme Court denied yet another challenge from Trump 's campaign on Monday , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast their votes for Biden . <p> Biden spoke Monday evening in praise of the state and local officials who " could not and would not give credence to what they knew was not true . " He charged that the Republican efforts to overturn the result represented an " unprecedented assault on our democracy , " while noting that " every single avenue was made available to President Trump to contest the results . " <p> " Respecting the will of the people is at the heart of our democracy , even if we find those results hard to accept , " Biden said . " We the people voted . Faith in our institutions held . The integrity of our elections remains intact . And now it 's time to turn the page as we 've done throughout our history , to unite to heal . " <h> Retiring GOP lawmaker leaving party over election attacks <p> Trump 's baseless attacks on the election result -- and the widespread support of the President 's efforts from Republican leaders in Congress -- prompted Rep. Paul Mitchell of Michigan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say in a letter to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel that he was withdrawing from the party . <p> " This party has to stand up for democracy first , for our Constitution first , and not political considerations , " Mitchell told CNN 's Jake Tapper on Monday . " Not to protect a candidate . Not simply for raw political power , and that 's what I feel is going on , and I 've had enough . " <p> In Congress , most Republicans declined to say that Biden is the President-elect before Monday 's vote , despite a decisive Electoral College victory and baseless claims of voter fraud being thrown out repeatedly in the courts . A majority of House Republicans , including McCarthy , signed on to the Texas lawsuit seeking to overturn the results in four states . <p> Some key Senate Republicans finally acknowledged Biden as President-elect as the Electoral College voting wrapped up on Monday . Sen. John Cornyn , a Texas Republican in Senate leadership , said " yes " when asked if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between now and Inauguration Day , January 20 . <p> " I think he 's President-elect subject to whatever additional litigation is ongoing , " Cornyn said , adding it would be a " bad mistake " for House Republicans to object to the results of the Electoral College vote . <p> Senate Majority Whip John Thune , a South Dakota Republican , said Monday that Biden is President-elect once he crosses 270 electoral votes . " Once the Electoral College settles the issue today , it 's time for everybody to move on , " Thune said . <p> While Trump has directed most of his Twitter ire at the courts and the GOP state officials who have properly certified their states ' election results for Biden , he 's now likely to focus on the upcoming vote counting in Congress . In a Fox News interview over the weekend , Trump claimed that " it 's not over " and vowed to keep fighting to stay in office . <p> Minutes after California affirmed Biden 's win with its vote , Trump tweeted that Attorney General William Barr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trump 's relationship with Barr has soured since the attorney general said after the election that the Justice Department had not uncovered evidence of widespread voter fraud and that the department under him had not disclosed an ongoing investigation into Biden 's son , Hunter Biden , during the election , following Justice Department protocol . Joe Biden is not implicated . <p> Trump and his allies have suggested state legislatures should try to put forward alternate slates of electors who would go against the votes in their states . <p> No state legislature did so on Monday . But Republicans who had been named as electors for Trump in Pennsylvania , Georgia , Arizona and Wisconsin nevertheless met separately to cast symbolic votes for the President on Monday . Those votes have no validity under federal law , but GOP officials in the states said the Trump electors met because there are still ongoing legal challenges . <h> Security concerns in several states <p> The heightened attention to Monday 's Electoral College voting prompted several states to put security protocols in place due to concerns over safety , threats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an undisclosed location , according to the public information office for the secretary of state . And in Wisconsin , electors were told to use an unmarked entrance with police escort , according to one of the electors . <p> " For elections officials in Arizona , this is the final step in our process . And one that is usually conducted with much pomp and circumstance , with the reverence it deserves for its place in history , " Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs , a Democrat , said during the state 's gathering . " But this year 's proceeding , which occurs only once every four years , has unfortunately had an artificial shadow cast over it in the form of baseless accusations of misconduct and fraud , for which no proof has been provided , and which court after court has dismissed as unfounded . And this fabrication of misdeed , leveled against everyone from poll workers to me and my office , has led to threats of violence against me , my office and those in this room today . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monday after " credible threats of violence " as the state 's 16 electors prepare to cast their votes for president and vice president , a spokeswoman told CNN . <p> A Michigan House Republican was stripped of his committee assignments for the rest of the term after inciting violence around protests expected later Monday in Lansing . Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield , a Republican , and Speaker-elect Jason Wentworth released a statement on Monday condemning the comments of House Republican Rep. Gary Eisen , who said in a radio interview that he could not offer assurances there would n't be violence on Monday . <p> In a statement , Chatfield said the state will not change electors to give Trump the win , because doing so would " bring mutually assured destruction for every future election in regards to the Electoral College . " <p> " I fought hard for President Trump , " he wrote . " Nobody wanted him to win more than me . I think he 's done an incredible job . But I love our republic , too . I ca n't fathom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolution retroactively changing the electors for Trump , simply because some think there may have been enough widespread fraud to give him the win . " <h> Congress will count Electoral College votes next month <p> Monday 's Electoral College vote is not the final step in the constitutional process of selecting a president . The votes cast on Monday are then sent to Congress , where they will be counted on January 6 in a joint session led by Vice President Mike Pence . <p> Some of Trump 's staunchest House Republican allies are preparing for a floor fight when the votes are counted in Congress . <p> Lawmakers can dispute a state 's election result when the votes are counted . But a challenge can be considered only if both a House member and a senator sign on to it . So far only House Republicans have said they will contest the results , although some GOP senators have suggested they are considering joining . Senate Republican leaders cautioned against such a move on Monday , however . <p> Even if a senator signs on to challenge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that case , the House and Senate separately debate the matter for two hours and vote on it . Democrats control the House , and enough GOP senators have already said they reject Trump 's claims of fraud that a challenge would not succeed there either . <p> After the state electors cast their ballots , the results are certified and sent to Congress , the National Archives and the courts . <p> As laid out in the Constitution , each state sets its own rules for how electors meet and vote . At least one state -- Nevada -- met virtually due to the pandemic . <p> Electors are picked by the state parties before the November election . Federal lawmakers are not allowed to be electors , but the slates usually include local officials and party alumni . In New York , for instance , former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton cast electoral votes for Biden . <p> In Florida , Republican state Senate President Wilton Simpson , who was a state elector , tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday night . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ College vote Monday and an alternate took his place to cast a ballot for Trump . <p> One of Michigan 's 16 electors was not in attendance for the vote , so electors voted on a replacement to fill the vacancy prior to casting their vote for Biden.

I have read articles on magazines and websites about positivity and acceptance in the past , but I was taken aback by how blunt and straightforward this book was . I was reading it on a Saturday morning and I stopped after 10-15 pages . But I convinced myself that maybe it 's just me adjusting to this kind of *tone* , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I made a good decision . <p> While the initial pages may come off a bit too serious , the next ones are peppered with funny anecdotes here and there . I like that the author would often inject random stories about her life that made me feel like I was her friend who was listening to her talk about her day . And it was not just a tell-all of her existence as an adult , it also targeted other relevant topics without walking away from its theme of helping the reader . Discussions on poverty , wealth , and politics were emphasized , and these reminded me to think bigger . <p> I Decided To Live As Me also has tidbits about the Korean culture and if you 're a *Korean everything* enthusiast like me , you will enjoy learning about them here . Some topics are actually relatable from what I currently read on the news , so for someone who dreams of settling down in the Land Of The Morning Calm , I was able to paint a clearer picture of what life is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all go through the same shit but just in different forms .

I 'm a sucker for this kind of stuff , lol . Also , if you love smelling books like me , the scent of this one has a faint book smell mixed with a whiff of magazine pages ( bookworms : IYKYK ! ) For the illustrations , you will love how minimalistic they are and it stays consistent with the entire concept of the book . <p> The new year is just around the corner and I recommend I Decided To Live As Me to anyone who wants to start anew and develop a better understanding of themselves .

It 's a great read while you 're inside a cafe ( do n't forget the safety protocols ! ) and you 're up for some serious life planning for 2021 with your earphones on . The most remarkable quote from I Decided To Live As Me would be : " Let 's break free from the idea we have of ourselves and try to become something we ca n't anticipate . " Take risks , do something out of your ordinary -- this book will be by your side to give you that push just in case you need it . 
@@72550230 <h> People Will Travel Differently In 2021 -- Here 's How <p> Even before the pandemic there were signs that change was needed in the travel industry . With 2020 basically putting a halt to all but essential travel , and hotels , monuments , airlines , museums and restaurants trying to reinvent themselves , repurpose their spaces and their services , can the lessons of 2020 be used in 2021 to help build a concept of tourism that satisfies the traveler without being destructive to the planet and others ? <h> Newsletters <h> Newsletters <p> All of a sudden the skies were emptied of airplanes , trains were running nearly empty , and everyone found themselves confined to their homes . The tourism industry essentially ground to a halt , and our own identity as travelers or tourists was transformed , shaken . Under house arrest , we rediscovered the nature around us and the wonders of proximity . And these long months should profoundly change how we travel in 2021 and beyond . <p> Even before the pandemic there were signs that change was needed in the travel industry . But instead of a gradual progression of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices after the " flygskam " movement and a progressive uptake in sustainable tourism by the industry , international tourism came to a standstill . The term " anthropause " -- referring to this period of significantly reduced human activity -- was coined largely in response to the unprecedented drop in travel and the resulting drop in carbon emissions . While our awareness of our impact as tourists , sometimes catastrophic , on environments and communities , may have been growing since the concept of " overtourism " made headlines in 2018 , 2020 made it essentially impossible to not look our behaviors in the face and understand that they have a very direct effect on shaping our planet . Watching the outside world from the inside , through screens in our homes , reports of dolphins swimming in less polluted waters in Italy and near Istanbul may have been a temporary reason to cheer but also a call to reckoning in ourselves . <p> Scientists investigating the effects of this anthropause on ecosystems emphasize that with wildlife free and humans under lockdown , the relationship between people and nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travelers , this year we learned that wildlife observation is n't only associated with an exotic or faraway location or even changing one 's environment . As we stayed at home , we started really looking at the nature around us . The birdwatching boom of 2020 grew out of convenience as birds can be found nearly anywhere , even in urban areas , but it also meant that many of us started to view our own , nearby environments differently . Bringing nature into our everyday routine meant we could approach these surroundings with new eyes , a key trait for developing our new travel practices . <h> Leaving the skies for the birds <p> As for the airlines , planes remained grounded , like a symbolic vestige of our recent past . A desert parking lot in Alice Springs , Australia is the storage site of over a hundred planes requiring regular maintenance and has become a kind of curiosity in itself . <p> At the same time in Singapore , grounded planes were transformed into restaurants where customers could reserve the opportunity to eat a travel-style meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Airlines Airbus 's A380 . And so marketing initiatives like this and the well-publicized flights to nowhere may have been designed to spark excitement about travel but , as a simulacrum of a trip , in fact , they resembled a kind of " tour " of our recent past . Postcards from another pre-covid time , or even another world . <p> Meanwhile a UK company specializing in " no-fly " holidays aims to respond to our evolving demands : " wanting to avoid crowded airports , holiday closer to home , experience nature and support local businesses . " <p> As for hotels -- what can a hotel offer us now ? In the new configuration of our everyday reality , hotels tried to launch special rates and offers for those who wanted to make it their temporary home office for a while , a home office located elsewhere for the hybrid nomads who want to work with a different view and take advantage of the amenities and the surroundings . A pragmatic reinvention and one that saw the blurring of the boundaries between home ( office ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home <p> The reasons that we travel are multiple : we want a change of scenery , we want to explore something new and learn something , we want to try new foods , we want a social media brag , we want to make connections , we want to relax , we want peace , calm and quiet , we want to rediscover ourselves . With levels of burnout soaring , particularly this year with the home office screens an omnipresent feature in our lives , this remains a key aspect of travel . Travel is often largely about our relationship with ourselves . <p> So instead of taking a local flight that goes nowhere , what if we could take an inner journey to somewhere ? The lessons of the year 2020 have paved the way for such contemplation . Early in the pandemic , philosopher and author Alain de Botton tackled for the FT the topic of how we can get some of the psychological , existential benefits of travel from an 8-minute walk or from reflecting on previous trips , how " we may already enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply by thinking about it . " While this may have been written before anyone knew just how much of 2020 would be spent in lockdowns , it may help us better understand what we seek from the travel experience when we are once again unfettered . One of the themes to watch for 2021 for Pinterest is " dreams are the new escapes " -- these voyages we take at home can prepare us for a different kind of travel , based on our own dreams and not filtered images showing up in social media feeds . <h> Backlash against travel influencers <p> Even before the pandemic , many influencers were being called out for staging their Instagram shots , while destinations ' promotional departments were also trying to navigate a fine line between working with the " right influencers " who build engagement and the " freeloaders . " In September 2019 , James Asquith asked in an essay in Forbes , " Have Instagram Influencers Ruined Travel For An Entire Generation ? " arguing that " Images became less about the destinations , and more about pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The result is a disconnect between image and reality : " we see all these amazing destinations and when we as the audience make that once in a lifetime trip to them , it leads to disappointment that said destination is n't how we have been made to believe it looks like , " he notes . The once-in-a-lifetime trip ends up being compared to the perfect Insta shot -- and nearly inevitably does n't measure up , leading to disappointment . Too many people to get a clear view , wrong time of day , no filter ... But " the world is n't perfect and that should be appreciated , " he points out . Look to be inspired by what 's right around you , not by the glossy Instagram shot -- it 's a message that resonates even more now as the realities of lockdowns made fantasies posted by influencers glaringly irrelevant . <h> Slow travel , " detourism " and staying still <p> So is there a way to travel better ? Can we become tourists and travelers with a difference ? This year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like New York-based real estate agent and avid traveler Rob , 34 , to do some soul-searching : " this past year has shown us how fragile that freedom to travel internationally can be and I think for a long time afterwards I 'm not going to take it for granted and I hope that my fellow travelers wo n't either ... " . <p> So is there a way to minimize our impact , perhaps by traveling less , and still get the benefits of travel ? An experience that enriches our lives , speaks to us with purpose , offers us sanctuary ? In the last decade slow tourism has been advocated by various players as a way to better respect the environment and community of our travels , with several destinations even promoting themselves that way . Taking time to immerse ourselves in our surroundings , explore what is nearby , eating local , supporting local craftspeople , focusing on experiences instead of hopping on a plane to consume a beach vacation across the world as one would a fast food meal , as described by travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trip for granted , about noticing and , yes , going slower -- though not necessarily for long periods or long distances . And as this year comes to a close there are signs that some in the industry are heeding this evolution , as it shows up in new initiatives around the world , including in Australia and India . <p> Another approach that could become particularly relevant in the post-covid world is that of " detourism " , which is closely related , and , according to French historian Sylvain Venayre , entails exploring your surroundings , often associated with being a tourist in your own area , and going with the flow , going where the day takes you and opening yourself up to chance encounters . It 's about following the path less taken rather than heading off to the top tourism destinations in the world to simply tick off a checklist ; it 's about having a more personal experience , not comparing what you see on your trip to what is in your social media feed . <p> While 2020 saw many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- because they had no choice with borders closed -- it could emerge as a more conscious choice . A growing interest in sales and rentals of campervans could be one sign that such journeys are becoming increasingly attractive to a growing number of people . The lessons of 2020 regarding our relationship to nature , our surroundings , our inner travels and the reality of small , imperfect meanderings that give rise to real , lived experiences along a smaller , different , less trodden path could pave the way for us to become better tourists .

@@84967234 <h> Javelin Report Shows Higher Account Takeover Fraud in 2019 <p> A new report from Javelin Strategy &amp; Research suggests that financial institutions are failing to keep pace with fraudsters . While the overall number of fraudulent incidents went down between 2018 and 2019 ( from 14.4 million to 13 million ) , the average attack has become more lucrative , leading to a 15 percent increase ( to $16.9 billion ) in year-over-year fraud losses . <p> However , what may be even more concerning is that much of that loss is being transferred directly to consumers , who shouldered $3.5 billion in out-of-pocket costs . Much of that can be attributed to the rise in account takeover fraud , which was up 72 percent for the year . Fraud is also increasing on peer-to-peer payment systems , jumping 733 percent between 2016 and 2019 . <p> " Scammers are adept at capitalizing on current events and new platforms , " said AARP Director of Fraud Prevention Kathy Stokes .

Third , we also have to deal with societal pressure and judgments , where oftentimes people think the relationship exists only because of money . Other than that , dating is somewhat taboo . A lot of Filipinos are not that open about dating a trans woman -- and if they do , the relationship has to be kept a secret . <p> What challenges have you faced in the dating scene ? <p> Looking for a man to date is hard .

There are a lot of men around , but I do n't know who is really " brave " enough to date someone like me . Not a lot of Filipinos are " ready " or open to date transgender women . We are still living in a time when transgender women are rejected in bars and clubs , and even some institutions like the military or other workplace . It 's extra difficult to even have a fighting chance in love because it requires more than our presence . In love , people need to meet us , get to know us , get personal with us . For many in the Philippines , our presence alone threatens them . I hope I am wrong , but sometimes that 's how I feel when it comes to dating here . I feel hopeless . <p> Can you tell us about your own dating experiences ? <p> I have been on some dates , but all failed . I 'm still single . I usually meet potential dates on Bumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more open about dating me . And even in these platforms , men would tell me that I should put on my bio that I am transgender because I am somehow catfishing them by not disclosing my gender orientation . I meet some during nights out but it seems that the men I meet are the ones who are n't " ready " for a relationship . <p> What challenges do you face ? <p> There are a lot of challenges . With Filipinos and foreigners alike , a lot of them fetishize being with a transgender woman . Some like to " experiment " and try a " new " experience . We are , most of the time , reduced to a kink . Maybe this is also why we are generalized into being sex workers . I totally respect sex workers , I believe it should be a legitimate job , but we are not here to do sex work . <p> Some are ashamed to be seen with a transgender woman in public . This is especially true when a trans woman , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's standard of beauty or if we do n't look feminine enough . It 's like , " I can love you but in secret , " which is not ideal for me . <p> There are also external factors -- what would your family say , what would your friends say , what would others say ? And some boys , and I say boys because they 're not men , would rather not deal with this . <p> We 're so scrutinized and pressured to look hyperfeminine . Some guys go , " Oh , you have some baby facial hair , " " Your shoulders are too broad in person , " " Your voice is not yet feminine enough , " " You need boobs and hips . " <p> When going on dates , some clubs will literally not allow trans women to enter because we are considered cross-dressers . <p> What would you change about the dating scene ? <p> Oh , that 's a difficult one . I would like to change a lot . For one , I hope people would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transgender women . It is no different from dating a cisgender woman . <p> In the Philippines , it 's always shocking when a straight man is dating or is in love with a transgender woman . People call them bakla or say that they are using the transgender woman for money . Dating without the layer of being trans is already challenging . What more if there are these people who make it extra hard ? <p> I would also like to see the trans community celebrate love more versus acting like we are all fighting over a small pool of men . I do n't know if this is just me or if this is common even in the cisgender dating scene , but because we have such a small pool of men , people can get very feisty . <p> Lastly , we really need to pass the Sogie ( sexual orientation and gender identity expression ) bill . This can open up discussions on transgender issues and education . This may literally protect us and save our lives . Transgender women are some of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we get discriminated against , we get killed ( and people can get away with it ) . We need to feel equal , we need to empower one of the most discriminated sectors in society . We need to love and be loved . <p> How do you deal with bigots ? <p> First , I try to make them get to know me . Usually when you get to know someone , you see that we have more similarities than differences . If they are open , I try to educate them on our challenges , our fears , our dreams . However , some are just really close-minded , so blocking them and taking them out my life is the last option . <p> The art of kebs sometimes works . Balakajan . Die a sad person and I will live my life surrounded by the people who fully accept me and love me . I know this can be ineffective , we need to continuously fight for our voices to be heard , but sometimes as human beings , we also get tired . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's this idea that Filipinos are n't as ready to date trans women as foreigners are -- is there truth to this , or is this a misconception ? <p> Somehow true . Based on my personal experience , they are the ones who are ashamed to go public in dating transgender women . Maybe because they fear being called bakla ( eh ano naman , di ba ? ) or what their family will say . <p> I think the misconception is that trans women prefer foreigners or afam over Filipinos . I do not think this is the case . It is just that foreigners tend to like us more than Filipinos . If a decent Filipino guy wants to date me , why not , poknat ? I am super game . <p> Has the Philippines improved in its treatment of trans women ? <p> I believe yes , compared to decades ago . Our transgender brothers and sisters back then really had to fight hard just to be recognized as transgender people versus gay or lesbian . At least now , we can truly claim who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more people are getting the courage to come out as transgender . However , by saying this , I am also acknowledging the fact that we have a long way to go when it comes to equal rights . We still have issues when it comes to restrooms , getting hired in the workforce , being given equal opportunities , etc . <p> What can we do to be better ? <p> I think as a people we really need to learn to listen more . Hear our stories , challenges , struggles . By doing so , you will see that we are just like any other human being . Listen to what we have to say , recognize that this world was n't created exclusively for cisgender people . On a more active note , be a true ally . Walk with us when we fight for our rights . Shout with us for equal opportunities . Be by our side when we are discriminated against and mistreated . Lastly , pass the Sogie bill . This bill will not hinder any of your rights , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . <p> What 's something you wish you could tell everyone about dating trans women ? <p> For the men who are thinking of dating transgender women , be ready . Be ready to date one of the strongest persons you will ever date . The trans woman you will be getting to know has faced a lot of challenges , and yet , she is still able to give so much love . What you will have is something very special and real . However , just like any other relationship , you will have problems . People might judge you , people may not accept your relationship , but hold on to it . Fight for it . In the end , if what you are feeling is real love , there is nothing people can say , do or think that should hinder your love for another person regardless of gender , race , status . Love is love . <p> What tips would you give trans women who are just starting to date ? <p> Heya , sissy ! Please know that you are capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is super important , please do not measure your worth based on a man . Your worth as a woman does not go up or down just because you have or do n't have a boyfriend . You are special , you are loved , you are worth it . <p> Lastly , some tips to remember : <p> You do not owe anyone disclosure . Tell them when you are comfortable , when you are ready . <p> Know your worth . Do not just jump on the opportunity of having a date for the sake of it . I know , it 's quite difficult especially here in the Philippines , but you will find the right person at the right time . <p> Be proud of who you are . Never settle for a secret relationship . We did n't fight to be seen just to be someone 's hidden love affair . <p> Be careful . The sad truth is , as trans women , we still get a lot of hate . Just take care of yourself . However , do not blame yourself if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is not our fault , it 's the assh -- e who made fun of us , fooled us , took advantage of us . <p> Just have fun and be yourself !
