@@71505230 <p> Chief Medical Officer in the Ministry of Health and Environment , Dr. Sheila Campbell-Forrester , has reiterated Jamaica 's call for an extension of the deadline for achieving the United Nations ' Millennium Development Goals(MDGs) beyond 2015 . Dr. Campbell-Forrester said that the current global financial meltdown will negatively impact on the country 's health spending and services , and its ability to meet the deadline for the health goals . She was representing Minister of Health and Environment , Rudyard Spencer , at a National Consultative Workshop on Jamaica 's National Report to the United Nations Annual Ministerial Review on International Development Goals and Commitments to Public Health , at the Planning Institute of Jamaica(PIOJ) , Oxford Road , Kingston , on Wednesday ( April 1 ) . Dr. Campbell-Forrester recalled that the extension was requested by small developing countries at last year 's World Health Assembly , against the background that current challenges , such as the financial crisis and the loss of skilled citizens , are affecting sustainable development . " Our response in the health sector must be transformative and must focus on social justice . We can not do everything all at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Chief Medical Officer assured the audience , however , that the Government would strengthen its focus on primary health care , as Jamaicans are forced to spend less of their disposable income on medical care . The eight UN MDGs include four which are directly related to the Ministry : reduce child mortality ; improve maternal health ; combat HIV/AIDS , malaria and other diseases ; and ensure environmental sustainability . The other MDGs are- eradicate extreme poverty and hunger ; achieve universal primary education ; promote gender equality and empower women ; and develop global partnerships for development . The deadline is 2015 . The MDGs were drawn from the actions and targets contained in the Millennium Declaration adopted by 189 nations and signed by 147 heads of state and governments , during the UN Millennium Summit in September , 2000 . The national workshop is intended for countries that volunteer to present a comprehensive report of their progress towards development goals , at the Annual Ministerial Review of the Economic and Social Council ( ECOSOC ) in Geneva , in July . Jamaica will be among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntary presentations at the meeting in July . Some of the other counties listed to present a report are China , Dominican Republic , New Zealand , Sri Lanka , Japan and Sudan . United Nations Resident Coordinator in Jamaica , Minh Pham , said that critical issues such as the financial meltdown and the country 's vulnerability to natural disasters , must be evaluated when the national report is being tabled . " The implications of a financial meltdown , the implications of a recession , implications of a high debt service in the country , as to where do we go from here in terms of achieving the goals that we have established for ourselves . I think that it is critical that the paper address those issues , as well , " said Mr. Pham . Under Secretary in the Multilateral Affairs Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade , Ambassador Vilma McNish , said the policies and experiences reviewed through the national voluntary presentation should offer learning tools for the country 's overall development process . " Our report should therefore highlight the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in pursuing its strategies in the area of public health , as well as other development goals , " said Ambassador McNish . The 2005 World Summit Outcome mandated ECOSOC to hold an Annual Ministerial Review , in order to gear efforts towards the implementation of the United Nations Development Agenda . The ministerial review provides an opportunity for countries to make national voluntary presentations , which would be based on the countries respective national development strategies and their implementation .
