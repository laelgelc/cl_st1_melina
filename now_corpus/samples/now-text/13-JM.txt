The tendered project was won by British company London and Regional , which has been developing the hub in Port Arthur since then . <p> The website of Panama Pacifico indicates that several multinationals have also set up office in the PPSEA . The area is now home to 154 companies , 5,400 employees and eight Fortune 500 companies .

@@4578231 <h> News <h> ' An entitlement Jamaicans can not afford ' <p> AMIDST brewing controversy and despite threats of protest from the parliamentary opposition , one public sector trade union is demanding a reintroduction of user fees in the public health-care system , a move it says would allow the Government to grant public sector workers a much-needed salary hike . <p> The pronouncement from the general secretary of the Union of Technical , Administrative and Supervisory Personnel ( UTASP ) St Patrice Ennis has added to the increasing levels of discontent among public sector unions in response to the suggestion that employees may have to make do with what they have due to the pending agreement with the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) . <p> Among other things , the IMF is demanding a reduction in the country 's debt and has reportedly suggested that a reduction in the public sector wage bill would help to solve this problem . <p> For some analysts , this reduction in the money paid to public servants can only be achieved through a wage freeze or by downsizing the public sector . <p> Ennis is insisting that his union has not agreed to any wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government , as workers who have been struggling to make ends meet can not endure another three or four years without a salary increase . <p> Branding the universal health-care policy an entitlement that Jamaicans can not afford the UTASP executive added that free tuition at the secondary level of the education system is another benefit that has tremendously reduced the Government 's ability to pay decent wages to public sector workers . <p> He believes that public servants are again being called upon to shoulder a burden that should be shared by everyone . <p> " If you are saying that people are required to make sacrifices , then everybody will have to make that sacrifice . Of course user fees must come back . If it does n't , then we are going to have a public-health system that falls totally into disarray .

If you are the wealthiest Jamaican you have access to free health care . If you have health insurance you have access to free health care . What sort of nonsense is that ? The expenditure has to come from somewhere and I am saying that when the Government makes its budget it accords priorities where it wants , and part of its priority is to win elections , so it does n't want to deal with the repercussions of having to introduce a user fee policy , and it does n't want to deal with removing the ' no tuition fee ' in the school system . So the scapegoat now to help deal with their expenditure issues is to cut compensation for public sector workers , " Ennis said . <p> He lobbied for the introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public who are unable to pay for health services , in order to establish special provisions for them . <p> But Ennis 's argument has not found favour with Opposition Spokesman on Public Service and Labour , Senator Arthur Williams , who again insisted that both the free tuition policy and the ' no user fee ' regime should not be touched . <p> " There must be no additional cost to students in school , and we are on record as saying you should not touch the user fees in hospitals unless there is a proper insurance system in place , " Williams asserted . <p> However , Ennis maintained that Jamaicans continue to hide from reality and insisted that the policies must be reviewed . <p> " In every other country looking at austerity measures entitlements are on the table , and these include the United Kingdom and the United States , where right now there is a big debate over welfare . The only people who seem to be oblivious to this is us , and we are poorer than all of these countries . Why is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these issues on the table ? " Ennis asked as he raised concerns about the usefulness of recent meetings of the public sector monitoring committee . <p> According to him , Government representatives often come to the meetings with cemented positions and are reluctant to engage in negotiations . <p> He added that since the departure of former Finance and Planning Minister Dr Omar Davies in 2007 , the effectiveness of the meetings has been reduced . <p> Meanwhile , the UTASP general secretary said that the Simpson Miller administration is guilty of committing the same mistakes that marred relations between the unions and the Bruce Golding-led Jamaica Labour Party administration . <p> " We believe that this Government has made the same mistake as the previous Government which had a wage agreement with the unions for a seven per cent increase for the period 2009-2010 . However , it still felt that it could go ahead and embark on an agreement with the IMF , and announced that it would not honour the seven per cent wage increase .

That 's 9,506 more than they could accommodate . In addition to the 841 spaces advertised , 77 others were reserved for special groups such as young professionals , public sector workers , persons with disabilities , and contributors earning $10,000 or less per week . <p> The solutions were priced at between $6.7 million and $7.3 million for two-bedroom units , from $4.9 million to $5.6 million for one bedroom houses , from 3.2 million to $4.2 million for studios , and from $1.5 million to $3 million for serviced lots .

The rush on Longville , according to real estate practitioners , is an indication of the demand for affordable homes of fair quality , but it comes as no surprise to CEO of LaMaison Property Services Ltd , Edwin Wint . <p> " I 've long said that for anything up to $8 million the effective demand is going to be high , because when two people can qualify for an NHT loan with a fairly reasonable mortgage payment , it 's going to ( go fast ) , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprecedented or unusual , " he said making reference to previous decades when he said NHT houses were gobbled up in similar fashion .

There is still a problem with homes above the low-to-middle income band , " said Tavares Finson .

@@4578235 <h> Chivalry - Not dead ... just modernised <p> The following article was written by an ardent Flair reader , Matthew Smith-Barrett <p> The concept of chivalry is a gender-exclusive act in which men , from as far back as the Middle Ages , have been charged with a code of conduct regarding the protection of those who can not protect themselves . <p> The history of chivalry and its meaning is documented below : <p> " The Knight 's Code of Chivalry was a moral system that stated all knights should protect others who can not protect themselves , such as widows , children , and elders . " - Davis , Alex ( 2004 ) <p> The modern revision of chivalry speaks to the act of men displaying protective and respective gestures/acts towards the opposite sex , whether in a causal or intimate manner . Chivalry , however , has had to compete with the continuous empowerment of the modern woman and the suggested marginalisation of the modern man , especially in the Jamaican setting . However , women now constantly complain of the lack of chivalrous men in today 's society , versus what was the norm in the 1960s to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' manly ' role they were charged with . As much as one would like to applaud that the previous statement is true , in the context of all the change that has taken place over the decades , giving us what is the ' modern ' woman versus the ' modern Neanderthal ' man , the applause should be reserved . The modern woman is not who the woman of the past was , but more power to the women who are now a combination of the past and present . <p> Chivalry ' died ' because it can not truly coexist with the concept of the independent woman and the equal rights/equal opportunity woman . Chivalry , as the definition suggests , is the act of protection of those who " can not protect themselves " . Now , show of hands all the women reading this that can attest to not being able to protect themselves ... do n't rush to put up all the hands at once . <p> Struggling to coexist <p> The modern requirement of chivalry is also a trampled concept that is struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the protection of those who can not protect themselves , to a man acting in a ' gentlemanly ' manner towards the opposite sex . Here are a few examples of what this modern concept entails : <p> 1 . Opening the door for a woman to enter or exit a building/room/space . <p> 2 . Opening of the car door for a woman before you , as the man , enter the car . <p> 3 . Offering your seat to a woman on any form of public transport that accommodates both seated and standing passengers . <p> 4 . Assisting a woman with crossing the road . <p> 5 . Paying for dinner and all other forms of dating or ' treating ' expenditure ( whether the man invited her out or the woman suggested the outing ) . <p> 6 .

The modern woman is now regarded as the equal of the modern man ( and , in some instances , superior to the modern man , depending on who you speak to ) . <p> 2 . The modern woman does not want to be associated with the classification under chivalry as being " in need of protection " or " not being able to protect themselves " . <p> 3 .

@@4587235 <h> News <h> Should contraceptives be introduced in schools ? <h> A Dat Wi Seh ... <p> The controversial debate regarding the distribution of contraceptives , primarily condoms , in Jamaica 's secondary schools continues to rage on , with teachers sharing mixed views on the topic . Last week the Sunday Observer posed the question ' should contraceptives be introduced in schools ? ' to educators attending a special forum at the Medallion Hall Hotel in Kingston . <p> Lenworth Sterling -- Principal , Ferncourt High School <p> " I do n't think that it should be done . I think our guidance counsellors have in their programmes the whole matter of abstinence and that is what we are pushing right now . I do n't think the schools should be asked to do that . " <p> Valentine Bailey -- Principal , Camperdown High School <p> " On one hand I do n't think that the schools should have that kind of authority to give a person 's child condoms . I think that is a parental decision . It should be solely a parental decision because of what is happening now ; the whole sexual freedom and the belief that once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do whatever . You giving them condoms may be seen as a signal to say ' alright , indulge but just protect yourself ' . One of the things we keep missing is that the act itself brings a whole heap of psychological problems , it sends a bad signal to that child . On the other hand , I can understand the rationale for doing it because I think the school system is saying ' well they ( students ) are doing it so we have to ensure that they protect themselves . ' But , if I have to lean to a side , I believe that it should be a parental decision . <p> " The argument posited that students are having sex anyway so we should not turn a blind eye and that we should give them condoms . My counter to that is that if you give them condoms they will still have unprotected sex . The majority of our Jamaican populace , based on research , does not practice the wearing of condoms . School is to create an environment to turn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and who can function in a global society . In doing that , I do not see the need to create the environment to disseminate condoms . It is not a family planning centre ; it 's a school to educate children on how to be responsible . And although it is responsible behaviour to wear condoms , it is also responsible behaviour to abstain from sex until you can deal with the consequences of sex , and that is the message that I want them ( students ) to get . " <p> Dr Winsome Gordon -- Chief Executive Officer , Jamaica Teaching Council <p> " I do n't think so . As far as I am concerned , that is not the role of the school . Parents have their children , they are suppose to discuss sexuality , sexual relations and intercourse with their children . They ( parents ) are the ones to take a decision to give the child or give the children contraceptives and to ensure that their children are safe . That is a parental responsibility , it is not a responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are other things that the education system should do like teaching children to value themselves , to value and respect their bodies , and teaching them to have healthy relationships that do not have to be sexual relationships . Those are things we can do as educators , but certainly not to distribute contraceptives . " <p> George Dawkins -- Research director , Shortwood Teachers ' College <p> " Whether we like it or not , inspite of our moral views on the matter , the students are having sex at a very early age and that 's a reality , based on the evidence . It would seem to be sensible , if we want to minimise teenage pregnancy , that this should be done . However , the communication with regards to its use and sexual activity should be clearly articulated to say that you should not be engaged in this activity because of the distractions and the fact that you are not physically and psychologically ready , but in the event that you want to engage then this is something that will protect you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is another view point that it will encourage or promote sexual activity and perhaps increase the number of incidents of such occurence . That is something that I do n't know about it , we would have to do the research to see if that is actually happening . But I would lead towards the provision of condoms with appropriate counselling and appropriate articulation of its purpose within the educational system . " <p> Leo Dacosta -- Vice Principal , Ocho Rios High School <p> " As I teach my students ; sex comes with responsiblity and therefore you are a student in school and ought not to be having sex . But I can not see myself giving them condoms because giving someone condoms is saying ' protect yourself whilst you have sex ' . So I see mixed signals being sent , and for schools , our responsibility is to teach according to what we expect . We are saying sex is to be delayed , students should wait and focus on what you should be accomplishing now in this stage of your development . Now , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to be issuing condoms we are sending mixed signals . Issue them at the tertiary level but not at the secondary level . " <p> Leroy McKenzie -- Vice Principal , Dunoon Technical High School <p> " My view is simply that it is a good thing . No matter how we try the students we have are coming from a background of society , an environment that allows for promiscuity so the school is no different from the environment so therefore distribution of condoms in schools should be done . Because they ( students ) know it , and since they are getting involved , that 's one of the things we can use to try to minimise teenage pregnancy right now . " <p> Ovnelle Smith -- teacher Donald Quarrie High School <p> " Teachers , educators should not distribute contraceptive in schools , but we should continue to educate the children in sex education classes as to how to deal with their sexuality . Education is important in that if we just distribute contraceptive we would be encouraging the children to get sexually involved and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come with being involved sexually . Our experience tells us that they are unable to manage it and most of the times those who are involved get themselves into deeper trouble . So I believe that teachers should continue to teach students in their health and family life classes about how to control those feelings and urgings for sex .

Haughton <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> About this logistics hub <p> The expansion the Panama Canal is expected to be completed by 2015 . With this in mind , Caribbean islands , including Cuba , Dominican Republic and Jamaica , have been putting plans in place to expand wharves and port facilities , transforming them into key logistic hubs to take full advantage of their strategic location in the Caribbean basin . <p> What is a logistics hub ? <p> According to a report prepared by the Euro-Platforms group , a logistics hub is a centre or specific area designated to deal with activities related to transportation , organisation , separation , coordination and distribution of goods for national and international transit , on a commercial basis by various operators . <p> These operators may own , lease or rent the buildings and/or the facilities of the hub . These include warehouses , storage areas , distribution centres , offices , trucking and shipping services . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above functions . Also , to ensure synergy and commercial consistency , it is best if the logistics hub is managed by a single , neutral legal body , preferably under a partnership between government and private interest . <p> What are the key features of a logistics hub ? <p> A successful logistics hub must have two main elements : <p> 1 . Territorial planning alongside infrastructure rationalisation . This is necessary to fully utilise the area dedicated for the hub and to safeguard the environment by moving the traffic from residential areas to the hub , and building infrastructure to meet the specific needs of the operations . <p> 2 . High transport quality . To remain competitive , this is a necessary component of the hub . With globalisation , other countries are also preparing logistic hubs . Growing industries constantly need the most efficient transport and logistic solutions . This means minimum bureaucracy in an environment where it is easy to do business , a formula that Jamaica can not find , considering the country ranks very low on the world doing business index . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , industrial costs , personnel costs , increase transport operations total turnover and maintain industrial productivity competitiveness . <p> The hub must seek to optimise the logistics chain , optimise truck and warehouse utilisation and provide optimal manpower organisation . <p> What are the activities of the hub ? <p> The company managing the logistics hub is required to carry out the following : <p> 3 . The management of the hub is responsible for investment and development planning and the overall layout of the centre . <p> 4 . Once they lay out the plan for the hub properly , the management company is responsible for constructing the infrastructure and making arrangements for renting , leasing and selling activities . <p> 5 . The management is also required to oversee the administrative , financial , commercial and operations management of the hub , and upkeep and maintenance of the communal property . <p> What about the infrastructure and services ? <p> The most important infrastructure are the warehouses and intermodal terminals . The warehouses are where the transport operators mainly carry out their businesses . There are different type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled by the transport operators . <p> General warehouse for storage , large warehouse for logistics activities , warehouse connected to goods transportation , warehouses with raised dock bays and air-conditioned warehouses . The intermodal terminals provide access to intermodal transport services , ensuring an efficient and competitive transportation and dispatch from the hubs . Services will be the core of the hub since it is built mainly to handle all activities related to freight movement . Therefore , the correct services are required to complement the infrastructure . <p> Some of the vital services provided by good logistic hubs are customs district , post offices , bus services and public telephones , areas for parking , loading and unloading , restaurants , cafes and vehicle-cleaning facilities . <p> Is Jamaica on the correct path ? <p> The Kingston Wharf acts as a logistics hub on the island .

So , it must to be of concern to those who run the Bustamante Industrial Trade Union ( BITU ) that , up to now , the marking of theirs has been largely a damp squib . <p> Indeed , notwithstanding last Sunday 's church service to launch the celebrations , Kavan Gayle , the BITU president , would forgive anyone who presumed that not even the union leadership is enthusiastic about the anniversary . We do n't feel their excitement . <p> Mr Gayle will , no doubt , argue that such an observation is a misreading of events ; that what we perceive is not a lack of effort and/or engagement on the part of the BITU , but the reality of the environment in which Jamaica 's trade unions exist . <p> He would probably be right .

The BITU 's 75th anniversary is a good catalyst for this . <p> No one can question the BITU 's - and , for that matter , trade union 's generally - place in , or contribution to , the modern economic , social and political history of Jamaica . The union formed by Alexander Bustamante provided leadership and direction to the labour upheavals of 1938 . Indeed , Bustamante and his union helped engineer the relatively stable political democracy that Jamaica enjoys today . <p> But what neither Jamaica 's labour unions nor the political framework they helped to spawn can claim is economic success , which Mr Gayle has posited as the mandate for the BITU going forward . <p> Said he : " ... We will continue to play our role in efforts to turn around the economy and create prosperity for all our people , but we will maintain an unflinching commitment to protect the gains of the workers and to seek further advances in justice and fair play for the masses .

Approximately one year ago , photography in The Gleaner highlighted some very elated nurses when it was announced that ' Cabinet signs off on reclassification of public-sector nurses ' . <p> These nurses would have anticipated much arising out of such reclassification exercise . To the contrary , these nurses are now realising that there was nothing significant to jump about . <p> As currently proposed by the Government , a graduate nurse with four years training and a BSc in nursing gets a measly starting salary of $71,000 per month before tax . Many of these nurses who have to fund their training with loans from the Students ' Loan Bureau have their work cut out to repay the required $50,000 or more per month following graduation . <p> BREACH OF AGREEMENT <p> The hard-fought 2006-2008 negotiations between the Nurses ' Association of Jamaica and the Government resulted in the inclusion of ' reclassification of nurses ' as part of that Heads of Agreement .

In accordance with figures in the final reclassification report , the starting salary for a graduate nurse was estimated at $67,500 per month before tax . Taking into account the effective date of the nurses ' reclassification ( July 2007 ) , it is evident that most ( approximately 75 per cent ) of the 22% salary increase which came after in the 2008-2010 contract period would have subsumed into the reclassified salary scales . <p> As indicated in a previous article ( July 10 , 2010 ) , the low values of scores in the " final reclassification report " would have negative implications for the health sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among some individuals , has obviously impacted negatively on the ability for nurses to be equitably remunerated in Jamaica . <p> The economic pie may be small , but it should be equitably divided so that nurses are not subjected to the raw deal that is now being proposed .

" In spite of this , bananas are on the decline , resulting in a scarcity , " he added . <p> Pottinger said that the majority of banana growers were small- and medium-scale farmers , so recovery efforts have been a challenge for them after Hurricane Sandy . <p> Pottinger stated that many of the farmers depend on assistance given to the country by the European Union as they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " What we now have is just a catastrophe fund which was seeded by the European Union ( EU ) and which farmers continue to put something in , " he said . <p> The assistance from this fund is not much , so farmers still face big costs after disaster strikes . <p> " Many farmers are trying to get back on their own at the moment , " Pottinger said . <p> He went on to add that the majority of farmers should rebound from the effects of Hurricane Sandy by the end of July . However , the supply will still not be enough , as more of the crop should be planted to supply the local market as well as to fulfil the possibility of an export market . <p> Pottinger said that banana farming remains attractive to those who are already in it ; however , the challenge is now to get young farmers on board . <p> " We have a lot of lands that we could put in bananas if we get the level of assistance , " he argued . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idle hands in the parish which could not only remedy the shortage but which could reduce crime in the parish , too . <p> " Agriculture is the answer , but it has to be attractive , " Pottinger pointed out . <p> The veteran farmer added that strategies had to be taken to get young men interested in banana growing . <p> " Banana is a long-term crop and no youngster is going to sit down for nine months and just sit and wait , " he suggested . <p> As a result , he said , the young men have to be assisted with cash crops to provide them with an income as they start off in banana growing . <p> He said that more assistance for the farmers is expected to come from the EU later this year . <p> However , farmers have lamented the process to get assistance provided by the EU as very tedious and disadvantageous to small farmers as this assistance is often issued in the form of loans and requires much documentation the small farmers are unable to provide . <p> While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ providing them with assistance to combat the decline in banana in St Mary , parish manager Howard O'Hara said that the farmers , if they are in need of assistance , should contact the office and help will be given . <p> O'Hara said that field officers were active in the parish . However , the farmers , he said , had to seek assistance , if needed . <p> President of the All-Island Banana Growers ' Association Grethel Sessing said that there are three major factors which had caused a decline in banana production in the parish . These , she said , were the frequency of bad weather , high cost of input and the inability of farmers to access affordable financing . <p> She admitted that if famers had easier access to financing , the situation could be improved . <h> ADVERTISEMENT <p> POST A COMMENT <p> HOUSE RULES <p> 1 .

Could you explain under what circumstances this can occur ? <p> - SJ <p> Dear SJ , <p> It is true that under certain circumstances a person who was born outside of the United Kingdom or a qualifying territory may be eligible to become a British citizen . The qualifying territories referred to are all the British overseas territories except for the Sovereign base areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia which are in Cyprus . <p> If a person was born outside the United Kingdom before 1 January 1983 , that person would became a British citizen if , immediately before that date , he or she was a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies and had the right of abode in the United Kingdom . <p> What is meant by this is that a person may have had citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies by descent from a father who had that citizenship , or because he or she was registered or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Also , if that person has a passport that was issued before 1 January 1983 that describes the holder as a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies on page 1 of the passport , then he or she would almost certainly have become a British citizen on 1 January 1983 as long as page 5 states that the ' Holder has the right of abode in the United Kingdom ' . <p> However , if that person had the right of abode because he or she was registered under the British Nationality ( No2 ) Act 1964 , then he or she would not normally have become a British citizen on 1 January 1983 unless that person 's mother had became a British citizen at that point . <p> A person may also have had right of abode if , he or she was adopted , naturalised or registered as a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies in the United Kingdom except in certain circumstances ; or if that person had been legally settled in the United Kingdom and had been " ordinarily resident ' there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ born , that person had a parent who was a citizen of the United Kingdom and Colonies because he/she was born , adopted , naturalised or registered in the United Kingdom , except in certain circumstances , or because one of that person 's grandparents was a citizen of the United Kingdom . <p> On the other hand if a person was born outside the United Kingdom on or after 1 January 1983 or if he or she was born outside a qualifying territory on or after 21 May 2002 and had a parent who was a British citizen then the rules are different . That is whether or not a person is a British citizen would depend on the type of citizenship that the parents of that individual had .

While it is encouraged that members enforce the law with the appropriate use of legislations and policies , those found in contravention and those who refuse to fulfil their professional obligations will face serious disciplinary actions .

@@4593234 <p> A Supreme Court judge has ruled that the police have no power , under the Road Traffic Act , to arbitrarily stop and search motor vehicles , opening the door for a flood of lawsuits . <p> The police have repeatedly argued that the law gives them the power to stop and search vehicles , and that this has resulted in the apprehension of criminals , the recovery of stolen vehicles and stolen farm produce . <p> But Justice David Batts says the police are abusing this power . <p> Batts made the ruling when he ordered the Government to pay $2.8 million in damages to a motorist who was assaulted by the police when he was stopped in St Catherine in May 2007 . <p> Batts emphasised in the judgment that lawful reasons must be given by the police for stopping and searching a motor vehicle . <p> Batts has directed the registrar of the Supreme Court to send copies of the judgment to the Office of the Commissioner of Police and to the commissioner of the Independent Commission of Investigations for action to be taken , as seen fit . <p> The judge said there was some belief that Section 58 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stop and search vehicles without reasonable cause . <p> " That act does no such thing , " Batts said in the judgment . <p> He explained that the act allows for the redirection of traffic or stopping of vehicles for the purposes of traffic flow or some reasonable purpose . <p> " The request for documents and driver 's licence similarly follow on some existing cause , such as a reasonable suspicion that a crime has been or is about to be committed . <p> " The reasonable cause to suspect that an individual has or is about to commit a crime must relate to peculiar characteristics of the persons or the vehicle he is driving , or the manner in which it is operated , or to information received , " said Batts . <p> He said further that in Jamaica , the citizen is free to move about without an obligation to carry a pass , and is not to be subject to arbitrary or random searches . <p> CONSTITUTIONAL GUARANTEE <p> Batts noted that this was still a constitutional guarantee . <p> " I find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abbreviated history because of some surprising features of this case . <p> " Surprising , because when the evidence from the defendant was completed , the matter of a lawful reason to stop and request a search of the claimant 's vehicle had not been addressed . <p> " Indeed , the attorney-at-law representing the Crown , when asked , stated that reasonable cause was the fact that the police were conducting random searches for guns and drugs . <p> " It is the casual attitude by the defendant and its witnesses to the individual 's right to freedom of movement , freedom of the person , and freedom from search , which has caused me to restate the source of these rights and the history of struggle to attain them . <p> " It bears repeating that while lawfully driving his motor vehicle , the claimant was exercising his right to freedom of movement and was entitled to expect that that , as well as his other rights , would not be interfered with without lawful excuse . <p> " Let me say further that even on the account @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is given for stopping the claimant 's vehicle .

@@4593235 <h> News <h> Buggery law : Government will bow <h> New church head expects pressure from int'l community , gays on Simpson Miller administration <p> THE Portia Simpson Miller administration will put the proposed repeal of the Buggery Act to a conscience vote , under pressure from the international gay community and pro-gay foreign governments . <p> This was the prediction of new president of the umbrella Jamaica Council of Churches ( JCC ) Rev Everald Galbraith in his first major interview since accepting the mantle of JCC head . <p> " I see the Government willing to go forward on its promise to put the matter to a conscience vote , even if it 's not immediate . This is partly driven by the international gay community and governments that have the capacity to influence economic support for the country , " said Galbraith , who is also head of the Methodist Church in Jamaica . <p> Galbraith said in the weekend interview with the Jamaica Observer that the Government would also succumb to the " increasing visibility and pressure from the gay community in the Jamaican society " . <p> During the 2011 political leadership debate , Simpson Miller promised to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buggery Act which outlaws anal sex and has become a flashpoint for gays emboldened by gains in the United States where the Supreme Court has upheld same-sex marriage . <p> Galbraith said the Christian and Social Witness Commission of the Jamaica Council of Churches -- which represents most of the established churches in Jamaica -- would meet later this month to decide on a final position on homosexuality and the buggery law . The grouping would then issue an official statement before September 2013 . <p> The church has apparently been treading cautiously on the hot button issue . A position paper on the matter was submitted for approval at the last Annual General Meeting on June 19 , 2013 , however , the document had to be revisited based on observations made by some members , Galbraith admitted . <p> But he insisted that , while a quick response was desirable from the church and the JCC , in particular , on certain national issues , such decisions " should not only solve the issues in the short term , but must also have a <p> far-reaching impact for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church is n't saying anything , but the churches that are a part of the JCC need to deliberate on matters before they speak . Depending on what the issue is , it may require an immediate response from the church ... But our position must deal with the issue , not just for now , but for the future , " he said . <p> Galbraith , who was elected president at the June AGM , also acknowledged that the manner in which the JCC came to decisions was sometimes a handicap to the decision-making process which involves often non-functioning commissions which were established to address socio-economic issues that arise in the society . The commissions include Family Life , Youth , Evangelism , Christian and Social Witness . <p> " Many challenges facing the church and society ideally should not be addressed at executive meetings . These issues are discussed at commissions . The problem is that the commissions do n't meet frequently . There is no scheduled meeting time , so they decide when to meet , but the representatives either are n't named or do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " However , I intend to solve this problem by using encouragement , persuasion , and getting the churches to look at the persons they name to the commissions . If we can get the commissions to function as they should we will be on target . This is a challenge facing the JCC right now , " he said . <p> Apart from the homosexuality and buggery law , Rev Galbraith sited several other issues of concern to the JCC and which would get his attention during his tenure . These include the proliferation of gambling , the welfare and well-being of the nation 's children , and the Tivoli inquiry , which he fully supports and hopes for adequate compensation for those who suffered in the incursion . <p> In relation to the protection and well being of the nation 's children , the JCC president was worried about the breakdown of family life , a cause of the ills affecting children .

It is a collection of thoughtful reflections on the Caribbean condition ; visionary and inspirational addresses to diplomats and graduating university students ; and moving accounts of experiences that are shaping today 's Caribbean . <p> The book is no ordinary collection of thoughts , ideas , protests and urgings . Each of its offerings is written in uplifting prose ; every sentence crafted to convey images and messages that are compelling ; the book is English literature at its finest . <p> The topics in the book are varied , reflecting a long life in the Caribbean ; the interests of a man who is poet and writer ; a lover of cricket ; executive in the sugar industry and a consummate West Indian , born in Trinidad of Antigua and St Kitts ancestry , grew up in Trinidad and Antigua , earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davis Cup tennis team , and worked most of his adult life in Guyana .

In A Cloud of Witnesses , he tells the story that a black girl , born in England of West Indian parentage , wrote asking him about his experience as a member of a minority so that she could compare their respective situations . He says an amazing fact quickly dawned on him : " I searched my memory all the way from my childhood and youth in Trinidad and Antigua throughout my life in Guyana and much travelling in all the West Indies . and I could think of absolutely no occasion when I had experienced discrimination or even ill will because of the colour of my skin .

He also remembers with satisfaction that the Commission felt that , while these models were useful reference points , the West Indian model had its own intrinsic value . <p> " West Indians , " the report said , " offer a rare creation -- a people of many nationalities , many races @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have stayed together in a single community . <p> McDonald asserts his own belief in the value of the West Indian model . Nonetheless , he is practical enough to " pray because I think we will need some heavenly blessing in a hard task ... but in the end I profoundly believe because I think we already hold enough in common to secure an undivided future together " . <p> His profound belief does not prevent him from being " disillusioned with the pettifogging gradualism that the word Caricom is rapidly coming to stand for " . <p> " All of our small countries , " he says , " simply have to make ourselves bigger very soon -- enlarge our domestic market , broaden our technological base , combine our financial resources , increase the scale of opportunity for our ambitious young people , bring together behind one frontier the marvellous common cultural strains that exist in the West Indies side-by-side but apart -- apart and therefore more vulnerable to outside cultural impact .

Of the high-sounding declarations , he laments that they are " declarations of futility " . <p> Let me not convey the impression that McDonald 's book is only about the nobility and importance of West Indian-ness and the necessity to consolidate its value ; it is much more . It is rich in description of the things that mean much to us as individuals , such as the ageing and death of our parents -- " the signs of their ageing threatened my contentment ... Intellectually I knew they were not immortal but now I saw that it was true " . <p> The book conjoins cricket with poetry not only in capturing the superlative stroke play of Rohan Kanhai and Vivian Richards ; the genius of Frank Worrell ; and the artistry of Garfield Sobers and Brian Lara , but the essence of what cricket means to every West Indian -- " truly , cricket is supremely an imaginative possession which binds our Caribbean Community together ...

" And , " It may be too late for the Church to ignore scientific progress . " <p> But Dr White 's real goal is neither defending scientific ' progress ' nor exposing what he considers to be the ' anti-progressive ' nature of religion/Christianity , as such . It is to establish " the scientific basis of homosexuality " , something which other kinds of scientists are far more qualified to pronounce upon than a physical scientist/engineer have no firm agreement on , even among the anti-religion set . <p> And where might science be racing to in its progress ? <p> The scientific method of the natural sciences has delivered the most astounding progress in human understanding of the natural world . And , from that understanding , the most spectacular technological achievements that humankind has ever known ; and all in the last three and a half centuries or so . The temptation to worship science is great , and is very often yielded to . <p> But the very technical achievements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disaster . For the first time in human history , human action , through technology , has the potential of destroying human survival on the planet . <p> Worship of science <p> Engineer White is bound to the pre-World War II Age of Optimism by the chains of Scientism , the worship of science . A lot of very thoughtful people have moved on to confront the harsh realities of the science-created present and the threats of the future . What the world needs now more than anything else , if it is to survive , is wisdom , traditionally the purview of philosophy and religion , both of which White , the technician , crudely dismisses . <p> Science is replete with its own pet prejudices , bigotry and religious zealotry . At its epistemological core , science , as preached by many practitioners and bandwagon believers , operates on two weak assumptions : The reductionist view that reality is purely material , the interplay of matter and energy ; and that the only way of truly knowing is by ' scientific method ' . <p> All of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of reality beyond the material . Science has been quite glibly willing to dismiss the mountain of evidence of non-material reality in defence of its own pet prejudice and in a deliberate and concerted effort to get rid of ' god ' and the supernatural , which might be more properly described as the ' othernatural ' rather than the ' supernatural ' . <p> But , as science progresses , everywhere at the frontiers some of its most able practitioners are meeting Othernatural mind . In the behaviour of matter at the ultra micro level . In the outer reaches of the Cosmos . In the ultrafine intricacies of life . And at the frontiers of the human mind itself . The deep prejudice is that if they persist long enough they will get past these very obvious and embarrassing outcrops of othernaturalness and generate purely natural-material explanation for all phenomena . <p> And as science progresses , it is forced to abandon its most cherished truth claims in endless revisionism . Any claim to be any kind of ultimate source of truth is patently ridiculous and a massive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory is currently under pressure are climate change and epigenetics . The certitude of global warming , and with it climate change from human action , dogmatically defended , and supported by deception now exposed , is being challenged by counterdata and may not be rescued even by presidential decree . <p> We once ' knew ' , from third-form biology up , that inheritance could only happen through the genes encoded by DNA in the nuclei of cells . We now know through epigenetics that the genome dynamically responds to the environment , with factors like stress , diet , behaviour , toxins and other stimuli activating and deactivating chemical switches that regulate gene expression . <p> A scientific study has appeared in my email inbox . ' Sex-specific epigenetic disruption and behavioural changes following low-dose in utero bisphenol A exposure ' , out of the Department of Psychology of Columbia University . The study is proposing that exposure to a particular chemical widely present in plastics , even at low dose , could epigenetically affect sexual behaviour , or orientation . <p> So engineer Patrick White may have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite the point he thought he had that it 's in the genes and is therefore ' natural ' . The Bible has othernatural epigenetic stories in it which were once the butt of scientific derision and an embarrassment to ' scientific ' Christians . <p> Scientific dogmatism insists that the only real way of knowing is through scientific method , which has worked enormously well in the ' natural ' sciences . Anchored in the positivism of Auguste Comte , the social ' sciences ' have struggled to ape scientific method as the only legitimate way of knowing and are now facing an epistemological existential crisis . <p> Some of the deepest insights into human nature have not come from any ' science ' but from art . In the case of literature , for example , character in great and enduring texts probe and expose human nature in ways that no artificially contrived ' social science ' can . <p> Indeed , literature is considered great and enduring precisely when it does this best . Shakespeare lives not because he was the most technically accomplished playwright but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture of this understanding in his characters . <p> And even if the Bible can be debunked as some holy book of othernatural revelation , some of its most thoughtful critics , from George Bernard Shaw to our own late John Hearne , recognise in it stretches of truly great literature . The consummate poetry of Isaiah , for example , which it is to be hoped even engineers can appreciate , ranks with the finest in world literature . And we would do well to humbly heed its theological lessons and prophetic warnings in a world where things are very obviously falling apart ( Isaiah 24 ) , despite science and also on account of the triumph of science without wisdom - a pyrrhic victory . <p> defending the dogma of evolution <p> Nowhere is scientific dogmatism more evident than in the obsessive-compulsive defence of the cherished dogma of evolution . Engineer White would have us to know that Darwin 's ' Theory of Evolution by Natural Selection ' " enabled mankind , for the first time , to understand how life developed and why it is now diverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , " Although this battle is still not over , defeat of the religious alternative is already in sight . " <p> A key reason why science is apparently winning this fight is its suppression and persecution of alternative views which , in method and ruthlessness , would have made the mediaeval Church proud . <p> Taking science on its own ground , no hypothesis of origins can be established by scientific method because it simply can not be tested , a key requirement of validating hypotheses . Origin , whether of matter or of life , is a unique , one-off , non-replicable event of the distant past without human witnesses . Scientific method proceeds by examining replicable phenomena for attaining reliable and valid results . In matters of origins , we all ultimately stand on a platform of faith . <p> The only rational , purely natural ' scientific ' position is that we , conscious and self-reflective human beings , find ourselves here . We do not know where we came from . We do not know why we are here . We do not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these critical existential questions . And science can assign no value to human life . The object can not value itself . Value is derived from being valuable to another . <p> The only reasonable options to this crisis of being are to go mad like Nietzsche , endure life like the Greek Stoics and Cynics , or to end it . I am only prepared to grant any significant credibility to the atheistic-materialistic views of the Patrick Whites of this world when many more of them deliver their nihilistic testaments as suicide notes . <p> Religion , and Christianity in particular , has often been its own worst enemy in the contrived conflict with science . The Bible is not a science text and was not intended to be . The pronouncements of the mediaeval Roman Catholic Church upon cosmology which led to its ' routing ' by Copernicus and Galileo , over which Patrick White now gloats , had no warrant in data sources available to the Church . <p> Mediaeval Catholicism must not and can not be construed to be the universal voice of Christianity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all times . But the Bible does make earth-centric , human-centric declarations of origins which science has no methodological tools whatsoever to refute or to propose scientifically reliable and valid alternatives . Let the faiths contend . <p> Furthermore , religion has strained too hard to be ' scientific ' rather than contesting , on solid **29;320;TOOLONG grounds , the pompous and pontifical claims of science to be the grand purveyor of truth . <p> As powerful and productive as they have been , science and scientific method are not without boundaries of competence to define and to examine reality . Trespassing outside those boundaries is definitely not scientific , and bluff and bluster by the doctors , priests and quacks of science can not change that simple fact . 
@@4593238 @ @ @ Thank you , Nelson Mandela <p> GIVEN his extreme frailty of mind and body , whether Nelson Mandela , the global freedom fighter icon , lives or dies any day soon , two things are a certainty : he is not afraid of dying ; and when death finally comes , a great part of his legacy to the world will be a solid body of ideas culled from his textured experience of life in the supremely racist polity of his pre-1994 native South Africa about building democracy while maintaining the principles of human dignity and human rights . <p> In this regard , he will join the gallery of the greatest leaders of thought on a mass scale in the 20th century , which includes Dr Martin Luther King Jr , Marcus Mosiah Garvey , and Mahatma Gandhi . <p> To the man the world most admires , violent resistance to the ' violence ' of dispossession and injustice that took cover under democracy in his country had always been a staple in the fight for freedom . As such , his pledge to suffer the supreme sacrifice in the face of persistent obscenity was a reflection of the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Congress ( ANC ) was not going to be abandoned if the conditions which first gave rise to its creation prevailed . This became clear after his release from 27 years of imprisonment on a life sentence for alleged terrorist activities against the racist regime of South Africa . <p> It was a defiant Mandela , surrounded by his people on the steps of City Hall in Cape Town , who declared to the world on Sunday , February 11 , 1989 , the immortal words : <p> " I have fought against white domination and I have fought against black domination . I have cherished the idea of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunity . It is an ideal I hope to live for and to achieve . But if needs be , it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die . " <p> Whether the conditions at the time referred to the Group Areas Act , the Lands Act , the Population Registration Act , or the general disenfranchisement of the mass of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was prepared to continue plotting the demise of the barriers of oppression . <p> This had become necessary in the context where , despite his own release and the relegitimising of the ANC by the then White Government of South Africa , he still could not vote , live wherever he wanted , or buy property wherever he would have liked . <p> Much of this reality crystalised his views that even in ' freedom ' there resides in the recesses of the human psyche the obscenities of racism which , as people of African descent in the New World know , has been central to the history of humankind for 500 years and more . The South African experience of Apartheid merely stood as the tip of the iceberg ; and Mandela came to realise that the bulk of prejudice , discrimination , and stereotypical thinking lies in submarine fortresses at the ready to sink any Titanic of hope . <p> He felt that to pretend that the correlation between continuing poverty , dispossession , psychic despair , and social marginalisation on the one hand , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not persist as an active principle of social and political organisation in today 's world is to live in a fool 's paradise . <p> And so , faced with this reality , the best loved man on planet Earth set about redoubling his effort to demonstrate to the world that the talent , will , and commitment existed to shape , maintain and refine a genuinely non-racial democratic South African society . But to achieve this , it was first necessary to break down the walls and dismantle Apartheid -- in the way that the Berlin Wall was dismantled -- as a condition of peaceful co-existence . <p> Mandela 's greatness was demonstrated in this struggle by his ability to forge statesmanship , leadership and street-wise insight into power-sharing at a time when blacks wanted total revolution . He did this while teaching his people that maintaining their freedom and consolidating the capabilities to take it beyond the one-person-one-vote reality could not be taken for granted , because mass democratisation in this narrow political sense does not necessarily mean genuine power to the people . <p> Consequently , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which caused some sources in the United States to mistakenly refer to his " socialistic orientation " . The father of modern South Africa understood , however , that unless blacks in his country had the power to decide in the crucible of political action how the material resources were to be mobilised , there would be no real change , or peace , in the power relations between Blacks and Whites . <p> Thanks to Nelson Mandela 's insight , wisdom , courage and sacrifice , change has come to South Africa -- even if not of the type strictly envisioned by the man who now lies critically ill in hospital , having lived a very long and stressful life . <p> For , by any standard , South Africa today is a post-Apartheid success story , notwithstanding the 15 million people living on less than ? 1.50 a day . <p> Twenty years after Mandela was elected president , millions of blacks have entered the middle class , and whites have grown much richer than they were under Apartheid . The country 's GDP now stands at ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland combined , and a third of the rest of sub-Saharan Africa . <p> But although many black South Africans have made good use of the Government 's Black Economic Empowerment ( BEE ) policy Mandela , in his very last interview around the time of his 90th birthday , was very critical of the record of his successor , Thabo Mbeki , and the ANC Government . <p> To him , the dismantling of Apartheid in its formal legal sense was one thing . But more important , in his opinion , was the need to follow this by its dismantling in its deeper psychological sense , because he feared that without this , Apartheid , if allowed to remain on the agenda , could help in further cementing Black mental submission and cowardice . <p> For Mandela , the freedom from fear is as much part of the responsibility of the Blacks as it is of the Whites in South Africa . This was the reason why a large part of his repeated invocation of self-discipline was meant to have profound implications for those who eventually took hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He remained disappointed , for instance , that the high incidence of black-on-black crime among the youths , albeit a correlate of economic dispossession , was never sufficiently contained . He believed that only the Blacks themselves could prevent this . <p> Politics and economics will have to work in creative tension to bring about the kind of society Mr Mandela and his successors say they want for South Africa . This creative fusion will demand more than a reliance on having political power through electoral politics . Economic ownership and control , Mandela tell us , is as much about human dignity and human rights as it is about the fight to determine where the surplus from the exploitation of natural resources goes . <p> If nature is allowed to take its normal course , Mr Mandela will soon depart this life . In recognition of this , it is important for his legatees to understand that in the same way his release from imprisonment did not signify the freedom of all oppressed South Africans , so too his departure will not mean the end of the struggle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have left an enormous and inspiring legacy for his people and the world of reconciliation , genuine human sacrifice , forgiveness , love , and the invincibility of the human spirit , which , if adopted by humankind , can have remarkable results . <p> Thank you , Nelson Mandela for being just who you are . <h> ADVERTISEMENT <p> POST A COMMENT <p> HOUSE RULES <p> 1 .

What , if anything , should the rest of the world do about the tragedy in Egypt ? The same question has been hanging in the air about the even greater Syrian tragedy for well over a year now , and it is starting to come up again in Iraq as well . <p> All three of the biggest countries in the heart of the Arab world are now in a state of actual or incipient civil war . The death toll in the Syrian civil war last month was 4,400 people . More than 1,000 people were killed by bombs and bullets last month in Iraq , the bloodiest month in the past five years . And at least 1,000 people have been killed in Egypt in the past week , the vast majority of them unarmed civilians murdered by the army . <p> You will note that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the sort of weasel-word formula that the media use when they do not want to offend powerful friends . Let 's be plain : the Egyptian army is deliberately massacring supporters of the democratically elected Muslim Brotherhood government that it overthrew last June ( whom it now brands as ' terrorists ' ) in order to terrorise them into submission . <p> The ' deep state ' is coming back in Egypt , and the useful idiots who now believe that the army is on their side , the secular democrats of the left and the opportunistic Noor Party on the religious right , will in due course find themselves back in the same old police stations , being tortured by the same old goons . So , should outsiders just stand by and watch it all happen ? <p> US Stance <p> The inaction of the United States ( US ) is linked to two causes . First , the only major leverage at Barack Obama 's disposal , cancelling the annual US$1.3 billion in aid that Washington gives to the Egyptian army , is no threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably increased , by the rich and conservative Arab monarchies of the Gulf that heartily approve of the Egyptian army 's coup . <p> Second , Washington remains transfixed by the notion that its alliance with Egypt is important for American security . This hoary myth dates back to the long-gone days when the US depended heavily on importing oil from the Gulf , and almost all of it had to pass through Egypt 's Suez Canal . Today , less than 10 per cent of the oil burned in America comes from the Middle East , and new domestic production from fracking is shrinking that share even further . <p> Even if Obama understood that Egypt is not a vital American strategic interest and ended US military aid to the country , it would only be a gesture ( although a desirable one ) . The International Monetary Fund has already broken off talks on a large new loan to Egypt , and the European Union is talking about cutting aid to the country , but there are no decisive measures available to anybody outside the Arab world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intervention <p> There will be no major military intervention in Syria either , although outside countries both within the Arab world and beyond it will continue to drip-feed supplies to their preferred side . And the Iraqi government 's request last Friday for renewed US military aid to stave off renewed civil war there has no hope of success . Getting involved again militarily in Iraq would be political suicide for Obama . <p> So what 's left of the Arab spring ? On the face of it , not much . Tunisia , where the first democratic revolution started three years ago , still totters forward , and there is more democracy in Morocco than there used to be , but that 's about it . The non-violent democratic revolutions that have worked so well in many other parts of the world are not doing very well in the Arab world . <p> There may be many reasons for this , but one stands out above all the others .

During its deliberations , a common feature was the view expressed by members that the national awards have lost their prestige and that the current system was not working . <p> Without a doubt , we believe that the nationalhonours and awards give the society a platform from which to acknowledge the contribution of citizens to the process of nation building.We , however , ca n't help but feel that many of the awards are still being given to reward friendship , political work and to seek endorsement from members of the business class . <p> The Gavel casts no aspersions on the character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honours .

Transportation was poor and the Rio Minho posed a threat since there was no bridge to facilitate safe crossing . There was also a shortage of labour for the nearby sugar plantations in Vere and therefore , in 1845 , East Indians were imported in order to provide an adequate and dependable labour force .

@@4608234 <h> GUYS too much testosterone can shrivel the testicles <p> TESTOSTERONE is very important to the growth , development and sexual health of men .

But you do have to be careful because with the use of the testosterone injections and to an extent if the testosterone levels are high , then what will happen is that it feeds back on the brain and causes reduced production and that in turn causes shrivelling of the testicles .

It is in this light that I wish to use the next few lines to articulate an alternative model to agriculture as an immediate growth pole to ease the burden of so many Jamaicans who are desperately looking for work . <p> Historically , almost all industrial countries have developed their agricultural sector as the base for driving early growth and then made the transformation from an agrarian society to an industrial one .

It has the potential to do so . <p> subsistence level <p> At present , the vast majority of farmers in Jamaica are engaged at the subsistence level .

The country 's promotion agency needs to target wealthy farmers overseas and show them the tremendous opportunities in the sector and invite them to come in and make investments similar to what we have done in the tourism and ICT sectors . This transformation will see persons from peasant farms working on larger acreages and earning a better income , while having their own cultivation to complement their wages .

@@4608239 <h> Columns <h> Promoting and enforcing the rule of law <p> This is Part 2 of a call for Jamaica to support the inclusion of Access to Justice and the Rule of Law on the post-2015 UN 's development agenda and as a goal . Part 1 appeared in the Daily Observer of Tuesday , October 29 , 2013 . <p> Rule of law as source of cross-sectoral development <p> The rule of law is a major source of sustainable economic development . It guarantees accountability , predictability and transparency in governance . Thus , adherence to these principles protects business confidence , attracts investments and ensures respect for and enforcement of property rights and freedoms . The World Development Report 1997 , The State in a Changing World , outlined their findings that unpredictability and inconsistent changes in law and policy affect negatively on the feeling of security of investment , property and environment . The lack of credibility also reduces investments , growth and the return on development projects . The report also illustrated that , " investment suffers because entrepreneurs choose not to commit resources in highly uncertain and volatile environments ... in a low-credibility environment , growth suffers ... the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also the environment for implementation of development projects " . Likewise , governments ' credibility can undermine private investment , as private investors are more inclined to invest in countries where there are sound , rational rules of the game . <p> Recently , Professor Tommy Koh , ambassador-at-large in Singapore 's Ministry of Foreign Affairs , in applying the Singapore development model , highlighted that a strong rule of law , zero tolerance for corruption , human capacity development and a business-friendly economy , are crucial strategies to achieve economic growth and sustainable development in Jamaica . While I do not embrace the one-size-fit-all approach , I concur with Professor Koh 's strategies . I further advocate , however , for endogenous development of the law , its processes and reform , which are more effective when demanded locally , law being viewed as a cognitive institution . The demand of citizens for performance from their " duty-bearers " in government drives effectiveness and accountability . It follows also that policymakers prioritise and invest in human capacity development . Rule of law development expertise should be encouraged and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should gradually fade . This is especially necessary in light of the current IMF deal and the conditional reforms it facilitates . <p> Economic development , interconnectedness and hybrid agenda <p> There is a great connection between economic growth and pro-poor or poverty reduction . Economic growth tends to reduce poverty . Openness and outward trade help reduce poverty through their effect on growth of institutions , capacities and communications . Research has shown that an increase in the rate of per capita GDP growth will translate into 1-for-1 increase in the average income of the poorest 40 per cent . In other words , GDP growth is forceful in reducing poverty , especially for the poorest of the population . There is also recognition that poverty is not only the lack of material goods and opportunities , such as employment and ownership of assets , but also involves lack of social goods , such as health care , social benefits and democratic freedoms . <p> Likewise , there is a high correlation between the wealth of a country and the rule of law , as illustrated from East Asian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are increased demands for a stronger legal system , which results in reforms . This creates a push and pull factor , facilitates a stronger legal system and results in economic development and growth . I support a hybrid agenda , which is a mixture of pro-poor ( building democratic freedoms ) and pro-growth ( economic and institutional capacity building ) approaches , capacity-building programmes and policies , both of which are mutually reinforcing . Development is freedom and democratic governance is an independent causal factor that improves economic performance . Likewise , market-based economic growth , facilitated by increased private sector trade and investment , through creation of a market friendly environment , is likely to lead to greater democracy . This agenda aims at reinforcing the importance of and need to strengthen the link between economic growth and democratic governance . Thus , while the government focuses on economic development , other policies should concurrently be created to legally empower the poor and strengthen freedoms . <p> Institutional capacity development and rule of law <p> Professor Dani Rodrik and IMF advisor Arvind Subramanian , in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does and does not mean ) , noted that institutions play a central role in dealing with property rights and the rule of law . The quality institutions that guarantee economic development and stability , as they argued , are not only those that create markets , but those that sustain their growth , through regulation , stabilisation and legitimisation . Likewise , regarding the rule of law , the institutions of focus are institutions that provide for and are involved in the administration , planning , co-ordination , training , monitoring , and evaluation of the justice sector and legal services , inclusive of legal aid for the poor . These institutions should be equipped and their capacity built to operate with a great level of transparency , rationality , accountability and predictability , to ensure national development . Bureaucracy should be kept as minimal as possible and , where possible , discretion fettered to prevent the underlying governance failure called corruption . Clear rules , law reform , processes and application should reduce discretion , thus , distorting the public officials ' cost-benefit assessment and lowering the opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The cumulative effect of these measures is likely to reduce corruption and/or its perception . <p> To secure sustainable economic development and growth , through embracing , promoting and adhering to the rule of law , the Jamaican Government could consider establishing a Rule of Law Sustainability and Development Unit , possibly , in the Attorney General 's Chambers , the hub of rule of law promotion in the nation , or create it as a division in an existing unit in the Ministry of Justice . <p> Time for action <p> As James A Goldston , executive director of the Open Society Justice Initiative , in Arguments : New Rules for the Rule of Law , profoundly noted , the time has come where the concept of the rule of law is " ... capable of commanding consensus in a divided world " . He also posited , " ... the recent ... turn to the rule of law is an unparalleled opportunity to strengthen human rights , advance human development , and help bridge the often yawning gap between the rights and development worlds " . He advocates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reject the false perception of the existence of different rule of laws . By this , it would dispel the commonly held , yet incorrect perception of a different rule of law promotion " abroad " by donors , from the search for it " at home " . Furthermore , a united stance on the rule of law should mitigate or remove any perceived " double standards in the application of the rule of law " . <p> The aftermath of the recent signing of the Social Partnership Agreement of Jamaica warrants action to bring to fruition this symbolic and significant commitment . Specifically , adherence to the rule of law ( and timely justice outcomes ) is one of the priority areas . Actions , such as those I have recommended , are crucial moves toward the country 's sustained development .

@@4613231 <h> Chinese investment improving sugar industry <p> In Aubyn Hill 's article , ' Chinese investment improving sugar industry ' , in the Financial Gleaner on Friday , the following sentence should have read , " PCS was advised that their first CEO was not the best choice to oversee the transition from GOJ to Chinese ownership . " <p> The sugar divestment team which I led from December 2005 to October 2011 concluded the divestment of the Government of Jamaica-owned ( GOJ ) sugar assets in two phases . The first set of asset transfer was achieved in July 2009 when Everglades and Seprod bought and leased the assets at Long Pond and Hampden , and at Golden Grove , respectively . <p> The second and much larger package of sugar assets , which include those at Frome , Monymusk , and Bernard Lodge estates in Westmoreland , Clarendon and St Catherine were sold and leased to the Chinese government-owned COMPLANT International Sugar Company which established the wholly-owned Jamaican company , Pan Caribbean Sugar Company Limited ( PCS ) . The local company owns the assets and manage the affairs of the business . COMPLANT group operates sugar businesses in various African countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which built the GOJ-owned conference centre in Montego Bay . <p> The divestment team and its secretariat , housed at the Development Bank of Jamaica ( DBJ ) , searched far and wide to finally settle on COMPLANT as the eventual investor . Our search invitations were carried in TheWall Street Journal , The Economist , the two local daily newspapers and two single-purpose websites . Prospective investors from Brazil , the United States , Canada , and Italy showed various levels of interest . <p> In the end , it was the Chinese which displayed the depth and consistency of interest , the necessary long-term view and financial capacity to take on the significant challenges that Frome , Monymusk , and Bernard Lodge estates and factories presented . The Chinese longer view on the opportunities of producing sugar in a world with an ever-increasing population gave them the right perspective to follow the Jamaican investors , who showed the same kind of economic and strategic vision a year earlier . <p> Large investments were contracted <p> The sugar assets divestment team was careful to codify in contract the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assets it acquired in the divestment exercise . Both sides agreed that PCS would invest a minimum of US$156 million within four years of acquiring the assets . A large portion of the investment would be used to revitalise existing cane fields and bring land left in fallow for decades back into cultivation . <p> Substantial sums were earmarked to renovate operations in the factories and put in major new equipment such as boilers , centrifugal baskets and cane conveyor systems . Cane transport , sugar storage and bagging mechanical equipment were slated for improvement and investment in intensive upgrades . <p> I am reliably informed that Pan Caribbean Sugar has invested more than US$200 million in its estates and factories in the less than two and a half years since it took over management of the three properties . This investment is well above the amount in their contract with the GOJ . In July this year , PCS announced that it had already invested US$160 million in its estates and factories - a month before the halfway mark of the four-year deadline it was obliged to meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the parties limited the number of foreign nationals PCS could bring into Jamaica and even enumerated which categories of employees could be brought in to Jamaica . There were also relevant clauses dealing with the training of Jamaicans in various disciplines by PCS foreign experts . <p> Since taking over management of the Frome , Monymusk and Bernard Lodge estates , PCS 's Chinese employees have shown an admirable work ethic from which Jamaicans can learn , and apparently the latter are learning . PCS was advised that their first CEO was not the best choice to oversee the transition from GOJ to Chinese ownership . That advice has proven to be sound and after many missteps , and a needlessly acrimonious relationship with the current minister of agriculture , he was removed from the post and from the COMPLANT Group . <p> Everyone who deals with PCS 's new CEO , " Harry " Wu , speaks of his reasoned , calm professional approach to managing the affairs and people relationships of the company . Harry is a member of that new professional group of Chinese who are populating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Chinese ambassador to Jamaica , who was trained in China and at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University in the United States of America , Harry Wu was trained in China , Hong Kong , Britain and Canada and has managed much bigger businesses than PCS - inside and out of China . <p> He will need all that training and experience to convert the assets of his three estates and factories into a perennially profitable business enterprise . Luckily for him , he has the necessary resources and relationships to succeed . <p> Moral hazard avoided <p> I was acutely aware of what economists call ' moral hazard ' , because of my experience at Air Jamaica where I worked as an unpaid consultant ( by choice ) from December 2004 to about September 2005 . In late 2004 , the then majority owners of Air Jamaica handed back the company with its many tens of billions of dollars in losses to the GOJ , simply because the GOJ was a minority shareholder in what was seen to be a " national treasure " . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burdened with moral hazard - acting as insurer of last resort for the company 's debts - even though it was a minority shareholder . The sugar divestment team members and I made a commitment , in line with government objectives and policies , that we would make every effort to ensure that the sugar divestment was done in such a way that the GOJ would not own a single share and , as much as was possible , avoid selling all the assets to one party . Those two objectives were achieved and moral hazard avoided . <p> Also , by splitting the assets among three new owners , the divestment team ensured that a single owner would not be able to bring inordinate political or commercial pressure on the GOJ . This kind of pressure would surface especially just before a general election , as was done in the past . Pressure is timed in order to extract special benefits , or to burden the Government with a kind of non-ownership moral hazard in order to get fearful , weak or opportunistic politicians to cave into a powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the GOJ , the divestment team also defused significantly the power of unions to put unreasonable pressure - similar to that on an unreasonable single owner - on a government that respond so delicately when it is threatened with a loss or workers ' job or votes . Owners with clear commercial objectives can and do respond more robustly to union power . <p> These new ownership changes which exclude the GOJ , and with the very substantial investments being put in by the privately owned Jamaican companies and the Chinese government-owned Pan Caribbean Sugar Company , the Jamaican sugar industry is finally getting the managerial skills and investment dollars to make it prosper into the long term . This revitalised sugar industry can now provide sustainable jobs and profits . <p> Aubyn Hill is the CEO of Corporate Strategies Limited and was an international banker for more than 25 years Email : writerhill@gmail.com Twitter : @HillAubynFacebook : **33;251;TOOLONG

@@4613239 <h> The music of Mandela and freedom <p> Nelson Mandela , the world 's greatest living humanitarian , finally received his divine reward on December 5 , 2013 . <p> No longer of this mortal toil , he journeyed across the pale to eternal rejoinder with God where he was n't greeted as ' Nelson ' , the English name given to him at nine years old by a Methodist primary-school teacher in Qunu , South Africa ( all schoolchildren were given ' English ' Christian names foreigners would find easier to pronounce ) ; not as ' Rolihlahla ' , his correct Xhosa birth name whose literal meaning is ' pulling the branch of a tree ' , but has the colloquial meaning ' troublemaker ' ( prophecy ? ) ; nor was he greeted as ' Madiba ' , his clan name as Father of The Nation . <p> None of those names seemed appropriate anymore . <p> As he joined together with his heavenly Father for all eternity , he was greeted by the name most closely associated with his life 's work and his current being . God simply said , " Welcome , Freedom . " <p> Nelson Mandela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black South Africans ' freedom from apartheid ( pronounced ' Apart hate ' ) , but more than that , he fought for black South Africans ' freedom from hate . He fought for white South Africans to remain a vital part of the nation . He fought for all South Africans ' freedom from fear ; fear of each other ; fear of the past ; fear of the future . He fought for a colour-blind South Africa . In his grandchildren 's generation , he succeeded . <p> In this effort and gradual success , he surpassed another great 20th-century humanitarian , Mahatma Gandhi . Gandhi succeeded in driving the British out of India , but his ultimate dream , for which he lived and died , was for a united India with Muslims and Hindus sharing one country in peace and harmony . The dream crashed and burned and he was assassinated for these ideals of religious tolerance . The Muslims broke away and formed their own nation , Pakistan . So far , Mandela 's work has prevented this from happening in South Africa . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Mandela and his life work that he recognised at an early stage how important sport and culture could be in freeing an oppressed people and then uniting a nation . Much has been said about his being a boxer in his youth , but he wrote in his autobiography : <p> " I did not enjoy the violence of boxing so much as the science of it . I was intrigued by how one moved one 's body to protect oneself , how one used a strategy both to attack and retreat , how one paced oneself over a match . <p> " Boxing is egalitarian . In the ring , rank , age , colour and wealth are irrelevant ... . I never did any real fighting after I entered politics . My main interest was in training ; I found the rigorous exercise to be an excellent outlet for tension and stress . After a strenuous workout , I felt both mentally and physically lighter . " <p> He famously said ( in Monaco in 2000 ) : " Sport has the power to change the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was during the 1995 Rugby World Cup on which Mandela spent much of his political capital with South African blacks by refusing to allow his government to ban the springbok logo for the rugby team despite it being one of the most appalling symbols of apartheid-era oppression . <p> The South African rugby team was n't among the favourites for the Cup . They were n't even expected to survive the first round of games . However , Mandela made a huge personal contribution , which included befriending the white team captain and literally willing the team to win the Cup . <p> The seminal scene of the first black president of South Africa presenting the World Cup to the white rugby team captain , whose position and emblem he had defended against his own African National Congress ( ANC ) party wishes , in one fell swoop convinced all of South Africa that this man was serious . It became obvious that he was n't a black president . He was a South African president . Once again he had used sport to teach egalitarianism - the lesson he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's another little-known fact that Mandela also recognised the power of music and used it throughout his life and struggles to achieve his objectives . He said : " Music is a great blessing . It has the power to elevate and liberate us . It sets people free to dream . It can unite us to sing with one voice . Such is the value of music . " <p> His 27 years in prison was an inspiration to musicians all over the world , and his vision was kept alive by music . The prison walls would reverberate with nightly singing by Mandela and his fellow inmates . Meanwhile , Mandela 's legend grew through freedom songs written everywhere . <p> Sidebar : People ask me if I look up the lyrics of the songs I quote . Almost never . I can remember every lyric of every song I heard 50 years ago . I ca n't remember what I did this morning . If I have a temporary memory block , I simply reach for the record from my extensive vinyl collection and play it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time ( at last ) , I 've been forced to look up the lyrics of a song . <p> Nkosi Sikeleli Africa <p> Malup hakanyiswu phondolwayo <p> Yiswa imithanda zo yethu <p> Nkosi Sikelela <p> Thina lusapolwayo . <p> There 's more . Like me , you might need help with some of the lyrics , but nobody who lived during the 1960s and ' 70s while Mandela was fighting for a free South Africa and then incarcerated will ever forget this song , originally composed ( in Xhosa ) as a hymn in 1897 by Enoch Sontonga , a teacher at a Methodist mission school in Johannesburg . We hummed along and sang the chorus lustily . The song 's title literally translates to Lord Bless Africa or God Bless Africa . <p> It was the anthem of the pan-African struggle as well as the ANC 's struggle against apartheid . In various adaptations , including some parts English , it was adopted as the national anthem of five African nations and is still , since 1994 , a part of the South African national anthem . Mandela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , insisted on retaining the former national anthem , sung in Afrikaans and in English , as a part of the new mixed national anthem of the new South Africa . <p> Recording projects <p> Other songs , like Nangu Mandela by the legendary Miriam Makeba and Bring Back Nelson Mandela by Hugh Masekela , were rallying cries for the ANC . Hugh Masekela tells the story of his inspiration for the hugely successful song . After many years in prison , Mandela , one of the Masekela 's biggest fans , wrote a letter to Masekela in April 1985 ( for Masekela 's birthday ) and smuggled it out of Pollsmoor Prison to get to Masekela for the big day . <p> The letter congratulated Masekela on his career so far , wished him luck on his recording projects and encouraged him to keep up the good work . Masekela was so moved by the fact that a man who had suffered and was still suffering as Mandela could find the time to write to him with encouragement , he was inspired to put pen to paper . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to <p> Soweto . <p> I want to see him walking <p> down the streets of South Africa - tomorrow ! <p> Bring back Nelson Mandela . <p> Bring him back home to <p> Soweto . <p> I want to see him walking hand in hand <p> with Winnie Mandela . <p> Bring Back Nelson Mandela became another anthem for the ANC in its struggle against apartheid . <p> We can never forget how proud we felt , as Jamaicans , when our island led the international fight for Mandela 's freedom and against apartheid . Some of the best freedom music of the time came from little Jamaica . I do n't have to tell you that Burning Spear was a leader of this musical movement : <p> As the pressure grew , international stars threw concerts in support of Mandela 's freedom . British ska band The Specials ' 1984 hit protest song Free Nelson Mandela reached number nine in the UK charts . Fans smuggled it into South Africa where it was banned from airplay but enjoyed extensive play among the oppressed . This was a feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa on cassette or beamed in on illegal shortwave radio , while exiled nationals like Makeba and Masekela carried the message throughout the world . <p> In 1988 , a worldwide TV audience of 600 million watched a live broadcast of Mandela 's 70th birthday tribute concert at London 's Wembley Stadium , featuring the likes of Sting and George Michael . <p> In 1985 , Senegalese **26;180;TOOLONG Youssou N'Dour organised a major concert at Dakar 's Stade de l'Amiti ? to demand Mandela 's liberation .

@@4613240 <h> Columns <h> Pope Francis and social justice <p> SAINT Francis of Assisi introduced the practice of having replicas of nativity scenes at Christmas to the Christian world some 800 years ago . When Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio of Argentina was elected pope in March this year , he named himself after this man of Assisi in Italy . At the time of Pope Francis 's election earlier this year , he was asked which Francis he was naming himself after , Francis of Assisi or Francis Xavier , since the new pope is the first Jesuit ever to be pope . He replied that he was naming himself after Francis of Assisi . <p> As we approach Christmas , it is worthwhile to remember that Christians are sent to give the good news to the poor as seen in Isaiah 61 and Luke 4 . Indeed , the replica of the nativity scene should remind us that Jesus was born in stark poverty as a sign that he had come to uplift and empower the poor . <p> The media has , in the way it has publicised the teachings and statements of Pope Francis , given the impression that this is a novelty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so at all . <p> It was Pope John Paul who wrote in his encyclical Laborem Exercens ( On Human Labour ) reading from number 6 : " The ancient world introduced its own typical differentiation of people into classes according to the type of work done . Work that demanded from the worker the exercise of physical strength , the work of muscles and hands , was considered unworthy of free men , and was therefore given to slaves . By broadening certain aspects that already belonged to the Old Testament , Christianity brought about a fundamental change of ideas in this field , taking the whole content of the Gospel message as its point of departure , especially the fact that the one who , while being God , became like us in all things and devoted most of the years of his life on earth to manual work at the carpenter 's bench . " <p> Numerous popes have had the same theme , and the concept that the church should have preferential option for the poor is an integral part of Roman Catholic doctrine . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact is that he also wrote an encyclical along the lines of social justice . <p> In Jamaica , the Roman Catholic Church introduced the credit unions to Jamaica in 1941 . This would complement the service co-operatives established by the old Jamaica Welfare ( now Social Development Commission ) established by Norman Manley in 1937 . <p> The concept of a minimum wage became law in 1975 , on a resolution moved by then Prime Minister Michael Manley . It came straight from the encyclical Rerum Novarum ( Modern Trends ) . That encyclical was written by Pope Leo XIII some 122 years ago in 1891 . It spoke to the concept of a living wage . <p> The Manleys were voracious readers and indicated that they had read the social encyclicals of the popes . Had they been alive , although they were not Roman Catholics , they would have been the first to tell you that Pope Francis 's position is nothing new and that he is only following the tradition of the popes . <p> And the concept of ' worker participation ' , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ownership programme , ESOP ) , was requested by Pope John XXIII in his encyclicals Mater et Magistra ( Mother and Teacher , 1961 ) and Pacem en Terras ( Peace on Earth ) in 1963 . In his 1967 encyclical Populorum Progressio ( People 's progress ) the late Pope Paul Vl wrote that we should create a world where " the poor man Lazarus can sit down at the same table with the rich man " . <p> The Lord 's Supper is re-enacted in every Roman Catholic Mass called officially the Holy Eucharist . Our understanding of the Eucharist is that the consecrated bread and wine miraculously become the Body and Blood of Jesus Christ in each mass . In consuming the body and blood of Christ we are all nourished by Jesus , which makes us have a certain relationship to each other by blood . <p> We therefore become one regardless of race or class . And this is the real message of Christmas that we will celebrate six days from today . To believe this means to abhor oppression which has been meted out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a time when the words socialism ad communism were used interchangeably and the Roman Catholic Church , in attacking communism , made reference to socialism in the same vein . But the church has explained that , in accordance with the meaning of socialism today , Roman Catholics not only can be socialists , but should be if we mean by socialism the upliftment of the poor to the point where they control economies to control their destinies . <p> This was explained in a 1971 Vatican document entitled Justice in the World , and also in a pastoral letter to the Roman Catholic flock of he English-speaking Caribbean in 1975 entitled Justice and Peace in a New Caribbean . <p> And by the way , the Roman Catholic Church is opposed to three aspects of scientific socialism or communism . These are the denial of the existence of God , the insistence on class warfare , and the suppression of all types of private property . <p> In any case , how could the Roman Catholic Church ever be against the empowerment of the poor when it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could the Roman Catholic Church be against such concepts when the Roman Catholic Church set up credit unions in Jamaica and other parts of the world and built the first housing scheme in Jamaica at Homestead in Bamboo , St Ann , in the 1940s ? <p> Indeed , it is difficult for me to envision a church that does not think in this way because such a church would run contrary to the teachings of Jesus Christ . And it would certainly run contrary to the sharing of communion which , in my understanding as a Roman Catholic , is that the body and blood of Jesus Christ make us one by participation . <p> The third verse of O Holy Night is : " Truly , he taught us to love one another , His law is love and His Gospel is peace . Chains shall he break for the slave is our brother and in His name all oppression shall cease .
