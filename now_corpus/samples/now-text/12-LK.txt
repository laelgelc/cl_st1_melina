@@773234 <h> Sri Lankans In Search Of Royalty <p> Most Sri Lankans have a secret yearning to be a royal . This is probably because we are steeped in history with our glorified kings and queens despite all the current debates about equality , democracy , human rights etc . Only a few will admit to such secret yearnings such as the self proclaimed reincarnation of Dutu Gemunu of Kelaniya but most others if asked for their ancient lineage will not deny but shrug it off with an evasive : ' Aney just go men ' or ' pallayang bung ' . They like to be royal . <p> Royalty in the making <p> Statue of King Narendra Singhe , Statue of King Dutu Gemunu and Dr. Mervyn Silva starring as King Dutu Gemunu <p> Some political analysts are of the opinion that a potential Sri Lankan royalty is in the making .

But do they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges ?

If they could be real royals , they could be there for ever instead of being unceremoniously thrown out by irate masses after elections . True , kings and their families too could be thrown out by irate mobs but that happens very rarely . <p> Apply to be a royal ! <p> Browsing through Internet last week , we found out there are ways in which one -- even a Sri Lankan -- could be proclaimed a royal .

How many of Lanka royals could prove their ancestry and their blue royal blood ? Perhaps Mervyn Silva could . He is so cock sure . This column can not vouch for the authenticity of the claims made by the commission we cited on the Web because our experience is only the same as that of any internet reader , going through it for the first time .

This South Indian took the name of Sri Vijaya Raja Sinha and ruled from 1739 till 1747 . He was followed by three other Nayakkar kings the last being Sri Wickrema Raja Sinha who was also the last king of Sri Lanka having been captured by the British , taken to Madurai and dying in exile there . <p> King of Jaffna <p> An interesting claim to the Kingdom of Jaffna is being made on the internet by a person who describes himself as His Royal Highness Prince Remigius Kanagarajah , Head of the Royal House of Jaffna with his given address as : Rajadhoni , Nilayan , The Nethe lands .

@@773235 <h> Towards A Parliament Of The Streets And A Constituent Assembly <p> By : Surendra Ajit Rupasinghe <p> In the mid nineteen eighties , the Philippines was rocked by a sustained people 's resistance movement that finally deposed of the hated and corrupt dictator , Ferdinand Marcos , who had to flee the country in a US Air Force helicopter . The Catholic Church , representing the majority of the people , played a critical role in this dramatic change . The people 's uprising was catalysed by the defection of two key military officers- Enrile and Ramos , who occupied the office of the Defense Secretary . They called on the people to depose Ferdinand Marcos and declared that they stood for democratic reform . When Marcos tried to cordon the office and arrest them , Radio Veritas , run by the Church called on the people to defend the two army officers . The people rallied to the call en masse . Marcos deployed the armed forces to quell the rebellion , including tanks and riot squads . The people resisted . Nuns went on their knees and began praying and blocked the tanks . Women were in the forefront of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading rebellion , defying martial law . They took over the main radio station of the government and silenced Marcos . Finally , Marcos was deposed by the power of the people . The hatred for Marcos had reached explosive proportions due to the rot of corruption , arrogance and despotism . He had earned the wrath of the people due to the vast fortunes -- billions of dollars -that he , his wife , Imelda and his cronies , had robbed , while the majority of the masses lived in dire poverty . This glorious people 's uprising came to be named the " Parliament of the Streets " . However , the Parliament of the Streets failed to bring about radical democratic change in the Philippines due to the fact that the people 's resistance movement failed to dismantle the apparatus of Dictatorship- the State , and left the armed forces intact . They were not prepared for taking over state power . This is much the same as what has happened in the " Arab Spring " , where even though some changes in the composition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in power . The same ties of economic dependence remains and the poverty and misery of the masses continue- in the Philippines and in the " Arab Spring " . In Sri Lanka , we are moving towards such a political crisis . The Mahinda Rajapakse regime is increasingly facing the tribunal of the people for reeking corruption , arrogance and despotism . We are facing a situation where white vans abduct people within the court compound in broad daylight , where workers and fishermen are killed while engaging in peaceful democratic protest , where students are attacked by riot squads , arrested and hunted down in their homes in the dead of night . The regime is on trial for series of unaccounted abductions , extra-judicial killings , enforced disappearances , inhuman torture and alleged war crimes and barbaric atrocities . It is on trial for attacking and looting media institutions and killing journalists . It is facing the tribunal of the people for the gross abuse of power , rigging of elections , manipulating the Constitution and the Judiciary and violating the Rule of Law . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robbing their dignity , their livelihood and for enforcing military rule over the Tamil people in the North and East .

It is condemned for having brought shame and infamy to us all , and defiling our honour and dignity in the eyes of the world . This spiraling political crisis is compounded by an equally severe economic and financial crisis brought about by insatiable greed , wanton waste and sheer financial and economic mismanagement . ( Mihin Air-loss of 13 billion , Deyata Kirula-loss loss of 2 billion , Air Lanka-loss of 23 billion , IFFA cost 1 billion , Asian Games-loss of 1 billion ) . The cost of living is soaring . The Rupee is on a downward spiral and will continue to be devalued . Colossal amount of funds of the tax payers hard-earned money , have been invested in utterly wasteful grandiose schemes , on bloated foreign tamashas and spectacular victory parades intended to glorify the emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into an irrevocable and spiraling cycle of debt . State coffers have been bled dry and the Regime is bankrupted , forcing it to pile even more debt at exorbitant interest , while foreign marauding powers and international financial institutions sink their deadly fangs into the very lifelines of our economy . Seven star hotels and hospitals , super-highways , airports , sports stadiums , tourist havens and skyscrapers glitter the skyline . Luxurious spas , brothels and bars dot the landscape -- all to feed the appetites of robber barons , sex perverts , drug lords , speculators and gangsters that have no bearing on alleviating poverty and misery of the masses , but which accumulate vast fortunes for the ruling dynasty and its mafia cronies . This is the trajectory of the hybrid neo-liberal path of development pursued by the Regime , encapsulated in achieving the " Miracle of Asia " , which is but a path of highway robbery , corruption and reeking parasitism , a path of blood , pillage and plunder . This combination of a spiraling political crisis and economic-financial breakdown will heap even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and degradation , strain their limits of tolerance , searing through the veils of deception and illusion . Repression will only fuel the simmering rage . The recent JVP rally and the UNP-led Opposition rally were tear gassed and baton charged by the Police and then the Army . Yet , the UNP-led rally reassembled and held ground for hours . People , including observers from atop their apartment roofs , belted the police with stones . In time , the people will demand radical democratic change . They will mobilize to hold their Parliament of the Streets . The writing is on the Wall- if you care to read it ! The challenge is to ensure that the people 's resistance and rebellion will not result in the same dead end as in the Philippines and the " Arab Spring " . If a resolution in Geneva calling for an independent international investigation into alleged war crimes succeeds- and even if not- the government will respond by raising the banner of ' patriotic nationalism ' . Its social base among the Sinhala rural masses , the comprador mudalalis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claiming that the Western powers , the Tamil Diaspora and NGOs are all ganging up against the Regime , country and the people , and that the UNP-led Opposition and particularly the emerging new Left People 's Resistance Movement are all part of this ' conspiracy ' . We should not underestimate the effect such a propaganda war will have on the broad chauvinist social base of the Government , including the armed forces , given that the opposition/alternative voices will be effectively suppressed and silenced . Given the imploding crisis , the Regime would have no option but to unleash fascist terror to save its rotting skin . The beast is most ferocious when it is in its death-throes , although fatally vulnerable . Ramos , Shah Palavi , Mubarak , Gaddafi , Assad are examples . Whatever the case , battle lines are being drawn and society will be polarised between two rival camps : The camp of Democracy and Freedom and the camp of Militarist-Chauvinist- Fascist Reaction . We must rise to the momentous challenge that history has placed before us . Only a genuine , bottom-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this , we must overcome fear , our worst enemy .

We should begin to articulate our own alternative vision and path of freedom , as a basis to convene a People 's Constituent Assembly . We should work on drafting the basic framework of a new constitution that enshrines the Rule of Law and Human Rights ; that gives expression to the national-democratic aspirations of the people , constituted by the various nations , nationalities and communities of Lanka ; that entrenches the enforceable rights of the workers , farmers , fishermen , students , university lecturers , youth , women , professionals and all social forces and ; that shall empower the People of Lanka to design @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a system of democratic assemblies , with direct and directly accountable people 's representatives .

@@773238 <h> Land of the free , home of the hypocrites ! <p> By Rypvanwinkle <p> My Dear Barack , <p> I thought I must write to you when I heard that the United States was sponsoring a resolution against our country at the Human Rights Council of the United Nations this week . To me , that seems rather silly-and I will tell you why-but I am told that is the way it is . <p> I suppose you are aware that we ended a war against the most ruthless terrorist group in the world two and a half years ago and did so with the greatest difficulty . I am not sure whether you know this , but that group , the Tigers , taught a thing or two about suicide bombings to al Qaeda and had their own Air Force ! While we were fighting them for thirty long years and bombs were exploding on our streets more often than not all your country-and some other countries such as Britain and France- could do was to lecture us on why we should not fight the Tigers but try to " negotiate " with them . <p> Of course we did that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an " Accord " with them brokered by India and then we had a " Ceasefire " with them brokered by Norway . On both occasions , they always went back to war , gaining ground and becoming more menacing with each truce . <p> And while all this was going on , our trains and buses were being bombed , our places of worship were attacked and even our airport and Central Bank were targeted . In all of those attacks , hundreds of innocent people died and that is why we needed to fight the Tigers to the end . <p> Now , you and your allies are trying to tell us that what we did was wrong or that the way we did it was wrong . You are saying that civilians were killed when the war ended and that our military and our political leadership should be punished for that . <p> Tell me , Barack , how should we have fought them ? There is enough and more evidence that the Tigers were using civilians in the areas that they controlled as human shields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would have otherwise died . Such deeds go unmentioned but you and a few other nations seem to think what we did was wrong . <p> Of course , because you represent the most powerful country in the world , the United Nations and that man Moon is a puppet on your string . They do your bidding and ask no questions , even when there are blatant double standards about " war crimes " . <p> Tell me , Barack , how many civilians have died when your planes bombed Afghanistan ? Even though that is not your country your forces are allowed to run amok and kill civilians and people like that man Moon or that woman Pillay say absolutely nothing ! <p> Then , we all saw pictures of you and Hillary watching the mission to capture Bin Laden . He may have been the most wanted man in the world but still he was killed when he was unarmed . So , are n't you and your troops guilty of violating international conventions about how captured suspects should be treated , Barack , to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while doing so ? <p> Just to put things in perspective , had Prabhakaran been killed when he was unarmed , what would you have said ? Surely it would have been called a war crime and the Pillays and the Moons , the Camerons and Sarkozys would have called for an ' international investigation ' . But when you do something similar , they see no evil and hear no evil ! <p> Of course , the British and the French , the Camerons and the Sarkozys are no better . They engineer a so-called revolution in Libya , carry out air raids on that country killing hundreds of civilians and when Gaddafi is captured , he is killed while pleading for his life . And yet , these are not ' war crimes ' and they do not need an ' international investigation ' ! <p> And look at what you and your allies have done . In recent years you have intervened in Iraq , Egypt and Libya and happily orchestrated what you call " regime change " . But all these countries are still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You are of course laughing all the way to the White House , after gaining better access to the oil in these countries ! <p> And oil is another matter that I need to write to you about . Just because you impose sanctions on Iran , you want us to follow suit . Iran has been a good friend of this country but we are not free to buy oil from them because you hate Ahmadinejad 's guts and as a result , millions of our people have to endure hardships-and you call yourself the leader of the Free World ! <p> So , whatever happens with this resolution you are proposing against us , it is a bit of joke to us really , when you try to lecture us about ' human rights ' and ' war crimes ' while you go about violating everybody else 's rights and bombing civilians whenever you feel like it , detaining suspects at Guantanamo Bay without trial and burning the Quran in Afghanistan . <p> We would have thought that having lived through the pain of 9/11 , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of terrorism . Regardless of your resolutions at the UN , what we do know is that we can now walk on our roads knowing that a bomb would not explode at the next street corner . Our people leave for work in the morning safe in the knowledge that they will return home to their families in the evenings . We can travel the length and breadth of our country without any restrictions . <p> That , Barack , is peace and do n't be jealous just because people in your country do n't enjoy that degree of freedom anymore because they have to constantly worry about terrorist threats . We are grateful for that peace and no amount of resolutions can take that away from us ! <p> Yours truly , Punchi Putha <p> PS-I know you were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize , after just eight months in office and before all your efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan . Judging by what has happened since then , I suppose they should either withdraw your prize or maybe we should nominate Prabhakaran for next year 's award ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Retired school principal S. Thoradeniya is dubbed ' The Reader , ' Bala Tampoe is ' The Union Leader , ' Helga de Silva is ' The Warrior Queen , ' The Venerable Walatara Sobhita Nayaka Thera is ' The Chief Monk . ' If one were to put Kannan himself up there among them , he says his title might very well be ' The Observer . ' His choice is revealing of how Kannan sees himself in this process . <p> ' The Chief Monk ' : Ven Walatara Sobhita Nayaka Thera <p> After all , we do not hear his voice in the videos , nor are those his views being expressed or his memories that are shared so generously . Instead Kannan is part artist , part narrative journalist . Using photographs and film , accompanied by edited audio from his interviews , he records stories from a Sri Lanka that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a degree in psychology from the University of Cambridge and recently completed his Master 's at the University of Oxford for which he considered the potential of new media to promote human rights . He also did a five -year stint in London as a media and human rights lawyer , during which time he confesses he might have " lived vicariously through the lives of my clients . " <p> But Kannan felt driven to do more , to move from " talking about issues and respondents to really talking about stories and characters . " He saw the power that lay in a simple narrative , beginning with his own . When he first moved here , Kannan made a series of programmes for Radio Netherlands Worldwide in which he spoke in the first person of his experiences of returning to Sri Lanka . He describes those as quite cathartic , but now says he is in a different phase : " I really feel like I do n't want to talk about myself , I just want to give other people a voice . " <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the many views on his website , his work will reach new audiences as part of the 8th Aljazeera International Documentary Festival 2012 and Film South Asia 2012 . He was also part of the just concluded Colombo Art Biennale . <p> Linking them all thematically is Kannan 's great obsession - an exploration of the shifting Sri Lankan identity . His own family 's circumstances and choices have made these stories deeply personal for Kannan , particularly the series titled ' Longing and Belonging : Diaspora Shorts , ' available on the website Groundviews . But it is his ' I Am ' series which absorbs him now . The first set introduced 36 narrators from Jaffna , Kandy and Galle and began with the filmmaker 's determination to explore the answers to this one question : was there a time when people in Sri Lanka did n't describe themselves as Sinhalese or Tamil , Muslim or Burgher ? <p> An anthropologist had suggested to him that the further back one went , the more likely it was that people would identify themselves by where they came from or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primarily as say ' Sinhalese ' or ' Tamil . ' Setting out , Kannan realised that his interviewees , even those in their 70s and 80s , were still too young to have escaped the most intense periods of the politicisation of ethnicity in Sri Lanka . But the stories he chose to tell transcended that initial question - becoming more subtle , more complex and altogether more interesting in the process . <p> The Union Leader : Bala Tampoe <p> On the road while making ' Kerosene ' : Esan , Kannan 's father and Kannan <p> In one a Buddhist monk talks about his collection of over 400 vinyl records , many of which are Buddhist songs sung by Muslims artists ( with the odd Jim Reeves record thrown in ) . Buddha also appreciated singers , the monk tells Kannan , why ca n't I ? In another , we meet Mr. S.

" It was great timing for me . I could capture him in his element addressing a crowd of workers in Sinhala to the cries of ' jaya weva ! ' and ' long live Bala Tampoe ! ' " But what Kannan found most interesting was that a man with connections to royalty who one would expect to be rooted in Jaffna , would primarily define himself in terms of his relationships with his union . " He talks of himself as a workers leader , " says Kannan , " As humans , then as workers , then as members of the union - that was his hierarchy when engaging with people . That fascinated me . " <p> This week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' series with interviews of iconic filmmaker Lester James Peries and cricketing personality Chandra Schaffter .

If you know someone interesting you think he should interview , Kannan would like to hear from you . <p> He was also commissioned to make a trilogy of short HD films that celebrated the resilience and inventiveness of those people , again by the website Groundviews . Kannan , who spent the first five years of his life in Jaffna before he immigrated with his family to London , saw the ' Paper , ' ' Kerosene ' and ' Koothu ' as a " tribute " to the residents who had stayed behind . <p> " If you talk to Jaffna residents , most people would probably agree that that was the hardest time for them , " he says , " but they talk about that time with a smile on their faces - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because of the passage of time , they were able to do that . " The brilliant inventiveness and absolute determination of those who kept the paper Uthayan running even when they had no newsprint , or taxi driver Esan who found ways to transport as many as 20 people at time in his vehicle even when he had no petrol were stories that penetrated all the babble and the political analysis to present a powerfully human perspective . " These individuals saw a way to adapt to the situation and they shared that knowledge , " says Kannan . <p> For Kannan , working on Koothu in particular was special because of the involvement of his father with the project . " My mother is a doctor and my father a lawyer and they left in the late seventies to migrate to England .

When she had stated that she is not a prostitute and tried to get away from them , the group had begun molesting her and fiddling with her private parts . At that juncture , the deceased Kuram Shaik had told them not to manhandle her , and intervened . These hooligans had then dragged Shaik away and attacked him with a broken bottle . When Shaik was struggling with the Chairman 's gangsters , one of the assailants had taken an automatic weapon which was with him and shot at Shaikh killing him . Victoria too had intervened in this tussle . The gangsters had then assaulted her fiercely so much so that she became motionless .

They have also threatened the tourists that if anyone says a word , all of them before they leave will be murdered in the same way as Shaikh . These dire threats have alarmed the tourists immensely . <p> ' Daniel ' who related this story told us he saw through the open door two individuals raping Victoria . He also added that he saw her abandoned nude on the cement floor of the room by the 8 individuals who raped her in the belief that she was dead . <p> ' Daniel ' went on to say , that the victim was in a most critical condition , yet nobody came forward to help .

While Victoria was receiving intensive care treatment at Karapitiya Hospital , she had been brought to the Colombo Apollo Hospital . This is an illegal action , because it is only on a request made by a relative of the patient that such an action can be taken .

It is so cataclysmic and defies logic in the manner they brainwash the common people of Sri Lanka into making fools of themselves by ridiculous resistance to implementing our own Lessons Learned . Pressure was heaped on the President to make clean due to the fabrications doled out that war operations were accomplished with minimum or no casualties to civilians and without Human Rights atrocities . Their refusal to accommodate any contradictory evidence of those caught in the cross-fire and the devastation to property took a disastrous turn when such proof by independent Media was produced . In desperation the Government began to refute such claims , even those produced in situ . Historically , the World Wars as well many others have not ended without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war was conducted in a manner beneficial ( sic ) to all by the Armed Forces in an astute manner . Apart from flippant excuses and vacillation the President then decided to institute panels of " fact finding " commissions composed of erudite men as well as their henchmen just as a ' time-buying ' exercise . It was a tactic to draw attention away in the hope things would fade away like the public demonstrations against price hikes in recent times . Prior to the LLRC , there was the APRC in the hands of intellectuals tasked with fact finding -- it was a fiasco with chaos , throw-backs , procrastination and a futile exercise -- the report ending in the Presidential garbage . The other ploy -- the proposed PSC never saw the light of day . All this was just barking at the moon ( metaphorically ) and repudiating the need of Rehabilitating and Rebuilding which is the paramount need of the hour apart from those grandiose schemes in the South . Ultimately the UN and UNHRC took the onus calling it a day . What was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the UN was a recommendation to the President to make good on his promises and put our house in order for peace and stability with our own home-grown recommendations . If the LLRC was taken for granted by the International community all the President has to do is commence implementing it . It is remarkable to note that even our neighbouring country saw fit to vote " for " the Resolution and shows our President the importance of backing and not bucking the International community . The Government muddies matters by brainwashing the poor , gullible , foolish masses , rabble rousers , including the clergy with a load of dung ' to cause chaos and defiance as a cover to wean their minds away from the corruption and spectre of a looming economic crisis . Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to deceive . The irony is that fundamentalists who have enjoyed luxuries of capitalist countries want a ban on them ! Philosopher Spinoza stated : I have strived not to laugh at human actions , not to weep at them , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time the President and parliament came to grips with reality , stop procrastinating and buckle down to the task of rebuilding the nation . This island belongs to " all its people " and not to a specific community or religion . Also our President must say what he really thinks instead of saying what he thinks people think they want to know . There is no greater opening for tragedy than a stupid exercise of power . But with the malady of a damned , decayed corpse for an Opposition it is no wonder the President can ride rough-shod over any opposition . Another leader , Disraeli said : " No government can be long secure without a formidable opposition " and with the present wimp leading a lame-duck Opposition anything is possible -- and there lies the tale ! It is said that a " demagogue " is one who preaches doctrine he knows to be untrue to a group of people he believes to be idiots -- quo vadis , sri lankaB .

To make matters worse for the home team their full back Kevin Dixon was sent off to the sin bin for foul play . This did not affect the peterites as in the next few minutes they turned the game around in their favour .
