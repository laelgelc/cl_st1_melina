He is talking about Gutsful , the new TV show he directed and narrated , and how people will inevitably compare it to Neighbours at War , the old TV show he directed ( for the first four series ) and narrated from 2006 to 2016 . <p> He is right in that both shows share the same key Kerton characteristics : the wry , deadpan narration , the eagle eye for a funny or absurd detail , the genuine warmth and affection for his often quite eccentric subjects . <p> When I turned up to interview him at the Greenstone TV office last week I was greeted by Gutsful producer Tash Christie . She kindly handed me a takeaway cup of coffee and requested I drink it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided it would be funny if you were drinking out of this when Bill gets here , " she said . I did n't understand why . <p> " It 's the nipple mug , " she explained . Sure enough , the side of the cup facing away from me had a kind of grotesque , superfluous ceramic nub . " You 'll understand when you see episode two . " <p> Episode two is about rubbish being dumped outside charity shops in Cambridge , Kerton told me when he arrived a couple of minutes later . He was wearing shorts , even though it was quite cold , and a green pullover hoodie . " They get a lot of stuff that 's not appropriate for a church organisation -- sex toys and blow up dolls and that sort of thing , " he said as I gingerly decanted my flat white into the bawdy mug . <p> Like its predecessor , Gutsful is a slice of Kiwi life in which the main protagonists are severely fed up about something . From charity shop shenanigans in Cambridge to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is better equipped to bring these everyday grievances to the small screen than Bill Kerton . <p> Warea , the scene of Gutsful 's first episode . ( Photo : Greenstone TV ) <p> Can you talk me through how an episode gets made ? For a start how do you find your subjects ? <p> For Gutsful the researchers will look on Facebook and all the different newspapers and other media because there 's always stuff that comes up every day . I suppose they just go and ask them , if there 's a Facebook group they might jump on and say do you want us to come and do a story on it . Then I 'll research it as thoroughly as I can . With any show I do I 'll always look at it and think have I got enough beats in there -- do I have enough material to make it fly for 22-and-a-half minutes . So then I 'll go on the road with a few pages of notes of what I want to try and get people to do , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get there it 's pretty haphazard because you 've usually never met them before and you 're basically just making it up as you go along . <p> Is there a trick to getting people to let their guard down and talk as candidly as they do ? <p> The first thing I do is tell them I 'm not a journalist laughs . People are often quite nervous once we 're there with the cameras , so you 've got to make them feel comfortable and obviously be genuinely interested in what they 're doing . You get a bit of a knack for it I suppose -- you can tell when people are getting a bit sick of it or if there 's something that they want to tell you that they 're not telling you . I 'll just sort of get there and look around and I 'll see visual cues that I know I can write voiceover to . In the field you have to get people to do stuff , you ca n't just sit them down do an interview and then shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to get them to do things . <p> What kind of things do you look for ? <p> So for example in the first episode of Gutsful there 's lots of visual cues in there where you can see who Chris is : he 's a surfer , he 's got his little car , he 's got his tattoo . All those things tell me who he is . It 's quite laborious , you have to work quite quickly , but you 've got to have all those things in place because when people watch on television you do n't get enough information just from two heads sitting there talking and shots of their house . You want to see them in their environment and see how they walk , or if they have a funny thing on the wall or anything like that . So your magpie 's eye goes into play when you 're in the field , you 're constantly looking for stuff that illustrates who they are to flesh out the story . <p> How long do you usually spend with someone for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but these days you have to be quite economical with your shoot days . You ca n't fuck around , you 've got to really think about it . So generally two days to shoot a story , maybe three , and then you 've got a contingency if you need to do pickups or anything extra . <p> Chris from the first episode of Gutsful in the public toilet desecrated by freedom campers . ( Photo : Greenstone TV ) <p> You 've worked on quite a lot of other things over the years -- can we take a quick sort of guided tour of your career ? Where did you start out and how did you end up here ? <p> I left school in ' 84 and got a job at a radio station in Whangarei ... that was around the time FM was popping up all over New Zealand so I got in on a new station that was starting . I spent 15 years in radio all up -- a couple of years in Whangarei , moved to Hamilton and did a couple of years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years on the radio in Ireland , briefly went to Monaco and did radio there ... then I came home and delivered chicken because I could n't get a job . But after about six months doing that I got into bFM , and I was there from about ' 93 to ' 99 as a production manager making commercials then as program director . <p> Did you invent the classic bFM funny ads ? <p> Nah . That was a very collaborative process . We used to have a really clever copywriter called Bob Kerrigan -- two guys , Bob Kerrigan and Scott Kelly -- who were very good at writing commercials . I was operating the recording studio , and there was always a revolving list of people coming through helping us make the ads , making them up as we went along . They were really part of the sound . I 've always thought if you can make it so people almost look forward to the ads then you 're onto a winner because they 're not going to switch off . So that was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of different people . Mikey Havoc was there and Joel Tobeck and a whole bunch of people like that . It was good fun , good times . <p> Is that how you ended up directing Havoc 's TV show ? <p> Yeah , that 's where I met Mike and Jeremy , and then when their director Paul Casserly left the show in about 1999 I think , that 's when I got shoulder-tapped and that 's when I started in TV . After that show ended I found myself in a bit of a weird position because I knew how to make that kind of television but I had no idea -- and I still do n't really -- how to make proper TV . So after Havoc I did a few pieces here and there , then I came here Greenstone TV about 8 or 9 years ago to do Neighbours at War . <p> Do you reckon a show like Havoc &amp; Newsboy could still get made today ? <p> I really do n't know . Mike and Jeremy had an ability to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing else like it . The thing is , making television , the best thing you can have is n't a really flash camera or a really good sound recordist . The best thing you can have is an executive producer or a network commissioner who opens a path for you to go straight to your audience . That 's the most important thing as far as I 'm concerned . If you do n't have that , if you have someone in that line that dilutes your message then it 's really hard to get it through . So we had a direct line to our audience almost . We had commissioners and executive producers who would look at what we were doing and go ' I have no idea why that 's funny or why you wan na do that , but off you go . ' <p> That was just before me , that was Dave Slade directed that series . That was the first series of Sellout Tour -- I did the second and third . But there were a couple of quite controversial things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spy base in Blenheim . That was all kinds of fucked up that was . That was ... borderline laughs . Havoc and Newsboy went across the wire , I stayed outside the perimeter with cameraman Clint Bruce and we filmed the shenanigans . They just basically wanted to do it because they wanted to do it . There was nothing political about it , they just wanted to go inside to see if they could , so they did . But I suspect that when that was broadcast somebody was probably called into a meeting at some level . It was all pretty harmless but you 're not supposed to do that sort of stuff . <p> Havoc and Newsboy at Waihopai ( Photo : NZ On Screen ) <p> Another thing that happened was we got involved with some animal rights activists down in Canterbury who took us to a chicken battery farm . We went and filmed in there and apparently there was hell to pay with Tegel or somebody threatening to pull their advertising . We had to have a couple of things modified in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , what about the one ... did you see the one where they had the guy from Christchurch who stapled his cock and balls to a big wooden crucifix ? <p> Yeah I vaguely remember that being talked about at school the next day ... <p> I had rung up a friend in Christchurch and asked if there was anything happening down there that we could do a story on . And he said well , there is this . This guy who 'd won a $100 bar tab by doing the most outrageous thing . What he 'd done is he 'd got this heavy wooden crucifix and a heavy duty stapler and stapled his cock and balls to it and then put lighter fluid on it and lit it . And this is all on reasonable high quality camera . We got that footage and I looked at it and thought Jesus Christ , I suppose we have to put this on TV . So we did , we cut it , and the network people looked at it and modified it slightly . But that really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea was it 's something that should probably not go on television , so let 's put it on television . <p> As the director were you egging Mike and Jeremy on or trying to rein them in a bit ? <p> I have a suspicion I was given that job because they knew that I was , y'know ... I am a pretty boring family man . Because I had no experience in television at all , I just knew them both quite well . So I suspect that executive producer Irene Gardiner gave me that job because she knew that I 'd be able to sort of ... control them ... a little bit . But by and large I just sort of hung on and went for the ride . They just did what they did and I just made sure that it got finished in time . <p> How did Neighbours at War come about ? <p> A lot of stuff was being commissioned at that time and I think they were probably scraping the bottom of the barrel . Greenstone had done a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit hokey but y'know . They 'd also given me a copy of a British show that was a sort of ' Neighbour v Neighbour ' thing , but it had this little quirk in it where you could tell that the production company was just slightly taking the mickey . I basically watched those two things and thought alright I 'll do it and signed on . I remember going and doing a couple of stories and thinking oh god , what has my career come to ? Because I was making a reality show about neighbours , which is just something I did n't really think I wanted to be doing . <p> Was there a moment you realised it might actually be quite good ? <p> I went to Mangere and met this lovely couple who thought their neighbours , because they were Fijian Indians , were eating the cats that were going missing . And I remember sitting there with them talking to them and thinking on the way back ' this is freakin ' gold . ' This is where I want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what makes them tick and ... not lampooning them but just , why not put that on television ? They were n't mentally ill or anything , it 's just what they thought . So that 's what I love is just doing that really . Any opportunity to get out there with real New Zealanders , to see what they do and how they do it . <p> How did you find people for that ? Did they come to you wanting to be on the show ? <p> It started out like that but eventually people thought I 'm not going on that show because that 's the show with crazy people on it . Which is a bit uncharitable . Because even though I presented it in a mildly entertaining way I do n't think it belittled their argument or their story . That 's the last thing I 'd want to do , for people to see a show I 've made and think that I 've jerked their chain . That 's a line I just would never cross with people . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If somebody did a Neighbours at War story on me there 'd be all sorts of stuff that I could look at and go well that is me , I am weird like that , you know . But that 's telly . <p> Typical scene from the Neighbours at War title sequence . ( Photo : NZ On Screen ) <p> Did you get many people coming back to you after their episode had aired feeling like they 'd been stitched up ? <p> Never . One lady , one lady in eight seasons . She was really unhappy . But I did n't add anything to her story ; she told it . She was annoyed because she felt the sound from the school and other areas was bouncing down her driveway and bouncing off the walls and going into her house or something . We had an acoustic expert who came to do some sound readings and he said to her that he thought perhaps she had an aversion to noise because there was no physics that could explain what was happening . She was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit bad for her but yeah . <p> What 's the single greatest episode of television you 've had a hand in making ? <p> Hmm . I 've got a soft spot for some of the Havoc shows . The one that Mike and I did in Ibiza was a really good one . That was an eye-opener laughs . I ca n't tell you much about that . <p> My favourite episode of Neighbours at War was one about a fella called Peter Morgan . I really liked that because it followed him from house to house to house , and it was a Neighbours at War story but you never met any of his neighbours because none of them wanted to talk to us . It was just all about him and how he went from place to place and always had problems with his neighbours . He said it was because his father was cursed by someone in Egypt many years ago . I loved that guy , I loved Peter . <p> But I do n't think I 've made any shows that are gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place I occupy is very much ...

He must be arrested and criminally prosecuted for trying to overthrow our government . More than a few traitors have been executed for such a crime . <p> What are the consequences of Republican leaders failing to denounce Trump totally and back up denunciations with action ? <p> Trump and his dangerous and armed mob will become millstones around your necks . And your failings will brand you as traitors unfit to hold public office . <p> For the Josh Hawleys , Ted Cruzes and other seditious Republican senators and representatives any further defense of Trump should end your political careers and your acceptance in civilized society . <p> Expel Seditious Legislators <p> Both the House and Senate , which with the Georgia runoff election results are under Democratic Party control , should exercise their authority to expel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defending Trump or challenging the certification of Joe Biden as the next president . <p> That 's not overreach ; it 's a Constitutional duty . <p> The mob Trump coerced to lay siege to our Capitol broke into the building , occupied and looted the Senate chamber , engaged in hand-to-hand combat with uniformed Capitol Police , broke into the floors of Congress and rifled through lawmakers ' desks . These all are criminal acts for which Trump is responsible . <p> A woman intruder , identified as Air Force veteran Ashli Babbitt of San Diego , was fatally shot by a Capitol police officer . Three others died of medical reactions . <p> Thank goodness someone had the presence of mind to gather up the state certifications of the November election results , denying Trump another opportunity to attack the Biden inauguration . <p> Trump Still Seeks Overthrow <p> If you doubt Trump still wants to overthrow our government , just watch his one-minute video from the White House Rose Garden made as the siege was under way . Trump asserted yet again the Big Lie that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a landslide . <p> While Trump did , in passing , tell the mob to go home , it was only a sort of suggestion . His core message to his riot squad was that " so bad and so evil " people stole the election . His real message to the rioters : Never give up trying to end our democracy and keep me in power . <p> That the crowd did not disperse proves his words hollow . Instead , live television carried voices of rioters vowing violence , promising to press on . As the sun set and darkness enveloped the Capitol grounds , where were federal law enforcement other than the Capitol Police ? <p> Trump put at risk the life of his own vice president , Mike Pence , on whom he painted a target during his incitement of the rioters . He endangered the next two people in line for the presidency , Nancy Pelosi , House speaker , and Chuck Grassley , Senate president pro tem . <p> Representative Linda Sanchez , a California Democrat , told MSNBC she instructed her family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed her life . <p> Warning Proved Right <p> About five years ago , I warned repeatedly that if Trump became president our democracy could end .

This can not stand . <p> Give the siege today , there can be no doubt that Trump remains a wannabe usurper , plain and simple . In rallying the mob to march on the Capitol , he : <p> Add in the provocative words of Giuliani , who told the mob there would be " trial by combat .

The insurrectionists forced lawmakers into hiding and necessitated armed officers to hold off rioters at the House chamber door with drawn handguns aimed at a rioters visible through a broken window . <p> From Day One , Trump has violated his oath of office but never so dangerously as in his inciting violence , a local crime for which the local District of Columbia authorities should have him arrested the moment his presidency ends if not before . <p> Hours after the siege began , the Capitol was still not under the control of our government as rioters , some of them looters , roamed the building . <p> Trump has over the decades said multiple times that looters should be shot on sight . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden video tweet ? Of course , it 's because Trump is at one with the rioters and looters . They are Trump 's mob . <p> Trump has not sent federal law enforcement to corral , arrest and identify the rioters . Instead , the governors of Maryland and Virginia sent state police riot squads to defend the Capitol . <p> It would be more than reasonable for Vice President Mike Pence and the cabinet to remove Trump immediately under the 25th Amendment . They must do this . However , while Trump promised " the best people " would populate his administration he intend installed such low-grade weaklings and incompetents that , sadly , this is likely a vain hope . <p> While time is short , it 's more than reasonable for the House to impeach Trump a second time .

These cases should proceed with all due speed . <p> Remember we welcome robust , respectful and insightful debate . We do n't welcome abusive or defamatory comments and will de-register those repeatedly making such comments . Our current comment policy is here . <p> So remind us again Zachary which of the US Capitol rioter thugs were acting peacefully , resulting in four people dead ?

I 'm more than happy to ignore your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rioters was far from peaceful , which everyone in the world can see . They can also see that Trump is infantile and unpatriotic president who ca n't handle the truth of his own failures . <p> I 'm not a supporter . I think the Western World has been sorely let down by the choice between Trump and Biden . Each are equally awful , pandering and decisive . Biden is however more polished and many magnitudes more palatable . Yesterdays action and imagery were foolish , distasteful and illegal . <p> So we agree for the most part . My point and I will reiterate . You are not better/more insightful/brilliant than people who think differently to you . <p> exactly - what about all that vile shit he 's done over the years ? once he 's the President it all gets forgotten and a free pass ? no effing way and neither does anyone who turns a blind eye - once a POS always a POSOTUS . When are the Republicans going to put up a decent candidate - Reagan was the last one of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eisenhower . <p> Yes pointless sensationalism . Wheels in US government just would n't turn quickly enough and anyway , the GOP has not forgotten Nixon was one of theirs , do n't want another ousted president on their portrait wall . By now there must be some consensus between representatives to keep a watch and use existing levers to curb and/or extinguish any extremes forthcoming in the next two weeks . <p> Zachary Smith .... The only peaceful protest is what Mahatma Gandhi demonstrated , Hunger Srtike . What happened yesterday was vandalism , assault on the Capitol , destruction of property , interference in legislative work , obstruction , and many more . All criminal and punishable . <p> I used to think like you SmoKey but I was convinced otherwise while arguing with very intelligent people about the BLM protests . I see now that protest is a sacred right and it is allowed to be robust . Actually Kiwis and British types in general are very reluctant to protest even in the face of actual outrages . <p> To quote you Zachary : " I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowed to be robust " . By robust protest do you mean that they 're allowed to carry guns and shoot at the police ? That 's a thug Zachary not a peaceful protestor . <p> CJ , it was the authorities shooting at the protestors . Four people died , one killed by security and the other three had heart attacks or something . The latter were bound to happen as the crowd was so huge and a lot of older folk there . <p> Of 73 million , a few 100 at the Capitol Building is a laugh ... even those few 100 could create plenty damage if well organized but thats where it stops as not well organized and the rally call of trumps vile rhetoric has been silenced . It 's almost time to ' drain the swamp ' of trump and his awful family <p> Fh you should really be a bit more explicit when you ask how much support Trump has . Certainly the crowd at the first rally was pretty respectable , and the 73 million votes ( 47+ % ) is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ isolation but they are far from being a " splinter group " <p> Yeah you should read what I wrote instead of go on your own detour , I referred to how many were in the mob , pretty simple really . If I ask one question and you decide to answer another totally random question of the voter turnout because you think it sounds better it is no wonder you are confused . Now just give it a rest rather than trying to prove you are right and everyone else is wrong . <p> How about you stop being a twat ? ? You said in your post Trump has marginal support - clearly incorrect . Do n't conflate your crap reasoning with " everyone else " .. it 's clearly cognitively dissonant , it 's also plainly incorrect . What you posted and what you thought were divergent . The # 's of the mob are clearly not representative of his support " trump is deluded that he thought he has big support " - your words ... clearly incorrect ! <p> I will quote Mahatma Gandhi again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world blind . Robust protest need not mean violence , destruction of property . It could mean simultaneous hunger strikes in many places , in front of government buildings ( without obstructing the normal work there ) , so on . It could also mean sit ins , not vandalism . The trigger happy police and protestors both do harm to Democracy , no doubt . That is the tragedy of America . Constant and continuous escalation by all the sides using fire arms and violence . <p> We can applaud the protestors if they had come on their own , instead of being goaded by a sitting President , which is the gist of this article . The insurrection by a President who swore to uphold and defend the Constitution . He needs to be removed or prosecuted later . The protestors were let loose by that incendiary speech . They behaved badly , not peacefully , as the whole world has seen . The forces trying to protect the Capitol were overwhelmed and were almost lynched . The shooting of one person could have been self defence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not use arms , what is the point of carrying them and how can they protect the building , property and the people inside the building . Those people were elected law makers and needed as much protection as the President himself . <p> Haha .. I think you 'll find they were more likely to be plastic fakes and faux fur - no doubt made in China .. the ultimate irony ! ! Got ta say America sure breeds some whackos. what a fustercluck of a country <p> I sort of agree but what further damage could he do worse than this . I think he will lick his wounds until inauguration day he ca n't use some of the social media to broadcast anymore which makes him pretty powerless . <p> They 're bogan nutcases with the utmost dedication to narcissist Trump , who 's been encouraging them to fight back at his rallies . There 's no excuses for being so lax on security . Something seems off with it all . <p> The Federal Elections Commissioner stated that the election was " not legitimate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counting in Pennsylvania . There was lack of due process in other states . The protest was on the whole peaceful . If anybody got excited , there was good reason to be . The media has reported on the election and its aftermath with complete bias . <p> You 'll never guess : There are multiple FEC Commissioners and they get appointed by Presidents . There is no ' The ' when it comes to FEC Commissioners and they 're partisan appointments , not neutral ones . I 'm sure elmo is n't showing any bias of his own in omitting this kind of information , probably just slipped his mind . <p> Fair enough . There did seem to be an underlying thread of denial in the rest of the post imv , but to be honest I think any discussion regarding the legitimacy of the election just got overridden by yesterdays events . Initially I thought Trump would be good for American politics but he 's become more and more dysfunctional as time has gone by . Pence is in an unenviable spot , if I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the vote asap <p> Plaintiffs ' interpretation of events is incorrect and not credible . I heard someone else say something , ' " and said , " Tell me how that is not hearsay . Come on now !

The plaintiffs " ask the Court to violate the rights of over 6.8 million Americans , " he wrote , referring to all the voters in November in Pennsylvania . " It is not in the power of this Court to violate the Constitution . " <p> Ageed . In addition the left wing media made no mention of the investigation into Hunter Biden until AFTER the electon . They finally announced that he was being investigated for criminal charges and the FBI were also determining whether his father knew about his dealings . Timing is everything . <p> Trump cares about no one - I mean no one - but himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , killed or destroyed . He is a narcissist of the highest order by any definition and if no one saw this coming they are blind . Imagine what Lincoln , Eisenhower , FDR et al would think of this along with all those Americans who have died trying and rid the world of this type of behavior . He s like a drug lord who demands unfettered loyalty in deference to himself . <p> A lot of his supporters are the poorest people in America , he implemented a lot of really good policies for those people , some getting back to work after decades of being unable to find work . <p> His policies were bad for international trade but really good for the people suffering under the trade deals which meant they could n't find work because they were competing with " cheaper " labor conditions overseas . <p> There is certainly a similarity between our mob of prisoners who rioted last week and Trump 's mob who stormed the White House yesterday .

Broadly speaking , property owners in the central Auckland suburb of Herne Bay remain at the top of the tree , with the highest median value in the land -- $2,681,650 . The Bay of Plenty town of Kawerau boasts the greatest five-year change in median values ( 200.7% ) , with the greatest 12-month change in median values being Outer Kaiti , Gisborne ( 39.7% ) . <p> Other key data about the national top-performing suburbs from the CoreLogic Best of the Best Report : <h> New Zealand 's property market mapped : top performing suburbs <p> All is revealed in CoreLogic NZ 's latest ' Mapping the Market ' ( December 2020 ) report , which delivers location analytics and geospatial expertise to consumers , investors and property agents .

By clicking on any New Zealand suburb in the interactive map , users can instantly see its current median property value , values one year ago , and the % and $ change over that period . <p> CoreLogic Senior Property Economist Kelvin Davidson says , " The constantly changing dynamics of the New Zealand property market mean many would-be homeowners often find it challenging to understand which suburbs match their budgets . That 's especially true in this new COVID world . The ' Mapping the Market ' tool puts this information at their fingertips and updates every three months . The map is colour-blocked so at a glance , it 's very easy to see which local suburbs sit within a particular budget and which have changed the most or least . " <p> The latest refresh of the data confirms the post-COVID rebound across most of the country , with suburbs around all of the main centres seeing strong gains . Indeed , recent growth means Auckland now has 117 suburbs with a median property value of at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1.01m ) means that Tauranga joins the $1m+ club too .

In fact , all of the top four suburbs for median value growth over the past year are in Gisborne -- Outer Kaiti taking the prize , with a 39.7% increase ( to $335,900 ) . <p> Across the country , 46 suburbs have seen their median value increase by at least $100,000 in the past year , with 33 of those in Auckland . <p> In addition to the visual demonstration , the smart map also provides key market commentary from the CoreLogic research team , with data highlights and trends provided for each major city . However -- users can easily focus in on any part of the country they want . <h> The year that 's been <p> Among 2020 's many unanticipated events has been the strong post-lockdown rebound in the housing market , says Davidson . " That growth certainly did n't seem likely back in April and May , when sales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the property upswing has been so swift that the political pressure has already ramped up to levels that would have taken far longer to get to in previous cycles . The Reserve Bank has not escaped scrutiny either . " <p> What actually happened this year ? Pre-lockdown , there were signs that sales activity and prices were strengthening , with mortgage rates edging lower and the stock of property actually listed/available to buy at historical lows . As COVID hit and the Government injected a huge amount of money into the economy ( primarily the wage subsidy ) , the Reserve Bank ( e.g. delayed capital requirements , removal of loan to value ratio rules , quantitative easing ) and the trading banks ( e.g. mortgage payment deferrals ) also played a large role in helping businesses and households to negotiate those tumultuous months over April , May , and into June . <p> Speaking about the various buyer groups , Davidson says , " This time last year we speculated that 2020 could be the ' year of the investor ' , and although the circumstances have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that call has proved to be pretty accurate . " <p> Indeed , mortgaged investors ' market share has continued to rise in recent months ( 27% in October ) , due to the removal of the LVRs , low returns on savings in the bank , and also how cheap it is to borrow to buy property . But first home buyers have also been very active , with their share of purchases hitting 25% in Q3 , a record high . <p> Davidson says , " In terms of the actual sales numbers , then , it 's remarkable to think that , despite the lack of listings and the ban on activity in lockdown , the total volume of transactions this year is on track to be about 85,000 to 90,000 , the same as 2019 and similar to the long-term average . Meanwhile , the rise in average property values for 2020 as a whole could be in the vicinity of nine to 10% -- pretty remarkable when measured against some forecasts made during lockdown that prices could fall by 15 to 20% . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impetus from low mortgage rates and a tight supply of listings could keep a fair degree of upwards pressure on property values in many suburbs for at least the first half of the year . <p> Davidson says , " It 's fascinating how quickly the property market has become political in recent weeks , and although the Finance Minister 's public letter to the Reserve Bank Governor ( and his subsequent reply ) may not drive immediate change to the RBNZ 's official policy targets , it does demonstrate that it might not be plain sailing for the property market in terms of regulatory measures in 2021 . Indeed , there 's already speculation emerging about an extension to the Brightline Test ( a capital gains tax that currently applies if an investor sells a property within five years ) , while debt-to-income ratios for new mortgage lending are also rearing their head too . <p> " Meanwhile , the reinstatement of the LVR speed limits on 1 March 2021 seems to be a done deal , with the banks having already made the move anyway . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to require 20% ) , but some investors could be frozen out by now having to find a 30% deposit rather than 20% . However , with general demand still so strong , it seems unlikely that the return of the LVR rules will be a game-changer . Of course , as we saw back in 2016 , pushing investor deposit requirements back up to 40% could be more significant -- and while it does n't seem to be on the table at present , that could n't be ruled out if market momentum remains strong . " <p> Other concerns that have been lingering for a while about how the end of the wage subsidy and mortgage deferrals might affect the property market seem to be less relevant now . After all , the wage subsidy has already ended without any real fuss , and although the unemployment rate has risen to 5.3% , the peak could now be less than 6.5% -- a far cry from lockdown forecasts that it could reach 10% . Similarly , after peaking at more than $22bn in May , the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markedly to less than $4bn . Again , those ' exits ' from the scheme do n't appear to have been too stressful . <p> Overall , provided COVID continues to be managed successfully , it 's hard to see the property market being seriously thrown off its current course in 2021 , says Davidson . " For sure , housing un-affordability will remain an issue between the ' haves ' and ' have-nots ' , but the key drivers for the market that we 've seen this year seem likely to remain in place next year . For example , low mortgage rates and a tight supply of listings . After all , many would-be movers are sitting tight ( therefore not listing their own property ) , few investors are actually selling to make their next purchase , while first home buyers obviously do n't sell anything either . That all amounts to further restraints on listings volumes . " <p> CoreLogic 's central assumption is that property sales volumes in 2021 will be similar to 2020 ( again in the range of 85,000 to 90,000 ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provide a dampening effect . Davidson says , " For property values , it would n't be a surprise to see another increase in the range of 5-10% next year . However , 2020 has taught us that nothing can be taken for granted , and no doubt there 'll be plenty of twists and turns in store for 2021 .

@@32515237 <p> Opinion from Inner-City Wellington It is vital that any redesign of Te Ngakau -- Civic Square recognises that inner-city residents now make up the largest suburb in Wellington in terms of population ( in the smallest area of land in Wellington ) and , as this population is expected to grow considerably , it is essential that , as well as being developed as the Civic heart and cultural hub of the city , the Square can also be seen as the heart of the inner city community . Key to this is retention of outdoor space , especially green space , and inclusion of surrounding internal community amenities at ground floor of ' new ' buildings . <p> Currently the inner city is woefully devoid of community open space for its residents and we can not afford to lose any that we have . Jack Ilott Green in the Square is the only reasonable sized easily accessible area in the CBD that provides essential green park-like space for children and adults alike to play and relax . A further requirement is for the space to continue to be open and retain the glorious vista to the harbour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterfront is also vital . The need for a large space that can be used as an evacuation centre is also a requirement . As we see it , the future of the Central Library is known -- and building requirements for the Old City Library , the Michael Fowler Centre and the Town Hall have been identified . <p> In addition , new or remediated facilities are needed to house the City Council civic and staff functions and a National centre for Music . We expect that these buildings will be as ' green ' as possible , base isolated and built with sea level rise/encroachment in mind . That means the ' greenness ' must be made a requirement for the design . <p> However , the greater and PRIOR issue is that of the whole site design -- consideration of the view shaft from Mercer Street , framing of the Square with consideration of sun and shade , and the way in which openness to the harbour needs to be maintained , the designation of large open spaces which are indeed adaptable so they can be used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evacuation places ; then the bulk location of the buildings to encourage connection . <p> ICW 's concern is that in providing a framework for any design brief or competition without a focus first on the spatial elements of the Square and the need for consideration of how it will contribute to improved social cohesion , conversation and debate will inevitably focus more on the buildings . <p> City Planners must consider and consult on the needs of the inner-city residents = Co-Design ! <p> AMENITIES <p> ? Library <p> ? Community and public spaces accessible in ground floor of ' new ' buildings <p> ? Green space : Retention of separate reasonable sized area of natural green space for physical activities , children 's play &amp; community gatherings such as picnics should be more integrated with the Square .

Nikau ramp should remain as it is an integral part of crossing to the waterfront <p> ? Separated interpersonal places around the edges of the square where people can feel comfortable and safe without being crowded <p> ? New buildings should not be taller than existing buildings and should contribute appropriately to the outer frame of the Square facing the Square . <p> ICW CONTENDS THAT : <p> 1 ) There must be major stakeholder engagement : Recognition of the square as the local community space for inner-city residents , as well as a place for all Wellingtonians and visitors to congregate , is vital to its success . <p> 2 ) If there is to be a design competition the criteria and guidelines must be agreed with inner-city residents and the Wellington public prior to announcement of the competition . <p> 3 ) The primary planning focus should be on SPACE planning rather than buildings . <p> 4 ) Timeframes need to be given priority . <p> 5 ) There must be a robust budget limit as this must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical services must be separate for each building , so that in future problems can be better isolated . <p> 9 ) An underground carpark is still required , and all vehicular traffic should be excluded from the Square . <p> 10 ) The main entrance to the Square should be clear and from there the square should tell a story that links the city to the harbour through sculpture/mural/water features etc . <p> This is part of a submission from Inner-City Wellington to the Wellington City Council highlighting pre-design concerns prior to any action being taken regarding Te Ngakau -- Civic Square . <h> Join the ScoopCitizen Community <p> 20 years of independent publishing is a milestone , but to keep Scoop thriving we need your support .

It only exists because the building intended for that site was curtailed by the 1987 share market crash . I recall the former civic lawn when I was a teenager ( with its Guy Ngan sculpture prominent ) which is now the site of the pink curved Civic Administration Building and how well used it was during lunchtimes , summer evenings etc vs. the J.I Green which is basically dead-space in comparison . Both the Civic Building and the former Capital E / southern part of the City to Sea bridge are seismically stuffed and are likely to be demolished .

This area of the city is not far behind Seoul ( 15,763 ) and is up there with the population density of London . The most densely populated area in London is Islington at 13,890 . These figures give great cause for concern when there is not the green infrastructure here to sustain them . <p> The World Health Organization ( WHO ) recommends that governments place health and health equity at the centre of urban governance and planning .

For a long time , WCC staff played regular lunchtime games of volleyball , office workers played touch rugby , and there are lots of occasions of people sitting around having lunch on the rundown seating , playing Petanque , having Tai Chi and gym sessions , and children playing . In the summer evenings ( when we have them ) there have been locals playing touch rugby , children playing and people walking and relaxing etc .

@@32520233 <h> Atecas Amended <p> The Cupra Ateca has been updated for 2021 , likewise the Seat Ateca , subtly for the most part , but the big news for this year is the arrival of Cupra 's first offering that is n't a Seat makeover . <p> And that newcomer would be the curvy Formentor , due in the second half of the year and ready to foment a bit of sales action for the Spanish brand . If you 're considering a Cupra Ateca , you should also have this on the wish list , as it is based on similar mechanicals but is rather sexier because of its rounded , coupe-like design . <p> Luggage and rear seat space might not be quite as commodious ( 420L vs 485L Cupra Ateca ) but what price style , right ? Local Cupra and Seat boss , James Yates , said there were already confirmed orders for four , no wait , five , make that six of them , the latter two confirmed over the phone during the launch drive of the updated Ateca range ! <p> Moreover , it looks as if spinning off Cupra into its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand is anything to go by . Last year , just over one-third of all sales were of Cupra models , compared with 17 per cent in 2019 , and this year Yates reckons the performance brand will run even-stevens with Seat . Kiwis certainly do seem to appreciate sporty vehicles , especially sports SUVs/crossovers . <p> And the launch drive of the updated range kind of showed why . Simply because we could , we decided to opt for the lowest power and cost model from the rationalised Ateca range first - that would be the FR as Style and Xcellence have gone by the wayside - and then into FR4 , and finally the Cupra Ateca , figuring we 'd leave the best until last ; that was the theory at any rate . <p> Last year was a sales disappointment for just about every brand , the global coronavirus pandemic and resulting lockdowns seeing local new vehicle numbers down by one-quarter overall . Making things more difficult for Seat and Cupra was the lack of new model variants , but this year promises to be different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Formentor(s) , rationalised Arona range , and new Leon wagon and hybrid models arriving later in the year . <p> As to the Ateca variants , both Seat and Cupra examples see modest changes externally - the sheet metal is unchanged - but there are more significant updates inside , the Seat versions with new instruments and a bigger 9.2-inch infotainment touchscreen that now shows three different data sets simultaneously . <p> Externally you can pick the new models by their bigger grilles , different alloy options ( six of ) , dynamic indicator lights , black and grey mirror caps and change in font for the Ateca script at the rear . A single $2100 option pack comprises park assist and adaptive cruise , top view camera and wireless phone charger . If you go for FR , do n't leave it out . Adaptive cruise can be had alone in FR4 for $400 . <p> As mentioned , there 's now just an FR spec level for Ateca , the front-drive model with a $46,900 sticker price and the FR4 costing $52,900 . Engines for the respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 250Nm mated to an eight-speed DSG , and a 2.0 unit making 140kW and 320Nm , hooked up to a seven-speed twin-clutch gearbox . <p> We drove the FR first and the FR4 thereafter . If you 're considering these , we 'd advise spending the extra on the FR4 . Not only is it more effortless and grippier on the go , but mean fuel use is n't much worse , at a claimed combined 6.9L/100km ( 6.2 for FR ) . Moreover it rides and handles better with adaptive dampers as standard , and even in Sport mode the progress is really rather easy going . <p> A quick sprint through the technically demanding Woodcock 's Rd into Warkworth gave a good indication of just how close this is to hot hatch dynamics , as we 've discovered in the past with the FR4 . It 's quick too , not as fast as the Cupra Ateca , now known as Ateca VZ ( Veloz is Spanish for speedy ) but it would give it a run for its money , both being 2.0L turbopetrols and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $600 upgrade ) is quicker - it takes under 5sec to hit open road speed - but it 's also a bit more locked down , though in doing that is not quite so compliant as FR4 . <p> On the other hand , you seldom need to invoke Sport or Cupra modes , such is its heroic body control ( and resulting ride comfort ) in the default Normal setting . Phew but this can hustle , and with 400Nm streaming from 2000rpm , along with 221kW of power , it feels pretty effortless too . Price has risen slightly to $66,900 . <p> This features a comprehensive safety package , including XDS torque vectoring by brake . Its standard Beats Audio set-up is excellent too , imaging like the dickens . A Brembo brake upgrade costs $4300 , although the standard ones work pretty well . A panoramic sunroof adds $2300 and petrol blue leather $1550 . <p> As to the rest of the Seat range ? The Arona is no longer available with that stroppy little 1.0 turbopetrol so now just comes with the 1.6L atmo engine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and there 's a better specified FR alternative at $31,900 . <p> The Tarraco ' range ' now comprises a single model , the 1.4 falling by the wayside , leaving the $64,900 FR4 . <p> As to Leon , a stylish Sportsourer FR wagon will arrive soon , with a $44,900 price tag , and likely a 48v 110kW mild hybrid will follow in the second half of the year . Cupra will be offering both the 221kW Leon hatch ( $59,900 ) and the 228kW Leon Sportstourer ( $65,900 ) , with the possibility of a 150kW hybrid variant down the line . Sportstourers evidently have luggage capacity of 620L before split folding . <p> And finally a few details on Cupra Formentor which arrives here midyear in two spec levels , V and VZ , the latter getting the 228kW turbopetrol and four exhaust outlets . The V variant uses the same powertrain as the Seat Ateca FR4 , packing 140kW , with quoted fuel use of 6.5L/100km . A 150kW plug-in hybrid is a likely starter later in the year , and it should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly longer than Cupra Ateca by 70mm but rides lower for improved dynamics .

@@32520235 <h> Growing a family legacy <p> Under the watchful eye of Jack , Sophia Hunt prepares oak seedlings for planting on the farm that 's been in her family for more than 100 years . <p> What started with planting some acacia trees 25 years ago has become a multi-generational passion for the Hunt family in Te Awamutu . <p> The Hunts are taking the long view on shade planting and sustainability . <p> " Grandpa was against it at the time ; grandma claims she suggested it , " says Sophia Hunt , whose grandparents were the original owners of Orakau Dairy in Te Awamutu , Waikato . <p> Sophia now helps farm Orakau -- a 350-cow operation split into two herds -- alongside her parents Rose and Vernon , and sister Margie . <p> What grandma and grandpa were disputing was Rose and Vernon shutting up a 1.5ha paddock with some mature acacias about 25 years ago , allowing the self-seeded acacias to grow , instead of being nibbled off each time cows grazed the paddock . <p> The farm had a few stands of mature macrocarpas at the time , planted for timber and used by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be milled , and there was concern about the trees causing slips . <p> So , Rose and Vernon decided to close the acacia paddock and create a new shade and shelter area . <p> " The paddock was closed to stock for about seven years , " says Rose . " We 'd intended to shut it for only five years , but the young trees needed a little longer to establish . " <p> By shutting the paddock , the seedlings were able to grow into tall trees , creating a shady glade . <p> Rose and Vernon also planted pin oaks , meaning there are now plenty of trees along races , including ongoing new plantings of pin oaks , kahikatea , blue gum and walnut . It 's fitting that trees are so prominent in their approach because the name of the area , Orakau , means ' place of trees ' . <p> " But you ca n't do it all at once , " says Rose , " so we 're fortunate this farm has been in the family this long . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next generation will . " <p> And Sophia is continuing the tradition . " I buy a bunch of trees and think , ' Where am I going to plant them ? ' We 're lucky to have soil that does n't allow trees to blow over when it 's windy . <p> " We still need more trees , but I 'm mindful of gateways , and getting in and out , as well as where roots could potentially block drains . " <p> Sophia 's latest tree endeavour is to bag up little seedlings growing under the mature oaks , and she 'll plant them elsewhere on the farm in a couple of years ' time . She hopes starting with seedlings that have n't had the tap root cut , and protecting them as they grow , will produce better shade trees than purchasing large saplings . <p> These are just some of the many initiatives taken at Orakau to keep their cows cool as part of their commitment to animal care on-farm . <p> " Our motivation is animal wellbeing for the most part , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days for the second herd because it 's on their way to the dairy . <p> " We try to keep the cows close to the shed during the day and use the far paddocks at night , so cows are n't using up too much energy during the hotter time of the day . <p> " It 's uncomfortable for us to see them panting . The flow-on effects of planting trees are happier cows that move a little easier , as they can manage the heat . " <p> The Hunts allow their cows to move at a ' glacial pace ' and to take as long as they need drinking before leaving the paddock . <p> There is a trough at the exit from the dairy , and four big troughs on the races , so cows typically have access to at least two troughs on the way to and from milking . This ensures the animals ' water intake is optimum . <p> The Hunts describe their acacia glade as a " triple whammy " : it provides shade , feeds the bees , and fixes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in the paddock , so this gives them all a chance to drink , " says Sophia . <p> All troughs are cleaned every two years . There have been sprinklers over the yard for 27 years to mitigate heat . " They are very effective . I 'm not sure if all the cows like them , but we leave enough space so they can avoid the sprinklers if they want to , " says Sophia . <p> Sophia would like to make changes to the milking routine in the summer , but for staffing reasons , has n't changed the routine yet . <p> " I would like to try milking earlier in the morning , with the second milking at midday , and put a shade cloth on the feed pad and the back of the yard . I 'm very aware of the heat radiating from the concrete onto the cows . " <p> Hot tips for cool cows <p> Sophia 's tips for other farmers wanting to keep their cows comfortable in summer : <p> Make water available in the race and allow cows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush them . <p> Manage paddock selection to avoid long walks in the heat of the day . <p> Misting fans make a huge difference for the cows , as well as helping with flies and making cups easier to clean . <p> Try to plant a few trees every year . When planted in the right place at the right time of year , and fenced for protection , you should have a good strike rate . <p> For many in the dairy industry June 1 means one thing -- time to move . As the new season starts , thousands of sharemilkers pack their cows into stock trucks and move equipment and families to new farms . <p> The recent visit by Professor Aalt Dijkhuizen , president of Topsector Agri and Food in the Netherlands , raised some interesting points about how New Zealand dairy farmers can learn from their Dutch counterparts . <p> Obviously not wishing to get left behind by some of its competitors , Italian manufacturer Merlo is planning to add to its green-liveried telehandler range- with another set of green credentials in the shape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

More than 3500 New Zealand men are diagnosed with prostate cancer and more than 50 die of it each month . Prostate cancer is a greatly under-served health problem in NZ compared to other cancers , says the Prostate Cancer Foundation . <p> The reasons for this include : <p> * Lack of access or inequitable access to screening tools and treatments for prostate cancer that are routinely available in other countries , including Australia . <p> * Lack of public health funding for specialist treatments that are thus only available to a small number of men who can afford them . <p> * Current Ministry of Health 's ( MoH ) advice to general practitioners against routine PSA screening despite robust evidence of its ability to save lives . <p> * Failure of the MoH to promote to GPs its own document on prostate cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services for the physical and psychological effects of prostate cancer treatments ( e.g. failure to fund erectile dysfunction drugs for men at a cost of less than $2 a week ; lack of access to psychological counselling and to dietary and exercise advice . ) <p> The result is that men in NZ are missing out -- particularly if they are poor , rural , or Maori . The Prostate Cancer Foundation has a significant role in promoting public awareness of this disease . With over 3500 Kiwi men being diagnosed each year , and with early detection leading to better outcomes , it is important that men are aware of the signs of potential disease and of the checking and screening tests that are available from their doctor . <p> Key messages <p> * Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in New Zealand men -- 1 in 8 men will develop prostate cancer in their lifetime . <p> * About 3500 NZ men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year .

Till then , we remain a capital city with no public transport from our airport . <p> And the week ended with Andy Foster amazing us by saying that LGWM was not set up to deliver what the city needs , comments which he made after a report ( weirdly titled a ' health report ' ) which said that LGWM is at risk of failure because of capability gaps and under resourcing and a need to address affordability and delivery constraints . The report said there was " little evidence of detailed design , operationalisation ( there 's a word ) or implementation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report had come from , but the mayor thanked his CEO and the LGWM board for commissioning it . Is the board now accepting responsibility for the failures outlined in the health report ? <p> A few weeks earlier , the DomPost 's Damian George had reported ( and not for the first time ) on some of the LGWM failures to deliver , including the fact that work on a new long-awaited pedestrian crossing on Cobham Drive was supposed to have started last year ; instead , all we 're getting is more public consultation sometime this year . <p> Early last week , the Regional Council asked us to tell it what we think of the bus and train services provided by its Metlink company . But on the same day as it appealed for this information , it told us it had completed a survey in which customer satisfaction had risen to 94 per cent . How much more satisfaction does it need to be told about ? Is it suspicious of its survey ? Or are there different departments inside the council , working separately from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a wordy press release , the city council said its long term plan had two pillars -- resilience and infrastructure -- and needed capital investment " the largest the city had ever made . " Then a thousand words later it revealed that councillors have been told they must increase the rates by 14 per cent or 17 per cent or 23 per cent . In the words of an old popular song : which will they choose ? None of the increases sounded acceptable , especially for ratepayers ( so many of them ) on fixed incomes , even if they recognise that the breaking pipes need fixing . <p> Mayor Andy , never at a loss for words , qualified this open-ended forecast by saying the council must ensure " we do not spend more than we can afford . " A wise statement no doubt , but challengeable at a time when work on the unpopular convention centre and its empty exhibition spaces ( are they really affordable ? ) continues unabated . <p> He also said the city council has had to make some hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us , leaving us to guess what the council has decided it ca n't afford to pay for -- whatever new level of rates is being considered .

The latest is the middle of NEXT year . <p> Local , 15 . February 2021 , 11:54 <p> Alan you are correct . A Regional Council statement ( one of many rather unhelpful statements on transport over the last week or so ) said we will have an airport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered and more and more consultation with us ! July 22 is just before next year 's local body election , as it happens . Unfortunately this does not marry up with a GraemeCA comment which said that tenders had been called by WIAL ( the mayor is a Board member ) and one awarded to Tranzit . Does that mean that ratepayers ( through a lesser dividend ) will be liable for a cancelled contract ? <p> Why did the mayor in a Feb 9 GWRC statement say he was delighted to " be part of the conversation " ... and presumably welcome another calling of a further tenders this time by GWRC . Do we really need or want more and more " conversation " . <p> How many politicians does it take to get a bus to go to the airport ? I for one ( of many ) need a bus to and from the airport of the Capital City of NZ well before the local body election ... actually I need it in five days ' time . This is all just irresponsible and plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 12:22 <p> A most worrying point is the statement from Mayor Foster saying " the city council has had to make some hard decisions . " When and how did it make these " hard decisions " ? What resolutions were passed and which of our lavishly inclined councillors voted to spend so much ? Will somebody please ask for this " official " information and let us know the answers ? <p> David Mackenzie , 15 . February 2021 , 13:12 <p> " Operationalisation " is a gem of a word . Does it mean " putting to work " , or something like that ? Working or operating is not what anything emerging from the recondite decision-making factory of the council has achieved in living memory . <p> Movement to the airport , a vital transport hub should merely cover costs , not be a money-making venture . In fact the whole air-port should exist to facilitate movements not to add costs to them . <p> Mike Mellor , 15 . February 2021 , 14:20 <p> Local , apparently while Wellington Airport had selected Tranzit to operate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact been signed . <p> One factor that makes the airport service different from every other bus service in the region is that Wellington Airport controls access to its site , and charges commercial operators to use it , with NZ Bus paying about $250,000 a year for the right to operate the Flyer . When both were majority owned by Infratil it could be seen as just a paper transaction , but when Infratil sold NZ Bus it became real money . <p> It 's unclear to me why GWRC is consulting about providing an airport bus route , since the Regional Public Transport Plan dating from 2014 already allows for such a service to be provided from Wellington Station if NZ Bus gives notice to withdraw the Flyer , as it did last November . <p> bsmith , 15 .

February 2021 , 17:26 <p> Mike Mellor : I quote here GrahamCA on this site , just 12 days ago . He is one who knows : <p> " The " background " ignores the facts that the NZ Bus contract was due to expire and the Airport Company had called for tenders for a new service . Several operators , including NZ Bus , reportedly expressed interest and , according to media reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal tenders after which WIAL announced they had awarded the contract to Tranzit . NZ Bus immediately announced the termination of the current operation . <p> So for the past four or five months Tranzit have been working on acquiring new vehicles for the defined service only to discover , apparently , that the officers of the GWRC had been working diligently to replace a commercial service with a ratepayer/taxpayer funded operation " <p> So who and what to believe ? Quite frankly , I just do not believe that there needs to be all these shenanigans . <p> In reality we are talking about one busstop.We have the buses-they came from Auckland , dirty smelly diesels , and apparently Tranzit has sought some new ones . <p> It 's no wonder Wellington 's pipes ca n't be fixed , LGWM is going nowhere , the future housing needs for Wellington are based on inaccurate perpetually changing population projections , and half of civic centre is going to be demolished .

February 2021 , 17:36 <p> The simple reason why there is no bus service to the airport is because WIAL do not want public transport taking away potential parking revenue .. their biggest earner ! The WCC as a minority shareholder has a glaring conflict of interest ... it 's the dosh or the bus ! <p> Helene Ritchie , 15 . February 2021 , 17:47 <p> Really ? The Central Library could have been fixed and opened 8 years ago when engineers commissioned by the staff recommended thid in a report which I happened to " come upon " which was never presented to Council . It was never damaged by an earthquake ( according to one of original architects who stated this at a public meeting 2019 ) , contrary to a the myth perpetuated by the Council in the recent consultations over what to do with it after Council suddenly closed it . It could still be fixed and opened for about a quarter of the cost of the ' nice to have new build ' library project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affordable . ( What has changed in the few months since that vote ? The fiscal challenges must have been known by the Council then . ) But because the library has been deliberately left derelict for so long now , the interior is likely in much worse shape , and with most of the books etc. have been carted away to some warehouse in the back of Johnsonville . I despair at such civic vandalism . Dereliction comes to mind .... <p> Andrew , 15 .

Let me try and shed some light on the Airport bus service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do with Metlink . It was operated by NZ Bus on contract to the Airport -- a contract formed at a time when the Airport Company and NZ Bus were both owned by Infratil . <p> In mid 2018 NZ Bus " revamped " the Flyer Service -- this involved ripping out the Snapper machines , removing the RTI capability and jacking up the price . Consequence = patronage fell through the floor way before Covid appeared on our shores . In fact , by my estimate NZ Bus could not have done a better job to kill off the service . The Airport Company meantime sat idly by .... because they get their clip of the ticket regardless of patronage . In the end NZ Bus made the only decision they could -- they exited at about the time when their contract fell due . They must surely have been bleeding money to this point -- in fact the only bright spot is likely to have been the $$$ received from advertising revenue . <p> In anticipation that the contract was coming to an end , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that Tranzit were selected as preferred provider but no contract was formed . Why ? Well air travel has flat lined to a new level and does not look likely to move from that level for six months or more -- perhaps not too compelling a commercial case if you also have to order new buses and take all the risk . <p> Under the Public Transport Operating Model ( PTOM ) GWRC is discouraged from running subsidised services if there is already a commercial service in place . I.e. as long as NZ Bus operated the Airport Flyer it would have been difficult ( read nigh on impossible ) to get NZTA to commit to a service -- I.e. to pay their share . <p> GWRC supports the need for a reliable airport service that is properly bolted into the Metlink network . While we are not looking to step in whenever a commercial service falls over we need to prepare for when air service patronage takes off again ( yes , I know -- a pun ) . Turns out it 's not quite as simple as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of buses to start running between the Airport and the Rail station . Here are some of the processes we need to work through : <p> A ) if we want to tender a route it needs to be part of a PTOM unit .... and there is no unit between these two points -- so first off a PTOM unit has to be created and there is a prescribed process for doing this -- a process that the government has prescribed in the Public Transport Operating Model ( remember that if we deviate from the model we are unlikely to get the appropriate government contribution for the service ) . So , last week we started the process to confirm the PTOM unit and you now have the opportunity to make your thoughts known on this in your feedback on the draft Wellington Regional Public Transport Plan -- www : **41;278;TOOLONG ... B ) before we embark on the PTOM unit process , we need to confirm arrangements with the Airport Company -- this is their property and we have no rights over their facilities so we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it , the Airport Company will be looking to clip the ticket -- so this is a negotiation process with GWRC looking for the best deal for users and ratepayers and the Airport Company looking for the best deal for its shareholders ( which ironically includes WCC ) . <p> C ) once the PTOM unit is confirmed we are then obligated to tender for the service -- the same as for all other subsidised bus services . That process will take several months to allow operators to organise to put tenders forward , and then a few more months to evaluate the tenders -- which often involves quite a lot of fact checking etc . <p> D ) once a contract is formed with a preferred provider , the provider then has to turn around and order new buses for the route -- remember that we are not accepting any more diesels into the fleet so these will be new electric which are speced for this route ( luggage racks etc ) . <p> E ) Order time for new electrics is at least 6 months , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Metlink buses . <p> Once you have done all of this .... roll on mid-2022 . In the meantime patronage remains very low . <p> Alternative ? Wait around for a commercial operator to form an agreement with the Airport Company and trust that it will be a lasting agreement providing an appropriate level of frequency and price . <p> Some additional points : a ) new service will have snapper and RTI b ) GWRC would look to find a price point that attracts more people onto the Airport Service ... but it is unlikely to be the same $5 cash fare as per the No 2 Route ( the Airport Company will make sure of this ) . <p> Mike Mellor makes a valid point . We are consulting on the proposed service because we are now in the very real situation of having to commit ratepayer funds . In the light of many other priorities the question to people from the Wellington Region is how much do you value this service ? <p> Hope this clarifies some issues , as well as introducing you to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have asked to be reviewed ! ) . <p> Toni , 15 . February 2021 , 23:32 <p> Forget the hard decisions -- there is one very easy solution , and that is to immediately withdraw the rest of the WCC $1.3 billion going to LGWM , especially when our Mayor has said it is not up to delivering what the city needs . So why are we wasting anymore money on something that is not delivering when the city is in a funding crisis . <p> Local , 16 . February 2021 , 9:29 <p> Gosh Daran . Patronage is actually non existent . No bus . No patronage . Please do not ask me to submit anything on this . It is plainly ridiculous to consult " because it is ratepayer 's money ... " every time . I just need a bus not another explanation : <p> Step one : Get bus from bus shed Step two : Put up sign that says " Busstop " Step three : Pay a small amount to WIAL for the busstop ( or ask them to be a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ source of their income . Step four : Allow Gold card ( Govt subsidised ) Step five : Agree to take cash or eftpos on the bus . Forget about Snapper complications -- passengers from outside Wellington do n't have Snapper . Step six : Put up plastic covered timetables so that people know when the bus is coming and going . <p> OR : <p> Just amend the Number 2 route by one extra stop . <p> Go on I dare you to take action . By tomorrow or maybe the next day . After all it 's only a busstop . Can the council organise a bus stop ? <p> Daran Ponter , 16 . February 2021 , 11:01 <p> @ Local Good luck with that . Welcome to PTOM and the bureaucracy of public transport administration . And do n't forget that at the end of the day your proposal involves using ratepayer and taxpayer funds ( which is not a reason for not acting , but it is a reason to be cautious ) . <p> Regarding amending the Route 2 -- negotiation required with Wellington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will clip the ticket ) . This is their land -- we have no rights on their premises . I 'll leave it for you to explain to No 2 users why their journeys will now take 10 minutes longer . <p> At this stage the No 2 to/from Broadway will remain the primary public bus service to and from the Airport . The Airport now have an enhanced shuttle service ( Co-op taxis ) which is offering competitive fares to the City . <p> Ruth , 16 . February 2021 , 12:00 <p> Well here 's yet another problem with having given WIAL Stewart Duff Drive which was previously a public road . If we had kept it as it was , a bus could have driven along it and stopped for free . <p> greenwelly , 16 . February 2021 , 13:12 <p> @Ruth , According to this , WIAL were never given Stewart Duff Drive , it 's not ( and never was ? ) a legal road in any sense public or private . <p> Dave B , 16 . February 2021 , 17:14 <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ via Miramar shops ? The No2M Miramar bus already services the Miramar shops . Can the No2S not run via Calabar Road and have an airport stop just as it turns into Broadway ? This is as close it can get to the airport without encroaching on WIAL 's sacred turf and incurring their ridiculous penalty . True , this would halve the frequency of service at Miramar shops , but it would significantly speed up the Seatoun service . <p> And ca n't WCC ( as a significant WIAL shareholder ) put pressure on WIAL 's miserly management to stop penalizing public transport access to a major public-transport facility ? Or perhaps the government should step in and nationalize the airport . <p> Hugh Rennie QC , 16 . February 2021 , 17:30 <p> An airport bus service does not require subsidy or other public funds . The previous one did not . It need not be " bolted into " the Metlink network . It does not much matter whether it takes Snapper , which has had its day . Paywave cards will soon replace it and similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening overseas . I used the old service regularly on business and also some vacation travel until it was collapsed in 2018 . Once it was removed from Metlink 's " sometimes it works " sign system , you did not know when it would arrive . Both Wellington and Regional Councils have allowed WIAL ( one third owned by WCC ) to capture stealthily all control of the airport area then charge monopoly prices . The current District Plan has as an airport objective : " 10.2.4.4 Strengthen the identity of the Broadway area as an important gateway to the airport and to the residential suburbs of Strathmore and Seatoun . " Instead the Council surrendered the public road ( Stewart Duff Drive ) to WIAL and did nothing to preserve that gateway for our use , including for bus transport . Was that road ever legally closed , or the land paid for by WIAL ? The non-airfare cost of using the airport has risen and risen .

@@32591232 <h> The strange hijacking of RNZ 's US debate preview <p> It 's normal to feature two different perspectives discussing a major US political set piece . Yet this morning RNZ 's flagship Morning Report hosted two unabashed Trump acolytes ahead of the final debate . <p> At 2pm New Zealand time , the final debate between president Donald Trump and his challenger , Joe Biden , takes place in Nashville , Tennessee . It 's Trump 's last big chance to sway the voters that have turned against him , and so it made sense that Morning Report would bring on a couple of US political commentators to discuss the issues likely to come up at the debate . What many listeners may have found surprising was RNZ 's choice of guests . The two invited to speak to RNZ 's flagship news programme were Ashe Schow , a senior editor for The Daily Wire -- the Ben Shapiro co-founded website which publishes some truly toxic content and is alleged to have knowingly circulated misinformation on Facebook -- and David Harsanyi , a senior writer at the National Review , one of America 's most famous conservative magazines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People Have Spoken ( and They Are Wrong ) : The Case Against Democracy . <p> Together , Schow and Harsanyi supplied Morning Report with nine minutes of Trump talking points , their focus largely on allegations concerning Hunter Biden , Joe Biden 's son . Schow likened the Bidens to the mafia and claimed that Joe Biden had " used his son in order to enrich himself " . Harsanyi chimed in to agree . " There is a lot of evidence that Joe Biden could have benefitted from the things that Hunter was doing , " he said . <p> What 's the obsession with Hunter Biden , again ? You may remember his focal role in the impeachment proceedings against Trump earlier this year , and he 's back in the news thanks to some dubiously sourced emails published in the tabloid New York Post on October 14 . Most of these emails -- released via Trump 's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani , who is currently dealing with his own embarrassing revelations -- are relatively trivial ( and also occasionally genuinely touching ) personal messages exchanged with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on one email they claim as proof that Joe Biden met with an adviser to Ukrainian energy company Burisma , where Hunter Biden was a board member . It should be noted that the email neither substantiates the claim -- the adviser thanks Hunter Biden for " the opportunity " to meet his father , but there is no proof any meeting ever took place -- nor has it been shown to be authentic . Doubts about the veracity and sourcing of the story caused New York Post reporters to refuse to attach their bylines to it , and prompted Facebook and Twitter to throttle its circulation . <p> Still , Schow and Harsanyi argued , the US media should be covering the emails in the same way they treated the leak of Hillary Clinton 's emails four years ago -- turning it into a story that many believe played a decisive role in handing the 2016 election to Trump . Said Harsanyi , " I 'm not saying you have to run a story saying the Biden allegation was true , but certainly that was enough evidence to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far lower standards of evidence . " <p> Later , Schow claimed Joe Biden had threatened to ban fracking ( he has not ) , and that today 's debate moderator , Kristin Welker , will use " the mute button " to disadvantage Trump ( she ca n't -- the debaters will be automatically muted during each other 's opening statements ; Welker has no " mute button " of her own ) . According to Schow , Welker " has shown a bias towards Democrats in the past , so she 's certainly going to use the button against Trump " . <p> During the interview , presenter Corin Dann repeatedly challenged both guests on their claims , and told listeners that Schow is a " right-leaning " writer . However no such label was attached to Dann 's other guest . Harsanyi 's worldview is clear : as well as his role at the National Review , he is a columnist for the New York Post , the newspaper that was the focus of today 's interview -- an important fact that went undisclosed . As an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : The Disasters Unleashed by Obama 's Reelection ; and Nanny State : How Food Fascists , Teetotaling Do-Gooders , Priggish Moralists , and other Boneheaded Bureaucrats are Turning America into a Nation of Children . <p> Having been given nearly 10 minutes to tag team attacks on Biden with a fellow " right-leaning " commentator , Harsanyi could n't help feeling a little smug . " I think a New Zealand program accidentally invited me on with @AsheSchow thinking I was going to be a liberal and debate her , " he tweeted this morning . " That did n't work out .

@@32591233 <h> How to cosplay when you 're terrified of costumes <p> Sacha Judd was never into costume parties , but when Mythbusters ' Adam Savage invited her to Comic-Con she gave it a shot . She writes about learning to build a costume from scratch . <p> In March this year , the students at North Bergen High School in New Jersey staged a two-night production of Alien : The Play . With a budget of about NZ$5,500 and using recycled and other materials , these high school students managed to recreate complicated space suits , spaceship interiors and fully functioning aliens to bring the 1979 sci-fi classic to life . <p> The play is an extraordinary thing , which you can now watch online . The performance went viral , and the student cast received praise from the movie 's director Ridley Scott and a visit from the star herself , Sigourney Weaver . <p> Last week , I was lucky enough to go to North Bergen High , meet some of the students who worked on the production , and see their incredible creations . <p> These are talented kids who repurpose what they have available to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junk , broken toys , and yes -- props from other productions that have been sacrificed to the cause . <p> The top half of Groot , from their giant Avengers models , became part of the alien . Also pictured , a five-foot Millennium Falcon , and a full-size Iron Throne . <p> I was in North Bergen with Adam Savage . The Mythbusters host , who now presents Savage Builds and releases his own incredible work on Tested.com , is a lifelong maker and creator . Adam was in New York for Comic-Con and one of his great loves : cosplay . <p> At its most straightforward , cosplay is dressing up in costume as a character you love from a film , television show or comic book . Fan conventions like Comic-Con attract cosplayers in their thousands , wearing everything from an outfit they purchased on Amazon to ones they have laboured over for months . <p> Adam 's love for cosplay is so well-known he gave a TED talk on it . Every year , he attends the major fan conventions with a new " incognito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . <p> So when Adam messaged me a couple of months ago suggesting I cosplay with him at New York Comic-Con , the largest pop culture convention in the United States , I panicked . It might have been the most intimidating invitation I 've received in my life . I love fandom in all its enormous creative weird variety , but costumes are never something I 've gotten on board with . I was always the person who waited until the last minute before the office Christmas party and rented something I hated from a hire shop or did n't dress up at all . <p> I polled all my friends and had a few good suggestions : Vice Admiral Holdo from The Last Jedi or Melisandre the Red Woman from Game of Thrones , both costumes I could probably pull off with the right wig and dress . <p> But something was missing . The whole point of cosplay is dressing as something you love , and I did n't have any connection to these characters . I realised I was looking at ideas for something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office Christmas party . <p> So I started to think about what I 'd really been into as a child , and instantly the answer was obvious . I 'd been obsessed with Supermarionation , the shows of Gerry and Sylvia Anderson : Thunderbirds , Joe 90 and Captain Scarlet . And my favourite characters by far were the Angel Interceptor pilots -- glamorous women who also flew fighter jets . They were my first feminist role models . <p> Dressing as a marionette seemed ideal . The costume was relatively simple with one key exception -- the helmet . And the downside of picking a niche fandom from the 60s was there was no buying an Angel helmet on Amazon . If I was going to do this , I was going to have to make it myself . <p> I threw myself at the project in earnest . I watched endless YouTube tutorials . I bought a $2 motorcycle helmet on TradeMe and stared at it for inspiration . I learned how cosplayers make things with foam , with cardboard , with 3D printers , with melty plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were . <p> My own attempts were less successful . My foam helmet involved a lot of me contact-cementing myself to the table . My efforts with a heat gun involved me burning a hole in the fibreglass of the motorcycle helmet I was using as a mould . And then sticking the plastic to itself . And then to the heat gun . My first papier-m ? ch ? attempt adhered so solidly to the mould ( despite using vaseline as instructed ) that I had to chisel it off in chunks . <p> Nevertheless , I persisted . <p> Eventually I had a papier-m ? ch ? base that looked promising , gumboots that I 'd painted white , and a dream . <p> I relocated to my parents ' house , where my mum can sew brilliantly and my dad has loads of tools . " Surprise ! " I said , " We 're making a helmet ! " . Luckily they 're both retired , up for pretty much anything , and also extremely crafty . <p> Meanwhile , my brother started trolling me from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this I needed to do it properly and make sure the Angel 's epaulettes lit up , the way they did on the show . He suggested using Christmas lights . I started Googling " LED cosplay " . Eventually a trip to a party store produced the perfect components . Sometimes you just need to think laterally . <p> Anyway . Over two days we sewed and glued and cut and stared at the pictures on the computer screen arguing about colour and distance and size . The helmet came out beautifully . <p> And so on Thursday afternoon in New York , I got dressed up as Rhapsody Angel : red wig , flashing epaulettes and all . <p> I felt so incredibly vulnerable and exposed walking through my hotel lobby with everyone staring at me , it was awful . But as I stepped out onto 42nd Street in midtown Manhattan , the first person who saw me yelled , " GERRY ANDERSON , MAN ! NO ONE REMEMBERS HIM ANY MORE ! " . I burst out laughing and said , " I did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoulder as he crossed the road , " YOU LOOK AMAZING ! " and suddenly I felt like maybe I did . <p> Adam and I walked the convention floor , stopping for photos , admiring other costumes , and it was incredible to be part of this sprawling , amazing celebration of the things people love . <p> Sacha and Adam Savage , masks on <p> Sacha and Adam Savage , masks off <p> Adam often says that cosplay is n't about a performer-audience relationship , and I saw instantly what he meant . There 's something communal about the whole thing . The parents whose baby was wearing a fully knitted Flash outfit . The girl towing her friend in costume on rollerskates across 11th Avenue . The way everyone at the sinks in the bathroom said to one another , " I love your costume , you look amazing . " All of the many , many Harley Quinns : <p> This is n't about one person performing for an audience . It 's about everyone celebrating what they love together . <p> I kept thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proudly showed us the costumes they were making for Comic Con : Halo armour , a Steven Universe shield , Robin 's mask . The sheer force of creativity on display and the staggering variety of things people cared about all around me was awesome . <p> I do n't know if I 'll cosplay again -- costumes are still terrifying to me -- but I 'm so glad I did it once and I ca n't recommend it strongly enough . There was so much joy in the whole experience . Get along to your local convention . Armageddon is on in Auckland at the end of the month . Think of something you loved a long time ago , or enjoy right now , and bring it to life in some small way .

Our current comment policy is here . <p> The final manifestation of central bankers ' insane folly is the promise that endless wealth can be yours if only you join the speculative extremes racing over the cliff.This madness is now global , so next up : Global Depression . The story of the past year has n't changed : that blowing an even bigger speculative asset bubble is the sure cure ; the latest " fix " to the pandemic will make it go away forever and ever , and everything that was broken before the pandemic will magically be restored by the magic of ever larger and more precarious speculative asset bubbles . <p> Forget the SLR " cliff " , why are dealers so reluctant to take on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desire to do more and better like they used to so easily and readily ? Instead , at times like these the closest thing to useful gossip we have is ... Treasury bills.Link <p> The safer the assets , the lower the applied " risk weighting " the net result being a higher capital ratio rewarding the bank for appearing itself uncontroversial or risky . The issue had been in how the rules allowed for creating " safe " assets out of those otherwise often of extreme risk -- employing , mostly , securitization strategies . <p> Is the RBNZ FLP scheme facilitating banks in their endeavours to further securitise mortgages into Residential Mortgage Backed Securities ( RMBS ) which are eligible for sale and repurchase for a three year period and effectively leave a greater proportion of the not so secure mortgage assets for unsecured bank creditors to deal with ? <p> - Re-establishing businesses that were previously out-sourced ( globalised ) ? - Reducing the number of imported additional people that we will have to feed , cloth and provide ongoing welfare for as they age ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shrink to the most efficient of operators ? <p> Nope . <p> We are smarter than that . We are going to ramp up property prices to even more extreme and unstable levels ( just what the RBNZ wants ! ) , and that will save us . Not only that , but we are going to load up our people with crushing Personal Debt , on top of the ever larger Public Debt ( that 's theirs as well ) in the hope of what ? Inflation , to ' make the debt loads look smaller ' in real terms ? As I keep saying - it 's madness . <p> The question is what drives inflation . To some extent Reserve Banks can apply some temporary pressure with their " tools " . However to produce inflation over any horizon we would need to move investment in productive areas of our economy , that would feed improvements in productivity which in turn would feed through to wages and consequently drive CPI and rates upwards . <p> The economies of western countries have been neutralised at the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ productive areas of our economy . <p> Just for fun on a lazy Saturday morning , and a pr ? cis from the comments section of the " Telegraph " in the UK this morning ( so it 's ' not just us ' that have the same concerns ) <p> Global policy makers are on economic suicide missions . <p> Bankers make the most money when they are driving your economy into a financial crisis . They will load your economy up with their debt products until you get a financial crisis . The financial crisis appears to come out of a clear blue sky when you use economics that does n't consider debt , <p> Economists do identify where real wealth creation in the economy occurs , but this is a most inconvenient truth as it reveals many at the top do n't actually create any wealth . Much of their money comes from wealth extraction rather than wealth creation , and they need to get everyone thoroughly confused , so we do n't realize what they are really up to . They need to confuse making money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth . How do you achieve it when you do n't know what real wealth creation is ? <p> We thought small state , unregulated capitalism was something that it was n't as our ideas came from neoclassical economics , which has little connection with classical economics . On bringing neoclassical economics back again , we had lost everything that had been learned in the 1930s and 1940s . <p> Mariner Eccles , FED chair 1934 -- 48 , observed what the capital accumulation of neoclassical economics did to the US economy in the 1920s : <p> " a giant suction pump had by 1929 to 1930 drawn into a few hands an increasing proportion of currently produced wealth . This served then as capital accumulations . But by taking purchasing power out of the hands of mass consumers , the savers denied themselves the kind of effective demand for their products which would justify reinvestment of the capital accumulation in new plants . In consequence as in a poker game where the chips were concentrated in fewer and fewer hands , the other fellows could stay in the game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game stopped " <p> Now BTC has hit a 1T market cap things get really interesting . Many of the worlds largest investment institutions such as pension funds , are simply not allowed to invest in an asset that sits under this level . Once an financial vehicle passes the Trillion dollar level , the possibility of total failure becomes extremely low . I believe we 've now passed the point of no return as a legitimate asset class . Expect to see investment announcements accelerate . <p> Aggregate data on the use FX swaps and FX forwards can be obtained from the BIS derivatives statistics.2 The BIS OTC derivatives data ( OTC data ) show that the total amount outstanding at end-June 2019 neared $86 trillion ( Graph 2 , first panel ) , with FX swaps accounting for an estimated three quarters of this total . Not surprisingly , the US dollar is almost always one of the two currencies exchanged ( 89% ) . Roughly three quarters of outstanding positions had a maturity of less than one year , but turnover data show that the modal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Many of the world 's largest investment institutions such as pension funds , are simply not allowed to invest in an asset that sits under ( $1T ) " Really ? So they ca n't invest in , say , Ford Motor Company , that has a capitalisation of ' only ' $50 billion ? Maybe Ford shares are n't classified as an asset ? <p> Congress made it more difficult for brokers to process transactions in stocks priced lower than $5 each , the cutoff point below which a stock earns the " penny stock " label . These regulations were put into place following a broad crackdown in the early 1990s . <p> Ford is an individual company that trades on the NYSE , they deal daily with equities worth 23T . Bitcoin is an entirely new asset class . They do n't get involved below the 1T level , as there is simply not enough liquidity for the amount of money they deal with . The rules across the world differ by country but they are very heavily restricted .

Where are you and why are you silent . Even when forced to speak will come with 5 year plan despite house prices rising on a weekly basis . <p> LVR will not have much impact ( that is one reason reintroducing ) now as anyone owning a property has seen 30% to 50% rise in last fewmonths which can be used as equity offsetting any ibtended restriction . Just like mention of low ibterest rate makes house more affordable is a farce as house price has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate is offsett by rising house price - infact now have more mortage to repay at the end of the term so it has not helped FHB but politicians who own multiple house . <p> Housing and infrastructure are n't sexy policies that attract voters on net .

Since the mid 90s increasing rents and house price inflation has pretty much been out of control . The population growth has been the highest in Akld . House price inflation has been the highest in Akld . Coincidence ? I doubt it . <p> Even when media or so called experts throw idea to controll the speculation , throw extreme ideas just to off track the debate like banning investors , which is not possible so why even suggest but can put restriction on investors . <p> Speculators in any market can not and should not be banned . But , they should use their own money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consequences in their entirety . <p> Remove lending for any established residential property beyond one property per taxpayer . Let those who want to own more than one property do so with their own cash . LVR of 0% , in effect , for any secondary residential property per taxpayer . If you want to speculate and get a secondary mortgage , then you have to build a new dwelling , and even then , the LVR of 40% looks generous . <p> Speculators in any market can not and should not be banned . But , they should use their own money , and benefit from the risks they take or suffer the consequences in their entirety . <p> Yes . If the central / commercial banks are allowed to destroy the value of labor and debase the money supply through this malarkey , how do you explain that to young people who have to suffer the consequences of and accept the responsibility for it all ?

These are the guiding documents that will shape road and public transport priorities for Marlborough and Nelson/Tasman for the next six years . <p> Submissions open today and close on 19 March . Hearings will be held on 15 April . <p> Chairman of the Marlborough Regional Transport Committee , Councillor Francis Maher , said the RLTP was an important document which underpinned the region 's road and transport planning and confirmed investment priorities on both the state highway and local roads . It is a collaboration between Marlborough District Council , Nelson City Council and Tasman District Council and is required under the Land Transport Management Act 2008 ( LTMA ) . <p> " Our three councils have created a joint RLTP , in conjunction with Waka Kotahi ( New Zealand Transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions we have here at the top of the south , " he said . It also draws on the work of the South Island Regional Transport Committee . <p> " We are competing against other regions nationally for a share of the funds available and the collective process of ranking our regional projects using Waka Kotahi 's methodology gives them additional context to inform the decision making , " said Clr Maher . <p> The Interisland Resilient Connection ( iREX ) Project to upgrade the interisland ferries , and the construction of an overbridge required in Dublin Street Picton as a result , has come out top of the list of significant regional projects in the RLTP . This is expected to cost $17m . <p> " This project has the highest priority , a ranking ratified by all three councils . The iREX project is of national significance and will have an impact not only on roading at the top of the south but all of New Zealand , " said Clr Maher . <p> The ' improvement projects ' are the highest cost projects for the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 years and represent the highest priorities for the region . Other significant improvement projects ( $2m and over ) that have made the priority list from Marlborough are : <p> Weld Pass , included in the 2018 RLTP as a safety project due to the high crash rate and to improve the network performance particularly for freight , is presently on hold . " The RLTP states , however , that without these improvements , the freight route between the North Island and Christchurch is compromised . We will continue to push for this in the longer term , " said Clr Maher . <p> The majority of freight moved around Te Tauihu is by road . State Highway 1 from Picton south is a nationally significant freight route . Five million tonnes of freight with an estimated value of $20 billion crosses Cook Strait annually . More freight goes from north to south than south to north , reflecting the importance of the Cook Strait ferries to the South Island economy . Cook Strait freight is forecast to grow by 35% over the next 20 years . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing transport network may not be fit for purpose for the future . The RLTP identifies the key transport issues for the next 10 years as : <p> vehicle usage growth and its effects on access <p> safety on roads <p> the design of the transport system limiting those wanting to use more sustainable options <p> communities being susceptible to losing access in more frequent weather events <p> the effect of vehicles on the natural environment <p> " The vision of this RLTP is to have a safe and connected region that is liveable , accessible and sustainable , " said Clr Maher . " The next three years are likely to be tight for funding so we will be focussed on maintaining and maximising the current network to cope with more people with an eye to sustainable transport .

In Marlborough 3.6% of the population cycle to work versus 2.2% nationally . All three Councils have a strategy to increase the uptake of walking and cycling . <p> The Marlborough Regional Public Transport Plan ( MRPTP ) is a stand-alone document which sits within the wider RLTP . It is required under the Land Transport Management Act 2003 , and Land Transport Management Act Amendment Act 2013 ( LTMA ) . <p> " The MRPTP sets out our Council 's intentions and policies regarding public transport in Marlborough , " said Sustainable Transport Manager Braden Prideaux . <p> It proposes a continuation of the Blenheim bus services ( North and South routes ) , as well as continued support of the Supergold scheme that provides those with a Supergold card ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) on Council bus services .

And in last month 's Monetary Policy Statement the RBNZ said the banking system is operationally ready for negative interest rates , with its Monetary Policy Committee prepared to lower the OCR from 0.25% to provide additional stimulus if required . <p> Negative interest rate policies have proven their ability to stimulate inflation and output by roughly as much as comparable conventional interest rate cuts or other unconventional monetary policies . For example , some estimate that negative interest rate policies were up to 90 percent as effective as conventional monetary policy . They also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank rates . <p> Deposit rates for corporate deposits have dropped more than those on retail deposits -- because it is costlier for companies than for individuals to switch into cash . Bank lending volumes have generally increased . And since neither banks nor their customers have markedly shifted to cash , interest rates can probably become even more negative before that happens . <p> Brandao-Marques and Gelos come across as pretty gung-ho about negative interest rates . I imagine a few savers in countries where they 've been applied may disagree ... <p> In sum , the evidence so far indicates negative interest rate policies have succeeded in easing financial conditions without raising significant financial stability concerns . Thus , central banks that adopted negative rates may be able to cut them further . And those non-adopting central banks should not rule out adding a similar policy to their toolkit -- even if they may be unlikely to use it . <p> In a submission to the New York State Assembly , the Tax Justice Network argues the case for financial transactions taxes ( FTT ) . <p> An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apply a tiny tax rate ( for example , 0.1 percent ) on the value of financial transactions such as the sale of shares or derivatives .

If enacted , it would levy a tax of five cents on every share trade valued over $20 -- so for the median Nasdaq share traded , worth $48 , this would amount to an insignificant 0.1 percent tax . It behaves like a progressive sales tax , vastly lower than the eight percent tax New York residents pay on retail items . <p> The STT would be painless and easy to implement -- and , of course , would prove immensely popular .

" @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaker . <p> Government role is limited and market forces will ultimately determine how things pan out , said Ajay Sahai , director general at the Federation of Indian Export Organisations . <p> " The best thing governments can do is ensure rapid and effective vaccination of their populations so that landside logistics labor capacity and productivity can be restored to pre-pandemic levels , " said Heaney . " That will do a lot to improve the circulation of containers . " <p> New Zealand has been running an MIQ scheme the same scale as Australia ( both countries been allowing around 2000 arrivals a week ) , despite the latter having five times the population . <p> Historian Niall Ferguson is worried about inflation . In this Bloomberg article he compares where the world 's at now with events from the past . Whilst acknowledging he has mistakenly worried about inflation before , Ferguson sees similar concerns today to where the world was at in the 1970s . He notes economist Milton Friedman 's famous comments in 1970 that ; " Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only by a more rapid increase in the quantity of money than in output . " <p> Ferguson also ascribes significant weight to concerns raised by former US Treasury secretary and Harvard University President Lawrence Summers of President Joe Biden 's US$1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus . Whilst suggesting the US Federal Reserve may not fear inflation , Ferguson himself does . <p> In Charles Dickens 's " Great Expectations , " the orphan Pip comes into a fortune from an anonymous benefactor and embarks on the life of a gentleman -- hence his great expectations . Only later does it become clear that the money comes from a dubious source and it ends up being lost altogether : " My great expectations had all dissolved , like our own marsh mists before the sun . " <p> It may ultimately be that our great expectations of inflation will dissolve in a similar way , vindicating Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and making fools of aged economists and bond vigilantes alike . But the resemblances between our situation and the one Milton Friedman described in 1970 are striking -- even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everywhere a monetary phenomenon . <p> Andy Haldane , the Bank of England 's Chief Economist who is also a member of its Monetary Policy Committee , has also been talking about inflation . In a recent speech Haldane suggests COVID-19 's negative impact on global trade , on top of a pre-existing push-back on globalisation , may add inflationary impetus to the global economy . An interesting theory , but once COVID-19 's no longer dominating our lives and with Donald Trump no longer in the White House , will the globalisation agenda gather new steam ? <p> A second supply-side effect working in the same direction is globalisation . The world witnessed many decades of under-interrupted growth in world trade and global value chains after the Second World War , much of it associated with the rising role of China in the world economy.19 On average since 1983 , global trade volumes have risen by around 5 ? % per year , roughly double the rate of growth of the world economy . <p> The Covid crisis has decisively broken those trends . Global trade volumes collapsed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared to a fall in global activity of around 9% ( Chart 16 ) . The crisis saw the fracturing of some global value chains , in part as a result of countries prioritising domestic over international supply of some goods and services . <p> With global trade barriers tending to rise over recent years , and with Covid having provided a further impetus towards localisation , it seems unlikely globalisation will remain as powerful a disinflationary force in the future as it has been in recent decades . And it is certainly possible trends in globalisation could even go into reverse in the period ahead , adding inflationary impetus.20 <p> Remember we welcome robust , respectful and insightful debate . We do n't welcome abusive or defamatory comments and will de-register those repeatedly making such comments . Our current comment policy is here . <p> For every 100 windfalls gained by the property magic beans , there has to be the 1 or 2 hard luck stories . This might be one of them . However , look at the corruption and largesse that happens in Sydney constantly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is structured around the property complex . It stretches right to the top of Aussie 's political structure and is pervasive . <p> Anyway , when I was a student in Japan , we had a kindly Japanese man take a group of foreign students out for dinner and drinks at a Japanese pub 1x per month . He would pay for everything . The guy came from farming stock and his family 's land was appropriated in the 60s to build a train station for many of the new suburbs that sprung up around Japan 's main cities . The family 's livelihood was gone but the govt compensation ensured that they would never have to work again in their lives with more money than most could ever imagine . <p> " Ferguson sees similar concerns today to where the world was at in the 1970s . " <p> Have you had a good look at the economic and social systems of 1970 and those of today , Niall ? Have you had a look at the size of the Global Population increase since 1970 ? And what do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for work - to provide for their welling - when jobs are disappearing faster than at any time since 1970 with technology and outsourcing ? <p> 1970 is n't the yardstick , Niall - 1890 is , when social support mechanisms and central banks , as we know them today , were non-existent . That 's what 's coming as Governments run out of the capacity to provide for their under utilised/ageing populations and leave them to fend for themselves . Not going to happen ? ! It already is . Ask any of our young who are trying to find a job or house themselves . <p> The crux of inflation is this : are the mass of pop facing higher costs increases than they get in wage increases , in a given period . If so , you have a dropping disposable income . Which means , in absence of more printing , that you get a recession . Inflation as measured is not accurate , as most serious commentators acknowledge . CB want inflation to erode debt and now more than ever . At same time they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down bond market . This little trick worked 2009-19 but no longer . No more cuts available and bond holders always lose money in coming scenario , so they want higher premium on their risk . Good luck CB , in fighting the elephant in the room <p> In lieu of increasing wages , we get easier credit access . Which kind of works -- see current house prices -- but it certainly means that pile of debt is n't going anywhere . It seems that the lesson CBs have learned from ' 08 is ' liquidity , liquidity at all costs ! ' Which is essentially the Japanese approach , right ? -- You have so much liquidity that no one ever has to go broke , so you avoid a crash . The result in Japan has been kinda sorta tolerable in real terms -- but they went into it *after* a collapse in asset prices , not before . <p> Which is essentially the Japanese approach , right ? -- You have so much liquidity that no one ever has to go broke , so you avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and h'holds went broke after the bubble . The Japanese banks have much liquidity but h'holds and firms have been paying down debt and not borrowing . It 's completely different to NZ and Australia where the private sector gouges on debt and people spend like drunken sailors . The stories of Japanese arrogance during their bubble are plentiful . And I think that 's much like the arrogance in countries like NZ and Australia who think their bubbles are impregnable . Reality is that even at the peak of its bubble , Japanese h'hold debt to GDP was never as high that of NZ . Many lived within their means . The same can not be said for NZ . <p> Negative interest-rates are all that fit a post-peak society . Ask the Romans .... <p> Financial transaction taxes are not taxing the real , but are stopping the unreal buying the real . Except that the Govt can now buy the real , using the unreal . What is needed , is spending and taxation related to the real . And we 've hell-and-gone from that , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're looking at inflation , a collapse , and then deflation ( if the system holds intact enough ) . <p> Inflation in the 1970 's was caused by the post war baby boom growing up wanting houses , schools and everything else . There was a lot of demand and available resources to satisfy that demand were stretched . There were unions and people were getting good wages so could afford to pay for the building required but capacity did not expand in a timely enough fashion to provide what was demanded . <p> You can expand the money supply if you want but if you do n't expand the capacity of the economy to produce at the same time then you get more money chasing the same amount of products . <p> I do n't think it is the same today . There is an income divide that means that a large proportion of the population do n't get the same sort of wages as people in the 1970 's so ca n't afford to buy a house without a large amount of credit . There is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in NZ so the same constraints in building houses and infrastructure apply regardless of the increase in demand . Today 's demand is more of a pent up temporary phenomenon than a consistent increase in the average income earners buying power . <p> NZ was more of an internal economy in the 1970 's with import substitution industry and tariffs . Covid is generating a small amount of cost associated with the free flow of imports being disrupted in today 's world but I imagine that this will be reversed once the borders reopen . <p> I would say that inflationary tendencies are for 5 to 10 years ahead . Except for what is going to happen with the Biden stimulus . <p> No-one is talking about how the $1.9 trillion to be put into the US economy shortly is going to affect NZ . How is the US deficit spending going to be financed ? Where are all the stimulus cheques going to be spent ? Does New Zealand have a plan for what is going to happen . Hahaha just joking , of course we do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent upwards movement of the bitcoin chart and it looks to me like at least some of the money is going to be spent gambling on crypto and shares . Will there be another wave of liquidity washing around the globe ? Is the our Reserve Bank governor going to be blamed again for something that he has no control over ? <p> Someone recently made the comment that a lot of people are saving for a deposit or have bought a house and re paying off the mortgage so fewer people are spending on other ( consumption ) items . So my reading of this is that money that has gone into the speculative economy is starving the consumer based economy of sales and income . <p> I 'd like to make the point that when the next wave of liquidity arrives on these shores the govt could divert some of this funding into the real economy . The Reserve Bank will face a choice of expanding our own money supply to compensate for other nations expanding their monetary supplies or seeing the dollar rise and NZ industry slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alternative . Money could be spend on New Zealand 's crumbling infrastructure . Bonds could be issued by the Reserve Bank for this purpose rather than this money being pushed onto trading banks balances . It does n't have to be the same dumbo response as the last time . Part of the money that last time went into the speculative economy could be spend on releasing constraints to future growth and productivity instead .

@@32666231 <p> The market for animal genetics is anticipated to witness rise in demand owing to factors such as increasing consumption of animal proteins and rapid global urbanization . To fulfill the continuously rising demand , the preference for genetics to breed high-quality livestock and secure large production has increased . The demand for animal genetics has increased over the years , owing to rise in various animal diseases , increasing prevalence of zoonotic diseases , and rise in adoption of pets &amp; companion animals . <p> According to Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) publication 2017 , livestock contributes almost 40% to the global value of agricultural output , and it supports food security and livelihood of more 1.5 billion people worldwide . However , the increasing land requirement for these animals and grazing is a major environmental concern . Public awareness regarding such concerns is a major reason leading to the shift toward white meat and vegan lifestyle , impeding growth of animal genetics . However , increasing support and research by government organizations to improve productivity is aiding growth . For instance ; Animal Improvement Program Launched in 2014 , by Animal Genomics and Improvement Laboratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization of USDA . The program aims at improving productivity and efficiency of dairy animals &amp; ruminants . <p> The market follows the standards set by International Society of Animal Genetics ( ISAG ) and leading animal research laboratories such as The University of California Davis ( U.C. Davis ) . The ISAG standard panel consists of 18 STR markers , and any company in animal genetics needs to follow the panel and standards set by the authorities . The need for high investments in development of new technology and the duration of product launch are some of the major factors resulting in steady growth . However , increasing population is expected to pose an ongoing challenge due to rise in the need for animal protein , aiding developments in the market . <p> Report Highlights <p> Based on live animal genetic materials , the porcine segment held the largest share in 2020 . This largest share can be attributed to various factors , such as a large consumer base for pork meat and its products , as well as growing penetration of advanced genetic research . Furthermore , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as comparatively limited land requirements and the low need for maintenance of animals . <p> Increasing the shift toward white meat consumption is a major factor leading to higher growth in the poultry segment . Furthermore , pocket-friendliness and low rate of food-related disease transmissions are the major factors propelling genetic research in the poultry segment . Rising government efforts to reduce environmental effects and create awareness in the European countries have led a consumer shift from red meat toward white meat . This shift is expected to create new opportunities for animal genetics to boost white meat production to meet the growing demand . <p> Based on genetic material , the embryo segment held the largest market share in 2020 and is expected to maintain its position during the forecast period . The high segment revenue can be attributed to the higher efficiency of the embryo compared to semen . Embryo transfer in cattle is primarily done to amplify reproduction rates . The cost of importing the embryos is often lower as compared to semen and postnatal animals , and embryo makes it possible to change the breed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the other hand , the semen segment is expected to grow at the fastest CAGR during the forecast period . This high growth can be attributed to increasing adoption of semen sexing and AI for cattle , sheep , pigs , and goats breeding . <p> Based on services , the genetic disease test segment is anticipated to grow at the highest rate during the forecast period . This growth can be attributed to the growing adoption of genomic tests to prevent financial losses and loss of live animal productivity , in the case of farm owners . DNA typing and parentage testing is the most common service provided by animal genetic companies . <p> Growing pet ownership is a major factor leading to the market growth of the genetic disease testing segment . Genetic trait tests , such as tests for coat color , and parentage tests are expected to rise with increasing pet population . Furthermore , genetic disease tests in livestock animals are also expected to grow during the forecast period , to ensure disease-free breed of animals . <p> North America is the largest shareholder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on animal genetics and the adoption of strategic activities by industry players , such as acquisitions . <p> Europe held the second-largest market for animal genetics , majorly due to rising awareness about animal wellbeing and increased expenditure on veterinary services .

@@32680235 <p> Last week Radio New Zealand 's ' Nine to Noon ' programme ran an excellent item based on two quality interviews highlighting the unsavoury outcomes of patient harm data cleansing for those people who require non-acute ( elective ) surgery but are either severely delayed or miss out . <h> Beginning with a personal story <p> The first interview with a self-employed Wellington hairdresser Andrea Clinton in her mid-50s was gut-wrenching . Her arthritis is so bad she ca n't walk more than five steps and is forced to spend $30,000 of her retirement savings to have surgery done privately because she has been declined on the public list . <p> Last September , following a pre-operation assessment , she was advised she would get her hip replacement within six months . This was upended by the Covid-19 national lockdown which led to the cancellation of all elective surgery thereby causing huge delays . Her condition deteriorated and is forced to take pharmaceuticals such as morphine and use crutches . <p> Much of this was sheer bad luck . After all how often do we have a pandemic . But now , despite being in increased pain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &amp; Coast DHB that she does n't meet the threshold for surgery , has to go back to the beginning again , and that her surgery would likely be within three months . This was the tipping point . <p> Being self-employed running a small business meant that financially she was dependent on working as much as possible but already it was a painful struggle to keep working . Consequently she had to go private at great personal cost . Our public hospitals since 2009 should never have been allowed to be so rundown that this despairing case is more typical than atypical . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> The second interview was with Peter Devane , President of New Zealand Orthopaedic Association . While working for the Association of Salaried Medical Specialists for so many years I came to admire orthopaedic surgeons . The clarity of their expression , their love of good methodology and data , and having no concept of ambiguity were impressive . <p> Devane articulated all of this in his interview . Sad and avoidable experiences such as Andrea Clinton were ' business as normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an excellent plain language description of how the current system works for non-acute elective surgery and why patients like Clinton get treated in the way they are . <h> Waiting lists to booking systems <p> I want to go back further in history and to be even blunter than an orthopaedic surgeon ( no mean feat in my view ) . Until the mid-1990s public hospitals had a system of waiting lists for operations . The length of these lists , especially when they increased , became a focal point for the public judging how well governments handled the health system . <p> Waiting lists did have faults . Some of those put on lists found that over time their conditions improved ( which raises a question in itself ) ; some died but remained on it ( rather embarrassing ) ; and some were placed on it in the knowledge that they might never be treated . <p> Waiting lists were being refined and improved as it was the only system available . But when National 's Jenny Shipley was health minister in the mid-1990s waiting lists were replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criteria patients whose scores were above the ' threshold ' were booked in while the rest disappeared from the list . Hence no official waiting lists and political problem solved . <p> But , while the criteria were clinical , the threshold was financial . I recall a prominent cardiac surgeon saying at the time that the booking system was good if hospitals were well-funded system but dangerous if underfunded ( as they were then ) . This danger was worsened by the inevitably subjective nature of applying clinical criteria to specific patient circumstances . <h> Booking system to ESPIs <p> There was a significant refinement in the final term of Helen Clark 's Labour-led government of the 2000s . Health Minister Pete Hodgson introduced Elective Services Performance Indicators ( ESPIs ) which specified how many patients should be treated or operated on within six months of being assessed . <p> It was then that I started describing the system as data cleansing because those requiring treatment or an operation disappeared off any list into in effect was a black hole ( officially called referral back to their general practitioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delight of National opposition health spokesperson Tony Ryall . <p> Despite Ryall 's delight he continued the system when health minister himself . The ESPI time period was gradually reduced until when Jonathan Coleman was minister it landed at the current three months . <h> It 's a political struggle <p> Conceptually the ESPI system has merit . But with public hospitals under continued financial pressure compounded with admissions of acutely ill patients increasing at a higher rate than the rate of population growth , its application is dangerous similar to the cardiac surgeon 's assessment of its predecessor booking system in the mid-1990s . Data cleansing sits behind harmful to patients as one of the deplorable consequences . This must end . <p> Solving the plight of Andrea Clinton and so many others living a life of continual and increasing suffering requires government action , including to address resourcing ; specifically our severe shortages of health professionals . <p> Karl Marx said that the class struggle was a political struggle . Today he might well say that the health system access struggle is also a political struggle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salaried Medical Specialists , the professional union representing senior doctors and dentists in New Zealand , for over 30 years , until December 2019 .

I recently summarized this view in this way : <p> " The official response -- in public -- is that , yes , rates have dropped on their own but QE made them go ( a relatively tiny bit ) lower than they otherwise might have .

The status quo of the banking system has become one in which banks themselves control the levers of money creation -- it is the wildest fantasies of the banking system come true . <p> But in depending so much on leverage , the banking system has become overly dependent on collateral . Collateral provides the lowest cost short-term operational funds while at the same time , depending on the particulars of each class of collateral , affords a reduction in the equity capital charge via regulatory definitions of " safety " . A repo transaction for a bank is a collateralized loan where a bank can fund assets at that lowest cost . In terms of the overall quantity of those assets a bank can ultimately hold and turn into profits , the securities that adhere to regulatory definitions of safety lead to the lowest capital reserve charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This accounting trick of regulatory safety meant financial innovation was needed to not only transform risky assets , but to mass-produce them as " safe " . Securitization of mortgage debt was one innovation widely used to create AAA-rated securities that were readily accepted as low haircut repo collateral , while at the same time using up as little equity capital as possible . The interest rate paid by the underlying mortgages and the traditional concept of risk/reward were secondary and tertiary considerations to how much leverage could be obtained and applied . Quality of assets was hardly considered in the pursuit for ultimate quantity . Link <p> Oh . . . and we have n't had a couple of one-sided upset vocal minorities on the site ? : ) Glad to see the Government action especially for FHB , but also to all including serious property investors , homeowners and the inherent risks to the wider economy as housing increases were unsustainable . As to recent investors as referred to the article , I do n't have much sympathy as it was obvious that increasing prices were unsustainable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to do something . So poor decision on his part and needs to live with that as part of risks with investing . That investor 's action was akin to hearing of a really great varsity party but by the time they got there the party was over ; like the alleged Rockefeller quote " When my shoeshine boy is advising me it is time to get out " . When everybody is talking about it is time to be cautious . <p> Crypto is a bit like that currently . It 's very easy to say it was obvious after a crash but as Karl says property has been popular with shoeshine boys for 40 years now . Governments do seem to have worked out that by manipulating interest rates they could avoid recessions or worse however it also means , and this seems to have only recently dawned on them , that they could avoid runaway asset prices as well . Well that 's my take on things . <p> Zachary Agree with you that RBNZ has been manipulating ( reducing ) interest rates for economic stability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly in short supply . . . hence other tools like FLP . Presently I am picking that the RBNZ May Monetary Statement wo n't be looking at taking any further actions affecting property such as DTI and interest only loans until the effects of this Government action on property is clear . . . a wait and see by them . <p> loveyourwork ... yes Stuff have proven to be very much like their idol Jacinda . They pretend to be the champion of the poor and minorities ( through grandstanding on minor issues for their own virtue signalling agenda ) while doing everything possible to ensure our society remains exclusive and inequality of outcome based on race remains . " House scalping " is one of the biggest factors contributing to racial inequality in NZ . <p> Those investors who do n't want to sell a holding losing money because they will have to pay the CGT ( bright-line tax ) are nuts ! What they do n't seem to understand is that if you are paying any CGT , you are still making a capital gain ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding off ( to avoid a tax ) and then when the bank forces the sale - they 'll lose even more - and the debt will stay with them on an asset they do n't own . The only reason this did n't happen in the US post-GFC is because they have non-recourse loans there . Imagine the mess we 'd be in if we get a US-style GFC house price crash . <p> gnx .. I doubt you have been to Mumbai , Joberg or Manilla or you would not be wondering . The quality of life in a NZ farm prison would be better than a life ( as a poor person ) in any of those places . However , a number of the immigrants that we genuinely do need may leave . The more the migrant fits the description of " net negative migrant " the less likely it is they will leave and vice versa . <p> " I would n't have bought the property if I had known such a change was coming . " or to put it another way , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known I could lose money " <p> And that .... is why the changes have been brought in . To do just as this buyer will do next time - think twice before buying a speculative asset . Even better ! All these stories are adding to the deterrent factor of " Do n't do it ! ' that the Property Investors Association is trying to calm . They are cutting their own throats with every article that they sponsor . <p> Goodness I hope those predictions for up to 40,000 lost jobs in Melbourne alone do n't eventuate . That 's massive . A bit like what we are seeing/have seen in the US . Time to brace for winter . Hope the politicians are up for managing an economy in a deep recession . So much COVID relief funds to date already spent . What a mess . <p> Yes Kate , I think the sh.t will hit the fan here before next summer . Consumer spending ca n't continue when wages are basically stagnant and business input costs are rising way faster than inflation . Steel prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In short , if they can make you think they , or the banking system , is printing money then they believe you 'll act in anticipation of expected future inflation even if no effective money ( on net ) ever gets printed . <p> ( from your link ) " A few years ago he was shooting a documentary in Zimbabwe , about hyperinflation . He said he saw a guy that had a wheelbarrow full of cash . He asked the guy if he was worried about someone stealing his money , and the guy replied , " No , I 'm worried about them stealing my wheelbarrow . " <p> I know we are all being conditioned to expect Inflation ! ! ! but do we think about what that would mean for 90% of the population of the planet ? If we did , we 'd realise that whatever " Insurrection ! ! ! " we saw on the steps of the Capitol is going to pale into insignificance if it ever arrives , never mind about what will happen in ( pick your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last thing " they ' need . But they do need an environment that wants to buy everything they own from them , and leave them with liquidity - cash , to start the whole thing over again . The way to get the sheep into the last paddock at the slaughterhouse is to make them more scared of you than whatever might be in that big building over there ...... <p> A few weeks back I posed this question to a fellow commentator ( Zachary ? ) : <p> " Are you brave enough to sell everything and covert it into cash ? " <p> In rough terms the answer was , " Are you mad ! " But given the Government changes to property this week , what would they say now ? And this is only in Little Ol ' New Zealand . What 's going to happen when the big economies start down the same track as us ? <p> Absolutely would not . The changes are n't as extreme as people make out . Things have returned to how they were just a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existent on an Auckland property even with a 100K of your own money thrown in . The very low interest rates made things much more attractive and kind of a no brainer . It was bound to enflame the market . <p> Fair enough . But what about if they return to what they were 10 years ago ; give back the last ' doubling ' - that 's not much after 7 or 8 of them over the last few decades . Housing was just as Unaffordable 10 years ago , after all . And then , perhaps , the one before that ? Like all things , no one makes a loss looking back . And as Kate wrote this morning " At what stage do those who hang on decide to give up ? " . It 's human nature to cling to what has worked . All I 'm suggesting is that whatever we had is going to change . If you think it will be for the better for asset values , hang on . I 'll just suggest our Government , for one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's one thing cash gives you , it 's instant choice . <p> I 'm not sure what rent levels will do . There are no hard and fast , guaranteed levels of property value/rental income . Rent is n't just about " the alternative cost of buying " . Most importantly , it 's about the ability or willingness to borrow to do so . It 's also about freedom of movement - for jobs etc . <p> Rents could go up , down or sideways and have less bearing on property re-sale prices than we may all think . If someone thought property prices would fall 50% in the near future , would they buy or rent today , regardless of the calculations ? <p> But what about if they return to what they were 10 years ago ; give back the last ' doubling ' - that 's not much after 7 or 8 of them over the last few decades . Housing was just as Unaffordable 10 years ago , after all . <p> Brad Olson from Infometrics was quoted on TVNZ saying that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall 55% for housing in NZ to be affordable . <p> This is a big bubble , even compared to those of the GFC . Furthermore , even during Japan 's epic bubble , h'hold debt to GDP was never as bad as it is in NZ . <p> ... you know that weird farty sound a balloon makes after you inflate it , then release it to bounce around the room .... well , theres gon na be alot of that about if house prices go into reverse .... alotta soiling of de nappies in de suburbs of this fine land , girt by debt ... <p> True , wouldnt all those OO with mortgage paid off like the bach by the bay at 50% off ... I cant understand the whinging ... sell the investment hoval in South Ak at 4 x purchase price profit - wait 3 - 4 years buy your family the beach house . <p> ... and , why would n't prices keep rising ... sure , Robbo 's severely punched property investors below the belt ... so , if that frees up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been no change at all in the supply/demand imbalance .. <p> Nothing 's been done to increase supply ... apologies for being a Croaking Cassandra guys , but Robbo has hoodwinked you ... <p> See article below , we are running out of timber as house building is so high . They are going up everywhere . Will take a while till they are all completed but I think an oversupply is the likely outcome . Not that I think that is a bad outcome , but it should make prices nosedive . <p> All business ventures generally require your own capital . Smart businessmen can sometimes convince others to provide the seed capital but often these types are con artists . <p> Also Kate we had a situation where if you only put in 200k of your own money into a 1M rental that 200k would return something like 4% just on rent yield . Much better than a term deposit . That was n't the situation until fairly recently . It was no wonder at all that it became compelling . <p> Yes , agree . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who borrowed 100% of the purchase price against unrealised gains - and who also took out an interest-only mortgage - that are now crying foul . <p> This is why people hate property managers . From Mary Holm 's latest Herald column : <p> " For the second tenant , we used a property manager , and I can happily report that they respected our wishes not to raise the rent , even though their policy was to review rents on an annual basis . In fact , when their system automatically raised the rent by 10 per cent , a refund was provided to the tenant at our request . " <p> Beggars belief that the property manager is being painted as ' good ' for reversing something that should never have happened in the first place . And what kind of business has a system in place which just ' automatically ' raises the prices by 10% on an annual basis ? Bloody hell . <p> And then Victoria Short comes out and reminds us that half of kiwis have less than thousand dollars in their account <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's very difficult to see where these rent rises are coming from if there 's no money to pay the rent . Furthermore , based on the ASB data , you can infer that 83% of NZers have &lt;$10k in cash savings . That 's not a lot of buffer . What it does show is that most NZers are living paycheck to paycheck . And if someone says that NZ is any better than the U.S. financially , the data suggests that this claim is not true . <p> They are fkin criminal and i hate them with a passion - what amazes me is that those that have rental properties managed by them do nt hate them also ... they take 10% monthly from you .... they only need 10 properties on their books to be taking the equivalent of full rent of a mortgage free home every month - for doing very little in my experience . And their practice of saying we 'll increase your take by 10% each year - no they are increasing their take of 10% each year - and you are taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ btw - just causes me acid in my mouth evry time i walk past a Quinovic office . I have a close friend who did this for a job before having children - she advised me not to rent with her because her boss would actively try to get every penny out of you as a tenant he could - tenants were to be wrung out at every opportunity in his eyes <p> No . Currently , less than 3% of BTC owners have 1 or more Bitcoin . Even when prices were less than $1000 , most NZers never owned a single BTC . A Kiwisaver fund having a small exposure to BTC has nothing to do with it . <p> There are currently 8 ETF applications for Bitcoin with the SEC at the moment . It is only a matter of time before a wave of Wall Street money starts to flow into this emerging asset class . Those who move early will hold control over the hardest money ever created and get to own part of the financial network of cyberspace . Do n't choose horses over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harvesting and milling when you can just kick back and live off carbon credits ? Work and industry is so over rated . Fuel user funded carbon lifestyles are where it 's at . House can just use concrete and steel instead . <p> Not just timber . Supply of other construction components are also suffering from the compound effects of shipping dislocation and the building boom . We have been forced to significantly expand our warehousing capacity as simply having stock available is often now the key determinant of getting the order . Higher margin long term customers get priority , tight arsed tradies whose business model is to cherry pick suppliers for the cheapest price are feeling a tad lonely . <p> And this is exactly why we need people like Mike Greer to go out and find innovative ways of building houses . But no we still hammer nails into expensive pieces of wood with little or no appetite to innovate ! <p> I have no sympathy for the couple who paid over a million dollars for a property in the Hutt Valley as mentioned on Stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase price which is way higher than what she hoped to pay for it . She did not have to buy it . No one put a gun to her head . They have a huge loan to pay off over many years . Two things are obvious . Interest rate rises will come along in due course as economies recover . Jacinda will implement more measures if the policies implemented this week do not work . When she leaves office for greater things she will not want to be remembered as a failure like John Key in terms of housing and poverty . Those who have bought in the 9 months or so are at risk of seeing their equity go backwards in varying amounts . <p> ex agent . I do have some sympathy for them . I 've been helping young family FHB members in their unsuccessful attempt to buy in Wellie for a lengthy period . The shark tank frenzy of grey greedies paying crazy money for rotting dumps , the aggressive domination of western city land and house package transactions by ' investors ' of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agents and all the other characteristics of an obscenely bloated RE market induce a desperation that you need to be involved with , to understand . It is a wretched experience to witness the shattered hopes of so many younger folk chasing a declining pool of often poor quality housing . I quite understand why this couple have ended up where they have . The people for whom I have no sympathy are those speculators who ignored the numerous warning signs that the party was going to come to an end once our timid prime minister belatedly worked out her back was to the wall and now face their day of reckoning . <p> Yeah I agree . Surely they could have found a more affordable townhouse too , rather than a bungalow on a decent sized section . She 's kind of perpetuating the notion that you need a detached house on a full section . For me lots of double standards there . <p> Government has to act with RBNZ on interest only loan if it really wants to target speculative demand as interest only loan is mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of FHB in one form or the other .

In 1983 the then 29 hospital boards administering the country 's health system were replaced by 14 area health boards . The hospital boards were considered too narrowly focused on hospital-based services , at a time when there was a growing emphasis on wider public health services beyond hospitals , hence the move to area health boards . <p> But by 1990 it was clear that the new model was struggling to perform any better than its predecessor . When then Health Minister Helen Clark sacked the largest of the area health boards -- the Auckland Area Health Board ( of which her husband was an elected member ) -- because she considered it dysfunctional , and replaced it with an appointed commissioner , the short-lived area health board experiment was effectively over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolished the remaining area health boards and replaced them with a centralised Health Funding Agency and four Regional Health Authorities . The Regional Health Authorities were intended to bid to the Health Funding Agency for the funding necessary to deliver the appropriate health services required for their region . The model was intended to be accompanied by a detailed definition of what constituted core services , what they might cost and how they could be organised and delivered , to assist Regional Health Authorities in their funding applications to the central body . <p> However , the core services review immediately aroused suspicions that it was a cover for the introduction of more competitive business models -- " Americanisation " it was pejoratively called -- to the public health system . When charges were introduced for some short-term emergency procedures requiring a night in hospital , and hospitals were renamed Crown Health Enterprises ( or CHEs , as they became widely known ) and established as stand-alone enterprises , the public concluded things had gone too far . Another major shake-up to restore a sense of equilibrium was inevitable when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1999 , with Helen Clark now the Prime Minister and her trusted adviser Heather Simpson , who has been with her since the mid-1980s , her chief of staff . What emerged was a system of 20 district health boards , with half the membership elected locally and the other half and the chair appointed by the government . The system was intended to be a careful balance between recognising local interests and the government 's policy priorities and has been the basis of the system since then . <p> However , the careful balance quickly gave way to stalemate , and a sense that through the power to appoint the board chair , the government was usually able to ensure it got what it wanted , often at the expense of local priorities and concerns . At the same time , the inherent operational inefficiencies of 20 autonomous boards , each ordering their own equipment and supplies and running their own systems became obvious and cumbersome . Ministers of Health discovered that the autonomy given to boards meant that they had no power to direct boards to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appointed board members or pointedly worded phrases in the annual letter of intent sent to each board , in the hope they might get their way . <p> The last National-led government started to address the organisational inefficiency aspect by getting some smaller boards to collaborate on and share back-room administrative services . But scorched by the public response to its replacement of elected area health boards by the appointed Health Funding Agency in the 1990s , National was extremely reluctant to do anything overt about reducing the number of boards , lest it once more be accused of stifling local democracy . Instead , it attempted , largely unsuccessfully , to encourage board amalgamations , but the only one that happened during its time was the extremely unpopular merger of Otago and Southland after one board had been fired and replaced by a commissioner . <p> Another review to tidy up what seemed to be too many loose ends , and to give recognition to the distinct interests of Maori and Pasifika in public health was inevitable when Labour took office in 2017 . Just as inevitable -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should head the review . Few people would have had the length of exposure to the public health system , its strengths and foibles , and the sense of perspective time brings , as she had . <p> The Simpson Health and Disability Services Review recommendations were released in June 2020 . They are a pragmatic response to the current situation . While establishing a new stand-alone national health authority to run the public health system and halving the number of district health boards and having them fully appointed by the government , not locally elected , may seem dramatic , it is really a refinement of the funder-provider split model the National Government introduced in the early 1990s . The proposal to establish a separate Maori Health Authority has been largely welcomed but there has been criticism that no similar model has been proposed to address Pasifika health concerns . <p> For its part , the government has appeared committed to the review , with the Minister of Health promising to announce its decisions on the next steps to be taken shortly . At the time the report was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " once-in-a-generation opportunity to back our world-class doctors , nurses and other health staff and deliver a truly national health and disability system " . <p> To achieve this objective , the government 's forthcoming response to the Simpson review can not be half-hearted or incomplete . Yet the history of health sector reform of the last 40 years under successive governments shows that it has never quite achieved its potential because it has never received the sufficiently full endorsement of the government of the day . Any opportunity for meaningful reform has frequently been compromised by government " cherry-picking " for fiscal and political reasons . More of the same in this instance will simply ensure more of the stagnation that has plagued the system for years . <p> The present Minister of Health is well placed to break this mould . Whether he will do so remains to be seen .

Last night Te Huia was named Kiwibank New Zealand Local Hero of the year for his work with Waikato communities preserving their environments . <p> The Waikato region is famous for two things , its farms and its rivers . Driving south over the Bombay Hills , you 're suddenly met with a view of water flowing like blue veins through the land , cutting through a vast expanse of grass green paddocks . Water plays a vital role in the everyday lives of those who call the Waikato home . <p> Shannon Te Huia grew up at Mangatoatoa marae , about 15 minutes south of Te Awamutu along State Highway 3 . The marae is situated just off the main drag , on the banks of the Puniu River . Driving down the loose metal road towards the main meeting house , you get the sense that this is not your average marae . Rows upon rows of native plants , ranging in size , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soaking in sunshine and preparing to be planted . <p> " We ca n't keep up with demand , " says Te Huia as he welcomes me to his whenua , proudly pointing to his maunga Kakepuku standing tall against the bright blue horizon , and the Puniu River flowing past the marae . A wide smile spreads across his sun-kissed face , reminding me of a proud father showing off his child for the first time . It 's clear that Te Huia has a deep bond with this land . <p> We round a corner , entering a shed full of nursery equipment . There the team is busy preparing trees to be planted . They all greet us with a unified " kia ora " and quickly gather to offer a hongi . <p> Planting on the Puniu River ( Photo : supplied ) <p> The 40-year-old Te Huia has fond memories of growing up here , especially his time spent in and around the awa . He speaks about catching eels with his whanau and spending time relaxing in the water during hot summer nights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he comes from . <p> " What 's important to us is our whanau , marae , iwi , hapu , your awa , and your maunga . The taiao is important to us , " says Te Huia . <p> Unfortunately , the awa that has provided for Te Huia and his whanau for generations is not as healthy as it once was . Upon returning from Australia , where he studied civil engineering specialising in environmental engineering and spatial science , Te Huia recognised that urgent action was needed to help stop the degradation of the awa he loved so much . <p> " It was about having an understanding of what 's important and valuing things that are important to us , " says Te Huia . <p> The timing could n't have been better when Te Huia befriended a group of mates through surfing , who happened to be running an organisation dedicated to cleaning up New Zealand 's beaches , rivers and protecting its waterways . <p> " I met the guys from Sustainable Coastlines co-founder Sam Judd was the 2013 Young New Zealander of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had some of the things I needed to take my idea to the next level , " Te Huia says . <p> Te Huia 's idea was a simple , yet highly effective way , of not only cleaning up the river , but also helping to future-proof its health far beyond his lifetime . The idea was to propagate and plant native trees in and around waterways , wetlands , streams , rivers and beyond . It would be a way to help clean the environment he loved so much , restore ecosystems , grow biodiversity , and have a positive impact on the local economy . This would be the beginnings of Puniu River Care . <p> In addition to producing the air we breathe , trees provide a range of other important benefits to water systems , people and animals . They slow down rainwater runoff , reducing flooding , erosion , pollution and refilling aquifers . Trees also provide an important habitat for all kinds of animals and insects , plus they keep our rivers cool . They capture carbon dioxide , locking it away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Huia could see the power and potential of trees .

It was time to do the mahi , " says Te Huia . <p> A new seedling ( Photo : supplied ) <p> The first step was establishing the structure of the organisation . Te Huia wanted his vision to long outlive him and he knew he needed stakeholders who would be in for the long-haul , committed to fully seeing the vision for clean and healthy waterways become a reality . <p> " You need stakeholders that are going to be in there for a long time and that 's your marae , " says Te Huia . " What 's important to us is our whanau , iwi , hapu , your awa , and your maunga . The taiao is important to us .

He began by planting trees around Mangatoatoa Pa site . Before long , word of the work Te Huia was doing spread and he began landing contracts to plant for the local council and other organisations throughout the region , including iwi and private landowners , primarily farmers . <p> The six years since have been a journey of continuous growth for Te Huia , both personally and professionally . Puniu River Care now employs over fifty locally-based staff . They have expanded their nursery 's capacity to grow tens of thousands of plants simultaneously and have already planted around 750,000 plants . Demand continues to grow , especially from farmers and others in the private sector . He hopes to continue landing contracts with governmental and non-government organisations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by planting native trees . <p> " I never get sick of hearing about how great a job we 're doing . One of the best things about what I do is hearing people say that I 'm inspiring them , because it means that I 'm inspiring them to care of our environment , " says Te Huia . <p> Planting at the Kaekepuku project ( Photo : supplied ) <p> As you pass through Te Awamutu , it does n't long to see the effect Puniu River Care is having on the small rural town . Locals drive around in company vehicles and proudly don company branded clothing . They are proud to work for Puniu River Care and the town is proud to have them there . All employees are paid no less than the living wage and the money going back into the local economy is helping to bolster local businesses . <p> Whilst what the company explicitly does for the health of the environment is obvious , there are also intangible benefits that come with educating people on their role of kaitiaki of the taiao @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farmers , hapu , and central government from the beginning , Puniu River Care has changed the way these groups can work together to protect the environment they 're so close . <p> " I think launching and propagating plants are the activities but the meaning and the purpose behind it is far broader . It 's about kaitiakitanga and this is our interpretation of doing that , " says Te Huia . <p> Te Huia shows me to the front of the whare tipuna , Te Maru o Ihoa . It is a tall , intricately carved whare and feels grand , as it stands proudly facing the river with the old whare next to it . There 's a maara kai not far from the whare and a nursery full of life and activity out the back . There 's even a pig pen and a few other live animals that they keep on site . <p> " It was n't always like this , " says Te Huia . He explains the marae was in a state of disrepair until it was recently being renovated . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we do . We can be here at the marae every day , even when it 's not busy .

The year-round schedule enables the staff to feel a sense of security in their jobs and empowers them to stay and contribute to the development of their region . The most powerful thing for his staff , however , is the fact the work they do is contributing towards the health of the awa they all care for so greatly . <p> The environmental impact of what Puniu River Care does is a slow process that happens over years , but the impacts on the community are immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy is boosted , people are becoming educated on how to properly care for the environment , and more people are becoming reconnected with the taiao by being immersed in it daily . <p> Whilst the full benefits of what the company does will not be felt for years to come , Te Huia 's desire and drive to do something to improve the health of the Puniu River has created a chain of positive impact for the Waikato region and beyond .

I made a quick decision - I told them to shut up and get in the car . <p> Perhaps an understandable parenting moment ( I needed a quick solution for the school run ) , but I did not follow a great decision-making process .

I was biased against the little darling who pushed my buttons the most ; and <p> 2 . I did n't give the girls a fair hearing as I simply wanted the fighting to stop . <p> This story resembles many of my clients ' stories in business . They need a quick , short-term solution to fix a conflict between staff or a difficult issue with someone they are in contract with . <p> But it is like plugging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underlying problem for so long . <p> I can advise on better ways of resolving conflict or working through challenging relationship issues , but the topic of this article relates to the principles of natural justice which public bodies or incorporated societies need to follow when making decisions . <p> They are also good principles for businesses and other organisations to adopt . <p> What is natural justice ? <p> New Zealand has inherited many of the principles of the English legal system , some of which go back to Roman law , which is where natural justice principles came from . They were regarded as principles that were natural or self-evident , being : <p> 1 . ' ' the right to be heard ' ' - hold a fair hearing ; and <p> 2. ' ' no person may judge their own case ' ' - do not be biased . <p> Decisions made by public organisations that affect the rights or interests of any person are subject to the rules of natural justice . They need to be independent and impartial and the procedure is required to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actions of the public sector , the principles of natural justice will apply . For example , when councils assess tenders or applications for funding , unless they follow these principles they may be subject to a judicial review . <p> That is when an interested party applies to court for a decision of an entity ( usually a public body ) to be reviewed and set aside . Such a situation causes uncertainty for the entity , is often prolonged by appeals , and can cause significant negative public perceptions . <p> Fair hearing <p> The right to a fair hearing requires that participants in the justice system should not be penalised by decisions that affect their rights unless they have been given : <p> 1 . prior notice of the matter in question ; <p> 2. fair opportunity to answer it ; and <p> 3. the opportunity to present their view properly . <p> Bias <p> Some organisations will let a person participate in making decisions if they have disclosed the nature of the conflict and the other decision makers are comfortable with that person still being involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive ( like a complaint ) , then I recommend you err on the side of caution . The key principle here is the person 's right to a fair and impartial determination of their issue . <p> This means none of the decision-makers can have a financial or any other kind of conflict of interest , real or perceived . Also , if the decision-maker has an ownership or personal interest in the matter then the law may imply that they are biased , suggesting that their decisions are not impartial . <p> The suspicion of bias can create a deep sense of suspicion and ill-will . Applying the principles of natural justice reduces the risk of actual or perceived bias . <p> How to ensure natural justice is applied <p> Generally , when an organisation holds meetings , they should follow a formal process , as set out in their rules of association . All meetings must be properly convened and run to ensure fairness to all those affected by the decisions being made . <p> As an example , a parent is unhappy with a decision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she complains to the school 's board of trustees . The board should then follow the principles of natural justice when reviewing the principal 's decision . <p> To ensure that happens , the board should : <p> 1 . Have a complaints policy setting out a fair and balanced process which is publicly available , for example on the school website . <p> 2 . Follow the policy , which may include calling an independent reviewer in . <p> 3 . Follow any other relevant process , such as one in an employment agreement . <p> 4 . Ensure that anyone with a conflict of interest is not involved in the process . For instance , if the complainant 's relative or spouse is on the board , they should not take part in relevant discussions or see relevant paperwork . <p> 5 . Keep an open mind until the board has heard from everyone , looked at all relevant information , and not taken account of irrelevant information . <p> 6 . Let the person whose decision is being reviewed or who is the subject of the complaint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is making it . <p> 7 . Let them have a chance to respond fully to any allegations .

@@32701239 <h> The trouble with timber <p> The abrupt announcement from Carter Holt Harvey to cut structural timber supplies to some merchants has caused a shock . But , given the complexity of modern business and the small size of the New Zealand market , it is surprising similar instances do not occur more often . <p> This has come when the building industry is frantically busy and new housing desperately needed . <p> It follows Labour 's big housing announcement . Bad news for builders is not what they would have ordered . <p> Various reasons are ascribed , and the Commerce Commission is asking questions . <p> The building supplies company most affected , ITM , is outraged , particularly citing the fact CHH will continue to supply Carters ( which CHH partially owns ) and Fletcher Placemakers . <p> ITM says it is the second-biggest supplier to the industry ( after Placemakers ) and has been a 30-year client . The retail giants , Mitre 10 and Bunnings , say they are not directly impacted , although some Mitre 10 stores could be . <p> CHH claims it will still be fulfilling its contractual obligations and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have pointed to the comparative lack of wood processing in this country and the mass export of logs . <p> It would seem , however , that local mills have been able to secure logs , albeit at high prices because of the booming demand overseas . <p> The chief executive of large mill Red Stag , from Rotorua , has explained that CHH shut its Whangarei mill before it could get its larger Kawarau plant fully redeveloped . Post-Covid , even more house building and renovation then came on top of what was already peak demand . CHH just could not supply . <p> Supposedly , in a few months , more capacity and the uptake of other options will rectify matters . <p> Timber supplies for the likes of decking , fencing and landscaping were already under pressure .

Competition often sharpens costs . <p> The Suez Canal blockage of the past week illustrates the intricacies and interdependence of global trade . Mostly , it works and works well . <p> In theory , supply and demand create markets and opportunities and proper rivalry . <p> New Zealand , though , is handicapped by small scale and limited competition . Capitalism , for all that it has raised living standards -- although not for everyone -- and for all that it delivers the goods , needs to be fettered . <p> Rules , watchdogs and occasional controls are required . <p> Compare a shortage of structural timber under a free market for perhaps several months to other options . <p> The New Zealand era of import licences was a recipe for monopolies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition in parts of the economy fostered inefficiency , inflexibility and high margins . <p> Those aged under 70 would find it hard to imagine the rigmarole to acquire a car and the exorbitant costs of previous times . <p> China only surged economically after its capitalist changes .

Westpac has already placed a number of businesses into a Specialist Businesses Division , for ultimate exit . We have also announced the consolidation of our international operations in Asia . <p> Westpac is also assessing the appropriate structure for its New Zealand business and whether a demerger would be in the best interests of shareholders . Westpac is in the very early stage of this assessment and no decisions have been made . This will also consider the impact of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand 's ( RBNZ ) reviews which were announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a valuable part of the Westpac Group and has been for over 160 years . <p> The business continues to perform well with a strong position in retail and commercial banking . However , given the changing capital requirements in New Zealand and the RBNZ requirement to structurally separate Westpac 's NZ business operations from its operations in Australia , it is now appropriate to assess the best structure for these businesses going forward . <p> Westpac will provide further updates as required . <p> There has been a lot of conjecture in the press as to what this may mean and what the potential implications may be for customers and the banking industry . <p> David McLean , Chief Executive of Westpac New Zealand Limited , has also provided some further background on these recent developments on the Westpac New Zealand Limited website . <p> A ' demerger ' is a legal and economic separation of distinct parts of a corporate group . In this instance , the demerger would involve the separation of WBC and Westpac New Zealand Limited into two separately owned businesses . <p> However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entity regulated by the Reserve Bank and Financial Markets Authority ( FMA ) and required to maintain appropriate separation from its shareholder under New Zealand banking standards , the day-to-day impacts would be much less than they may be in other sectors . <p> What form could a demerger take ? <p> If WBC decides to go ahead with a demerger , one model which seems likely is the model NAB used to demerge the Clydesdale Banking Group . This model involves the parent separating the subsidiary and listing it on a local stock exchange . David McLean specifically mentioned this form of demerger in his recent update . <p> Under the NAB/Clydesdale model , existing shareholders in WBC would receive shares in the Westpac New Zealand Limited ( or a new holding company which might own other New Zealand entities as well ) which would then be listed , on relevant stock exchanges . <p> In the NAB/Clydesdale demerger , the existing shareholders ( of NAB ) received 75% of the shares in the new entity . The remaining 25% of shares were sold to other investors through an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not a necessary feature of a demerger . Certain nuances did apply , for example NAB shareholders who held 2000 shares or less were given an option to sell their allocated Clydesdale shares into a share sale facility ( without having to pay brokerage fees ) . The NAB/Clydesdale demerger also involved a court approved Scheme of Arrangement ( under Australian law ) . <p> This model is similar to demergers that we have seen in New Zealand , including the demergers of NZME from APN and Tilt Renewables from Trustpower . On this basis , and particularly given the inherent similarities with the NAB/Clydesdale circumstances , it may well be a viable option for WBC if it decides to proceed with a demerger . <p> Why might a demerger be beneficial for New Zealand and New Zealand businesses ? <p> There are many reasons why a WBC/Westpac New Zealand demerger might be beneficial for the New Zealand business . For example , a demerger would ( 1 ) be a hugely positive boost for capital markets in New Zealand ( 2 ) provide New Zealand investors a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a proxy for investment in the country 's economy ( 3 ) mean that one of New Zealand 's four large banks would operate under the regulation of RBNZ only ( rather than the ' two-regulator ' model which the Australian-owned banks currently operate under ) and ( 4 ) also be a signal of independence to the global economy , demonstrating that it is a viable and prudent option for a major New Zealand bank to be locally owned and operated . <p> What might a demerger mean for customers ? <p> At this stage , this is hard to predict . <p> If WBC decides to proceed with a demerger , the implications will depend on the form of the demerger . However , it is likely that the implications for most New Zealand bank customers , employees and suppliers will be minimal , although there will likely be some detail around the markets business currently operated by a branch of Westpac Banking Corporation in New Zealand . This is because Westpac New Zealand Limited is already a separate legal entity , holding its own registrations and licences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the degree of separation from WBC required by applicable banking standards . <p> That is likely to continue as the main operating entity in the NZ group . <p> Likewise , related entities , like Westpac Life NZ Limited ( if included in the transaction ) , are already separate legal entities , holding their own registrations and licences from relevant New Zealand regulators . <p> It seems likely , but not inevitable , that a demerger might result in renaming and rebranding of Westpac New Zealand Limited . <p> We wait with interest as to where the deliberations of WBC 's Board go . <p> About Kate **26;67;TOOLONG Partner Kate Lane leads the law firm 's Banking sector team .

@@32702231 <h> Fifty years of Concours <h> The Ellerslie Car Show , as most know it , is a mass gathering of some of the country 's finest automobiles . We headed along to check out the show in its fiftieth year . <p> Words : Kyle Cassidy Photos Kyle Cassidy <p> The second Sunday of February each year is a special day on the calendar of the classic car enthusiast . For it 's when one of the country 's longest running car events is held , the Ellerslie Intermarque Concours . It was an extra special occasion for car lovers this year , for not only was it held on Valentine 's Day ( could there be a better way to spend a romantic day out ? ) but it was the event 's 50th running , quite a knock for any show . <p> The weather played nice , the cars and the crowd enjoying a stunning day ( the outdoor event is held rain or shine ) and it was timed to perfection as not only did Auckland go into Level 3 Covid-19 restrictions the next day , but the weather gods turned nasty too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt blessed having arranged the show ( something that is said to take all year ) and to have dodged the Covid cancellation gremlins . <p> The event is a big undertaking with an estimated 1000 cars from over 70 Kiwi car clubs converging on Ellerslie Racecourse . For the casual attendee , it 's a get-together of fancy and fine machines but there is a serious aspect to the show , one that draws a particularly high calibre of car to be displayed . The main attraction is the Intermarque Concours d'Elegance where those who have honed and buffed their machine to perfection compete for best-in-show status . <p> The event is a big undertaking with an estimated 1000 cars from over 70 Kiwi car clubs converging on Ellerslie Racecourse . <p> There are three main categories ; the Intermarque Team Shield , Masters Class and Survivors . The entrants in each category are inspected carefully by a team of judges from the Thoroughbred And Classic Car Owners Club ( TACCOC ) , making for a somewhat independent panel , and each car is scored on 11 different aspects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the underbody and engine , the electrical system , the brightwork , the boot area and tools , wheels , and the interior , while they also take into account the car 's originality.For the Master class and Teams event , a car can attain a maximum of 590 points , with deductions made for any imperfections or irregularities the judges find . <p> For the teams event , a car club can enter two cars , and the award goes to the pairing with the highest combined score . Winning this award then gives that car club the right to be the host for the next event . The Masters Class is for single car entries where all cars must be more than five years old . The Survivors Class is one for unrestored , unmodified and original cars . They have to be 35 years old and while a nice patina is deemed okay , they need to be in solid , well kept condition . <p> The winner of the master class this year was a 1966 Mercedes-Benz 230SL scoring 561 points , while the Porsche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amassing 562 points and a 356 A Coupe gaining 557 to beat the hosting Auckland Mustang Owners Club . A 1973 Series III E-Type took out the Survivors car title . <p> It takes a real commitment of time and money to get a car up to concours standard and the entrants highlight the high quality restoration work of New Zealand 's fine trades and crafts people . Owners sure tip a lot of money into getting these things looking perfect , some better than when they left the factory . <p> Being the 50th event , the organisers managed to wrangle an impressive line-up of past winners of the Masters Class . It seems Kiwis love to spend their money on Mustangs , more than a few represented in the winners circle , and plenty of Porsches too . There were a few Holdens and Mercedes-Benz in the mix as well . Present also were a couple of the first winners from the early events held by the MG Car Club , all still in great nick . <p> Advertisement <p> The first event was held in 1972 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

As hosts of the day , the Auckland Mustang Owners club had the biggest turnout , many a Mustang on show spanning the car 's incredible 56 years of being . <p> Away from the gleaming concours cars , there was a great range of vehicles on show ; Bugattis , BMWs , Fords , Ferraris , Mitsubishis , MGs , Rileys , and Rollers .

The hand-formed alloy panels are coming together nicely , the team making good progress on the project since we visited the museum a couple of years past . They 've still a long way to go but it will look sensational when it 's done . <p> A casual observation sees that the owners of the Packards , Model As , Daimlers and British Leyland marques have attended quite a few of these shows over the years . And so it 's good to see a healthy turn out from Japanese car enthusiasts with the likes of the Mitsubishi Classic Car Club making a debut with a line up of nice GTOs along with members of Japanese Nostalgic Cars showing their Integras , a 22B , Datsuns and Skylines . <p> With the ' younger ' enthusiast in mind , the organisers this year introduced a new 50-50-50 category . This is for cars and owners less than 50 years old while the total cost of the car ( purchase and resto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are still judged on certain criteria but not to the same extent as the Masters Class , with less emphasis on originality and fastidious detailing . Adding more for your money 's worth this year ( tickets cost $20 , certainly good value for a few hours of entertainment ) were a few hot rod displays , . While there was the usual American muscle on display it was n't a rod and custom show . Also new were a few ' barn finds ' and other rusting wrecks that had been dragged along waiting for money to be poured into them .

I have heard children being bullied at school by other kids in relation to that type of publicity . It is upsetting to listen to and no doubt very traumatic for those young people !

@@32708239 <h> Lies and ill will <p> Writer Vincent O'Sullivan has lent his pen to a new production , Simple acts of Malice , devised in concert with Richard Huber , Simon O'Connor and Barbara Power . PHOTO : GETTY IMAGES/GRANT MAIDEN <p> A new play to debut at the Dunedin Arts Festival is not about telling the truth , but might have truths to tell , writes Tom McKinlay . <p> Vincent O'Sullivan says his entry in the Dunedin Arts Festival programme owes a debt to a play that is famous for , among other things , beginning with a misspelt expletive . <p> Among those other things , is that the play 's first night was also its last after it " offended almost everyone who saw it " -- it was an " inglorious slop-pail " of a thing , according to one critic . <p> That play was Ubu Roi , by the French playwright Alfred Jarry , performed in Paris in 1896 and now celebrated as variously anticipating modernism , Dada , Surrealism and the Theatre of the Absurd . <p> " That 's where we started but , of course , moved a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now no direct link at all , he says . It is not clear whether he is providing reassurance or managing expectations . <p> But then , he later suggests of his play , " I think some people will think it is pretty off the wall " . <p> And offers that , " It gave me a chance to be both singularly unpleasant as well as ... having comic scenes ... And that was fun . " <p> So some of the spirit of Jarry 's absurdist anarchism appears to have survived the development process . <p> And indeed there 's a bit more backstory here yet , because the play , Simple Acts of Malice , is , in fact , a collaboration between O'Sullivan and the three members of RBS Productions : Richard Huber , who directs , and the actors Barbara Power and Simon O'Connor . <p> The three have worked together previously , Power and O'Connor combining for the two-handed One Day -- two plays of their own devising -- under Huber 's direction . <p> O'Sullivan was recruited to join the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I was the new boy brought in , " O'Sullivan confirms . " But I was very glad to have the chance to work with them and to be able to do something in terms of writing that was quite different to anything I had done before . " <p> Writing , he says , can be a bit of a solitary vice . <p> O'Connor says the three of them in RBS ( the first letter from each of their names ) were inspired to work with devised theatre by the example of British playwright and film-maker Mike Leigh . <p> " Which is developing theatre , plays , through improvisation , I suppose , but particularly through going into the deep background of characters . " <p> The three of them wanted to do something else with that " hyper real " approach by getting a scriptwriter on board and applying it to something a bit larger than life , O'Connor says . <p> " Once former US President Donald Trump got in or started looking like he might , I got very interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... the extremely disturbing world that he was throwing light on to -- a mixture of buffoonery and lies and the utter uncertainty of truth , and that grandiosity . " <p> He picked up Ubu Roi -- a tale of overweening ambition , betrayal and double-dealing -- but it was n't quite the ticket , so the call went out to O'Sullivan -- over the fence . <p> They worked together , the four of them , one day a week , improvising and discussing , then the playwright would go away and return with some more script . And so on . <p> " It still has some of the Ma and Pa Ubu , these grandiose , greedy , voracious people at the heart of it , " O'Connor says . <p> The play is another entry in the extraordinary CV of Vincent O'Sullivan ( DCNZM ) . It 's play number six . The last one staged was Take the Moon , Mr Casement at Christchurch 's Court Theatre back in the 1990s . He 's recently published a new poetry collection , and is off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his " biographical portrait " of Ralph Hotere , The Dark Is Light Enough -- an Ockham award finalist . <p> This new drama , Simple Acts of Malice , finds its protagonists , Bones and Elaine , holed up on the lam from a " hectic lifetime of mayhem " , according to the Dunedin Arts Festival programme , during which it will be staged -- a touch incongruously -- in a yoga studio . <p> Bones and Elaine seem well deserving of each other -- their conversation references the likes of the Bassett Rd murders , Bones claims a life as a mercenary -- but the claustrophobic confines of their bolt hole are not well suited to their " malevolent energy " . <p> If it sounds a little bit Covid lockdown , that is in fact coincidence , if not entirely unwelcome . <p> O'Sullivan says the period during which the four of them worked on the play pretty much lined up with the pandemic -- but that it was no part of their narrative . <p> " So what we finished up with is this play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is basically a man and a woman locked in a room . But it is really beyond that , they are locked into themselves , their personalities , " he says . <p> O'Sullivan is concerned that might sound a bit intellectual , so assures that the intention was to turn the ideas into fun , entertainment . <p> " It is like a marriage that people do n't want , that has gone on for 30 years , so they are locked into their relationship , they are locked into space , they are locked into disappointment with the way their lives have turned out . So , again , as people sometimes are in that sort of situation , they are locked into a series of repetitive moves , which in this case is a series of games they play .

" <p> We 're not told precisely why Bones and Elaine ca n't go out . <p> " You just know they are a bit scared and there are fantasies about people who might be after them . " <p> They both regret the path that has led them to their predicament , but at the same time enjoy trawling back through it , building themselves up -- even if that involves acts of wilful invention . <p> " All of us , I think , sometimes can tell a story about ourselves -- we do n't lie about it , but we edit it , " O'Sullivan says . <p> Exaggeration arrives whether by design or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory . <p> " I mean , if we lie to ourselves there is always a story behind that .

It was the inaugural day of Te Huia , the new passenger train service between Hamilton and South Auckland , and train-lover John was ready to capture every glorious moment of this ground-breaking journey .

Officially , he was having a lovely time . The train announced its arrival in Huntly , and John was momentarily speechless . " We 're pulling into Huntly ! We 're here !

@@32711237 <p> Here 's our summary of key economic events over the long holiday weekend that affect New Zealand with news Janet Yellen is calling for a global minimum tax on multinationals . <p> But first up today , the IMF has released a series of global economic reports , the heart of which show rising economic growth rates especially in the first world , but problems for the developing world and rising inequality . The improving American economy is drawing billions of dollars in capital from emerging markets , stirring concerns that investor flight may destabilise these countries where pandemic infections remain high and the prospect of an economic recovery seems distant . Not helping are awful local public policy positions in places like Turkey and Brazil . <p> The IMF is also warning about the rising nonfinancial sector leverage , which they see as a real risk to be addressed and entirely a consequence of loose monetary policies and vast pandemic stimulus . And it is pointing out the global risks from commercial real estate in the post-pandemic environment . <p> In China , there was a not-so-flash private sector Caixin PMI report . Like its official version @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity in private factories and the heat has well and truly gone out of their sharp recovery . It was the slowest ' expansion ' in almost a year . <p> But price rises , some quite sharp , are becoming more common . For example , corn prices have risen almost +50% in a year , and there are moves to substitute it wheat and rice in animal feed . That may have future food security issues for China . <p> In the US , the March non-farm payrolls report was a good , positive one , led by an accelerating pace of vaccinations and the anticipation of more stimulus . Employers added +916,000 jobs in March , up from +416,000 in February and the most since August 2020 . The leisure and hospitality sector led the way , adding +280,000 jobs as Americans returned to restaurants and resorts in greater numbers . However , these gain left the pandemic deficit at an -8.4 mln jobs lost since February 2020 , so they have a long way to go . Analysts say that future gains will grow from here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the March data was collected before most states opened up , and before the latest stimulus payments actually arrived . <p> One feature we should watch ; as more lower-paid jobs open up in their workforce , the strong growth in average weekly earnings is moderating , but it is still higher by +4.2% pa , just not as high as the prior +5.2% pa . <p> The number of initial claims for unemployment benefits actually rose marginally last week , although to be fair , the prior week 's numbers were revised lower . That means the total number of these benefits is now 4.1 mln , and a level lower than a week ago . <p> The labour market improvements are also reflected in the state of American factories . They are running at the best levels in 14 years and since before the GFC . The March results were affected by well-publicised supply-channel problems , but new order levels are high , and hiring is rising . The previously noted sharp rises in costs and prices is also a feature of these reports . The locally-watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulties . The internationally benchmarked Markit PMI was equally positive , as was their services sector expansion . <p> American vehicle sales rose sharply in March to a rate of 17.7 mln per year , up from 15.5 mln per year in February . Still , this leaves the American car markets still well into second place behind China . <p> Canadian building permits rose unexpectedly strongly , in this case in February from January , with notable rises in non-residential construction permits . Building permit levels for residential construction were lower in February than January , but year-on-year they are up a very notable +25% . <p> In Chicago , Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has called for a global corporate minimum tax on multinationals . <p> In Washington , a key consumer protection regulator is proposing some rule changes to " prevent avoidable foreclosures " as the emergency pandemic measure expire . Essentially , they are extending the time borrowers have to work through repayment stress issues . <p> In Europe , their factory sector is rising as well .

Inflation is n't getting any respite from core commodities . Further , in a few days , we will get the latest update on global food prices , and almost certainly they have risen in March . <p> On Wall Street , the S&amp;P500 is up a strong +1.3% in early afternoon trade . European markets were closed overnight for Easter . Yesterday , the Shanghai and Hong Kong exchanges were closed for local holidays , but Tokyo was open and it rose +0.8% . Obviously , the ASX and NZX were closed yesterday . <p> The latest global compilation of COVID-19 data is here .

The number of active cases there fell to 6,904,000 and down -38,000 since Saturday . <p> The UST 10yr yield is up +1 bp at 1.72% . The US 2-10 rate curve has steepened slightly to 154 bps . Their 1-5 curve is flatter at +88 bps , while their 3m-10 year curve is unchanged at +169 bps . The Australian Govt 10 year yield is up +1 bp at 1.77% . The China Govt 10 year yield is unchanged at 3.22% . And the New Zealand Govt 10 year yield is unchanged as well at 1.83% . <p> Oil prices have slumped over the weekend by about -US$2.50 and are now at just under US$58.50/bbl in the US , while the international price is now just over US$62/bbl . <p> The Kiwi dollar opens today marginally firmer at just on 70.6 USc .

" <p> Economists ' R* , or R-star , is a fiction . It 's one that they came up with after-the-fact to try to explain why their policies did n't actually work the way policymakers had initially promised . While in public , officials still speak glowingly of each QE , one after another after another , in private they know it deserves absolutely no praise . <p> Research on the effectiveness of earlier quantitative easing has yielded mixed results , with most pointing to limited effects on economic activity . While most papers found evidence that quantitative easing helped reduce yields , its effect on economic activity and inflation was found to be small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which impaired the credit channel ... emphasis added <p> Helped reduce yields . That 's a very curious way to frame ( in order to arrive at " mixed results " ) what is its only detectable , possible contribution . In fact , even this much is debatable ; ask yourself , what is it that QE is always " helping " lower rates ? As I put it last week " celebrating " the undeserving theory 's unholy twentieth anniversary : <p> In other words , falling rates correlate with QE 's if only because rates are already falling by the time central banks get around to conducting these programs . And if yields are already dropping as things get bad enough to convince central bankers to unleash their psychology , what good are even lower interest rates than the low rates bad things have already brought up ? <p> This is where R* supposedly comes into it . The modern central banker 's only job is to figure out a way to influence behavior ; but you ca n't put " behavior " into an econometric model @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plausible enough stand-in to the detached statistician with no real feel for actual economics ( small " e " ) . To achieve success , in the regression analysis , the Fed or ECB need only drive rates below computed R* -- even if the market itself is already pushing them lower . <p> If it seems a bit too wishy washy if not completely contradictory for what monetary policy projects for itself , that 's because it is complete nonsense . Here 's what I wrote just before the onset of Inflation Hysteria #1 , back in March 2017 right at the beginning of what would shortly become that whole globally synchronized growth debacle : <p> R* is just the plugline or balancing factor that attempts to make sense of why neither ultra-low interest rates after the dot-com recession nor QE in the aftermath of the Great " Recession " failed to work as they " should " have . For policymakers , policy rates went low and lower but since no great recovery resulted , especially from the QE 's , it is merely asserted that R* @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real " policy rates had been pushed down to -10% , the still lack of recovery would have left Fed officials claiming R* surely was -10.01% . <p> This is exactly what curves had been saying all along ; not only was QE failing time and again , each time it did the market adjusted to each failure ! <p> " China Got the Jobs , we got the debt and all else that emits from the FIRE sector " True enough , but the last US Administration set out to do something about that-and did . Tarriffs gave the US Manufacturers the signal they needed to get back on their horses and expand and thus David reports today " The labour market improvements are also reflected in the state of American factories . They are running at the best levels in 14 years and since before the GFC .

I agree with the sentiments expressed over expectations of public service responsibility to " give free and frank advice which does not try to divert attention from uncomfortable truths " .

The replacement public service that has evolved is more like the corporate world with their values . Irrespective of this I would say that if we are to expect our public services to " give free and frank advice which does not try to divert attention from uncomfortable truths " then we must maintain this expectation consistently across all public services . For instance , the Ministry of Education is revising our schools NZ history curriculum to ensure it reflects the truth and removes " sanitised " viewpoints . This should be applauded for rightly dealing with uncomfortable truths .

It is the classic fhb house but now worth nearly 1.2 MILLION . Jaconda has done more for boomers than for millenials <p> Over the past few years a consensus has developed in New Zealand . We are facing a severe home affordability and ownership crisis . The crisis has reached dangerous levels in recent years and looks set to get worse . <p> This is an issue that should concern all New Zealanders . It threatens a fundamental part of our culture , it threatens our communities and , ultimately , it threatens our economy . <p> Such a shame he seemed to have merely lied to New Zealanders to get into power . <p> Is a ball head someone who is follicularly challenged ? Because I have been called a ball head and retain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaning , boomer privileged pedigree that earns me the moniker ? Wishing Chris all the best , anything is a step forward from the Greens and smiling teeth . <p> If Jacinda Arden is sincere , should curb inerest only loan through rbnz - removing it now will go a long way , not only now but in future also to curb speculative activities . Perfect opportunity but both rbnz and government does not seem to want to control so most probably will come with excuse instead of closing unfairness that PM talked about between the investors and fhb . <p> All infrastructure maintenance and growth , and consents , and services connections should be covered by property rates . That would put a dampener on property prices and also apply the burden to those who benefit from the economic growth in the community ... the landholders . Right now Auckland council takes $5billion in revenue yearly , only $1.5billion is from property rates . $400million of which is spent immediately on maintaining the $10billion debt burden . <p> Double or triple property rates and levy them against land values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates , and we 'd solve this housing crisis in a heartbeat . <p> frazz We wait and see with interest . Early days only , yet so far no signs of a crash and lots of carnage . Still expecting a flat market over the next few years at least with some possible minor fall especially over the winter . I am expecting RBNZ not to take imminent action on DTI and IO loans . But used to the wife telling me that I 'm wrong . <p> frazz Decisions are not all about a simple number . For longer term ( three or four years plus ) investors have seen interest rates fall from around 3 to 4% so loss of interest deductibility ( and only to be phased in ) is offset currently by lower interest charges so numbers should n't look too bad . . . and then throw in recent rent increases and the numbers wo n't be looking too bad . As for those who have purchased in last year or two ; they will hang in there not wanting to be hit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes is more significant . Yes , some longer term investors will be seeing the market peak and considering taking the capital gains . . . but now getting a good yield on initial investment , happy to see out short term market fluctuations , not sure what to do with that cash , and to buy back in is going to mean buying in to a 10 year Brightline Test . Do n't read too much into the reported squeals of some ( headless chook ) investors . No downward pressure on rents , rather some upwards and likely to see similar squeals from renters over the next year or so . We wait and see . : ) <p> Fritz I agree . An international financial crisis is quite possible . . . as with another significant event such as a conflict which will be equivalent to Covid . I grew up in an era when the terms depression and recession were regularly banded about in the MSM , and the " Great Depression " and WW2 were deeply impressed in the minds of older generations . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and RBNZ have minimised the impact of the GFC and Covid through monetary policy and yes , their powder is seemingly now in short supply . It is for this reason I often refer to being prudent - one needs to protect oneself from adverse situations . I do n't believe in the simplistic term " safe as houses " ; however in the event of a serious calamity - financial or otherwise - then I would tend to think that housing in NZ is likely to be safer than other areas of the economy . One is more likely to see stocks and businesses more severely hit and in some instances disappear but there will always be a need for housing . Yes , I am aware of the housing bursts in the USA , Ireland and Iceland . However NZ housing was not adversely affected in the GFC as , despite criticism of them , our banks tend to be more regulated , and conservative and prudent . But watch out ; it may not be the financial crisis that gets you . . . . it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any one of other numerous risk factors in life . <p> New Zealand has the highest homeless rate in the OECD - RIGHT NOW . Also we have some of the most unaffordable housing in real terms , IN THE WORLD . <p> I respect you comment and points , yet they seem a tiny bit unconsidered in light of these facts . Going forward , outcomes will MUCH depend on the decisions of the King ( Labour Government ) over the next year-and-a-half . <p> Franky , in policy terms , Labour have a year-and-a-half to make changes - then there 's a year ( or less ) for the public to evaluate the past 6 years of Labour 's reign , until the next election . I doubt many people will vote National . <p> The only hope for NZ is Act and TOP . Both parties have different , yet coherent economic policies/visions . I 'd be happy with either course . <p> Act or TOP is a really interesting dichotomy . But I think there 's a lot of sense in what you 're saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but in a principled way that would likely result in a good outcome . Currently , the two major parties are in a centrist stalemate where despite the wails of their stakeholders nothing really changes and TPM , the Greens and previously NZ First are beholden to special interests only . <p> Primary needs , like food is more important as well as Health . When big natural disasters strike , current manipulated shelter needs still seek refuge even to a temporary/make shift shelter . Begging for food ransom , ca n't eat/drink $ , and surprise .. for health still need to get it from somewhere/someone for help . BTW , OZ banks are really more prudent in OZ as compare to the NZ bunch .. that 's why the cartel in NZ lobby so much against CAR , TD guarantee and bit shy to do independent fact finding commission .. oh yes , forgot they 're .. conservative &amp; prudent , so much so can be seen by the current average loan risk debt exposure ratio .. ehem. - It is indeed more rewarding to put accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulate vested interest view of what life is all about . <p> Oh God I hope so . I really want to be able to say I saw a negative OCR before the end . The banks have spent all that money getting their nerds to change interest rate fields to handle negatives - would be such a pity to waste the effort . <p> That is Wellington for you . Open home queues down the street . Agents are saying Wellington is the new Auckland . Jacinda thinks only Auckland has a price problem as she saw an open home across the road from her house <p> If the money is pouring out its not going under the mattress with those numbers so its going into ........ assets like houses . I guess there are unintended consequences to interest rates falling and those with money that can see the housing market rocketing . <p> Interest Only loan should be stopped only to contain the unintended consequence but by not acting on interest only loan , it seems that it is not unintended but intended consequence with face of unintended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed as Jacinda Arden said that she wants to remove all advantage that investors have over FHB and interest only only is BIG advantage as it multiply the purchasing power of Speculators over FHB . <p> It does not matter , if house price is high or low , interest only loan should go for level playing field for all TO BE FAIR and Jacinda Arden believes in fairness . <p> Sales and price growth rates next few months are expected to slow as we enter the slow season . Using the data this month and the next few as a gauge on policies or contractions and there will be multi-collinearity error . <p> Total sales in Auckland March 2020 : 3999 Total sales in Auckland March 2021 : 4137 Now consider that a week of March 2020 was hit by lockdown . Sales up 3.4% last 3 months down 1.47% 3 months prior to Xmas average was up 37% pcm The mania is over . Reversion to mean is upon us . Expect further drops in sales growth between now and June , when should be back to normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , that depends on consumer confidence and inflation , as well as the investors impact .

@@32736240 <p> You can be forgiven if you 're not 100 percent certain what the US Supreme Court ruled in its Google vs . Oracle decision . Yes , we know that " Google won " -- or , as Justice Stephen Breyer wrote , " Google 's copying of the Java API did not violate the copyright law . " This is true , but goes only so far . Google , after all , had gone to court with two big arguments : one , that APIs are n't copyrightable and , two , that even if APIs are copyrightable , Google 's use of the Java API to develop Android constituted fair use . <p> The US Supreme Court sidestepped the first question , arguably the more important of the two , with Breyer writing , " Given the rapidly changing technological , economic , and business-related circumstances , we believe we should not answer more than is necessary to resolve the parties ' dispute . " That 's better than what the world would have looked like had the Court sided with Oracle , which would have " threatened disastrous consequences for innovation , " as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're left with an industry where APIs might or might not be copyrightable . The considerable solace , however , is that courts have been given the nod to take a generous view on fair use as related to APIs and interoperability , one that makes developer utility central to the doctrine of fair use . <h> A world of copyrightable APIs ... <p> Last year Hannu Valtonen outlined all that could go wrong if APIs were deemed to be copyrightable . Developers , quite simply , would have to unlearn decades of common development practices , while business interests could set up toll gates on their APIs to monetise them . It would also become dramatically harder to achieve compatibility across products , entrenching big , corporate interests . <p> In a word , it would be terrible . <p> Yet we 're not actually any farther away from this potential future today than we were before the US Supreme Court ruled , because they ducked the issue , as Justice Clarence Thomas fired off in his dissent . ( " By skipping over the copyrightability question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fair-use analysis . " ) I do n't blame the Justices for skipping that question , because based on the questions they 'd been asking the counsel for both parties , it seems likely that few of them ( Justice Breyer excepted ) seemed to really understand what an API is or does . Digging into the copyrightability question would perhaps have required them to understand the function of APIs better than they were capable of . <p> So we 're left with the same uncertainty about copyright and APIs as before , though with the silver lining that the Court expressly did not say that APIs can be copyrighted . This might give support to previous appellate rulings that skewed against copyrightability , as Timothy Lee points out . <p> It also made it clear that copying APIs for the purpose of interoperability is pretty clearly fair use , even while leaving murky just how " fair " that use would be if the product making the API calls is directly competitive ... or an open source version of the proprietary product . <h> Wither open source ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least over at The Wall Street Journal . " A Supreme Court ruling that sided with Alphabet Inc. ' s Google in its 10-year legal battle with Oracle Corp . reaffirms the business model behind open source software -- sharing bits of computer code for free , experts said , " wrote Angus Loten . I 'm not sure the Court 's decision did anything of the sort , and I 'm very much in favour of anything that furthers the cause of open source software . <p> Loten , for example , cites Forrester analyst David Mooter , who argues that " a decision in Oracle 's favour would have exposed open source software makers to copyright trolls threatening lawsuits over similarities between competing software codes . " This is true of all developers , not just open source developers . And , in fact , it might be less true of open source developers these days , who have tended to be the real innovators over the last decade , not imitators . Open source software as varied as Kubernetes , PyTorch , Apache Kafka , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copyright infringement . This is all state-of-the-art stuff , not copycat code . <p> If anything , however , the Court 's decision did centre on the importance of developers of all kinds , open source or otherwise . Instead of focusing on the owner of the code that a developer calls through an API , the Court chose to focus on the value of those developers . This is a big deal . The Court reached its decision by holding " Google 's limited copying of the API is a transformative use " because " Google copied only what was needed to allow programmers to work in a different computing environment without discarding a portion of a familiar programming language . " <p> More bluntly , the majority opinion went on , " Google wanted millions of programmers , familiar with Java , to be able easily to work with its new Android platform , so it also copied roughly 11,500 lines of code from the Java SE program . " <p> This is a victory shout for developers of all kinds , including open source developers . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the silly notion that APIs can be copyrighted , at least the Court expanded the definition of fair use in a way to take into account what is good for developers to build great software . This will help all developers , including those that choose to apply open source licences to their code . <p> Copyright 2021 IDG Communications . ABN 14 001 592 650 . All rights reserved .

The Committee agreed that the interaction between price and wage inflation and inflation expectations will be important in determining the sustainability of inflation pressures in the medium term . <p> Members agreed that employment is below its maximum sustainable level and expect employment to increase gradually over the medium term . The Committee noted that employment outcomes are uneven across the economy with some firms having difficulty finding skilled labour as a result of border restrictions and skills mismatches . <p> Following the February Monetary Policy Statement , the Minister of Finance issued a new remit for the Monetary Policy Committee and issued the Bank a direction specifically relating to its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Committee 's new remit and emphasised it was important to clarify that the objectives of monetary policy in the new remit remain unchanged : to maintain a stable general level of prices over the medium term and support maximum sustainable employment .

The Committee 's initial assessment is that stimulatory monetary policy is playing a role in lifting house prices . Other factors are also influencing house prices including : the impact of low global interest rates on all asset prices , constrained housing supply and infrastructure , land use regulations , tax policies and the broader recovery in aggregate demand . <p> The Committee also discussed the broader distributional impacts of lower interest rates .

Staff presented and discussed a preliminary suite of indicators assessing house price sustainability with the Committee . Preliminary assessments on the Bank 's response to the Ministerial direction will be included in the May Financial Stability Report . <p> Overall , the Committee agreed that the risks to the economic outlook remain balanced , conditional on ongoing stimulatory fiscal and monetary policies .

Staff noted that reduced government bond issuance was placing less upward pressure on New Zealand government bond yields and providing less scope for LSAP purchases . Members also noted that the proceeds from the upcoming maturity of the May 2021 New Zealand Government Bond would be reinvested over time as part of the weekly purchases . The Committee affirmed that weekly changes in the LSAP do not represent a change in monetary policy stance .

The Committee expects a prolonged period of time to pass before these conditions are met . <p> The Committee agreed that it was prepared to lower the Official Cash Rate ( OCR ) if required . <p> On Wednesday 14 April , the Committee reached a consensus to : <p> hold the OCR at 0.25 percent ; <p> maintain the existing LSAP programme of a maximum of $100 billion by June 2022 ; and <p> Remember we welcome robust , respectful and insightful debate . We do n't welcome abusive or defamatory comments and will de-register those repeatedly making such comments . Our current comment policy is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much overshoot of the official measures ( once it starts to register properly ) will they allow and for how long on inflation ? Will they say we 're in catch-up mode for a few quarters while consumer prices on take-off on an uncaptured basis ? <p> I 'd be surprised if Orr would let it run too hot over 3% CPI if at all . Last time CPI exceeded 3% was September 2011 . In contrast CPI has been below 1% in 12 quarters since then . RBNZ is obviously supporting term deposit holders by undershooting CPI and overcooking OCR . <p> Facetiousness aside and in fairness , it 'll be a mix of more " look through " and a bit of changing the CPI bundle , most likely . It 's only a couple of decades since we removed the cost of land from the bundle and freed ourselves to inflate it to the moon . <p> But if inflation ( historically ) is measured via money supply , why would you use consumption prices to measure inflation in a period of globalisation that causes deflationary effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a lost cat but giving helpers in the search a picture of a lost dog . They never find the cat . <p> Because increased money supply with no corresponding increase in the price of consumer goods and services indicates production is matching demand so that no price rises caused by decreased supply compared to demand is arising . In such a case there is no need to restrict money supply . Why would you want to ? <p> ' What do you think would have been the outcome if money supply was not increased e.g. no wage subsidies to employees impacted by Covid ? ' <p> Well exactly what we needed and now need even more ! A severe recession that clears out the zombie companies and reset assets prices and debt levels so that interest rates can moderate and bring stability back to the economy . <p> Exactly right . Even the most extreme Keynesian would not hide the fundamental role in economic development played by the economic cycle . The only place where they thought they could remove it without consequence was in Soviet Russia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now it is actually even worse , with the pervasive delusional thinking that the economic cycle can be removed by creating asset bubbles like the housing Ponzi . <p> Imagine if we have inflation and interest rates start rising , then mortgage rates go up , then landlords are forced to push rents up , then that gets feedback into CPI measurements , then the central bank sees inflation , then the OCR goes up , then mortgage rates go up , then rents go up , then central banks see even more inflation ( what a death loop ! ) <p> The measurement of inflation is an odd/chicken egg thing . Its low because we 've set interest rates low . But if they start creeping up there could be some horrible feedback loop effects that might be difficult to control . <p> Ok so the market sets rents - not landlords . I will just have to remind the landlords of that on the property investment pages ! They think they set rents based upon their expenses ( like when they lose interest deductability ) , not what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in important costs for the average consumer the measure becomes less meaningful . We 've had low inflation , yet we 've massively devalued wages and savings vis-a-vis one of the biggest purchases of most consumers ' lives . <p> I 'm all for elegant measures but they need to be of value . We ca n't tell people their purchasing power is all fine and dandy while we 're transferring their real wealth away to others and their ability to build a life is suffering as a result . <p> The Official Cash Rate ( OCR ) will remain at 0.25% . The cap on the Large-Scale Asset Purchase ( LSAP ) programme will remain at $100 billion , and the Funding for Lending Programme will continue to operate under existing conditions . Both programmes will continue to run through to June 2022 . <p> I do n't see how fiat currency can have legitimacy going forward if crypto is allowed to spread .

But I just do n't see how central banks can allow crypto popularity to spread without risk losing legitimacy of their role or the currency they back . There will need to be a tipping point in one direction or the other that could change the future of finance/economics . <p> Yes , I have thought along those lines , and my view is that they have a vaguely formed plan to pump fiat hard to win as much time as they can , while preparing the rollout of their CBDC .

But then they come to realise that the government can now track every transaction , tax it at time of transfer , and monitor what you do so they will jsut buy Bitcoin where they cant stop you . CBDC will be the worst thing to happen to the world , easily leading to a more Orwellian future .

If crypto 's do take hold and there 's a major scramble from fiat currency ( which there is a reasonable chance ) , central banks will either fix the price of the crypto or ban ownership completely . <p> Otherwise they lose control of the financial system . Why would anyone bother holding fiat currency they are destroying ? And how would the central bank of the global power at the time control the quantity and value of the major store of wealth used to trade goods and services . <p> Otherwise they lose control of the financial system .

I was quite useless at these jobs but they paid well although I was never invited back . Once I worked in a foundry where I was n't strong enough to fill the moulds with wet sand so they gave me a cushy job in the yard sorting out different pieces of metal at my own pace . After a couple of years at university still not knowing what career I wanted to pursue I decided to give accounting a go . So I bought a teach yourself book-keeping book from Whitcombe and Tombs ( now Whitcoulls ) and spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then applied for an accounting job advertised in the Herald . With no experience I thought my chances were zilch . But I did get the job and was straightaway called the ' assistant accountant ' at a quite large import and manufacturing company in Penrose supplying the dairy industry . I stayed there for about a year before boredom got the better of me . <p> Back in the UK my Dad ( who left school , at 15 ) rose to find himself running 8 car franchise garages by 28 , working 6.5 frantic days a week . Along the way sometime ( in the army ? ) he 'd done a Metropolitan College paper on bookkeeping and accounts - he could add . Anyhoo , we emigrated to NZ ( which at that time was almost literally like transferring to the colonies ) and he thought employers would ooh and ahh over his meteoric and youthful rise to management . The first interviewer heard about the beancounting paper , dwelled on it for the rest of the interview , then quickly hired him as a sales manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and penalising that that increases it is arguably one of the most important areas of focus that central banks will need to get involved in in the future . It 's not really their job , but their job currently rewards destruction of the environment and biosphere and in that regard is ultimately incompatible with long-term financial stability . <p> On Wednesday 14 April , the Committee reached a consensus to : - hold the OCR at 0.25 percent ; - maintain the existing LSAP programme of a maximum of $100 billion by June 2022 ; and - maintain the existing Funding for Lending Programme ( FLP ) conditions . <p> Potentially banks could end up owning government and RMBS assets greater than outstanding business loan assets , which have already contracted 4.1% to date - source . <p> Peter Schiff ( love him or hate him ... I 'm undecided ) is more confident that the US has overcooked their money printing than he was about his prediction the US was going to tank in 2008 ( which he was right ) . He see 's high inflation then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates . <p> Oh he 's been saying the same thing for over 15 years . If you just keep predicting downturns you eventually get it right . Also , he predicted that the US dollar would crash - but the reverse happened during the GFC - it went up . <p> 1 : Today Mr erOrr was dead drop silent on DTI and Interest Only Loan , may be today was not the day to speak on it but am sure when he does speak on 5th May - his excuse will be wait and watch as below was mentioned last time and also now , so is preparing his excuse . <p> " It expected the Government 's new housing policies to dampen house price growth . But it said it would take time for the impact of these on inflation and employment to be seen . <p> The Committee also maintained the net effect of the trans-Tasman bubble was yet to be seen " <p> Another highlight , when it comes to supporting the ponzi , is taking the ' least regret approach BUT when it comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " approach . <p> Does it not exposes them ? ? ? <p> If least regret approach is for overall economy and do not want average Kiwi and FHB to be collateral damage ( already been ) than why not take counter measure by stopping Interest Only Loan .... why wait and watch attitute ....... <p> It is and has been very evident that Interest Only Loan , not only gives undue advantage to so called investors over FHB but also a right step in curbing speculative activity , more than tax change ( though even that was good but that may affect all investors but stopping IO loan will target future speculators by squeezing easy and cheap money ) . <p> Can hold me if am wrong as Mr Orr is bound to come out with wait and watch attitude as if rampant rise in last few months , not enough to act as both Politicians and bureaucrats and reserve bank though may anything but in reality has no interest to control the ponzi . <p> If you are familiar with Samuel Beckett 's play " Waiting for Godot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting forever . When they make up the rules , their power is total . Every time I listen to Orr ( or any other central banker ) , I 'm convinced that whatever they say is also totally made up .

Often clinicians are involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a healthcare provider . <p> " As a result , many senior managers have little understanding of the potential and the increasingly important role of digital technology in healthcare . New digital approaches to clinical decision support are not being prioritised because their potential is poorly understood . " <p> In New Zealand , digital health is frequently only provided as an elective course in education or professional training or taught as a standalone subject in many of our educational institutions rather than being integrated across health subjects . <p> Although some DHBs have appointed clinical chief information officers ( CCIOs ) , the role remains poorly defined and is not universally accepted . Meanwhile , in NHS England , the role of CCIO is standard . <p> The report says digital literacy in the health workforce is the cornerstone of the integration of new and innovative technologies in the health and disability sector . <p> The OECD says successful digital transformation in the health sector is not a simple matter of technical change but requires a complex adaptive change in people 's attitudes and skills as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial frameworks . <p> " It is crucial that the health workforce is able to be confident and competent in their digital skills , thus providing the best care to consumers , improving daily workflows , and giving the workforce the opportunity to participate in ongoing professional development to acquire this skillset , to stay relevant and expand their own career pathways in the future .

@@32761231 <h> The FMA has released a warning to fund managers to not overstate the importance of their 2020 returns due to large fluctuations in the market last year . <p> You see it beneath the returns graph of any fund worth its salt . Past performance is no guarantee of future returns . <p> But this nuance is becoming lost as certain fund managers attempt to cash in on market fluctuations in 2020 by advertising phenomenal returns . <p> An example of this has been NZ Funds , which put up a billboard in Wellington airport advertising 107% returns in 2020 <p> James Grigor , chief investment officer at NZ Funds has stated that , " The reporting and advertising of annual returns has been an industry-wide practice since the very beginnings of KiwiSaver . <p> " Every KiwiSaver provider has these results on their website . It 's how independent organisations like Morningstar and Sorted rank and display KiwiSaver performance . <p> " But we respect the FMA 's new guidance , and in order to comply with it , we prepared replacement billboards , to go up before the Tuesday night deadline . " <p> However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when he saw the advertisement he felt " sadness and anger " . <p> " The vast majority of fund managers would not advertise like this . <p> " Of course other players have incredible numbers too , but we wo n't put those numbers out because it gives completely the wrong impression on what future returns may be and it can encourage the most vulnerable and the least informed to switch funds for reasons the fund manager will know are highly unlikely to be repeated . " <p> Stubbs says " NZ Funds charge fees high enough to be able to afford an ethics and morals lesson , so perhaps that would be money well spent . " <p> The FMA seems to agree with Stubbs , coming out strongly against this behaviour and warning the funds management industry to avoid advertising large investment returns for the 12 month period preceding March 31 , 2021 . <p> The period refers to the post-March recovery which saw the economy claw its way back from the brink , resulting in some phenomenal returns for many funds , particularly those with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that investors are being told returns for the 12-month period -- without the context of the dire drop that preceded it -- may be misled into thinking the performance seen is typical , or that particular managers have significant , repeatable skills . <p> Key to the FMA is the difference that it makes to their returns if fund managers were to advertise yearly returns starting one month before the recovery . The numbers of market index performance that include the March 2020 sell-down shows the importance of the time period involved when promoting returns . <p> Paul Gregory , FMA director of investment management has said , " Some fund managers with growth products share our concerns and have already told us they will not be promoting performance focused exclusively over this 12-month period . " <p> The FMA has asked KiwiSaver providers , other fund managers , and financial advisers to : <p> - avoid advertising performance for the 12-month period to March 31 , 2021 ( or , where promotion has already happened , withdrawing advertisements and promotions ) <p> - ensure the content does not place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Gregory says if providers continue to promote the strong returns seen over the 12-month period in question , " we will be closely monitoring whether doing so potentially breaches the fair dealing provisions contained in the Financial Markets Conduct Act 2013 " . <h> Comments from our readers <p> So apparently a valid business is no longer able to advertise either factual information or their unique capability any more .

Shall we go the other way next time and delete bad months because of COVID etc ? I am sure every adviser points out to a client that historical returns are not indicative of any possible future returns .

When you make a decision to travel , you risk the rules changing when you 're overseas and you find yourself stranded . Initially flights were suspended from India by the Government for two weeks and now , while Mr Kashyap , a New Zealand citizen , can return to New Zealand , there are no commercial flights to get him home . <p> We 're having the same conversation we had when we first began closing our borders , and when the MIQ voucher system was brought into play , and at Christmas when everyone wanted to come home to enjoy our glorious summer . <p> In the early stages of Covid repatriation flights were available and there were border exceptions , but for over 12 months New Zealanders wanting to return home have had to be patient . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair . That 's how it goes when your border is the first line of defence . <p> I have great sympathy for Mr Kashyap and his family . He 's at the mercy of commercial flights and unless flights to New Zealand from India via stop over ports are postponed on a more permanent basis , I do n't see the government stepping in to help . <p> It 's a reminder of how fragile the world remains . <p> Since April 19 , when Kiwis and Australians began crossing the ditch quarantine free , we 've seen how easy it is for slip ups to happen . It 's the right time to give the Trans-Tasman bubble a whirl but I 'm not sure we can rely on trust if things go wrong . If travellers are required to self-isolate for five days until a negative Covid test is received there need to be checks to make sure it 's happening . <p> Most travellers are aware the risk is on them ; and if something goes wrong , they will likely have to adjust their plans to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting to see how the system works , or until they receive the vaccination , before jumping on a plane . <p> Just overnight Ministry of Health has said all direct flights from Western Australia to New Zealand should be immediately paused after a worker at a Perth managed isolation facility tested positive for Covid-19 . The trans-Tasman Bubble will only work if we move quickly when issues arise . <p> But I 'm not so sure that people will play their part by doing the right thing . <p> We 've seen several passengers take advantage of the trans-Tasman Bubble to return to New Zealand from other parts of the globe , and when there 's been a breach contact tracing is still important . <p> So the NZ Covid Tracer App is really important . If you have an MIQ facility in your town I think you 're probably more likely to use the NZ Covid Tracer App , but for regions yet to experience a Covid case there 's little historical incentive to record your movements . <p> These school holidays we headed to Hawkes Bay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and wine , glorious beaches to walk along , cycle ways and galleries .

I stood in the centre of Napier and watched for quite a while ; no one even looked for the QR code . Not even the two police officers I followed into Tank . I know there will be times when it 's impossible to stop and use the app , such as being in a hot pursuit , but getting lunch was surely an opportunity for good role modelling . <p> This is just an observation and I 'm not having a go at Hawkes Bay -- I 'm sure it 's the same all over the country . <p> But this complacency could be our biggest issue .

However , annual changes indicate the labour market still has n't returned to pre-Covid-19 levels for men or women , " Stats NZ 's work , wealth , and wellbeing statistics senior manager Sean Broughton said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . <p> The Labour Cost Index increased 1.6% in the year to the March 2021 quarter , with wage inflation remaining steady from last quarter . This is the first quarter since the December 2019 quarter where annual wage inflation has not slowed . <p> " Typically , March quarters see more muted wage inflation but this quarter we saw modest wage growth as New Zealand continues to have travel restrictions and businesses aimed to retain and attract staff , " Broughton said . <p> Westpac acting chief economist Michael Gordon said the unemployment result reinforces the sense that the New Zealand economy " is past the worst of the Covid-19 shock , and that the unemployment rate of 5.2% in the September quarter last year will prove to be the ( surprisingly low ) peak in this cycle " . <p> " The result was better than our forecast of a flat outturn , and the Reserve Bank 's forecast of an increase to 5.0% . The implication is that while we 're still below what the RBNZ would consider to be ' maximum sustainable employment ' according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Remember we welcome robust , respectful and insightful debate .

Chuck in all those extra billions in bank created mortgage cash = rockstar . Seems this is more a sugar rush than anything of substance or sustainable ... or am I mistaken ? <p> That $40 B includes $12 B for the covid subsidy that hopefully wo n't be needed again in the near future . Still a $3 B increase : 1 B NZ super , 0.7 B accomodation supplement , 0.5 B for the regular benefits . As always NZ super is the lion 's share of the social development spending , trying to reign in the rest is n't going to solve that . <p> yes it does however the context of this is unemployment level . The overall stimulus through the benefit system and the billions in mortgage debt are the drivers of this artificial good news job story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are really interesting . Estimate of 2.6 B in the 2020/2021 year on accomodation assistance . With about 1 million rentals that 's a 2,500 subsidy per property to landlords . Add on to that the GST exemption for rent which is probably another 3k+/year/property . Do n't know why they 're so upset about losing mortgage interest deductions . <p> You ca n't look at the unemployment rate in isolation - the other figures give a better picture overall . If the respondent working 1 hour per week classified as employed wanted more hours , they would be classified as ' underutilised ' . <p> Also , those of working age not looking for work can be ascertained with the labour participation rate ( i.e. 100-70.4 = 29.6% of NZ 's working age population neither working nor actively looking ) . <p> The supply of overseas ' students ' and those coming in through other work visa scam channels dries up and unemployment falls to unexpectedly low levels . Could there be a connection ? Might employers be having to actually solicit and attract labour instead of lazily leaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slaves flying in ? <p> Kris Faafoi said earlier this week that the Productivity Commission inquiry into our long-term immigration settings wo n't be concluded until April 2021 , so policy changes in response to the findings wo n't happen till late next year . <p> However , some immediate changes are to be announced in the ' coming weeks ' that are intended to to tilt the balance away from low-skilled work , by attracting high-skilled migrants and meeting genuine skills shortages . This should be interesting ! <p> Yes its reading comments like this that really makes the day drag lol ! Fancy wanting immigrants who can actually add value to our economy . Such innovation in government ! For the love of God what was the previous balance ? ? <p> Previous policy of all governments from Clark onwards was to flood NZ with as many necessary to create the illusion of genuine economic growth . Faafois review is to ' tilt the balance away from low-skilled work ' . I 'm confused . Was n't that what the skills based points system is already supposedly designed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full-time job in NZ for every two working age people . One in three working age people are not earning a wage at all . There are 135,000 people unemployed . There are 300,000+ workers who want more hours and greater security of income . But , at least the number of people who can be bothered to register as being unemployed has gone down by 0.2% . <p> 4.7 % unemployment rates is 135,000 people excluding sickness and disability . so why cant these people do the jobs that have traditionally gone to immigrant workers . If people refuse to work then refuse the benefit . people are screaming out for workers and at $20 per hour , is it really that bad . The graph is typical of how governments shape B.S into a positive . <p> In the real world , there is a huge mismatch between people wanting to work and the amount , type and location of work available . For example : <p> - There are 25,000 to 30,000 job vacancies in NZ . Yet , there are 135,000 people actively seeking work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thousands of people not in the labour market who would be tempted back by the right job opportunity . Do the Math - The kind of jobs available are often poorly suited to the people looking for them . If you collect your kids from school in Hamilton at 3:30pm , or look in on your elderly mother a few times a week , you ca n't be toiling in the vineyards in the Hawkes Bay and sleeping in a dormitory for $20 per hour . This is n't laziness - it literally makes zero sense to swap poverty on benefits with your family , for poverty with hard work in a field without your family <p> Our economic model relies on having a decent stock of desperate , unemployed people on standby . This is how wages and working conditions are kept low . Economists even argue that this ' buffer stock ' of unemployed people is absolutely necessary to control inflation ( idiots ) . Anyway , What those who benefit from this model want everyone to think is that people are unemployed because they are lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Most vacancies are in the main centres . No vineyards there . Thousands find ways to fit in their domestic responsibilities around jobs . Many employers will accommodate these arrangements for good workers . <p> Dave . Friend of the family lost their full time modestly paying job due to covid shutdowns so went on the benefit . She 's an industrious person who wants to work so unsurprisingly has found something and back in the workforce . But she was intrigued that her all benefits combined when on welfare was just $100 less per week less than when working . She said that not having to get up to go to work was great and she can see why many choose it as a lifestyle option . I have n't fact checked her data but if correct it 's not surprising that we still have a solid block of ' unemployed ' at a time when employers are complaining about shortages of workers . <p> I posted this on here the other day . A screenshot of someone 's WINZ entitlements page they posted on Facebook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 4 raking in what someone who earns a $78k salary does every week . <p> Yes , it 's funny how misunderstood our benefits/tax transfer system is - folks that moan about the unemployed - seem to generally ignore/not realise that the employed get all those benefits/tax transfers ( aside from the Sole Parent support line ) as well . <p> What I do accept is that our costs-of-living are too high in comparison to our wages . And that 's primarily a failure of government to regulate well - and that 's primarily because they 've been stuck in a neoliberal , globalist ideological quagmire . <p> Start with #rentcontrolsnow as a means to regulate the single largest COL expense and then take it from there in terms of climbing out of the tax transfer muck . <p> But what does that say ? It all comes down to whether she was able to live comfortably ; without using savings or going into debt with $100 less per week . And " all the benefits combined " also tells a story - why ca n't we just have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs . A single person ( not living at parents home ) Job Seeker ( unemployment ) benefit is $258.50 after tax per week . You ca n't be implying that this person was living comfortably on that ? <p> As a matter of comparison ( noting that there are many , many differences in social equity ) in Thailand you can get an unemployment benefit equal to 50% of your average daily wage in the highest paid three months in the nine months before unemployment . It is paid for up to 180 days in any calendar year ; if voluntarily unemployed , 30% of the insured 's average daily wage is paid for up to 90 days in any calendar year . The benefit recipient must check in once a month and must take a suitable job if offered . <p> The unemployment rate for Thailand was 1.86% in the October-December quarter , down from 1.90% in the September quarter . The rate hit an 11-year high of 1.95% in the June quarter . <p> It 's hollow politicking from Nash . He 'll act the populist tough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more cash from tourists at the border to pay for national park services but beyond that his options to regulate categories of tourists are limited . Was in Queenstown coupla weeks ago , developers down there do n't seem to believe teeming mass tourism is going to be curbed any time soon . <p> Wow you can create any narrative you want from those figures . Love it how you just create new categories so more and more people actually get excluded from the real unemployment figure . The result is you can claim its going down when its actually going up .

The March report on realestate.co.nz shows an average asking price of $834,768 , the Newshub article gives it as $835,844 , and interest.co.nz has it at $863,396 . So not even realestate.co.nz 's own figures agree with each other between the March and April reports . <p> Normally April is a slower month for housing and after hyped housing policy announced should have hoped to control the ever growing ponzi but average house price still going up speaks volume for itself . <p> Now what Mr Robertson and Mr Orr as this was not the data that you both were expecting . Surely you both will still find reason and excuse to not act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent to put a brake on speculative demand . <p> Even now , if they act is not ' least regret ' but will be ' better late than never ' policy . <p> FOMO has to be controlled and for that have to target speculative demand to bring some equilibrium in the market otherwise all efforts are a farce to create smoke with no real intent . <p> In the scheme of things the 2.1% decline only gives back the March increases - so we are still only back at Feb prices . There are some very wide discrepancies in house falls- a couple of months ago everybody was talking about the central north island been the next " hotspot " and those prices have fallen fast . Central Otago could be in for a world of pain - especially as its obvious that borders are nt opening anytime soon and whilst Aussies will come and ski - I 'm not sure its going to be enough people to help ALL the businesses in Queenstown survive . <p> As for listings - looking at Auckland stock with sales of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thats 3 months stock available . Wellington is low on stock still - especially Wellington City and Porirua , but Upper and lower hutt have their highest number of listings since Sept last year and in these regions new developments are nt selling out like they were before Xmas so it does indicate lower demand . Lower hutt which does nt usually list prices ( preferring to advertise with tender and then price by negotiation ) had 17% of houses listed with a price as of Friday . Following the lockdown last year when a downturn was predicted only 10% of houses in the hutt had a listed price . <p> Nothing new in it , as has always been and will always be BUT the Bigger question is , what is government along with RBNZ going to do suppress demand - as can not target deamnd from FHB moving into home , should they be not targeting speculative demand . <p> That is the elephant in the room . Current build is greater than natural population growth . If the immigration floodgates are not reopened , the excess demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance . But past form of both Labour and National indicates the floodgates will reopen as soon as Covid is under control . <p> We had sufficient shelter 20 years ago . Then a bunch of elected officials in Wellington decided that mass immigration would solve our problems . What it did was create a series of problems we previously did not have . <p> Just a minor " blip " ladies and gentlemen ...... normal transmission will resume shortly , as Auntie Cindy and her side kick Grantee have it all under " control " ...... just rest your wee heads , you multiple owing property folk out there .... us renters and one property owner plebs will keep slaving our guts out to keep your " retirement scheme " going , so your spoilt brat , " self entitled " offspring will reap the rewards of your hard work and your benevolence for providing a damp , cold , mouldy , dump to some minimum waged young couple .... while essential repairs are put on the back burner .... forever . <p> Is this not possibly just realestate.co.nz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I certainly would n't bother with their site . Just looking this morning Trademe has 21,128 listings nationally vs 19,473 on realestate . If you are going to presume one website to be indictative of all NZ property listings then I 'd be looking at Trademe . <p> Thanks Greg , very interesting , it looks like the new anti-investor rules are indeed having an effect . Could you please tell us if there is generally a lowering of asking prices from March to April in previous years or not ( except 2020 ) to give us some perspective ? Thanks <p> Still no answers on why the mythical ' lack of supply ' would enable people on moderate incomes to buy a house for over $1 Million dollars . It can only happen via the banks willingness to lend eye-popping amounts to people in order for them to take their place in the Ponzi . There may be a lack of supply of Ferarri 's , but if I can not come up with the money it is neither here no there : I ca n't buy one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamnetal questions about how sustainable and prudent it is to have NZ 's often old and sub-par housing stock changing hands at these prices . <p> I believe it 's such places as Raetihi , Taihape and Waiouru , and as far north as Taumarunui . But looking on their website it appears to include Taupo as well , which of all the towns there would likely be the only one large enough to have a reasonably consistent sale price indicator . <p> On Realestate.co.nz the average asking price for March is $834 ' 769 ( not $863 ' 396 ) , I could not yet find the April data . If this March figure and also Interest 's April figure of $845 ' 056 are correct , then asking prices actually rose ! Can you please clarify Greg <p> See my comment above stating the same thing ... I assume that interest.co.nz and other news sources have access to preliminary figures before realestate.co.nz has checked/published them . If you look at the heading of this article it states : " Asking prices on Realestate.co.nz 's portal " . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually publish in their reports ? And different to what Newshub use ? Shows that data can just be manipulated/interpreted to come up with different stories/conclusions as needed ... <p> As I noted in my reply to comments on this question above - " The differences in the figures are easily explained . Realestate.co.nz produces seasonally adjusted and non-seasonally adjusted figures . We use the non-seasonally adjusted figures in our reports . " <p> Why does a subset of the population ie the property investor , bankers , RE agents etc who sponge off the taxpayer and the renter , have so much say ? ? ? ..... instead , if we put as much financial resources , time and expertise into R&amp;D , growing new and niche industries/markets , bringing in people that can assist and develop these new industries/markets and ONLY those people , we would ALL be better off ..... a small economy at the bottom of the world will NOT have the best long term economic outcomes , if this absolute " fixation " with residential property investing continues ...... or is it just a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll pull up the ladder and the rest of you can just &amp;$%$# off " <h> BIG SAVINGS ON <h> BIG CURRENCY TRANSFERS <p> Currency rates on this page are supplied for indication purposes only , and may or may not be rates offered by any institution .

For many Kiwis , realizing the promise and essence of digital technologies is vital . Additionally , the widespread adoption of digital tools across the country can underpin a vibrant economy with less socio-economic inequality and greater well-being . <p> One of the biggest hindrances to this potential new reality is the lack of adequate digital skills among New Zealanders and various aspects of their lives . Fortunately , results show that Kiwis understand the potential for digital technologies to improve their society and economy . <p> COVID-19 Offers Critical Context <p> The pandemic saw many New Zealanders adhere to " safer-at-home " guidelines , which resulted in increased use of the internet .

There was an e-commerce boom as many traditional retailers shifted their operations online to survive the lockdown restrictions and resultant economic recession .

The government needs to continue working to extend access to high-speed internet into every corner of the country . Already , 95 percent of Kiwis enjoy internet access at home while 96 percent use it at least a few times weekly . <p> A concerted effort between the private , public , and not-for-profit sectors is critical to increase Internet access and ensure digital skills training programs across the board .

Lambert/Getty Images <p> From experimenting with different sex positions to bringing accessories into the bedroom , there are a plethora of steamy ways to take your sex life to the next level . But more and more couples are flirting with the idea of non-monogamy as a way to find fulfillment . In fact , in a 2020 YouGov poll of more than 1,300 U.S. adults , about one-third ( 32% ) said that their ideal relationship is non-monogamous to some degree . <p> " Some form of a non-monogamous relationship dynamic might be for you if the idea of being intimate with more than one partner excites you , " says Amy Baldwin , sex educator , sex and relationship coach , and co-host of the Shameless Sex Podcast . " Some folks choose it to spice up their current partnership with newness and aliveness while others may do so to remedy sexual or emotional needs that are not being met in their current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can take a variety of forms -- one of which is swinging , also referred to as being in " the lifestyle , " a sexual practice that involves engaging in sexual activities with another couple and single people . Here , how this particular type of consensual non-monogamy works and best practices for getting started . <h> The Basics on Being in " The Lifestyle " <p> Baldwin explains that a swinger , or someone in " the lifestyle , " is typically : <p> Married and/or heterosexual . <p> In a committed relationship . <p> Open to engaging in sexual activity with other people . <p> Aiming to have a shared experience with their partner . <p> That said , people in the lifestyle can be solo as well , says intimacy expert Susan Bratton . And they often gather at public or private parties ( which used to be called " key parties " ) that are hosted in rental homes , resorts , or even cruise ships ( most of which were put on hold over the past year due to COVID ) . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as ' unicorns ' -- but severely throttle the number of single men who can attend because otherwise the ratio would fall too much toward a bunch of horny guys , " she notes . <p> You can usually find lifestyle parties with a simple Google search , but the most important aspect of involvement is being invited in , showing up , and getting invited back over time to establish yourself as a trustworthy and valuable addition to the group , explains Bratton . <h> What Swinging Involves In Practice <p> While swinging , partners might engage in " same room " sex , which refers to all activities taking place in the same room , so partners can see each other enjoying themselves , explains Sarah Melancon , Ph.D. , a clinical sexologist and sexuality and relationships expert for SexToyCollective.com , who adds that this may also provide a sense of security for some . But sharing the experience does n't necessarily mean sharing the same space . Swingers might also participate in " separate room " sex , which is exactly what it sounds like . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the underlying intention is generally a feeling of shared turn-on or aliveness that somehow fuels more fire into the partnership . <p> There are also several levels of partner swapping that swingers will engage in , according to Melancon : <p> A " soft swap " : Involves sexual activities up to and including oral sex . <p> A " full swap " or " hard swap " : Involves most sexual activities , including intercourse ( vaginal or anal , depending on preferences ) . <p> " Some couples like to start with soft swaps to get their feet wet , so to speak , while for others they simply prefer to reserve intercourse for their romantic relationship , " explains Melancon , who adds that the level at which a couple is willing to swap could be related to either preference or health concerns , like STI transmission and pregnancy risk . <p> While it might sound counterintuitive , couples who engage in swinging do n't necessarily define their relationship as " open . " Think of " open relationship " as a bit of an umbrella @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from purely sexual no-strings-attached experiences with multiple people to dating and/or deeper connections , " she notes . And open relationships are more about satisfying each person 's unique needs , while swinging is a " team effort . " <p> A third form of consensual non-monogamy : Polyamory , which is different from swinging and open relationships in that it focuses on the building of relationships with other people outside of your primary partnership , says Baldwin . " It is less casual and more about love or connection , often resulting in multiple loving relationships , and even multiple committed partners , " she says . <h> How to Know if Swinging Is Right for You <p> If you 're unclear on which type of non-monogamy appeals the most , reflect on whether you 're craving a shared experience with your partner , you might want to try swinging . <p> But if you want to exercise your own sexual freedom or autonomy outside of your current relationship , you might be more interested in an open relationship . And if you want to connect with and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , says Baldwin . <h> How to Start Swinging <p> Consider taking the following steps to dip your toe into the lifestyle . <p> 1 . Talk to your partner . <p> Once you 've concluded that swinging is the form of non-monogamy that would work best for you , broach the conversation with your partner . " If they are a ' maybe ' or a ' yes , ' be sure to spend plenty of time learning more about how to navigate non-monogamy , as well as having plenty of clear conversations about feelings , boundaries , and needs , " suggests Baldwin . <p> And note that getting a " yes " from your partner is crucial . " Both partners should have a similar interest level before trying swinging , " says Melancon . " If one partner is unsure or is doing it just to make their partner happy , it is more likely to cause emotional pain and possible breakup than sexual excitement and pleasure . " Feeling pressured by your partner to engage in swinging is also a " big red flag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communication , the better . <p> Prepare yourself for communicating more than you did when you were monogamous . " Things become a bit more complex when we allow more people into our intimate , energetic space , " says Baldwin . <p> For example , you 'll want to discuss rules of the road . Talk about the level -- soft , full , or hard -- you 're OK with . " It is essential to be comfortable discussing boundaries ( i.e. , ' I am comfortable with you performing oral sex but not having intercourse ' ) and preferences ( i.e. , ' I would find it really hot to watch you have sex with another woman ' ) with your partner , " says Melancon . <p> And make sure to go over safe sex practices ( condoms , dental dams , and birth control ) related to STI and pregnancy risk , says Melancon , who adds that regular STI testing is recommended for anyone engaging in sex with multiple partners . <p> 3 . Take small steps . <p> Baldwin suggests starting out with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft swap involving just foreplay or making out , to start -- and then check in after each to tend to any challenging emotions that come up .

How can we believe that gender equality becomes effective if we continue to use " two scales and two scales " ? Often times , women find it difficult to reconcile the precarious balance between life and work , and they often have to choose to take care of a family or work .

@@32861237 <p> But of course , cyber security is an ongoing battle between attack and defence , and the attackers continue to pose novel challenges . <p> Older techniques , such as steganography -- the art of hiding information including malicious payloads in otherwise benign files , such as images -- are evolving , leading to new possibilities . For example , recently a researcher demonstrated even Twitter was n't immune to steganography , and images on the platform could be abused to pack ZIP archives of up to 3MB within them . <p> However , in my own research , I have noticed that in addition to using obfuscation , steganography , and malware packing techniques , threat actors today frequently take advantage of legitimate services , platforms , protocols , and tools to conduct their activities . This lets them blend in with traffic or activity that may look " clean " to human analysts and machines alike . <p> Here are five tactics cybercriminals are using to cover their tracks today . <p> 1 - Abusing trusted platforms that wo n't raise alarms <p> This was a common theme seen by security professionals in 2020 that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tools such as Cobalt Strike and Ngrok , to established open-source code ecosystems like GitHub , to image and text sites like Imgur and Pastebin , attackers have targeted a wide array of trusted platforms in just the past few years . <p> Typically , Ngrok is used by ethical hackers interested in collecting data or setting up mock tunnels for inbound connections as a part of bug bounty exercises or pen-testing engagements . But malicious actors have abused Ngrok to directly install botnet malware , or connect a legitimate communications service to a maliciousserver . <p> In a more recent example , Xavier Mertens at SANS Institute spotted one such malware sample written in Python that contained base64-encoded code to plant a backdoor on the infected system that used Ngrok . <p> Because Ngrok is widely trusted , the remote attacker could connect to the infected system via an Ngrok tunnel , which will likely bypass corporate firewalls or NAT protections . <p> Cobalt Strike is a popular pen-testing framework to simulate advanced real-world cyberattacks , but like any security software product , it can be misused by adversaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not immune to being exploited . <p> These examples show why attackers find value in targeting legitimate platforms that many firewalls and security monitoring tools may not block . <p> 2 - Upstream attacks that capitalise on a brand value , reputation or popularity <p> Software supply chain security concerns may have gained public attention following the recent SolarWinds breach , but these attacks have been on the rise for some time . <p> Whether in the form of typosquatting , brandjacking or dependency confusion ( which initially came to light as a proof-of-concept research but was later abused for malicious purposes ) , " upstream " attacks exploit trust within known partner ecosystems and capitalise on the popularity or reputation of a brand or software component . <p> The attackers aim to push malicious code upstream to a trusted codebase associated with a brand , which then gets distributed downstream to the ultimate target : that brand 's partners , customers , or users . <p> Any system that is open to everyone is also open to adversaries . So , many supply chain attacks target open-source ecosystems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " open to all " principle . However , commercial organisations are also subject to these attacks . <p> In a recent case that some have likened to the SolarWinds incident , software testing company Codecov disclosed an attack against its Bash Uploader script that had gone undetected for over two months . <p> Codecov 's 29,000-plus clients include some prominent global brand names . In this attack , the uploader used by the company 's clients was altered to exfiltrate the system 's environment variables ( keys , credentials , and tokens ) to the attacker 's IP address . <p> Additionally , as more companies adopt Kubernetes or Docker containers to deploy their applications , container security solutions that have a built-in web application firewall and are capable of spotting simple misconfiguration errors early can help prevent a bigger compromise . <p> 3 - Funnelling cryptocurrency payments via hard-to-trace methods <p> Darknet marketplace sellers and ransomware operators frequently deal in cryptocurrency , given its decentralised and privacy-minded design . <p> But , although not minted or controlled by government central banks , cryptocurrency still lacks the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innovative ways to siphon funds between accounts . <p> Cryptocurrency is n't a completely foolproof way of hiding a money trail . On the night of the 2020 U.S. Presidential election , the U.S. government emptied out a US$1 billion Bitcoin wallet which contained funds linked to the most notorious darknet marketplace , Silk Road , which itself had been shut down in 2013 . <p> Some other cryptocurrencies like Monero ( XMR ) and Zcash ( ZEC ) have more extensive privacy-preserving abilities than Bitcoin for anonymising transactions . The back-and-forth between criminals and investigators will no doubt continue on this front as attackers keep looking for better ways to hide their tracks . <p> 4 - Using common channels and protocols <p> Like trusted platforms and brands , encrypted channels , ports , and protocols used by legitimate applications provide another way for attackers to mask their footsteps . For example , HTTPS is a universally indispensable protocol for the Web today , and for that reason , port 443 ( used by HTTPS/SSL ) is very hard to block in a corporate environment . <p> There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a commonly used protocol like HTTPS or DoH , attackers enjoy the same privacy benefits of end-to-end encrypted channels as legitimate users do . <p> Second , this poses difficulties for network administrators . Blocking DNS in any form itself poses a challenge , but now , given the DNS requests and responses are encrypted over HTTPS , it becomes a nuisance for security professionals to intercept , single out , and analyse the suspicious traffic from many HTTPS requests moving inbound and outbound through the network . <p> Researcher Alex Birsan , who demonstrated the dependency confusion technique to ethically hack into more than 35 big technology firms , was able to maximise his success rate by using DNS ( port 53 ) to exfiltrate basic information . Birsan chose DNS because of the high likelihood of corporate firewalls not blocking DNS traffic , due to performance requirements and legitimate DNS uses . <p> LOLBINs refer to legitimate , digitally signed executables , such as Windows executables signed by Microsoft , that can be misused by attackers to launch malicious code with elevated privileges , or to evade endpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a recently discovered Linux and macOS malware I analysed had a perfect zero-detection rate among all leading antivirus products . <p> The binary did contain obfuscated code , which aided in evasion . However , further investigation also revealed the malware was built using hundreds of legitimate open-source components and conducted its malicious activities , such as gaining administrative privileges , in ways identical to how legitimate applications would do so . <h> The Kiwi channel gathers for the 2020 Reseller News Women in ICT Awards <p> Hundreds of leaders from the New Zealand IT industry gathered at the Hilton in Auckland on 17 November to celebrate the finest female talent in the Kiwi channel and recognise the winners of the Reseller News Women in ICT Awards ( WIICTA ) 2020 . <h> Related Whitepapers <p> Copyright 2021 IDG Communications .

Ostensibly modelled on parole arrangements for people released from New Zealand prisons , in practice the regime for overseas offenders is more punitive and exclusionary while offering fewer legal protections . <p> The act is also extremely unusual : no other country on the receiving end of deportation has pursued a formal policy response . Yet it has received little attention . In the enthusiasm for critiquing our neighbour 's policy , New Zealand has failed to look to itself . <p> While adjusting to life outside of prison or immigration detention , returning offenders must also navigate the practical and emotional complexities of leaving one 's home to start again in a new country . They will encounter obstacles to rehabilitation and ( re ) integration beyond those of the average domestic offender . Many face serious mental health struggles , no doubt exacerbated by their experiences of detention and deportation . <p> Rather than compensate for these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The New Zealand state has chosen to respond to deportees as dangerous threats to be contained , and not vulnerable people to be supported . It would be disingenuous to deny the significance of this choice in light of the fact that the majority of returning offenders are non-white -- over 60% are Maori or Pasifika . This racial disparity mirrors that of New Zealand 's wider criminal justice system , where Maori and Pasifika peoples comprise 60% of the prison population . <p> If Australia 's policy imposes a triple punishment for non-citizens convicted of criminal offending , then the New Zealand legislation slathers on yet another punitive layer , creating what amounts to a quadruple punishment : imprisonment , immigration detention , deportation , and now ongoing monitoring and supervision in New Zealand . <p> Such prolonged criminal justice exposure can feel deeply unfair . As Mark says to his parole officer in the Maori TV documentary Section 501 , " I 'm square with the house and then I come here and I get put on a 12-month probation ... man , I just want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people convicted here in New Zealand , returning offenders receive a greater number of punishments for their original offence . And because of the way the ROMI Act is implemented , their post-release supervision is also harsher . <p> Although sold in parliament as tools for targeting only the most high-risk individuals , more restrictive " special conditions " like electronic monitoring and curfews are being imposed on nearly every returning offender , despite there being no evidence that the group presents a particular risk . <p> The stakes could also not be higher : breach of a ROMI condition is a criminal offence , punishable by up to one year 's imprisonment , so enhanced restrictions are likely to have the knock-on effect of sending more people back to prison . <p> Corrections defends the widespread use of special conditions on the grounds that it is impossible to know the risk profile of people who committed their offending overseas . <p> Out of an abundance of caution , Corrections makes a presumption of dangerousness across the returnee population and deported Kiwis consequently experience a greater loss of freedom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , reflects that his life could " so quickly ... turn into a nightmare again . I 'm only really two steps away from being locked up : one , I miss an appointment with a probation officer ; two , I get locked up . " <p> While returnees are eligible for legal aid , few take it up . This may be because deported Kiwis are unaware of their eligibility , highlighting the inherent vulnerability of people compelled to navigate an unfamiliar criminal justice system . <p> Compounding upon their legal vulnerability , deported Kiwis experience profound social precarity yet receive no dedicated support for rehabilitation or ( re ) integration . <p> The government passed on the opportunity to create an " enhanced support service " for addressing the housing , employment and healthcare needs of returning New Zealanders . The Ministry of Justice , when explaining the rationale behind the proposed service , noted that many returnees face " additional challenges in returning to a country where they have citizenship , but few personal connections " . <p> Why would the government choose the ROMI Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more humane and quite possibly more effective means of preventing reoffending ? The political fanfare surrounding returning New Zealanders offers a clue . <p> A week before the vote on the ROMI bill , John Key declared in parliament that deported New Zealanders were " rapists ... child molesters ... murderers " . He singled out those held on the Christmas Island Detention Centre , saying " the vast majority ... are serious criminals . " But nearly all detainees on Christmas Island at that time had been convicted of shoplifting or low-level drug offences -- none had convictions for rape or murder . <p> The harsher treatment of returning offenders is sustained by a political culture which responds to deported New Zealanders as dangerous outsiders , deserving of heightened controls but undeserving of the full protections of the law guaranteed to citizens . <p> Returning offenders are often talked about as though they were foreigners . Amy Adams , then minister of justice , commented that Australia is " deporting people back to New Zealand who , other than their DNA , are really not New Zealanders " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send back Kiwis , genuine Kiwis -- do not deport your people , and your problems . " This leaves unanswered the question of who is a " genuine Kiwi " and what the state owes to those who fall outside the definition . <p> New Zealand had an opportunity to treat deported people with dignity and care . We did n't take it . <p> In March this year , Chris Hipkins described Australia as " exporting its garbage to New Zealand " . He backtracked , claiming to be paraphrasing Australian home affairs minister Peter Dutton . Whatever the truth , Hipkins ' choice of words reminds us that ways of talking about and , ultimately , treating people are infectious . <p> New Zealand has permitted Australian border policy , distinguished by its harshness and racism , to shape our domestic criminal justice policy . Troubling as this is , it is not altogether surprising . New Zealand 's treatment of its deported citizens conforms to the racialised patterns of criminalisation and exclusion which have persisted here since colonialisation . <p> If only we could , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's callous treatment of their 501 club and New Zealand 's punitive response to our own ROMI club . We can start by pairing our justified outrage at Australian policy with empathy for the people caught in the middle and demand that they be supported instead of punished for Australia 's mistakes . <p> Subscribe to The Bulletin to get all the day 's key news stories in five minutes -- delivered every weekday at 7.30am . <p> Email * <p> Success !

@@32882240 <h> Taiwan 's Covid response was once the envy of the world . What went wrong ? <p> Along with New Zealand and a handful of other places across Asia-Pacific , Taiwan was until recently seen as a paragon of Covid preparedness . Now a community outbreak is spreading across the island -- just as a squabble over the supply of vaccine erupts , writes New Zealander Ron Hanson from Taipei . <p> It was the world 's most stringent Covid defence . Despite being located a metaphorical stone 's throw away from the original epicentre , with frequent direct flights to Wuhan at the time of the pandemic 's outset , Taiwan had made it almost a year and a half with the barest of social restrictions and only a handful of deaths . The economy was booming and the international press coverage was glowing . <p> Now , suddenly , Taiwan is engulfed in an island-wide outbreak as its government and people are put to the test . So what went wrong and what are the lessons for New Zealand in Taiwan 's mistakes ? <p> Within Taiwan 's success lay the seeds of its undoing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively kept out the virus that , like New Zealand , its people were already enjoying a post-pandemic lifestyle . Concerts were packed , bars were brimming with patrons and crowds thronged at Taiwan 's legendary religious festivals . But the trouble was that the pandemic had n't ended . When the border was finally breached , the virus found fresh virgin territory and a population that had let down its guard . Taiwan had kept up vigilance for so long , but sure enough , complacency had crept in . <p> A Taipei pandemic street scene ( Photo : Gregory Garde ) <p> The facts of the border failure are becoming well known . The Novetol airport hotel , where China Airlines pilots and aircrew quarantine , had broken the rules by housing quarantining pilots , flight crew and domestic tourists in the same building . Crucially , on April 15 , Taiwan relaxed its quarantine rules for unvaccinated pilots and aircrew . The quarantine period was reduced from five to three days . <p> Almost like clockwork , by the end of April we were reading reports of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highly infectious UK variant after they had finished quarantine . And then we started to learn of the locations they had visited . When we learned in early May that a Covid-positive pilot and flight attendant had broken the rules of their self-health monitoring period by visiting a sports bar , we knew we might have some trouble on our hands . Mask-wearing had been mandated in most public indoor settings , but the places where people did n't wear masks were restaurants , night clubs , and bars . Naturally one ca n't wear a mask while they eat and drink . <p> Masked friends talk outside a temple in Taipei ( Photo : Frankie Chang ) <p> And then the virus made it into the hostess clubs of Wanhua , Taipei 's oldest district . Euphemistically known as " tea houses " or colloquially as " grandpa shops " , these are establishments where middle-aged women serve a typically older clientele . The degree to which these businesses provide sexual services reportedly varies . Regardless , one can be sure that not a lot of social distancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ establishments are reluctant to co-operate with the authorities . Contact tracers are dealing with a list of people who have tested positive but left false contact details . <p> And then there is the issue of vaccines . Due to its geopolitical situation and the ongoing vaccine crunch , Taiwan has struggled to obtain the vaccines it needs . In February , health minister and director of the Central Epidemic Command Centre Chen Shih-Chung alleged that Taiwan 's deal with BioNTech , the company that partnered with Pfizer to produce the vaccine currently being rolled out in New Zealand , had been scuttled due to political pressure . According to Chen , this was after the contract had been finalised and Taiwan had already signed . Following Chen 's allegation , BioNTech quickly issued a statement saying that it was committed to providing Taiwan with the vaccine , but no deal has materialised . <p> Disinfecting a MRT station , Taipei ( Photo : Lisa Tsai ) <p> Last week , president Tsai Ing-Wen directly accused Beijing of interfering in Taiwan 's vaccine purchases . Beijing , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taiwan with free Chinese-made vaccines , while simultaneously bombarding the island with fake news and disinformation in what local experts are referring to as a " pressure test " . Fosun Pharma , the Shanghai-based company that distributes BioNTech to the greater China region , recently said it is willing to supply " Taiwan compatriots " with the vaccine . But Taiwan insists on dealing directly with BioNTech , citing safety , political and legal risks . <p> Prior to the outbreak only around 300,000 doses of AstraZeneca had been obtained . And after the steady stream of scare stories in the media about AZ , and with other governments suspending its use , people here were reluctant to take it . Taiwan was safe . Why not wait for a different vaccine to arrive , or Taiwan 's own vaccine candidates to come to fruition ? <p> Taiwan did n't have enough doses to protect its frontline workers , and what little was here was in danger of expiring . With the recent outbreak , vaccine hesitancy has been dealt a decisive blow . But the failure to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retrospect . <p> A temperature check at Top City department store in Taichung City ( Photo : Ema Chang ) <p> So here we are in the thick of it , a surreal phenomenon we 'd seen unfold elsewhere through the media . In Taiwan , it feels like the pandemic has just begun . The government is now scrambling to increase its testing capacity . Given how diligently it prepared for this pandemic in the preceding years , it 's disappointing to see how little the government appears to have utilised the past year to prepare for this contingency . Taiwan was light years ahead of the game at the beginning of this pandemic , but now we 've got some catching up to do . <p> Taiwan 's greatest asset , however , has always been its public . The citizen response has been phenomenal . After all the stereotypes of submissive obedience , it turns out that the public does n't need to be told what to do . In many ways this is a citizen-led response , with the Taiwanese people outpacing the government , keeping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indoor dining , but even before that many businesses were voluntarily closing or refusing to allow dining in . The restaurants were empty as people chose to order deliveries or take out . The government thus far appears unwilling to enter a full lockdown . What we 're seeing instead is being referred to as a " voluntary lockdown " . <p> The power of this should n't be underestimated . At the beginning of the pandemic , Taiwan achieved elimination without a lockdown . This was despite there being 10 community cases with unknown origins . It was a phenomenal achievement that depended on the determination and ingenuity of the public . But now we 're dealing with a highly infectious new variant and widespread community transmission . Are we even pursuing elimination now ? Or are we moving into a strategy of suppression and mitigation while we wait for vaccines ? <p> A usually packed MRT carriage during Taipei 's current quasi-lockdown ( Photo : Frankie Chang ) <p> So as I write , the number of international Covid success stories has dwindled . What should New Zealanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feeling of exceptionalism . Human folly is a universal experience and in the course of the pandemic it 's bound to rear its head . To be sure , New Zealand has huge advantages . Chief among them are low population density and an effective approach of snap lockdowns . It 's also had some luck . <p> Throughout the pandemic most pilots and air crew of international flights who are based in New Zealand have been completely exempt from quarantine . This is despite repeated warnings from epidemiologists and internal documents raising concerns by aircrew and staff about the risk the policy poses to colleagues and the public . As pilots and flight crews get vaccinated , the risk decreases but is still present . There is reportedly still a significant amount of vaccine hesitancy among these key workers . <p> If the Taiwan experience shows anything , it 's that there is a constant need to reassess the response , look for holes and weaknesses , and plan for contingencies . What happens if the current approach suddenly does n't work ?

@@32890235 <h> The Bulletin : Cleaning up the Canterbury floods <p> Good morning and welcome to The Bulletin . In today 's edition : Cleaning up the Canterbury floods , walking and cycling harbour crossing coming in Auckland , and plans underway to get New Zealanders back from Melbourne . <p> Over the last few days , we 've started to get a picture of the damage done by the flooding around Canterbury . Some of the numbers on this will come through in the subsequent stories , but seeing is believing , and the stories collected by One News in particular show how bad it has been . This story by Thomas Mead is a great example , about the Upper Rakaia being completely cut off . The rain came down so hard that it literally changed the landscape . <p> Rural areas have been hit particularly hard , and will now face high costs of recovery . Radio NZ reports about 300 claims have been made through to rural insurer FMG , with the expectation of that figure tripling once the damage is fully assessed . And it goes beyond property damage , to complete disruption of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported on one farming family that had lost all of their winter feed and straw , which could leave them in a hugely difficult position in the coming months . One aspect that might not be widely understood is the damage flooding does to paddocks , and how it can make them dangerous to drive around even after the water recedes . The Timaru Herald 's Esther Ashby-Coventry had a story that illustrated this , after the Orari River ripped through a farmer 's field , leaving a giant scar behind . <p> Earlier in the week the government declared an " adverse event " , which unlocks disaster relief funding , in this case to the tune of $500k . Agriculture minister Damien O'Connor said more would be considered when the scale of the damage is clearer . But as Stuff 's Amber Allott reports , that figure is seen as woefully insufficient by some farmers , with one farmer saying it might do the job for his farm alone . None of this is to mention the immense infrastructure damage that has also been done by the flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's transport system : A second harbour crossing will be built for pedestrians and cyclists . The NZ Herald 's Simon Wilson reports that 'll be announced by transport minister Michael Wood today , and will sit next to the existing bridge . The cost is estimated around $685 million , and it is expected to take about five years to construct . It could strike a significant blow against Auckland 's transport emissions , which are currently projected to grow , and constitute a major part of the city 's contribution to climate change . In the interim , Wood has asked Waka Kotahi to look into how walking and cycling options could be added to the existing bridge . <p> Plans are being considered to get New Zealanders stuck in Melbourne back home , after the travel bubble with the city was paused for another week . Newshub reports Covid-19 minister Chris Hipkins said he wanted to start giving people in that situation some certainty about when they 'd be able to return , in the form of " carefully managed green flights " .

Labour select committee members said in their report they agreed with more second language teaching , but this bill is n't the way to do it . National 's education spokesperson Paul Goldsmith accused Labour of hypocrisy in celebrating other languages without prioritising them being taught . A reminder -- no firm decisions have been made by Labour yet , so we 'll have to wait and see how they vote . <p> NZ Post boss David Walsh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a delivery business , reports Radio NZ .

As a result , NZ Post is investing heavily in this part of the market -- though that may not bring much joy to those who still prefer to do their business in a branch . <p> A new series worth keeping an eye on , about the culture of political donations in New Zealand : Writing for Newsroom , Peter McKenzie has started by looking at so-called " dark money " , in which parties obscure the source of donations through " lawful but problematic means " . Given how many parties and politicians are currently being investigated by the Serious Fraud Office for their donations , it 's a particularly timely issue to note . <p> The Electoral Commission has called for laws around election-delaying emergencies to be updated , during an appearance in front of the justice select committee . I wrote a report on their call , which draws heavily on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pandemic and a month-long delay . One interesting point -- the current laws are more reflective of a First Past the Post environment , in which ( for eg ) an earthquake would have a highly disruptive but localised effect . But the emergency last year was of a very different nature , and under MMP it makes more sense for every party vote to be cast in the same period . The spy agencies and Facebook both also appeared before the committee . <p> A correction : Meng Foon , accomplished though he is , is not the police commissioner , as I incorrectly said yesterday . The story was about policing so I had them on the brain , but he is in fact the race relations commissioner . Apologies to Mr Foon for the error . <p> Right now on The Spinoff : Mata'afa Keni Lesa suggests 10 Samoan words and concepts to help you understand the ongoing political and constitutional crisis in the country .

I realise that 's quite a dry sell , but the heart of the issue is that economically poor countries are facing serious environmental consequences so that other countries and foreign companies can enrich themselves . Here 's an excerpt from the interactive piece on the Guardian . <p> In Solomon Islands , a bauxite mine on Rennell Island has been the cause of catastrophic spills of oil and bauxite into the island 's fishing grounds , endangering a World Heritage site -- while enjoying multi-million dollar tax exemptions granted by the country 's government . <p> And the island of Nauru once had one of the highest per-capita incomes in the world because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the mismanagement of hundreds of millions in royalties caused the near-collapse of the country 's economy , fuelling a series of financial crises and ongoing political instability .

Just kidding , he scored 200 on debut . As Radio NZ reports , he was the last man out after spending New Zealand 's entire innings at the crease . The eventual team score of 378 should be highly competitive , but there might be some concern in the camp about a batting collapse after Henry Nicholls got out for 61 .

" <p> The Ridds follow key themes when it comes to improving their environment , such as fencing waterways , riparian planting and developing wetlands , but they also believe in a strong connection with the community .

@@32933230 <p> We had our annual meeting to ' chew the fat ' with our accountant the other day . Always an enjoyable catch-up and he makes a good sounding board to test ideas etc against . <p> In the course of conversation , the topic of nitrates came up . As a ' rural ' accountant he no doubt hears many farmers bemoaning the influx of regulations and so gets a broad overview of what people are thinking about . The focus on nitrates in New Zealand waterways has been in the headlines considerably lately and most would agree that the issues and risks need fleshing out , understood and acted upon . <p> Our accountant 's ponderings took a different route however , and he was wondering what the potential of nitrates in our green foods intakes are and are they a potential risk ? Most livestock farmers understand the risks of nitrate poisoning in livestock . Caused by feeding green feeds ( everything from new pastures to green feed crops ) high in nitrates which cause a ' malady ' often called ' red water ' ( not to be confused with another ' red water ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northern hemisphere farming systems ) . Red water because the nitrates convert to nitrites in the rumen , then absorbed into red blood cells , discolouring them and blocking the transport of oxygen . In extreme cases the animal dies from lack of oxygen . In the process urine turns red when blood is filtered by the kidneys . Pretty much , the exact same process as what occurs when animals ( including us ) ingest too much nitrates in their water . <p> In farming the situation often occurs from young crops and grasses which have been grazed too early ( prolonged cloudy weather exacerbates the situation ) and the nitrogen content of the plant is too high for the animal and rapid and multiple animal deaths occur . So , given it can occur from feed in animals then potentially at some level logic says there must be risk for humans who also have high intake of young greens . <p> Looking at some research , most foods we consume contain some nitrates but the bulk in our diet is sourced from green vegetables . Processed meats ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preservative and meat colouring process . However , in the last 10-20 years restrictions have been put on the limits ( mostly sodium nitrate ) allowed to be used and the addition vitamin C helps stops to conversion of nitrate to nitrosamines which are linked to the causation of cancers . It 's worth mentioning that some degree of ingesting of nitrates is necessary for good health , the question is how much is too much ? <p> The most comprehensive study ( as linked above ) which was published in 2017 came up with some interesting findings . Conducted in the EU it worked on the assumptions that a 60kg adult could handle about 222mg of nitrates ( 37mg per kg liveweight ) of which about 80% was sourced from fresh vegetables and fruit . EU average intakes of ' various vegetables ' was about 400grams which led to the ingesting of 157mgs of nitrates . So , on the surface well within the then published recommendations . <p> There are a couple of things worth considering however : recommendations on the amount of nitrates that can cause danger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study which stated that there was a 15% increase in the incidence of bowel cancer at water levels of 2.1mgs and increases with water levels as low as 0.87mg per litre . Well below the WHO recommendations of 11mgs . However , these interpretations have been questioned by experts and may not be as drastic as the headlines indicate . <p> The other consideration is not all greens are equal in their amount of nitrate content . They vary across the seasons and between types of vegetables . The amount of N fertiliser used also influences uptake and nitrate levels peak in the autumn period being when the greatest concentrations occur . <p> Greens such as lettuce through autumn have an average of 1264mgs per kg and the highest sample reached 2940 ; spinach averaged 2014 with a high 3412 ; arugula ( rocket ) goes into a different league with an average content of 4375mg per kg and a high of 5370 . It is worth mentioning that rocket does have a maximum EU intake guideline of 44 grams per day ( this was news to me ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast majority of people green vegetable intakes were not considered hazardous to human health and benefits outweighed negatives . There was however a warning " It is important to emphasise that due care should be taken with spinach consumption in childhood , but also in people who consume vegetables in larger quantities than recommended , because in this way , they take in larger amounts of nitrate , which , if continuing for a longer period of time , could adversely affect health . " This warning could be heightened if rocket was included in a child 's diet . <p> I think the study and lack of knowledge by the public on any potential risks small or large highlight how little most of us know about what we consume . <p> It also shows how the nitrate in water debate may only be the tip of the iceberg . New Zealand Ministry of Health guidelines tend to show the " three servings of vegetables and two of fruit each day " . However , they do n't say why . Sometimes ignorance is bliss . <p> Remember we welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcome abusive or defamatory comments and will de-register those repeatedly making such comments . Our current comment policy is here . <p> Just for clarification " Red Water " is different to " nitrate poisoning " Although nitrogen is a common factor in both aliments , sulphuric fertiliser exacerbates SMCO concentrations , contributing to red water ; <p> Red water or kale anemia is caused by a high concentration of SMCO ( high S-methyl cysteine sulphoxide ) . SMCO is found in all brassicas but is especially high in kale . In the rumen , SMCO is converted to an oxidative compound , called dimethyl sulphide , which reacts with red blood cells , lowering haemoglobin concentration . As this is excreted it results in red urine or the clinical condition known as " red water " . Other clinical signs can include weakness , diarrhoea , jaundice , decreased appetite , and poor performance . If red water is observed affected animals should be removed to alternative feed sources , to reduce SMCO intake . Ensure animals have adequate levels of selenium before going onto crops . <p> Nitrate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N than they need for leaf growth . Nitrates in the plants are converted to nitrites and ammonia by the microbes in the rumen . At high concentrations , the ability of rumen microflora to reduce nitrate to ammonia via the intermediate nitrite is overloaded . The nitrites are instead absorbed into the bloodstream which lowers the blood 's ability to carry oxygen to the tissues . Clinical signs of nitrate poisoning are sudden deaths , animals appearing uncoordinated and anoxia ( lack of oxygen to tissues ) . <p> The higher the nitrate level in green vegetables the more bitter and unpalatable the taste , not a very marketable product , so growers flush hydroponic systems with water before harvest to reduce nutrient concentrations , and conventional market gardeners only apply fertiliser in the early stages of plant establishment ( for the most part ) ...

At this stage , the Ministry of Health has only released the locations of interest for Saturday June 19 but the individual remained in the city for a further day before travelling back to Australia . <p> The most concerning locations of interest are the initial flight into Wellington , the surrealism exhibition at Te Papa and Jack Hackett 's Bar in central Wellington .

We 'll have everything you need to know as it happens . <p> A lockdown in Wellington has not yet been considered by health officials , but it also ca n't be ruled out . The director general of health Ashley Bloomfield has said this morning that " all options are on the table " as Wellington faces its first Covid-19 scare in months . <p> As detailed in this morning 's Bulletin , the threat of Covid spread has been sparked after a person who later tested positive for the coronavirus travelled to Wellington from Sydney over the weekend . <p> Speaking to RNZ , Bloomfield said the individual was in the country with their partner and four close contacts have now been identified . " They were contacted and are in isolation , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting . " <p> Meanwhile , health officials are scrambling to confirm any locations of interest in the capital .

Bloomfield so it " would be helpful " if the infected traveller had been scanning in , but considering the low levels of national app use that seems unlikely . Another unknown is whether or not the person has been vaccinated , Bloomfield told Newshub . <p> While the delta variant of Covid-19 has been spreading rapidly across Australia , Bloomfield said he did not yet know what variant this individual had acquired . " Whatever the variant the response is the same , " he said . Genome sequencing will be able to confirm what strain of Covid-19 the person has and , Bloomfield said , hopefully link them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They developed symptoms on Monday , while they were travelling back to Australia or soon after they arrived back , " he said .

But as Toby Manhire wrote , we are at risk of a Sydney-style outbreak , and not initially being in a good position to trace it .

@@32948231 <p> Having already spent a week on Rarotonga , Craig McLachlan decided to head to the tropical paradise of Aitutaki . <p> We are woken each morning about 2am by Aitutaki 's impressive rooster population and they barely let up for the next five to six hours . The roosters seem to go off together , spur each other on and roam the island at will . <p> Still part of the Cook Island 's southern group , Aitutaki is a 45-minute flight north of Rarotonga and has long held the reputation as boasting the world 's most beautiful lagoon . In my opinion , that reputation is well deserved . <p> We 're also here for a cultural experience , and we 're getting it -- no plush resorts for us . I booked an Airbnb run by locals Ross and Enoa and we 're in a simple unit , one of two , on their sizeable property , 400m from the wharf , in the town of Arutanga . <p> The island 's population is 1800 , and most international visitors -- these days only Kiwis or foreign nationals who have been in New Zealand for at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aitutaki Lagoon Resort &amp; Spa or the Pacific Resort . <p> A kitesurfer near Honeymoon Isalnd . Aitutaki . Photo : Supplied <p> The rooster experience is a lot different from our time on Rarotonga . The Cooks ' main island seems overrun by dogs . Every family seems to have a couple that are treated like family members and roam the neighbourhood , rarely tied up . <p> Aitutaki has no dogs . Local legend says that a chief 's daughter was bitten by a dog years ago and that was it for the canine population . These days , it 's an Aitutaki law that no dogs are allowed on the island . <p> So , while Rarotonga has its dogs , Aitutaki has its chooks . They 're everywhere , and as part of our cultural experience , our neighbour can be heard yelling for her roaming chooks to come home about 7am and 5pm each day . The rest of the day they roam free , and we 've had some close calls with chooks scurrying across the road when riding around on our scooter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the island , the locals ' main mode of transport is the scooter . No-one wears helmets and two to a scooter is the norm , not the exception . Little kids are often seated behind or on the lap of a parent . <p> We 've joined in with great enthusiasm and a fun part of the experience has been the " eyebrow raise " greeting as we pass locals on scooters heading in the other direction . It seems that everyone knows everyone on an island this small and after only a few minutes on our scooter we were greeting one and all , too . It 's a lot different than visiting Japan , where the accepted greeting is a nod of the head downward . On Aitutaki , it 's the eyebrow raise , with chin up and a great big grin . <p> The roads here are in great shape , perfect for scooters , and Aitutaki locals take great pride in keeping their properties spick and span , right up to the roadside . Each house receives an inspection from the health authorities every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're drinking rainwater off the roof , boiled before consumption . <p> Our accommodation , while simple , is clean and comfortable . There 's a Wi-Fi hot spot 100m away at the <p> main building , and there 's so much fruit growing on the property that Enoa has told us to help ourselves . The passionfruit hanging from <p> the vines is exquisite . <p> Exploring Aitutaki by scooter . Photo : Supplied <p> We 've complemented that with bananas and papaya bought at roadside stalls and the island 's simple stores that the locals frequent . Enoa has also brought us local delicacies to try , including a tasty banana and cassava concoction , Aitutaki poke made from coconuts and cassava , and addictive breadfruit chips . <p> Saturday morning , we headed down to Aitutaki market at 7am , where I had breakfast of barbecued flying fish and boiled cassava with the locals -- a real treat . <p> Most beautiful lagoon on the planet <p> While the cultural aspects of our visit have been enthralling , it 's the lagoon that is Aitutaki 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to visit for decades , and the spectacular hues of turquoise , green and blue are totally captivating . The reef-fringed atoll is triangular in shape , with the main island in the northwest and gorgeous tiny motu ( islands ) scattered around the outside of the triangle . The lagoon is so big that it 's said that the whole island of Rarotonga would fit within its confines . <p> On our Teking Lagoon Cruise , guide Pa brought along his 3-year-old son Morris for the day . Numbers of visitors are picking up , and while trips were heading out daily pre-Covid , they 're only operating a few days a week at this stage . <p> We took along our own snorkelling gear and made the most of the day with 10 other guests on the cruise . We swam and snorkelled among giant trevally that were indeed giant -- and a tad scary !

This spot is in the southeast corner of the lagoon and represents the perfect motu -- white sand , swaying coconut palms and sparkling clear waters . Visitors can get their passports stamped on One Foot Island , a priceless souvenir of any trip to Aitutaki . <p> Last stop was a visit to where Teal 's giant Solent flying boats refuelled when they plied the island-hopping Coral Route between 1951 and 1960 . Teal in 1965 became Air New Zealand and the Coral Route from Auckland to Tahiti included stops in lagoons in Fiji , Samoa and Aitutaki . <p> Aitutaki 's lagoon is 20km across at its widest point , making it a lengthy runway for the flying boats , which refuelled on Akaiami Island while passengers played on the beach . <p> Our day trip was so enjoyable that we took a taxi boat back to Honeymoon Island a few days later for some private time on this perfect island . <p> In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet . <p> Christian fervour <p> As with other island groups in the Pacific , the Cook Islands took to Christianity with great zeal , and the number of churches on the various islands is mind-boggling . <p> Aitutaki was the first of the Cook Islands to be Christianised , when the Rev John Williams and missionary Papeiha of the London Missionary Society ( LMS ) turned up on October 26 , 1821 , from the Society Islands , in what is now French Polynesia . After converting Aitutaki , the LMS missionaries moved on to Rarotonga . <p> October 26 will mark 200 years since the LMS arrival on Aitutaki and extensive celebrations are planned , though it 's hoped that the impact of Covid will be negligible . <p> Enoa tells me that 4000 visitors are expected for the two weeks of celebrations . For an island of only 1800 , that sounds like a logistical nightmare , but apparently everything is under control . An estimated 100,000 Cook Islanders live in New Zealand and Australia and a fair few are expected home for the festivities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economy was decimated by 14 months of no tourists is an understatement . While not a single active Covid case has registered in the Cook Islands , the economic tap was turned off with lockdowns in New Zealand and Australia , plus the understanding that if Covid reached the Cooks that there would be a total health disaster . <p> Sunset on Aitutaki lagoon . Photo : Getty Images <p> Island populations were decimated when Europeans first turned up a couple of centuries ago , bringing diseases that the islanders had never had to face and to which they had no immunity . A similar disaster could well have occurred in 2020 should Covid have reached these shores . <p> As in New Zealand and in other countries around the globe , there was debate here on Aitutaki as to when tourists should be allowed back . Older locals wanted the island population to be fully vaccinated before the island opened up , but the younger population was for the economic benefits of bringing in tourists sooner . <p> All is good now , though . Almost the entire population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the start of the month . There 's a growing confidence among locals , especially seeing the increase in numbers of visiting tourists over the week we 've been here . <p> Enoa explained it well : " There was a real Covid shock here on Aitutaki . With no tourists and no other form of income , locals went back to the old ways , planting crops and pulling together in families and villages to overcome the economic hardships . There have been some positives . We are now exporting taro to New Zealand . The boats that bring the things we need to survive here on Aitutaki now head back with some Aitutaki exports . <p> " And it 's good for the health of the community . Locals have been growing and eating their own food , becoming self-sufficient . " <p> One problem though is that a number of younger islanders headed to New Zealand for work once the one-way bubble was up and running in late January .

@@32954240 <h> NZ 's housing market is broken and we 've got the maps to prove it <p> Inspired by a map of the US housing market , analyst Emma Vitz created a graph showing how much people needed to earn to afford a property in their region . It quickly went viral . <p> From the comfort of my 23 square metre apartment that I most definitely do not own , I mapped out the New Zealand property market . I took the common financial advice to not spend more than 30% of your gross weekly income on housing and calculated the household income needed to make this possible for a homeowner in each region of the country . <p> This idea was sparked by seeing a similar map of the US , and it struck a chord . Soon the maps I created based on these numbers were being shared everywhere . New Zealanders have a love-hate relationship with property , and these maps were bringing it all out . Politicians , real estate agents , demographers , recent and aspiring first home buyers -- they all had something to say . <p> My calculations were based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buyer had managed to put down a 20% deposit and that they would have a 30 year mortgage at an interest rate of 4% . <p> Of course , the deposit is often the biggest hurdle for many people wanting to buy a property . A 20% deposit is difficult to achieve unless you currently own a home that has been appreciating in value , or you have particularly well-off parents who are willing to lend a hand . However , I wanted to be generous and , assuming this somewhat unlikely head start , see what it takes to buy property in New Zealand . <p> The answer , unsurprisingly , is often a lot more than the average New Zealand household earns . In Auckland , an income of just over $170,000 is required , which is about $66,000 more than the median household income . Wellington requires an income of $132,000 , $30,000 more than the average household actually earns . <p> Only three regions in New Zealand required less than the actual median income in order to comfortably pay for a mortgage . The West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country 's population , and Canterbury . Canterbury has 12.7% of the population and apparently , the only reasonable housing market of any significant size in New Zealand . <p> I 've often said that in order to buy a property in New Zealand , you need at least two of the following three things : A dual income household , a high income job , and rich parents . In some parts of the country , it seems you might need all three . <p> According to the 2020 Household Labour Force Survey , the Auckland median income of all household types -- coupled , single , with children or without -- was far below what you 'd need to service a mortgage comfortably according to the 30% rule . <p> In Wellington , the median income of a couple with two dependent children scrapes in just above the required number of $131,960 at $136,604 , while all other households fall short . <p> In Canterbury , the average single income household ( whether with dependent children or not ) fails to meet the threshold of $85,520 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above this . Once again , Canterbury seems to be the only large housing market in New Zealand that is anywhere close to being affordable for the average New Zealander . <p> The New Zealand property market is a fascinating beast . We seem rather determined to make an economy out of trading non-productive assets between each other at higher and higher prices . Even Jacinda Ardern agreed , back in 2011 , that our economy is a housing market with a few bits tacked on . However , it seems that the average New Zealand household struggles to get a toehold in this market , and these maps show why . <p> The Spinoff is subject to NZ Media Council procedures .

Because of this , we are advising residents who access the Hautere/Te Horo public water supply to boil all water used for drinking , making up infant formula or ice , preparing food and cleaning teeth as a precautionary measure . <p> " If affected residents are unable to boil their water , they can treat it by adding 5 drops of plain , unscented household bleach to 1 litre of water and leaving it to stand for 30 minutes before drinking .

It is one of those age-old questions that sounds simple to answer but has you scratching your head and struggling to explain it . <p> Even if you can elucidate on what it is , is " normal " a good thing ? Do I even want to be " normal " , and cast off any elements of individuality just to be part of one huge , boring , homogenous crowd ? Or is being normal , or thereabouts , something we should all aspire to , given humans are social animals ? <p> Certainly some of what goes on around the world in defence of " normal " , or of what is said to be the " normal thing to do " , is morally questionable and at odds with what many reasonable-minded people feel comfortable with . <p> There is no doubt , though , that whatever normal is , it can change over the years .

However , he also aired strong views on CBDCs arguing there should be a greater focus on the longer-term monetary and financial stability benefits of new monetary technologies . <p> A CBDC would allow households and businesses to directly make electronic payments using money issued by the central bank such as the Bank of England in Britain , or the Reserve Bank in New Zealand .

At that point , central banking came of age in the setting monetary and financial stability policy . Tomorrow 's decisions on CBDC rival the 1844 Act in their significance for central banks over the medium term . And that is why a deeper consideration of monetary and financial stability implications is paramount today , " Haldane said . <p> The winds of technological change are blowing a gale through finance , led by payments , Haldane said , with new technological barbarians appearing at the gates , transferring money cheaper , faster and easier than ever . Against this backdrop with CBDCs under consideration , Haldane says from a financial stability context , a widely-used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It could result in something akin to narrow banking , with safe , payments-based activities segregated from banks ' riskier credit-provision activities .

" <p> " Specifically , this could lead to a closer alignment of risk for those institutions , new and old , offering these services - narrow banking for payments , money backed by safe assets , and limited purpose banking for lending , risky assets backed by risky liabilities . This radically different topology , while not costless , would reduce at source the fragilities in the banking model that have been causing financial crises for over 800 years .

Even if you accept cash has other benefits that mean it is the preferred payment method for some , the inability to pay interest on public money is a relic of a bygone era . " <p> " In principle , a widely-used digital currency could mitigate , perhaps even eliminate , this technological constraint . Specifically , CBDC would enable interest to be levied on central bank issued monetary assets or digital cash . The extent to which this relaxed the ZLB constraint depends , in addition , on the elasticity with which physical cash is provided to the public alongside CBDC .

To those benefits needs to be added the gains to digital cash users of holding a remunerated instrument , helping protect their purchasing power . These financial stability and monetary-macro benefits should be at the centre of the debate about the desirability and design of digital currencies . To give an example , the design of the remuneration schedule for CBDC will in my view be one of the most significant decisions made by central banks in the next half-century .

But I 'd also hazard a guess that they 'd have a lot less control of the process ultimately . <p> The zero lower bound issue referred to in the article is that interest rates below zero are n't very effective , because if the bank charges you interest for storing your cash with them , you would simply withdraw your cash .

@@33007232 <h> New Zealand will test long-range wireless electricity transmission <p> A startup in New Zealand has developed a technology to transmit electricity wirelessly over long distances <p> As early as 1890 , Nikola Tesla demonstrated that with a large coil he could turn on a light bulb up to 3 km away . He dreamed of placing huge antennas around the world to spread electricity to any point on the planet without the need for networks and wires . Today that dream can become a reality thanks to Emrod , a startup in New Zealand that has developed an innovative technology for transmitting electricity over long distances wirelessly.The system consists of a transmitting antenna , several repeaters and a receiving antenna.The transmitting antenna converts electricity into microwave energy and focuses it into a cylindrical beam . The microwave beam is sent through a series of repeaters , which look like square plates placed on a pole , until it reaches the receiving antenna , or upright , an antenna capable of converting microwave energy back into electricity . The beam is in the ISM ( industrial , scientific and medical ) frequency band of radio waves , which also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including fog or rain.It just needs a clear and continuous line of sight between the repeaters . Thus , this new technology can transmit electricity for thousands of kilometers at a fraction of the infrastructure and maintenance costs , as well as the environmental impact , which would occur with a wired solution . A low-power laser curtain is used as a safety system that instantly stops the transmission of electricity at the exact moment when an object , such as a bird or a drone , crosses the beam.Although microwave energy propagation technology has been around for decades , what makes Emrod 's wireless electrical transmission different is its high degree of efficiency and the almost complete absence of power loss . " The efficiency of all the components we developed is very good , almost 100 percent . We are not the first to implement this technology , but we are the first to have a commercially viable solution , " said Greg Kushner , founder of the startup.Powerco , New Zealand 's second largest electricity distributor , also believes in this system , which is funding Emrod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small prototype that manages to transmit a few Watts to a few dozen metres , but it will build a larger , more efficient model for Powerco that will be tested for several months in the lab before field testing.At least initially , the device will only be able to provide a few kilowatts of power , but in the future it will be easily scalable . " We can use the exact same technology to transmit 100 times more power over much longer distances . Wireless systems using Emrod technology can transmit any amount of power current transmitted by wired solutions , " Kushner said .

@@33017232 <p> Arrested and effectively detained on the day he arrived in Singapore from New Zealand more than three years ago , Richard Whitham is now able to leave , despite being sentenced this week to 38 months imprisonment . <p> Having arrived in Singapore at 8:30am on June 4 , 2018 , Whitham was arrested at about 3:30pm the same day when attempting to withdraw money at the OCBC Bank Centre on Chulia Street . <p> He faced seven charges of dishonestly misappropriating money in his role as banking relationship establishment project officer for the Hamilton-based Worldclear . Whitham was remanded in Changi Prison from March 5 , 2019 until his trial this week , accused of making unauthorised banking transfers from money he held on trust for Worldclear . <p> After previously pleading not guilty , he pleaded guilty this week to three charges under Singapore 's Corruption , Drug Trafficking and Other Serious Crimes ( Confiscation of Benefits ) Act . He was charged with removing more than S$1.1 million from Singapore through three outward transfers from an OCBC bank account " which in part directly represents his benefits from criminal conduct , " according to Singapore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decided to plead guilty in order to be reunited with his family as soon as possible . The 38 months imprisonment sentence came with effect from March 5 , 2019 . <p> " It was not an easy decision to plead guilty to something you absolutely did not do , but our four kids deserve to have their dad home . He has been gone almost three years , " Erika Whitham says . <p> She says Whitham , who heading into his trial was potentially facing several more years in prison , is now able to leave Singapore . After his arrest in June 2018 Whitham had to surrender his passport to Singapore Police and was told not to leave the country . He stayed in various accommodation , including backpackers , until being charged and remanded in Changi Prison with bail of S$250,000 . <p> Worldclear 's managing director David Hillary declined to comment on Whitham 's guilty plea and sentencing . Hillary 's LinkedIn profile says Worldclear has been closed down and he is ; " resolving some remaining issues ... following employee theft in May 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Whitham , who has dual New Zealand and Australian citizenship . However , with the Singapore proceedings completed , this could be withdrawn under double jeopardy rules that set out no one who has been finally acquitted or convicted of , or pardoned for , an offence shall be tried or punished for it again . <p> ' Belated ' <p> In court this week Singapore 's public prosecutors said the 42 year-old Whitham 's guilty plea was belated . They sought 42 months imprisonment and noted his offences were committed within just one day . The prosecutors said however ; " the plan to dissipate the stolen/misappropriated monies was not particularly sophisticated . " <p> Whitham 's relationship with Worldclear began in 2017 . Worldclear is majority owned by Hillary . According to Hillary , Worldclear operated internationally assisting clients with money transfers , currency trading and banking . It charged clients establishment fees , monthly fees and transaction fees . Hillary says Worldclear worked with customers that banks would n't work with due to reasons such as their location or business structure . He has said Worldclear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The idea was that Whitham would try and get banks to accept Worldclear as a customer or partner . At the same time Whitham says he was also trying to grow his Retail Guru retail consultancy business and driving for Uber to keep food on his family 's table . <p> Whitham says he contacted more than 500 banks primarily in Europe and the United States , but says none wanted to work with Worldclear . <p> Prior to hiring Whitham , Hillary says Worldclear had bank accounts he opened but banks closed these due to Worldclear being categorised as a remittance company . Banks often view money remittance companies as risky under the Anti-Money Laundering and Countering Financing of Terrorism ( AML/CFT ) Act , and thus decide not to have them as customers . Banks are supervised for AML/CFT Act compliance by the Reserve Bank . Worldclear was supervised for AML/CFT Act compliance by the Department of Internal Affairs . <p> Worldclear was incorporated in April 2014 and registered on New Zealand 's financial service providers ' register between April 2014 and February 2019 . Worldclear remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Worldclear 's sole director and majority shareholder . <p> T1 Holdings <p> In December 2017 Whitham incorporated T1 Holdings Ltd with himself as sole director and shareholder . According to Whitham , T1 Holdings was to be a retail shop fitting business . However , T1 Holdings also received funding from Worldclear , with Hillary 's companies able to use T1 Holdings ' bank accounts for conducting financial transactions . Worldclear employees were provided with access to conduct transactions via T1 Holdings ' bank accounts . <p> Hillary says he had suggested , to Whitham , getting somebody to setup a new company to open bank accounts to facilitate financial transactions for Worldclear . From these discussions Whitham agreed to establish T1 Holdings solely for this purpose , Hillary says , with bank accounts in NZ , Singapore and Europe subsequently established . <p> Hillary says $41,500 in banking start-up funds were provided to Whitham by Worldclear . The deal was for Whitham to receive commissions ranging from $500 to $1500 for opening bank accounts to hold money on behalf of Worldclear . <p> On May 18 , 2018 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and who normally had access to T1 Holdings accounts , were n't able to access T1 Holdings ' ANZ , ASB or BNZ accounts . That afternoon Hillary says he noticed files in Worldclear 's online storage dropbox were being deleted and he noticed Whitham had logged on from a Singapore-based IP address and was deleting folders . On the previous afternoon , Thursday May 17 , Whitham had left the Worldclear office early saying he had to look after his sick child . <p> Hillary says he took screen shots of Whitham 's activity , restored the files and suspended his access . He also turned to the Police , and Worldclear obtained a freezing order through the High Court in Hamilton for the funds held by T1 Holdings , Retail Guru and Whitham on May 23 , 2018 . <p> Whitham says he went to Singapore in June 2018 to transfer funds from T1 Operations Pte Ltd , a company he had established there on a previous visit , to his lawyer 's account in NZ . He says he could n't do this via internet banking because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' virtual office in Singapore . <p> Whitham says he also wanted to establish business contacts in Singapore , and that T1 Operations was to be a contractor agent for retail shop fitting . Whitham 's Singapore lawyers said he became concerned in April 2018 when he discovered large transactions were being conducted by Worldclear employees via T1 Holdings ' accounts to various locations around the world . <p> Twenty-six bank accounts <p> Hillary says Whitham absconded from New Zealand after misappropriating money from Worldclear and used some of it to pay personal bills . Hillary says T1 Operations in Singapore was established for the same purpose , and subject to the same arrangements , as T1 Holdings in NZ . According to a May 2018 New Zealand court judgment , T1 Holdings had 26 bank accounts . These included accounts with ANZ , ASB , BNZ and OCBC in Singapore . Worldclear 's accounting records showed it had exposure to T1 Holdings of $4.6 million , the judgment said . <p> Of seven transfers from TI Holdings ' OCBC accounts at the centre of the Whitham Singapore case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mother-in-law 's bank account in South Africa . According to Whitham , this was for stock purchases in South Africa with his mother-in-law 's bank account to be used temporarily until a local bank account could be opened for T1 Holdings . A further two transfers , one of ? 50,000 , and another of ? 200,000 were sent to a bank account at WB21 in Lithuania . Further transfers were made to New York , Lithuania , Singapore and Bulgaria . <p> " The accused transferred the monies to the respective accounts in order to make it more difficult for these to be traced and/or recovered by the victim and/or authorities , " the Singapore Public Prosecutors said . <p> McDonald Vague was appointed T1 Holdings ' liquidator on July 9 , 2018 , receiving an unsecured creditor claim of $4.5 million from Worldclear . This sum was ordered in a NZ judgment obtained by Worldclear against T1 Holdings . <p> In their most recent liquidators ' report , McDonald Vague say they 've thus far distributed $1.2 million to Worldclear . Via the courts , they continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they say was sent there in an unauthorised transaction by Whitham on May 18 , 2018 . McDonald Vague 's Colin Sanderson says they 're still waiting on a decision from the court in Lithuania . <p> Worldclear had received the ? 250,000 via Global Fidelity Bank of the Cayman Islands . Liquidators were appointed to Global Fidelity Bank last month . <p> Lithuania 's Financial Crime Investigation Service , or FNTT , is involved in the legal process as a third party , an FNTT spokeswoman says . She says the prosecutor initiated proceedings to declare the money derelict and transfer it to the budget of the Republic of Lithuania due to uncertainty over who the beneficial owner of the ? 250,000 is . Hillary says this money belongs to Worldclear . <p> McDonald Vague were also appointed liquidators for Retail Guru . In their final report they say claims from Worldclear and T1 Holdings total $4.9 million with $358,360 distributed to T1 Holdings . On the application of Worldclear , Whitham was adjudicated bankrupt in the High Court at Hamilton on May 27 , 2019 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangement that saw T1 Holdings open bank accounts and hold money on behalf of Worldclear , a Reserve Bank ( RBNZ ) spokeswoman told interest.co.nz in 2018 New Zealand banks that opened accounts for TI Holdings probably did n't know about the connection back to Worldclear .

For the air conditioning system , the building utilises a mixture of active chilled beams and a low temperature variable air volume system utilising high induction linear diffusers ( infusers ) which optimises occupant comfort by eliminating drafts , as well as minimising plant and duct sizes . . . The environmentally sustainable building was completed in 2010 and much to the delight of the client , achieved a 5 star Green Star Office Design v1 rating . The building 's energy use was then monitored daily to understand where further improvements could be made in order to make further savings .

Photo by Myprofe <p> In all groups of ponies , muscle enzymes ( aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase ) and urea were high when compared to normal values for equine species , but triglycerides and creatinine were low . Blood lactate concentrations among the Class A ponies were high in comparison with normal values for horses , they reported . <p> " Normal values for equine species should not be directly applied to interpret the lactate , triglycerides , aspartate aminotransferase and creatine kinase values in ponies , " they concluded . <p> Discussing their findings , they said it was still a matter for debate whether ponies should be classified as " hot-blooded " or " cold-blooded " horses from a haematological standpoint . <p> " One of the important findings in our study is a higher concentration of lactate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C represented by Felin ponies and Polish Koniks , respectively . " <p> This , they said , was important from a diagnostic standpoint , as lactate levels are commonly used as diagnostic and prognostic indicators in gastrointestinal and ischemic emergencies in horses . <p> They noted that several studies have mentioned differences in liver functions between horses and ponies . The scientists in the current study also found differences : Aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase in all groups of ponies were high , and in Polish Koniks the latter markedly exceeded the reference intervals for hot-blooded horses . <p> Differences regarding muscle enzymes also seem possible . Creatine kinase ( CPK ) activity was surprisingly high in class A and Polish Koniks . <p> " We postulate that high CPK values were related to muscle mass and composition , which were not examined in our study , but such differences in ponies have been reported in the literature .

" We saw all this news coming out about these people wanting his Twitter handle and how this was the reason he died . It was just mind-boggling to know the man who forever preached Internet safety died this way . " <p> On Wednesday , Shane Sonderman was sentenced in Memphis federal court to five years in prison for one count of conspiracy . Sonderman , 20 , of Lauderdale County , Tennessee , pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge in March in exchange for several other charges to be dropped . <p> Federal prosecutors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure them to sell him their social media handles , according to court documents obtained by The Post .

The British minor , identified as " C.B. " in the indictment , was not extradited to the United States for charges . <p> Bryan Huffman , Sonderman 's lawyer , said he thought his client 's sentencing was fair and emphasised that Sonderman has expressed remorse for actions that helped lead to Herring 's death . <p> " He has expressed his regret regarding Mr. Herring 's death , " Huffman said to The Post .

After this unfolded , Sonderman went on the video game chat platform Discord to share the names and addresses of Herring and his family members , prosecutors say . <p> Alexander Shatov/Unsplash <p> A spokesperson for video game chat platform Discord said in a statement that the company takes safety matters " incredibly seriously " and does engage with authorities when suspicious activity arises . <p> Then , as the pizza situation was happening , police responded to a call from someone with a British accent about an alleged murder and bomb threat - and " arrived prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to the indictment . <p> " Emergency responders were dispatched , and when they arrived at Herring 's home , guns drawn , they called for Herring to walk towards them , keeping his hands visible .

" <p> Fran Herring , his ex-wife , said the timing of his death was no coincidence . <p> " I believe he was scared to death , and that is what caused his heart attack , " she told WKRN . <p> Investigators later determined Sonderman played a role in the fatal " swatting . " Prosecutors said it was clear he " was part of a chain of events " that " led to a juvenile halfway across the globe calling for emergency responses to a non-emergency .

Kirk at the start of each episode of the earliest Star Trek . <p> Despite the frenzied aspirations of Jeff Bezos and Richard Branson to ride their own personal rockets into the lowest reaches of space , and be first to do so , somebody needs to remind them it is no longer uncharted territory . <p> They are by no means explorers or pioneers . Plenty of others have been up there before , and on missions far more valuable to humanity than the Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin expeditions . <p> It is more likely that Mr Bezos and Mr Branson do not care whether we consider them galactic leaders or indeed what we think about their space antics . If that is the case , then bang go any claims to have done it to inspire the billions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth . <p> When you stand on a clear night looking up at the black sky punctured by innumerable pricks of light , do we really need another two ?

When Earth-bound tourism is going to struggle for years due to Covid-19 , is space tourism really going to be a goer ? Is it a good idea to have rich folk zipping around up there in tin cans ? <p> The debate rolls on about whether Commander Bezos and Commander Branson are actually astronauts . <p> The Karman line , 100km up , is an internationally recognised boundary between the top of the atmosphere and the start of space . Mr Branson 's Virgin Galactic did not make it , reaching an altitude of about 86km during a 59-minute flight , while Mr Bezos ' Blue Origin did , rising to 107km above the surface in about 10 minutes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are astronauts . On the same day as Mr Bezos ' flight , it introduced new rules " in order to maintain the prestige of commercial space astronaut wings " , which , among other things , means those who pay for orbital or suborbital space flights are ineligible . <p> The FAA also says flight crew members must be employed by an FAA-certified organisation , including Nasa and the United States military , and that they must be involved in activities during the flight that are " essential to public safety or contributed to human space-flight safety " . <p> Before the journey , Mr Branson told the BBC he had wanted to go into space " since I was a kid " . He wanted to help hundreds of thousands of people in the next 100 years go to space to " look back at our beautiful Earth and come home and work very hard to try to do magic to it to look after it " . <p> Mr Bezos similarly posted on Instagram : " Ever since I was 5 years old , I 've dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ?

Levels of atmospheric CO2 and methane hit all-time highs in 2021 . All-time low levels of ice mass and glaciers are melting 31 percent faster than they did just 15 years ago . Ocean heat and global sea levels set new records since 2019 , and the annual loss rate of the Brazilian Amazon reached a 12-year high in 2020 . Forest degradation linked to fire , drought and logging was causing parts of the Brazilian Amazon to now act as a source of carbon , rather than absorb the gas from the atmosphere . Livestock such as cows and sheep are now at record levels , numbering more than four billion and with a mass exceeding that of all humans and wild land mammals combined , the authors said . They call for the elimination of fossil fuels and air pollutants like soot and methane , a switch to mostly plant-based diets and a more sustainable economy . <p> What a bitter editorial , and so ill-informed as well . Blue Origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rockets are water vapour , and the rockets can be reused . With emission free reusable rockets the satellites that we all use for maps and GPS and watching the Olympics and communication are much less damaging to the environment . Bezos has also invested strongly in the amazing new Rivian pickups that make current diesel pickups look like they have horse and cart technology ( and are currently being tested right here in Otago ) . He recently gave hundreds of millions to foodbanks , and has a $10 billion environment fund that gives to a wide range of environmental organisations . Branson is also giving $3 billion to environmental causes , in addition to the dozens of charities he gives million to . And Bezos and Gates are funding new electric planes that use hydrogen generators , so like the rocket , the only emissions are water vapour . Perhaps the ODT could take a more intelligent look at what is behind these space projects , instead of resorting to a shallow tabloid-style hatchet job . <p> Blue Origin ( New Shepard ) did emit large quantities of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the layer that protects us from harmful UV radiation . The water vapor that Blue Origin emits also forms clouds in the upper atmosphere that alter climate . This effect was noted by Toohey and atmospheric scientist Martin Ross in a 2019 paper where they warn " water vapor emissions from individual launches can notably impact the mesosphere and ionosphere " -- the two atmospheric layers closest to the edge of space . A study from 2010 found that the soot released by 1,000 space tourism flights could warm Antarctica by nearly 1 degree Celsius . The effects on the environment will differ depending on factors like the fuel they use , the energy required to manufacture that fuel , and where they 're headed . While there is a valid argument for space technology to help the planets future , I can see only negative impacts from these joy-rides.

All children are educated about " stranger danger " this is not a word social workers , in particular Oranga Tamariki social workers , should be using . <p> " From our observations of the limited interaction social worker had with the child , social worker was very cold , showed no empathy and had limited understanding into the child 's world , " the document says . <p> DHB staff saw " very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relationship with the child . <p> " This lack of relationship worries us as we know a key role of an Oranga Tamariki social worker is to ensure the child 's voice is heard and their views are taken into consideration .

" <p> Oranga Tamariki were reportedly informed at all times of the increasing concerns about the child 's distress . <p> " We hold significant concern about the lack of psychological support the child has received following the trauma they have been exposed to in their childhood . This trauma has continued as the child was unable to return to live with family and spent a considerable amount of time in a hospital ward with feelings of abandonment , " the report said . <p> DHB staff also said the child was " fearful " and had " ongoing distrust of their Oranga Tamariki team " . <p> Despite predicting that the child would find their discharge " extremely traumatic " , the social worker decided they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only after " multiple " requests from the DHB that the social worker " reluctantly " agreed to be present . <p> When the time came for the child to leave , the youngster was extremely distressed , screaming , crying and resisting . <p> Police were needed to escort the child to a waiting car and many members of staff and the public witnessed the discharge . <p> " This has been described by one of our most experienced nursing staff as the most distressing ' uplift ' in her entire career in pediatrics . " <p> After being discharged , the Oranga Tamariki social worker called the DHB asking for nurses to help and try to calm the child . <p> The report 's view of Oranga Tamariki : <p> A lack of communication from Oranga Tamariki <p> A lack of advocacy for the child <p> A lack of action to find a suitable placement <p> No work by the agency to ensure the child 's needs and rights were met in hospital <p> Lack of effort to build rapport with a traumatised child <p> Limited insight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A poor discharge plan and lack of support . <p> DHB staff asked for a full and formal review of the file and an apology .

Source : istock.com <p> In December 2018 , three cars were stolen in a ram raid in West Auckland . <p> The Independent Police Conduct Authority ( IPCA ) said one of the two cars that fled the scene was stopped soon after , but police had to use road spikes to stop the other on a motorway off-ramp . <p> The driver got out and was arrested .

" <p> The IPCA made a number of other findings in relation to the pursuit .

And , as Justin Latif reports , a new film focused on her fight for climate change shows she will not be silenced . <p> This year has been quieter . While she says she still receives around 30 appearance requests a month , life has " slowed down a lot " , despite the added pressures of life as a environmental engineering student at AUT University . She plans to also begin a law degree next year . <p> " I 've been exploited so many times that I had to develop some boundaries , " she says of her decision to temporarily pull back from public life . <p> " I 've had some experiences where I was the only one on a panel not getting paid or sometimes I realised they did n't really want me -- they just wanted a brown face . <p> " It starts to feel microaggressive when people want you to share your traumas just so they can clutch their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their privileged lives . <p> " But at the same time I also do n't want to stop -- because climate change is n't going to stop .

Rather it 's ensuring the voices of young South Aucklanders are respected by the other activists within the movement . <p> " None of us really realised that we 'd have to be fighting for climate change and fighting against racism in the climate space as well , " she says now . <p> When the first School Strike 4 Climate took place on March 19 , 2019 , few South Auckland pupils took part as it coincided with Polyfest , one of the most important cultural events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says this was initially not seen as a problem by the school strike movement 's organisers , but when she highlighted this lack of diversity on The Project , the organisers changed their tune . <p> " It seemed like they only took me seriously because I called them out on national television -- and then they were like ' oh we 've got to have you here ' . " <p> The film also reveals that some of her fellow activists did not feel the risks to Pacific peoples from rising sea levels was an issue the steering group should focus on . <p> " I fear my island will become nothing but a story to tell , " she says in the film . " But how do people talk about our genocide like it 's nothing ? It breaks my heart . " <p> However over the course of the film her concerns are addressed . By its conclusion , a united front has been established as the disparate groups prepare for an extra large school strike event . <p> " It was definitely jarring -- that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in actually supporting those living through climate change , " says Fepulea'i Tapua'i of that time . <p> " But in the end I came to see it as an opportunity to give attention to the things that are being left out of the conversation , which is pretty much what the documentary captures .

But as Benedict Evans pointed out to me a few weeks ago , that is insignificant compared to what they did to business itself , allowing small businesses to advertise for the first time and creating whole sectors out of thin air . <p> The same will be true of the metaverse . Here is Matthew Ball writing on what happens to content : <p> " The metaverse will also lead to the establishment of many new entertainment franchises and consumer-facing brands . This is because new access technologies do more than shift how consumers access content . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . Each medium calls forth a new face . We may be considering the same questions , but every evolution of information technology modifies or transforms expression . This can be superficial -- search engines encouraging boring headlines in online news -- or as deep as the way social media seems to favour partisanship and exaggeration . <h> But what actually is it ? <p> Before you dismiss the metaverse as a re-branded internet , consider how you would describe the internet itself to someone from the past . I am thinking about my grandmother , who was born in 1914 and died in 1995 . You could explain the internet as a whole lot of computers connected together , a network that lets you send mail , make calls , do the grocery shopping , and watch movies . She would readily understand that , because all those things she already understood . But precisely because of this I would n't really be explaining it . The internet changed what it was possible to do . <p> Remember the ' information superhighway ' ? ( Book cover , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct , then the metaverse will be like the internet all over again . <p> He names children 's gaming platform Roblox as the current best precursor to the " virtual platforms " that will be integral to the metaverse . I wrote about Roblox , its slow build and phenomenal success , earlier this year . Every month around 200 million humans -- mostly small humans -- use it . <p> Ball also namechecks Minecraft as a virtual platform and metaverse precursor . Interesting that the future is coming out of the nursery . <h> Longing for something we already have <p> Both Zuckerberg and Ball are focussed on the positive aspects of the metaverse , and Zuckerberg is convincing when he points out the flaws in current experience . <p> " We have these phones . They 're relatively small . A lot of the time that we 're spending , we 're basically mediating our lives and our communication through these small , glowing rectangles . I think that that 's not really how people are made to interact . " <p> It seems that blind optimism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blunderers like Ball and Zuckerberg , we would n't have the modern world . <p> We can also safely say , right now , that their optimism is ludicrous . <p> The flipside of a metaverse that provides a new way to work , have fun , and make social connections is new ways to fragment societies and minds . At bottom , the metaverse is a challenge to the primacy of physical reality . <p> It 's exciting and it 's disturbing , and once we go there , we 're not coming back . <p> It makes me nostalgic for the present , the simplicity of our two-dimensional screens , and the charming innocence of a social media constrained by the glowing rectangle .

The gates were opened shortly before the advertised hour of 11 , by which time there was a crowd waiting outside the barriers . By 11.30 the double seats round the field were filled , and from 12 o'clock the people began to pour in through the various entrances . Though the ground filled steadily there was very little waiting at the gates , and the behaviour of the crowd both in coming and going was exemplary . Policemen were stationed at various points on the ground and at the several approaches to it , but so orderly was the crowd in its passage that there was no need for a restraining or directing hand .

@@33119239 <h> Vaccination programme needs to be fully rolled out before borders can be slowly re-opened , health experts advise Government <p> New Zealand 's border restrictions should n't be relaxed until the vaccination programme is fully rolled out . <p> Once this is likely to have occurred by early-2022 , a phased approach should be taken to re-opening the country 's borders . <p> These are two key take-outs from three reports , commissioned by Associate Minister of Health Ayesha Verrall , and completed by a group of experts in epidemiology , infectious diseases and public health . <p> The group , chaired by Professor David Skegg , said border rules could initially be relaxed by extending quarantine-free travel to countries beyond Australia ( currently paused ) and the Cook Islands , and reducing the time vaccinated New Zealand citizens or residents , who have gone overseas for a short trip , need to spend in managed isolation . <p> However , it said because it 's " entirely possible that Delta may have been displaced by an even more transmissible variant ( with other unique characteristics ) by the end of this year , " it 's unrealistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The group repeatedly stressed the importance of getting New Zealand 's adult vaccination rate " as near as possible towards 100% " . <p> It said vaccinations reduce the likelihood of infection and the likelihood of an infected person becoming seriously ill . Vaccinations also reduce the likelihood of the virus spreading . <p> The group concluded herd immunity is unlikely to be reached here or internationally , particularly as children are n't vaccinated , and because much more transmissible variants of COVID-19 , like Delta , will emerge . <p> It acknowledged that once borders re-open - even partially - people carrying COVID-19 will inevitably enter the country , regularly . <p> If the population is only partially vaccinated , outbreaks might be too large for our public health units to extinguish them by testing , rapid tracing and isolation of contacts . <p> " Raising of alert levels would be almost inevitable , and the vaccine roll-out could be impeded . Moreover , treatment services would probably be stretched beyond capacity , " the group said . <p> " The New Zealand health system is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease such as COVID-19 . As we entered the pandemic , the provision of intensive care beds ( per capita ) in New Zealand was less than one third of the average among 22 OECD countries . " <p> The group noted the health system is already likely to come under more strain as re-opening borders will increase cases of influenza in the winters of 2022 and 2023 . <p> The group said the degree of protection would be higher if 12-16-year-olds were vaccinated too . <p> It acknowledged " it is possible that a variant resistant to the vaccine could emerge before we are ready to open our borders " . <p> " Even with current settings , New Zealand is liable to experience an outbreak similar to that in New South Wales over the coming months - although presumably we would go into lockdown more quickly , " the group said . <p> New Zealand may even continue to face " localised " lockdowns once borders re-open . <p> The group said steps need to be taken to prepare for slowly re-opening borders . <p> " These include @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , review and likely expansion of the contact tracing capacity of public health units , mandating of QR scanning at some types of venue , exploration of special measures to assist tracing of returning travellers , and review and strengthening of health system capacity and management systems for dealing with large outbreaks of COVID-19 , " it said . <p> The group suggested , " In the early phases of re-opening , a reduced time in an MIQ facility , say for five to seven days , would seem more realistic . This could be followed by additional testing once or twice in the second week . <p> " The reduced quarantine scheme could start with people who have visited low-risk ( or medium- and low-risk ) countries for a limited period - say up to one month . <p> " Because children are currently not eligible for vaccination , we suggest that the scheme should initially be confined to vaccinated adults . " <p> The group said it was not only viable , but optimal for New Zealand to maintain its elimination strategy once borders start re-opening . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than a goal of no new cases . <p> The Government will respond to the group 's reports on Thursday . <p> The group 's members includes , David Skegg , Nikki Turner , Philip Hill , Maia Brewerton , David Murdoch and Ella Iosua . Rodney Jones and Shaun Hendy are special advisors . <p> The three reports , which are 18 pages long in total and written in plain English , can be read here . <p> Remember we welcome robust , respectful and insightful debate . We do n't welcome abusive or defamatory comments and will de-register those repeatedly making such comments . Our current comment policy is here . <p> Brock Landers was pretty adamant we would n't be opening borders next year . At all . <p> So clearly not everyone " knew " what you consider to be obvious . <p> Anyway , would you prefer the government not get official advice for their decisions ? Just use their own personal reckons ? <p> Steven Joyce ( who would have been finance minister if National won in 2017 ) reckoned when we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elimination strategy was " pie in the sky " . I 'm glad we have a government that seeks expert advice instead of just using their personal reckons . <p> What people do n't really seem to understand about that policy , is over 10 years we normally plant 500 million . The policy was only to double the planting over 10 years , not actually that ambitious really . <p> Yes , I wish the MSM in this country would do a better job of reporting facts and dispelling misinformation and lies . But they are n't doing it , so I 'm happy to point out the facts when I spot someone being misleading in the wild . <p> Lanthanide - I thought it was an additional 1 billion trees ? Anyway the current average of 50 million trees planted every year are 80% replants ! ! I 'm in forestry investments if they are counting current plantings then only 20% should be counted ! <p> They will never open borders like 2019 again we now have nightly news telling us the climate is doomed and covid is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super rich and powerful to travel due to carbon reduction taxes and pandemic costs and inflation pushing airfares back to 1980 ticket pricing . <p> This report could of been done last year and/or not taken 3 months for simple conclusions . Our roll out of the vaccine could of been efficient and nearly finished by now - we 're one of the worst in the world . The boarders could of slowly started opening by now . Yet , we 're still sitting duck 's if the virus creeps back in with a level 4 lock down pending . All talk , no action . Next year is not that far off and we 're no where near ready . <p> The fact is the *majority* of people in this country are living their life relatively unaffected by COVID . <p> Those that are directly affected , eg businesses without customers , or who are struggling without access to imported labour - well , what exactly do they want the government to do ? If they could eliminate COVID globally they would . In absence of being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , which is allowing the majority of the people in this country live their life relatively unaffected by COVID . <p> That 's the simple truth anyone claiming the government has done a bad job ( as you are claiming ) has to grapple with - the fact that on any reasonable scale , the government has done a very good job , certainly when comparing to pretty much every other developed country on the planet . <p> Given the sporting analogies all over this thread ... one could argue that the Government , on balance , has done a good job in respect of COVID in its initial response . But COVID will be a game of two halves . And our second half performance , so far , is bad . There is a real risk our sub-optimal vaccination programme and inability to make meaningful improvements to our health infrastructure mean that we may , in the end , lose . <p> It 's like the All Blacks just scrapping through with the win . They had all the odds for them but they had continuous unforced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they got over confident and cocky . They got surprised when the opposition scored a number of tries . <p> This has been the 3rd consecutive game like this . <p> Fans after the game were happy with the win but looked for reasons again as to why they did n't perform when they were the clear favourites . Other counties are starting to get better than them . <p> The coach could be rolled after this and key players are on the line . There 's areas for improvement and results need to be proven going forward to be the best team . <p> Interesting analogy , but not very relevant to a global pandemic : 1 . This is life and peoples livelihoods , not entertainment 2 . The All Blacks play how many games per year ? 3 . Rugby has a set list of rules , known players and totally known scope . The rugby ball stays the same size and shape and you always know where it is at any given time . 4 . Rugby players are 100% totally responsible for what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy and give instructions for 10,000+ other people to follow , and hope that they can follow those instructions without making mistakes . 5 . There is no rule book for how to deal with a COVID pandemic . We started with an influenza epidemic plan , which provided some early guidance but quickly turned out to be ill-suited for a COVID pandemic . We 've watched other countries and learned as best we could from their experiences . 6 . No other country has really done a better job . When the All Blacks barely scrape through , you can look at past games and see times when they did much better . Right now we can look at hundreds of other countries and see how they are all mostly doing much much worse . <p> @donny11 you seem to be under the misinformed opinion that outside New Zealand other countries are letting people travel internationally with ease . In reality most other countries also have a ban on international travel ( expect for their own citizens ) . For the most part our restrictions on travel are similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the world would absolutely kill to be where NZ is right now - every other developed country is grappling with either endemic covid or months long lockdowns to combat outbreaks . We also have a super strong economy despite eliminating international tourism . Meanwhile kiwis are living their lives in NZ in pretty much the same manner as before covid , with the only major difference being a lack of international travel and international visitors ( something which every other country is also without ) . NZ is Absolutely amazing by any measure , only an idiot would fail to see that . <p> You can label it as National propaganda or you can look at the history , which is that there have been instances where the Government claims to be waiting for advice then does n't wait for the advice to be submitted or sits on that advice or ignores it entirely . This has nothing to do with National . In fact , the Prime Minister herself loves telling the story that it was a phone call from friends in London that led to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would do a lot better if we were less tribal and willing to call out our own " team " for their failures . In NZ , we seem to be willing to do this endlessly with the All Blacks or the Warriors , but once it 's political our teams can do no wrong it seems . In a few years , you will be as disillusioned with the Ardern years as many National members now are with the Key years . I am already lamenting the state of our democracy . <p> Yep money would have been better spent on a new dedicated MIQ facility that with the right design could be used for emergency housing after the pandemic . We just live in hope that another even worse variant will not come along and all those homeless people will leave the motels right ? <p> Maybe not , but we have had 16 months since the border shut . Ample time to plan and construct a dedicated MIQ facility . The countless billions spent on propping up the housing market would have easily covered the costs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as-always , the risk . We did n't know how the pandemic would unfold - Avian Flu , Zika and Ebola ended up mostly being hot air . Start building something and risk it not being required because the virus goes away . Start building something and risk it being totally inadequate for what is eventually needed . Start building something and end up not needing it because the virus begins circulating in the community anyway and so you end up with a system where people isolate at home rather than needing MIQ facilities . <p> Also for all the investment in a purpose-built MIQ facility , would it really end up being better than what we 've had so far ? We have n't had any community spreads since February , so the current system seems to be working well . The biggest risk is perhaps simply the number of people you let into the country , more-so than the facility used to house them - having more MIQ capacity , even if it was in a purpose-built facility , may actually increase our overall risk of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend any money " propping up the housing market " - not sure where you are getting that idea from . The independent reserve bank ( like every other central bank ) lowered interest rates and purchased bonds to support the economy/jobs which was grinding to a halt 18 months ago . However none of the reserve bank activity is using money which is available for general government spending - that 's not how it works . <p> My main take-outs : 1 . reaching ' herd immunity ' such that NZ can just re-open fully is n't going to happen , ever 2. high vaccination rates will help reach a point where we can slowly &amp; partially re-open to some places &amp; people , but 3. we 'll still have infections in NZ that will need to be stamped out , by contact tracing , isolation and , possibly , further lockdowns 4. we are n't ever going back to life before COVID , the world has changed 5 . I probably wont see my Aust domiciled mum this calendar year , sigh . <p> 1 . COVID is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over time because selection pressure stifles the deadlier strains from spreading . 2 . New , more effective vaccines will be developed . 3 . Vaccines hesitancy will decline and conspiracy theories will be shown to be made up crap . 4 . New rapid and accurate tests will be developed 5 . New treatments for COVID will be developed <p> A feasible reality is in the future we may have a rapid and accurate 15 minutes packaged test a doctor can administer you . You stay in the office until you get the result , then if positive you 're given a prescription of pills to take 4 times a day for 5 days and told to isolate at home for 3 days and take the pills . <p> Even just having an accurate 15 minutes packaged test can change things dramatically - airlines could test passengers prior to boarding , for example . <p> Lanthanide -- thats a pretty good summary and i suspect that you are right on the money -- my only concern is that we are vaccinating so so so so slowly - and therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in a situation where at least 60% of the population were fully vaccinated by now which would have limited the risk - we could also have increased the number of ICU beds available- made sure we have a large number of ventilators and of course started building MIQ facilities -- as they will be needed for years - and Covid wont be the last pandemic <p> Like it or not the government 's strategy from the outset , has regarded our hospital system as being barely adequate to cover general admissions existing pre CV19 and obviously still existing . Iceland with over 85% of its population vaccinated is now experiencing an influx of delta variant patients that is seriously impacting on their health system . It is a pointer to a potential NZ outcome . Can not imagine our government is going to abandon their strategy unless that sort of risk is either minor or controllable . When that might be ? Not any time soon methinks . Like it or lump it in other words . <p> Searching for Iceland on the herald turns up no obvious results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mostly about COVID and ships in Tauranga . None of those had a link to an article about Iceland . <p> Given how effective the vaccine is at preventing hospitalisations , and the article I linked to saying Iceland has 90%+ vaccination rates , I find it unlikely that their health system is struggling with COVID at the moment . <p> https : **39;2738;TOOLONG ... i think you will find that like NZ its such a small health system that it can be easily overwhelmed --- in reality our health officials were concerned about the impact of one UN evacuee from Fiji and the impact so how we will cope with say 200 - which would suck up a thousand staff i do nt know - its takes 4.2FTE to provide one to one cover over a week -- and the reality is that we are looking at a lot more than one staff designated just to a covid patient at any particular time - so that 1000 staff for 200 ICU beds is a huge underestimation <p> It looks to me like they 're really assuming it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently had a sharp decline in their COVID spread despite opening up . Probably too early to say what will happen in Iceland - could easily be very bad as they are predicting , but it might also have a UK-style turnaround . <p> The UK graphs are very interesting - despite teh huge surge in cases to over 50,000 a day during the football , they have dropped below 20,000 already despite no extra restrictions - in fact all restrictions were removed and still the numbers went down -- Most importantly there has not been an associated spike in hospitalizations or deaths - a very small increase yes - but its tiny in comparison https : **26;2779;TOOLONG is a good link -- clearest evidence yet that mass vaccination is incredibly effective in reducing deaths and serious illness from Covid <p> Did the UK mainly use AstraZeneca , they initially ordered 100m doses of AstraZeneca and 40m of Pfizer ? Is their falling rate more to do with the mix of vaccines used ? They also extended the 2nd Pfizer dose out to 12 weeks rather than the initial advice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2nd AstraZeneca . <p> they definitely mixed 3 or 4 vaccines but i could not tell you what the ratio was - but that data does suggest there is no loss by extending out -- but the biggest gain is from the first vaccine -- and they prioritized getting as many first vaccines in as opposed to doubles - the BBC pretty much does a daily update or every couple of days - so there is a link below with most of the data <p> Yes that seems to be being recognised now . But kpnuts &amp; Lanthanide provide some good points in that observing the status &amp; progress in both the UK &amp; Iceland , is going to provide NZ authorities with very good guidelines for future trends and outcomes , hope so ! <p> In there , a nugget of core information : We are likely to see a Delta variant outbreak before we hit our vaccination marks . There is serious rumblings that Level 4 as we know it may not be enough . And fewer businesses would be able to mark themselves as ' essential ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time for the financial relief packages to be outlined , the payroll providers to update their software so it can actually functionally pay out a wage subsidy and the extension of the recently-yeeted fixed asset threshold . There 's no reason we should n't be doing these things in advance . <p> The problem is if the government were to outline such a contingency , National would slag them off as " expecting to fail " , regardless of the fact that National would not have managed COVID as well as this government has ( see my earlier comment about Steven Joyce 's view , and recall National repeatedly saying we should have opened borders last year ) . <p> Probably they should do it anyway , but the political environment is still a consideration . <p> I 'm not entirely sure about that - if you want to play hypotheticals , I have a hard time believing that Mr Social Investment , husband of a GP and man with strong opinions about the sanctity of life Bill English would have chanced his arm on something like a global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as the management consultant wing of the party . It 's not the same party it was under his watch , which is as much our loss as it is theirs . <p> Yes , Bill English is probably the singular element that could have made a National response more like what we 've seen from Labour . I 'm not aware of any public statements from him about COVID ( Key has made a few ) since he was out of Parliament before it all kicked off . <p> I disagree . If we swapped the roles , the response would have been identical . And Labour right now would be an opposition like a dog chasing cars in the same way the National Party is right now . The strengths and weaknesses of NZ 's approach sits entirely with our institutions , and the long-term success and failure of our COVID response will be dictated by the effectiveness of our technocrats of making good choices and taking people with them . Right now , MOH needs to be performance managed . Andrew Little , to his credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety of areas . The next 3-4 months will be critical . <p> Only way to keep NZ safe is to keep borders closed if opened to government would be held accountable for the carnage . This virus will kill even if vaccine is taken up throughout country look at other places in the world lockdowns all the time and still people really sick and dying , at the moment people in NZ can go out visit family travel freely why change that when you do n't have to , look at it in a years time after more research has been completed . <p> It 's generally immeasurable , but the two most likely causal chains is that if we keep the borders closed to foreigners and only allow NZers in , then we 'll likely end up with fewer skilled healthcare workers such as doctors and surgeons coming here . How many people might die from injuries or illnesses that could have been saved had the healthcare workers been let in ? It 's impossible to know or measure , but that does n't mean it wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay shut for extended periods is suicides , both in NZ and elsewhere , eg from families not being able to reunite and the stress driving them over the edge . Again , not really possible to quantify this , but that does n't mean it wo n't happen . <p> The longer the borders stay shut , the worse both of these influences become . Also if the borders stayed shut for a very long time ( say current , or stricter settings , for another 18+ months ) it will likely result in lower overall economic growth , which in turn has costs on human health in general . <p> The point is , even if it ca n't be accurately quantified , keeping the borders shut *will* cost lives , in terms of outrights deaths and also lowered life outcomes ( eg if someone is unemployed for 2 years it has a great toll on the rest of their life trajectory in terms of earning potential ) . Opening the borders will cost lives from COVID . <p> Focussing only on the lives lost when the borders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and totally ignoring the lives lost when the borders are kept shut , is not a sensible thing to do . At some point you also do need to take into account the value of a human life , and the deaths of frail people in their 80s+ who may not have lived much longer and may not have had a great quality of life anyway , morally does need to be weighed against the costs being imposed on the rest of the population . <p> Morally for me , the most troubling situation is those people who can not medically take a COVID vaccine . They 're in a very unfortunate position , mostly through no fault of their own . <p> &gt; then we 'll likely end up with fewer skilled healthcare workers such as doctors and surgeons coming here . <p> Despite the borders being closed theres still some migration happening right ? surely if anyone can get in it will be doctors and surgeons with the level of skill that we do n't have the internal expertise to train ourselves . <p> Back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doctors and surgeons as well as huge numbers of retail managers , chefs and students . We never actually got anywhere in addressing the healthcare worker shortage because we kept pumping up the general population . <p> &gt; The other likely causal chain if borders stay shut for extended periods is suicides , both in NZ and elsewhere , eg from families not being able to reunite and the stress driving them over the edge . <p> I 'll post a source when I 'm not on mobile but from memory the suicide rate has decreased over the last year . Would n't this effect have started to be evident by now ? Also , why ca n't families reunite - its more difficult but not impossible to travel , surely if its genuinely a matter of life and death then 2 weeks in MIQ is a small price to pay . <p> &gt; eg if someone is unemployed for 2 years it has a great toll on the rest of their life trajectory in terms of earning potential <p> Unemployment is down and it seems that wage growth is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the border closure ( less immigration meaning employers must compete for workers ) . The economy is a complex thing with 5m moving parts , I do n't think you can point to a change in one input(immigration) and say that this is objectively good or bad but on balance the economy seems to be ticking along pretty well . <p> Despite the borders being closed theres still some migration happening right ? surely if anyone can get in it will be doctors and surgeons with the level of skill that we do n't have the internal expertise to train ourselves . <p> I do n't believe so . Certainly not at a high enough rate to fill the shortages we have in the healthcare industry . <p> I 'll post a source when I 'm not on mobile but from memory the suicide rate has decreased over the last year . <p> Sure . I 'm not talking about the rate . <p> I 'm saying if the borders stay shut as they are now ( or worse ) for a long enough period , people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those same people otherwise would not have . <p> The overall rate of suicides may be lower , my point is that there are specific people who will die as a *direct* result of borders being shut , who would not die if the borders were open . <p> Also , why ca n't families reunite - its more difficult but not impossible to travel , surely if its genuinely a matter of life and death then 2 weeks in MIQ is a small price to pay . <p> Have you not seen any of the stories about how people overseas are completely unable to book any slots in MIQ ? As for suicide , it usually is n't rational - being in a very bad place mentally , expecting your family to be visiting soon , only for them to have to cancel for some reason and then being unable to get another booking in MIQ for months could push someone over the edge . <p> The economy is a complex thing with 5m moving parts , I do n't think you can point to a change in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on balance the economy seems to be ticking along pretty well . <p> Yes , overall the economy might be doing well and unemployment might be down overall , but that does n't help Joe Bloggs who has run a tourism business in Waikickamucow for the last 15 years who has seen their livelihood destroyed by COVID and who is n't able to get a decently paying job otherwise . <p> If you 're going to focus on the *individuals* who directly die as a result of getting COVID after the borders are opened and holding them up as a reason NOT to open the borders , then you should give *some* thought to the *individuals* who directly die ( or have worse life outcomes ) as a direct result of the borders being kept shut for longer . <p> Also , why ca n't families reunite - its more difficult but not impossible to travel , surely if its genuinely a matter of life and death then 2 weeks in MIQ is a small price to pay . <p> The problem is that MIQ is fully booked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookings are accepted . So it 's not just 2 weeks in MIQ , it 's needing to stay away for 4+ months , maybe even a year or more - further splitting up families in the interim . <p> there is data around about the ave expected number of deaths vis a vis COVID deaths - https : **35;2807;TOOLONG but its too difficult for me to explain - but it does give some form of measure - admittedly not specific to a border closure <p> In some countries they are showing less deaths than expected to non covid reasons -- ie lockdowns reducing travel so road tolls lower , work so accidents and deaths in workplace lower etc -- but there is also evidence in some countries of more excess deaths - due to lack of hospital treatment for other illnesses . In particular the lack of screening for certain cancers has led to more diagnosis being at stage 4 rather than stages 2 and 3 where treatment is an option and has a far greater chance of success . <p> I personally knew two people who died this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - in both cases their access to diagnostic treatment was significantly delayed due to the waiting list increases caused by the lockdowns and staff shortages - In fact their diagnosis only came as a result of emergency hospital admissions not due to their initial reporting of symptoms to a GP - leading to a four month wait for an appointment with a specialist that in the end did not happen . <p> At the moment - Waitemata DHB for example have only filled 30 of the 100 extra nursing posts they need -- but have significantly more vacancies in their baseline positions - and so are currently over 200 nurses short - and my understanding is most DHB 's are teh same <p> Think the report is terrible . Supression does n't work . Look how delta is spreading in NSW despite a hard lockdown . Our options are either maintain elimination or live with the virus . There is no third option . <p> The report is dated 10 June 2021 we were still in the early stages of Delta . I think the official narrative was Pfizer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no solid data to contradict this ) . I think the report would consider its self out of date . <p> Exactly . In this light I think a much more likely scenario is a Delta outbreak we are unable to suppress ( no one else seems to be really able to .. ) and us being forced to live with the virus . We can only hope that the vaccination rates are high by the time this occurs ... <p> Seems like this report tells the government exactly what it wants to hear . <p> Here are my three quick takeaways ; 1 . Professor Skegg has an impressive academic career , however it looks to me like these guys are all prone to establishment groupthink . I mean Skegg had been an adviser to the WHO and Turner is or was on the WHO SAGE subcommittee . Hendy came up with the doom and gloom SIR models which steered us into closing the borders . How likely is it that these guys would be critical of what NZ 's done so far , or would recommend an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of the report seems be cynically re-defining words . Elimination does n't mean actual elimination ? Herd immunity does n't actually mean the virus ca n't pass between people ? Also Covid19 apparently needs a Maori translation because that 's really important . 3 . They seem to be doubling down again . Vaccinate everyone 16 years and older . This seems weird to me because people like Dr Geert Vandeen Bosssche ( Who 's a hardcore vaccine advocate who worked for GAVI , the WHO , and Gates foundation ) are ringing the alarm bell and saying we should stop mass vaccination immediately to prevent escape variants from evolving . <p> " The group repeatedly stressed the importance of getting New Zealand 's adult vaccination rate " as near as possible towards 100% " . " A nice cop out statement . Adults 16+ ? Its been suggested that 80% of the total population who are likely to be adversely affected need to be vaccinated . Pick your ages and risk factors . There is no ways this govt or any govt can achieve this " as near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most conservative solutions and hedging their bets on a new strain . Well in 6 months there may very well be a new strain and six months after that another new strain . This govt will push out the relaxation of restrictions as far out as possible . I was hoping no MIQ for returning vaccinated would be allowed by end 1st qty 2022 . I do n't see this happening . <p> Thats evil . Throwing kids on the bonfire to save their grandparents . You should be ashamed of yourself . There are no long term trials . Children have a long term ahead of them . It has been shown spike proteins head for bonemarrow and ovaries . Cancer and infertility . Are you willing to bet the farm on that ?

It is this effect that will not just cause house prices to stall but drive a recession . <p> I agree , the discretionary spending will take a huge dive . Paying your mortgage is at the very top of the priority list , if you have to live on baked beans and the kids do n't get any Christmas presents then that 's the way it will be . <p> This is exactly it .

New headlights and tail lights also feature , with the latter getting a very different light signature . <p> Ironically , the biggest change to the iX3 's exterior is more to do with the spec sheet . All models now come with BMW 's M Sport visual pack as standard . This chucks in larger 20-inch wheels and a more aggressive body kit all round . <p> The cabin is a similar story of evolution over revolution , although that 's not necessarily a bad thing .

These include three ' Vernasca leather ' colour options ; black , white , or ' Mocha ' brown . <p> Now to the iX3 's business end ; its mechanicals . Each model gets an 80kWh lithium-ion battery which BMW says has an advanced ' mass-to-capacity ' ratio . This is thanks to things like the aluminium cell casings and other refinements made between generations . <p> This is mated to a rear-mounted motor producing 210kW of power and 400Nm of torque , allowing the model to accelerate to 100km/h in 6.8 seconds on its way to an electronically limited 180km/h top speed . <p> Most curiously , the iX3 is rear-wheel drive instead of the all-wheel drive we 've come to expect in X3 models . BMW says that this move means the model aligns neatly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although the move is also potentially a reflection of lack of interest in AWD among X3 clientele . <p> Range is rated at 460km on the WLTP cycle , meaning that a real-world figure is probably in the ballpark of 400km per charge .

@@33129233 <h> Peter Dunne <p> Wellington , August 15 , 2021 <p> Image from Covid-19 ( New Zealand ) website <p> The most consistent aspect of the government 's response to Covid-19 has been that at no point throughout the global pandemic so far has it ever been acknowledged that there is merit in any of the responses other countries have adopted . <p> The strong implication has been that no country understands the pandemic the way New Zealand does or has the calibre of scientific advice available to it as we do here . <p> And somehow , the impact of Covid-19 on human beings in New Zealand is different from its impact on human beings anywhere else in the world . <p> Evidence-based decisions <p> The government has said throughout that its decisions have been guided by the evidence and focused on the health impacts of the virus . Consequently , the advice it has been guided by has been primarily from the preservation of the public health perspective , with little regard for the wider social and economic impacts of both the virus and the response to it . <p> Fair enough , given that the near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursuing an elimination strategy was the best course of action , even if most other countries have moved on from that approach . <p> It freely acknowledges that New Zealand is now the " last man standing " when it comes to continuing to promote an elimination strategy . <p> The Expert Advisory Group <p> This week 's report from Sir David Skegg 's Expert Advisory Group on what New Zealand should do next confirms that approach . Not only was the Expert Advisory Group made up entirely of people with a health background , its very conservative report , by its own admission , focuses solely on the health issues regarding the pandemic , and leaves the wider economic and social issues for the government to address . <p> For its part , the government seems just as content to continue to see Covid-19 and the response to it as no more than a public health issue and to gear its responses accordingly . There has been no suggestion , for example , that the Skegg report is externally reviewed by a more representative wider group ( perhaps jointly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clark ? ) to ensure that the decisions made upon it best reflect New Zealand 's wider interests . <p> Cautious response <p> The government has been lucky so far that there has been no coherent or credible challenge to either its health-centred approach or reliance on a very narrow pool of New Zealand epidemiologists for its advice . <p> That has enabled it to fashion New Zealand 's cautious response , exemplified by the slow rate of vaccination ( now just 16% according to the latest World Health Organisation data ) , with a remarkable degree of insularity . The lack of other health professionals ' voices being allowed to be heard or taken seriously has also meant the government has operated within its own comfortable echo chamber for the last eighteen months , knowing its tight view of the world is unlikely to be seriously challenged . <p> The Delta Variant <p> The advent of the Delta variant has changed a lot of thinking around the world . <p> The Covid-19 Response Minister is warning that in the event the Delta virus was found in New Zealand the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole country likely to go into an immediate Level 4 lockdown . <p> Yet the same day , the Minister was making these overly draconian threats to reinforce the public fear the government has relied on from the outset to impose its pandemic response , a panel of international experts at least as distinguished as their New Zealand counterparts was calling for an entirely different approach to dealing with Covid-19 be adopted -- precisely because of the Delta variant . <p> The team , led by Professor Andrew Pollard , who led the prestigious Oxford University Vaccine Team , says it is now time to accept that the spread of the virus throughout the entire population could not be stopped , and that monitoring people with mild symptoms was no longer helpful . Pollard said that " we do n't have anything that will stop transmission , so I think that we are in a situation where herd immunity is not a possibility and I suspect the virus will throw up a new variant that is even better at infecting vaccinated individuals . " <p> Shifting the focus <p> His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British MPs , was that full vaccination would never be enough to prevent Covid-19 spreading . They say that the focus now needs to shift to dealing with those people who become unwell because of the virus , not just recording the numbers of cases in the community . <p> All of which makes not only the Skegg review 's recommendation that New Zealand should not consider reopening its borders until every eligible New Zealander has had the opportunity to be vaccinated , and the Minister 's wild threats of even more draconian lockdowns should the Delta variant emerge here look unrealistic . <p> More fundamentally , it knocks the ground out from under the government 's entire response strategy . What the Pollard team is really saying is that clinging to the elimination approach Skegg urges New Zealand to hold onto is doomed to failure ; the Delta variant can not be stopped despite what Minister Hipkins may think or threaten , and vaccination will not produce the herd immunity both Skegg and the government say is a necessary precursor to reopening our borders . <p> Different strategy needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep New Zealand in a semi-permanent state of isolation and periodic lockdown , which no rational human being would accept as logical or reasonable , it is time for a serious rethink of our Covid-19 approach , based on the latest international evidence . Such a rethink would upend the timid findings of the Skegg review and focus less on the elusive dream of continuing to eliminate a virus which simply continues to spread , regardless of restrictions , and much more on making sure that proper treatment is available to those becoming unwell as a result of catching it . <p> A separate report this week that New Zealand has the second lowest number of intensive care beds per capita in the OECD , with only Mexico below it , shows how badly prepared we are on that score and where our future focus needs to be . <p> It smacks of gross irresponsibility that boosting intensive care capacity to cope with Covid-19 cases has received so little consideration from a supposedly caring government over the last eighteen months . Bluntly , the hundreds of troops currently being used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better utilised building temporary field hospitals to boost intensive care capacity . This is especially so since it now appears that lack of intensive care capacity is the real reason why the government is so reluctant to open the country 's borders . <p> Latest developments in the evidence-based approach the government says that it is relying upon strongly suggest our current response is now out of step with international reality . <p> The challenge for the government is whether it will continue to cling to the elimination strategy other countries have abandoned , or whether it is sufficiently adept to refresh its approach in line with the latest evidence now being amassed in the rest of the world . <p> Peter Dunne was a Minister of the Crown under the Labour and National-led governments from November 1999 to September 2017 .

@@33135234 <p> Sometimes , when I wake up , I hear voices yelling at me in a language I 've never heard . When I go to sleep , I sometimes hear a loud buzzing inside my skull , or crashing and banging in the hallway , or see a massive flash of light . Investigations have shown all of these are in my head . As I slip in and out of sleep , my dreams are projected onto the real world . <p> If you want to get technical , it 's called hypnagogia ( hallucinations while going to sleep ) and hypnopompia ( hallucinations while waking up ) . Halfway between the two is something much scarier : sleep paralysis . <p> I 've heard things since I was 14 or so , but the full paralysis experience did n't kick off until my early 20s . I woke up in the middle of the night , frozen in place , staring into an abyss that stared right back with glowing red eyes . Long arms coalesced out of the shadows next to it , and it glided closer . I tried to scream but all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounded like " ih ! " I managed to move my fingers , and the monster disappeared . <p> Since that first experience I 've seen a tall ghoul in a top hat , a crouched figure with trembling hands , a giant spider , and aliens . Usually it 's your common or garden shadow people . <p> Beware a visit from the Slenderman . Photo : Youtube ( additional design by Toby Morris ) <p> Once upon a time , people with sleep paralysis were visited by cackling witches and their ghostly horses ; today , we have a wealth of horrors to draw on . Dr Karyn O'Keeffe , a sleep physiologist at Massey University , says sleep paralysis hallucinations are limited by your understanding of the world and whatever is in the zeitgeist at the time . <p> " Many cultures around the world have stories that really sound like sleep paralysis . People visiting them in the night , strange beings , paranormal phenomena , a feeling of pressure on your chest , " she says . " A lot of historians have thought that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Around 8% of the population experience sleep paralysis , says O'Keeffe , but it 's hard to get a clear number . There 's not a lot of research into the condition , and it 's possible people who experience paralysis do n't report it ; they might just think they 've been abducted by aliens . The only demographics we know are more likely to get it are students , psychiatric patients and narcoleptics . <p> For those of you who 've never known the joys of being trapped between the real world and the dream world , here 's what happens . There are two types of sleep , REM and non-REM . REM sleep is most commonly associated with vivid dreaming , and when we enter a REM state our bodies completely lose muscle tension . <p> " We 're effectively paralysed , probably so we ca n't live out our dreams and hurt ourselves or other people , " O'Keeffe says . " What happens with sleep paralysis , it seems , is the mind becomes awake . Muscle paralysis is still in effect , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've come out of sleep , but not fully . " If you 're lucky it only stays that way for seconds . Some people have reported being stuck for 20 minutes , but most events are around the six-minute mark . <p> It sounds scary , but it 's the breathing that really gets me . I did n't realise the value of neck flexibility until I started spending my nights stuck breathing in very slightly less air than I 'd like , because my head was very slightly off-centre . I know the demons are n't real , but the fear of suffocation is . <p> Despite being projections of my own half-sunk mind , those demons sure look ( and occasionally feel ) real . There are three major types of sleep paralysis hallucination : intruder , incubus , and out-of-body . The intruder is the most common kind . You sense a presence in the room , usually an evil one . I see a humanoid figure coalesce out of shadows , and move slowly closer and closer . Others might see a little green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some people just see a normal human , watching through the window . Yes , they can touch you . <p> Then there 's the incubus -- another term for chest pressure hallucinations . Sleep paralysis can make it feel hard to breathe , as though there 's a weight on your chest . The hallucination will be of something on your chest : a witch , a wild dog , or , more obviously , an incubus . The term " nightmare " comes from this kind of hallucination ; " m ? re " is an Old English word for a demon or evil spirit . A m ? re would visit in the night and sit on people 's ribcages , tormenting them . <p> The last kind of paralysis hallucination is probably the best one : vestibular-motor hallucinations are basically out-of-body experiences . These seem to be a little more rare , but people who experience them generally like them because they offer more control over what you 're seeing . <p> But why do we see these creepy things in our rooms if our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no solid explanation as to why it happens , but can make an educated guess . " It 's probably to do with the fact the REM system in the brain has n't fully turned off , " she says . " It 's kind of like you end up in a hybrid sleep state . " <p> There is one thing she is certain of : no-one 's ever died of sleep paralysis . " I do n't think there have been any reports of people having adverse consequences , apart from being incredibly fearful , " says O'Keeffe . The way I 've described my experiences above seems matter-of-fact , but she 's right -- I just about piss myself every time . <p> If you suffer from sleep paralysis , there are ways you can make it manageable . I sleep with my forearm up on a pillow -- it takes minimal straining to wobble it off the pillow , and then I 'm free . Generally once one muscle moves , the rest follow . You will not be able to flex your arm very hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of mine sleeps with his arm on a bedside table for the same reason . Many people focus on wiggling their fingers and toes . <p> Of course , the best position to sleep in is one that keeps you out of the shadow realm altogether : do not sleep on your back . I know doctors and dermatologists recommend it , but nightly paranormal visitations could give you as many wrinkles as cramming your face into a pillow . O'Keeffe also recommends good " sleep hygiene " -- going to bed at regular hours and staying away from substances like caffeine and alcohol that might disturb your sleep . <p> At least you do n't need to worry about disturbing others with your waking nightmare , because you ca n't thrash or yell . In sleep paralysis , no-one can hear you scream -- kind of . Years ago , when my sister and I had adjoining rooms , she would complain she could hear me farting at night .

@@33144230 <h> Covid modeller : ' We 're dealing with a large cluster ' <p> A Covid-19 modeller says he is reasonably confident that New Zealand 's strict level 4 lockdown will be able to control an outbreak of the Delta variant but warns that Auckland is likely to be in lockdown for longer than seven days . <p> Health authorities announced three new cases last night , taking the total number of active community cases to 10 , and new cases from overnight have not yet been announced . <p> One of the most recently confirmed cases in Auckland is suspected to have been infectious more than two weeks ago . <p> Shaun Hendy said there could be about 100 Covid-19 cases in the community . Photo : Shaun Hendy <p> There are now at least 68 locations of interest across Auckland and Coromandel . <p> Professor Shaun Hendy , a Covid-19 modeller at the University of Auckland , said the models suggest that there could be about 100 cases out in the community although there is still much uncertainty and new information may change that outlook . <p> " Obviously that case that was discovered yesterday from several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cluster and the models suggest that around about 100 cases might be out there . " <p> Hendy said current information shows that the decision to move very swiftly into level 4 lockdown was the right one and it will have considerably cut the opportunity for the virus to spread . <p> He said with a cluster all of the case numbers are not seen at once and the daily case numbers of Covid-19 are telling us about the transmission that took place last week . <p> " So over the next few days , as we find more cases , we 're really starting to just tick off maybe the 100 cases that are out there , but the transmission rates will have come right down . " <p> Hendy said over the next week people need to look at whether there has been any spread of Covid-19 to essential services , many of which are still operating . <p> " What would be really unfortunate is if we did start to get spread in people who still have to be out and about but hopefully we 've dodged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down next week . " <p> Hendy said he is reasonably confident that alert level 4 in New Zealand is stringent enough to control a Delta outbreak and knowledge about how Delta spreads can be used to make level 4 more effective . <p> " We know that the primary root is airborne transmission , aerosol transmission , and so that means measures such as more widespread mask use and better social distancing should work very well this time around . " <p> He said one thing New Zealand could make better use of is more rapid Covid-19 tests and although they are not as accurate as the nasal tests that have been used here , they can be done more frequently and the results come back faster . <p> " That 's something we could be looking at for our essential services , certainly our border , once we get this under control , to stop that transmission before it gets into networks of people who are still out there and still having to work together . " <h> Auckland lockdown likely to be longer than seven days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Auckland is going to be longer seven days . <p> " We 're probably not looking at a situation where we 're going to be able to quickly contain and eliminate this cluster , this is going to take probably a couple of weeks . " <p> But he said in terms of the rest of the country , it will be necessary to wait and see . <p> " We 'll be getting the wastewater tests from around the country , and you know obviously people in a lot of other parts of the country , people who 've been in Auckland maybe been in those locations of interest will be getting tests over the next few days and so we 'll get more information about what 's going to happen in the rest of the country soon . <p> " However I think at this stage in Auckland I think it 's pretty clear we 're going to have a longer lockdown than the initial seven days .

If we half-arse it as a country we get stuck in limbo like NSW until the vaccines are rolled out . <p> Sounds like the right ballpark . So several thousand dead New Zealanders if it really let rip here - perhaps 5-10 years worth of road deaths .

In my department we did n't defer any time-critical treatment but did defer patients who were unlikely to be harmed by the wait . We 've cancelled no treatments this week as we moved to level 4 . There are probably impacts earlier in the line from delayed diagnostics , though . No idea about suicide or domestic violence stats - have you seen any ?

We will be locked down and the rest of the world would have changed their expectations . Skegg is smoking crack if he thinks international elimination of Covid was possible . Go to Delhi Skegg .

Or are kids still trundling off to school as per normal ... ? <p> Are our ( mainly unvaccinated ) live cases now in icu ? or taking a dispirin in isolation ? is there any journalism left here ? <p> You 're probably aware deaths lag cases by a couple of weeks , or at least that was the case with ' classic ' covid and I assume delta is similar . Deaths are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aussies dying each day at the moment , about 60 in this outbreak so far <p> You may also have noticed that 600 is not a particularly big number in a population the size of NSW , but the trend is relentlessly upwards at the moment . If they do n't get out of it one way or another it 'll be thousands , tens of thousands a day and more like dozens to hundreds of deaths per day . <p> If we can lock down sufficiently strongly we can avoid that fate until vaccines are more widely distributed . <p> Looks reasonably consistent with my estimates above - Fiji have had 400 deaths so far in the last couple of months and they 're certainly not done yet . Lets say they end up around 600 . Translating that to NZ 's population is a little over 3000 dead . <p> Again , worthy of a serious and hopefully short lockdown in my book . <p> Translate Fiji 's 20 deaths a day to NSW 's population and they would be losing 200 people per day - the lockdown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been abysmal , the government needs to accept that plan b of opening up after country has beenvaccinated , and living with Covid is the only option . This has been recognised by other countries . This government is all about control and making it up as it goes along . A bit like every other policy they have . <p> They are talking about partial border opening next year . That will be after we have very high vaccination rates . Of course that wo n't apply to the anti vaccer conspiracy theorists of course , but there 's no telling them anything because they doubt everything and yet know everything with surety at the same time . <p> The overall proportion of cases under investigation in each state and territory is relatively low , indicating that public health actions , including case identification and contact tracing , is occurring in a timely manner . <p> To date , more than 28,390,500 tests have been conducted nationally . Of those tests conducted , 0.1% have been positive . ' <p> Correct at present there is n't and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level sufficient to re-evaluate the status quo . But the fly in the ointment will still be those that are not vaccinated by either personal circumstances or choice and whether that percentage of people is likely to assume the virus in numbers sufficient to cause an influx of hospital admissions beyond what can be accommodated and in turn what risk that will pose to everyday hospital admissions and procedures . <p> Agreed , vaccines for everyone who wants it does n't take our risk down to zero . For me , I think it brings the risk to an acceptable level , perhaps with some minor restrictions to spread things out as needed . At that point the choice is between opening up or waiting for an improved vaccine or the world to rid itself of covid , both of which could add years to the timeline - I do n't think that 's practical . <p> We 're talking about the hypothetical opening up once vaccines are rolled out , do keep up . If vaccination rates are n't high enough , vaccines are n't 100% effect , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with very busy Hospitals as in parts of the US right now . <p> vaccines are nt 100% effective - do keep up sorry - " very busy hospitals " does n't pass peer review were they not " very busy " beforehand ? ... ground reports suggest the ( covid ) busyness is fallacy ( links not available under censorship guidelines ) will " leaky " vaccines make the problem ( better short term ) and far worse ( medium term ) ? who knows where the reality lies ... but the science appears like its fishing off a leaky schooner <p> Hard to know is n't it . If the nationwide lockdown from March 2020 had n't occurred NZ may well have had an overload of pandemic patients swamping hospitals . Heck even the White Island tragedy went close to that as far as ICUs . But because the lockdown did occur that factor ca n't be described and nor will it be if the policy of immediate lock downs continues on the emergence of covid cases in the community . If and when that lockdown policy ceases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be identified as valid or not . <p> Well aware vaccines are n't 100% effective , this is why I included it in my post . Yes , they are very busy now , imagine adding a few hundred or thousand needing treatment for covid into the mix . <p> I 'm not sure we agree on base truths - do you believe covid is real , spreads fast and causes illness and deaths ? <p> Profile posted a 0.15% IFR up thread which I did n't dispute - maybe it 's double or half that in NZ 's exact situation , who knows ? For each death there 'll be a number of other hospitalisations , shall we say 5 ? Here in Chch we serve a slightly smaller population than Fiji , so using their example we 'd see 10 deaths per day and 50 hospitalisations on top of what we have now - we do not have the beds for this . <p> It 's an interesting conundrum . Worthy of a quick theoretical experiment . <p> Q : Why do n't we want overloaded hospitals ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resources . Potentially leaving people with long term/ongoing health issues or worse case dying . <p> So , what exactly is the difference between a lockdown and the virus running rampant ? Both remove the resources , both cause ongoing issues , and have caused deaths . <p> I agree we do n't have the beds for masses , but we do n't have them now either . I agree we are saving some lives , but at the same time we are already condeming some to death . <p> When all this comes to an end and we look back with hindsight , I wonder if we would have done things differently . <p> There is a difference between turning away people who need a hospital bed right now and delaying routine treatments and diagnostics . At the very least , it feels very different to the person sending them away . <p> Tell that to a patient with an illness that is rapidly becoming terminal due to non treatment . I think the point made was a good one . We are basically ignoring the thousands who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It 's funny , you and profile and co talk about the hyped FEAR all the time , and yet it is your posts that scream fear more than most . Scared of vaccines , scared of lockdowns , scared of pharmaceutical companies , scared of govt interference ... while most people just get on with it , living with a bit of hope while accepting that there are no silver bullets or easy decisions . There are always trade-offs in everything . <p> I 'm young , health and vaccinated and have no elderly family in NZ , so no reason for fear on my part . I also happen to be a practicing Scientist working in healthcare . I 'm simply weighing up options and a short , sharp lockdown with a reasonable chance of wiping out covid once again seems way better than a drawn-out half arsed lockdown or letting rip and losing a few thousand people . Please point out my unscientific irrationalities specifically . <p> It is the weighing up that is half arsed . It simply ca n't be measured , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sham from start to finish , scientists that are simply not good enough . <p> OK , well I 'm an applied Scientist used to working in situations with incomplete information so this is fairly normal for me albeit on a much larger scale . Incomplete information does not mean there 's no role for Science , just that the error bars grow . <p> We would obviously all make different decisions . You probably would n't like mine . But we will never know what response was better ( Quantatively or qualitively ) you can only really measure , how happy you were with the chosen response . <p> My gut feel is that in 20-30 years humanity will look back and say , we went a bit OTT with that Covid thing . <p> You may well be right . I am generally happy with the NZ approach so far though . The initial strong lockdowns were needed because we did n't understand the disease - people were throwing around 1-2% fatality rates at that time which would have been devastating . Once we managed to eliminate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not as bad as we first though , it was less costly to maintain elimination than to let the disease in and have to deal with it . <p> We 'll have to change tack eventually , and I think that when vaccines have been given to anyone who wants them is the right time . <p> I agree with the initial lockdown ( I think it could have been stricter ) <p> But now , looking at everything I would just treat as endemic like the flu . Most people will come out of it just fine , a few will not . <p> My concern is that we have now set a precedent for future viruses . The whole concept of Zero deaths is simply fanciful . Build the underlying infrastructure to cater with health in general . Some will always get sick , and some will die , that is just nature . <p> Well consequentialism is n't science , so why are you trying to do it if you are a scientist ? For that reason alone I 'd say you fall short of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess you can call yourself what you like . <p> If scientists were intelligent enough they 'd have gone into engineering . Same sort of thinking required but less room for mistakes , so the bad ones get weeded out . In medical science you just bury your mistakes , and lots have been buried over the years . Or the world of finance also picks off the best minds of this type . <p> Why also the need to make a decision ? A whole personality trait in itself , this need for control . People can make their own decisions , and in fact the obesity epidemic says they already have and there is really bugger all you can do about that . So leave it alone . No one has ever given me a reason why I should have my civil liberties trashed for fat people . <p> My cousin , a philosopher , pointed out to me that science does n't require ethics . And also that if it was required for people to die to prove the scientist right they would kill people . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covid experience to show it is true . <p> Unfortunately not all of them are weeded out . Canterbury/Christchurch EQs offer due testament to that fact and if subsequently you had had to deal with some of that profession working for EQC and the insurers your confidence in that process would have taken quite a knock as well . <p> I can call myself a Scientist because of my Science degrees , my registration as a Scientist and my job title . Incidentally , one of those degrees minored in Philosophy . <p> Firstly , regarding decisions , you are calling for a world without public policy . Sometimes we are stronger as a cohesive body and decisions need to be made as a whole . The success of the first lockdown is a great example of this . On a smaller scale , if I do n't make decisions at work patients do n't get treated properly . <p> I ca n't speak for all of medical science , but in my area we have a very strong culture of reporting errors and improving from them , not burying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely small in a Medical context . We require some basic ethics - the goal of curing our patients and limiting the side-effects as we do so . <p> It 's a shame you have such a distorted view of Science . Most of us are decent people . <p> Lockdown is the way to go but only if its strictly followed . The issue will be the more lockdowns or the longer the lockdown the less effective it will be . If everyone did n't leave the house for weeks it would work for sure but even the exercising locally thing has problems . Never seen so many people out walking , running , cycling and dog walking in my life the other day in our road . <p> This is correct , they appear to be some people with far fetched opinions , most of the time not supported by evidence . The number of times I have seen them show selective data interpreted wrongly , falsified data etc ... it 's just not worth it . Frankly I am surprised they are allowed to continue , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> NZ has shown go-hard lock downs have worked for us . We can revisit that policy when we have a high vaccination rate . Until our vaccination rate is way up there , the government is doing what it should , as evidenced by the past . The vaccine changes the situation , but only when we are well vaccinated . <p> Israel is only 64% vaccinated , so lots of unvaccinated people . Vaccinated people can still catch and spread it , but they are much less likely to suffer severe effects and their spread rate is lower ( shorter infectious period ) . Everywhere around the world health professionals are reporting those that are n't vaccinated are worse affected . <p> For example , this is a great example of selectively interpreting data to suit a poorly thought out argument . This says nothing about the patient outcomes .

When I moved into the primary produce export sector in the early 1970s we used to fasten onto Norway as subject for research and analysis . Primitive sort of work in those pre computer internet days undoubtedly , but certainly not unhelpful . Lengthy bit of land , mountainous , same population , outdoors active people , good fisherman , forestry , venison , harsher winter and out side of the EEC . Most of that still exists . Prompted on this thought early this morning when a well spoken lady from Norway phoned in to talk back to explain the situation there . They have had approx 145000 cases 810 deaths are now living day to day with 56000 active cases , life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dose over 80% for the second . What have they got what we have n't got ? <p> Our dismal developed world vaccination penetration ranking status shows it can be done far better . Foxgloves post shows other small nations pulled it off . The Ardern government said we 'd receive priority but were not able to deliver on this promise . What evidence did they have for this or were they just making shit up ? <p> Maybe the opposite - since most Kiwis are not vaccinated we are taking this lockdown seriously . My son in Sydney since Easter says Aussies are not sensible - plenty of people in the street , etc . If we had say 80% vaccinated would there be complacency about distancing , mask wearing , keeping records of shopping and public transport ? <p> NZs dismally low use of the tracer app before this outbreak suggest that low vaccination rates do n't increase compliance . This despite most people being generally aware that NZ had escaped a contagion so far , in large part due to dumb luck . We got lucky with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ms Ardern explained how gullible Tauranga waterfront workers are susceptible to anti vax conspiracy theories leading to mass exposure on a covid carrying freighter . Again , by some miracle , it seems we dodged yet anther bullet there . <p> it started at the leadership of NSW. she has not taken the right steps from day one and is very reactive , now she has put most of australia and NZ into lockdown all from one case . i am amazed at how ( so far ) queensland has kept it out with the amount of traffic going across the border . as for NZ , many of us knew it was a matter of time it came across our border and those that work in those industries connected to the border prepared last week when the warning was issued <p> Your response is as intemperate as it is inaccurate . My age is beyond that of a boomer . At this age and stage of life a lockdown causes little change to my usual activities . My concern though in raising the Norway comparison is that here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertaining a lifestyle near enough to normal . Therefore if NZ had arrived at the same vaccination progress in the same time a lot of NZrs might too have the advantage of not having lockdowns suddenly arriving and interrupting employment and social activities and the overhanging threat associated with that almost on a daily basis.Obviously that would include those younger than the detested boomers as well . <p> Interesting thoughts . Very different cultural mindsight . No-nonsense competence and efficiency is central to the Scandanavian mindset . Also , their whole economy and society was never decimated by neo-liberalism . Community wellbeing remains a very high priority . <p> Yes on visits to Scandinavia , Baltic States there is a level of community self support , mature , progressive and born out of necessity . Has to be , the winters are extreme , deadly dangerous for a start . Think this social status is partly what Sweden based their strategy on plus they have , or may still have , an accurate nationwide tracking system of individual alcohol consumption , that would have been adapted one would think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open up and live with virus once we are 70% vaccinated . Or is it lockdown as soon as one case pops up even after we are vaccinated . If the later , then they should stop ALL flights from Oseas except cargo and medical and reduce MIQ to basically nothing and wait ten years to see what happens in rest of the world . I am hoping they have the sense and see you need to live with this and it ai nt ever going away . So get on and roll out some huge vaccination programmes in schools , large workplaces , big government organisations , at airports . <p> And 7 figure housing prices in Auckland central suburbs will start with a 2 for a 3 bed . Looking at suburbs such as Remuera ( lol ) semi-detached 3 bed will start with a 3 , stand alone house will start with a 4 . <p> I remember when the lottery was $1,000,000.00 ! ! Only a handy deposit on 3 bed now . <p> The US Fed released the minutes of their last meeting earlier today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But they are debating the timing and mechanics of easing back their stimulus policies . <p> No need , the pretence of competitiveness is surely no longer required given the evidence to the contrary without any interest from regulators . I will however get a laugh if the others in the cartel raise theirs in kind . <p> In addition to a series of bans or restrictions on Xinjiang cotton , tomatoes and polycrystalline silicon , the US Congress is expected to launch a tougher crackdown against the region by approving " legislation later this year that would prohibit imports of all products from Xinjiang unless the importer can prove their items are free of forced labor , " the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday . <p> Are they rolling out the wage subsidy again ... how many millions are the likes of Fletchers etc allowed to claim , even though these companies are posting huge profits . Its easy to show a 40% drop in revenue when no one is working . <p> Squatter 's rights to property ownership in the UK was either 12 or 20 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in PNG and I 've been told Maori too accept the right to ownership of land if the original owner has made no assertion of ownership for a prolonged period . I had an Irish colleague whose parents returned to Ireland simply because if they did n't live on their small holding they would lose ownership by Irish law . So the principle of squatters rights is widespread and accepted - all NZ has to do is make it 20 days not 20 years . All those empty houses would be occupied before October . <p> " RBNZ forecasts house prices will rise another 10% by mid-2022 , before falling 5% by late 2024 ; It says house prices ' appear to be above their sustainable level ' ; " <p> WHAT A STUPIDITY <p> RBNZ admits that house price is at unsustainable level and than say that it expects further 10% rise ...... WHAT ARE THEY DOING NOW IF THEY KNOW THAT WILL RISE FURTHER . <p> RBNZ expects house price to rise by 10% and than assures FHB that will fall by 5% ..... Really is it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one reads or listen to RBNZ , hard to understand except that he wants ponzi to continue . <p> He has been wrong most of the time as earlier said that house price will stabilise and now saying that price will rise by 10% but what if it goes up by 30% or 20% and than it falls by 5% . After massive rise of 70% to 100% even if the price falls by 5% what is he trying to say or unknowingly came out with his mindset . <p> China and Xi showing full authoritarian colour now and world barely noticing . Taiwan only a matter of time . Nov-Feb I would say . China looking to dev its own economic sphere of dec countries Is NZ going to have to accept it is one of them ? ? <p> Pfizer wo n't grant licenses to manufacture the vaccine so we are reliant on a single supplier . Our fragmented , decentralised health system has n't helped . The joys of the free market ! As my old dad used to say , it 's fine if you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allocation tool for areas of public need it 's not neutral or self-regulating at all . <p> Some interesting dynamics emerging . China and Russia to a slightly lesser degree , have been enhancing their relationships with the Taliban , well before the USA withdrawal was even announced . Some strategic ducks being lined up . Friends in Afghanistan , Iran , Syria , a very large territory virtually from the sub continent to the Mediterranean . Amongst that though is the problems both Russia and China have demonstrated in dealing with their muslim communities . Shifting sands indeed . In terms of CV19 reporting perhaps China has adopted Nth Korea 's model . Things have gone very quiet there too generally have n't they .

Additionally there may be people from places of interest in Auckland who have subsequently travelled to the South Island . <p> This is additional to the five cases reported previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage to seven , all which are being included in the national tally today . All cases are being transferred safely to an Auckland isolation facility , under strict infection prevention and control procedures , including the use of full PPE . <p> In addition , there are three new cases in returnees in managed isolation . <p> The two new community cases , a 21-year-old male and a 19-year-old female , both returned a positive test today ( 18 August ) . Both are located in Auckland . <p> These two cases are linked to the earlier reported community cases . Public health officials are conducting interviews to establish more details of how these new cases were infected and to determine further details of their movements . <p> Case A is now in a quarantine facility in Auckland . A subsequent test of case A has again returned a positive test result . <p> The wife of Case A , reported yesterday , and who is fully vaccinated , has again returned a negative test result . <p> Of the community cases reported to date , four were tested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identified as contacts . <p> Movements of the additional cases reported earlier today continue to be investigated . Investigations also continue at Auckland City Hospital , where one of the cases worked for four shifts during their infectious period . <p> The hospital last night activated plans to prevent the spread of the virus within the hospital . The DHB has stopped unnecessary movements between wards and is testing all staff and patients on the ward the staff member worked on . The DHB is also standing down , testing and isolating staff on the same ward . <p> The Ministry understands news this morning that one of the cases worked at Auckland City Hospital may create concern . <p> However , anyone who needs urgent medical care will be safe as safe in our hospitals now as they would be at any other time , including Auckland City Hospital . <p> While elective surgery and non-essential outpatient hospital appointments are currently postponed at hospitals around the country , anyone who needs urgent medical attention -- such as a medical emergency or going into labour -- should follow the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interactions with heathcare services may be virtual . <p> Dial 111 or attend a hospital emergency departments . Hospital staff are working and able to provide the care you need . They have measures in place to safely manage care at Alert Level 4 . <p> And as you would normally do , if you have a health issue that is n't an emergency , please call your GP or give Healthline a call on 0800 611 116 . <p> Pharmacies also remain open in Alert Level 4 . <p> Additional testing resources are being set-up across the country and people that are symptomatic , wherever they are in New Zealand , especially in the Auckland region and the Coromandel , or have been at a location of interest are urged to get tested . <p> The key message from the last lockdown remains relevant : ' stay at home , save lives , be tested . This will stop any undetected spread in the community . <p> Only leave your home if you need to , and please wear a mask when you do . <h> Contact tracing <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical work necessary to investigate community cases . <p> They are interviewing cases , identifying their contacts , tracing those contacts , and ensuring they 're in isolation and tested . Isolation , when in alert level 4 , means isolating themselves from other household members . <p> That work continues apace . <p> As at 11am Auckland Regional Public Health have 16 contacts identified . Of these 16 , 14 have been contacted . Two are in the process of being traced and contacted . One of the 14 contacts has tested positive and they are included in the case update provided earlier . <p> Two contacts have returned negative test results , and the other 13 are isolating and being tested . Of the 16 contacts , we know that four are fully vaccinated ; three have had one dose ; and the remainder are unvaccinated - reflecting the majority of these individuals would not yet have been offered vaccination due to not yet meeting the eligibility for vaccination . <p> These numbers are expected to grow . <p> Details of the locations of interest identified to date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update progressively as further locations of interest are identified . <p> The Ministry 's website will also include advice on what to do if you were at any of these locations at the time when you could potentially have been exposed . Text message alerts are currently being sent to people who scanned in using the COVID-19 Tracer App at locations during the relevant times . <p> Please call Healthline on 0800 358 5453 if you were potentially exposed and for advice on testing . <h> Whole Genome Sequencing <p> Initial whole genome sequencing run on a sample from Case A overnight has shown he has the Delta variant and there is a link to the New South Wales outbreak . <p> Further investigations have continued this morning and the Ministry is working closely with ESR to determine the source of these infections . <p> ESR is also examining cases who have recently arrived from New South Wales to determine if there is any possible link . <h> Wastewater <p> The results of wastewater samples taken at Rosedale on Auckland 's North Shore are expected today . Daily samples are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also increased the wastewater samples they are taking at other sites around Auckland . <p> Composite sampling of Whitianga and Coromandel Town is being set up today with further samples being taken in Coromandel at Pauanui , Tairua and Whangamata . Sampling at Thames will be underway tomorrow . <p> The first results from the samples can be expected on Friday . ESR is planning to take three samples over the next three consecutive days . <p> Wastewater testing is continuing at ESR 's other 26 sites across the country , including at its new sites announced on Monday which include Whangarei , Gisborne , Tauranga , Taupo , New Plymouth , Napier , Palmerston North , Nelson , Dunedin and Invercargill . <h> Testing <p> Please get tested if you visited a location of interest or have cold and flu symptoms . <p> All community testing centres in Auckland are continuing to operate extended hours today and will remain open until 8pm . <p> Four additional pop-up community testing centres have opened this morning in Devonport , St Lukes , Wairau Valley and Albany and will remain open into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Coromandel Township , including two pop-up testing sites , and additional testing centres are being rapidly stood up across the District . <p> Pop-up testing sites are open in Coromandel Township and Thames , and an additional testing centre has been stood up at Claudelands Event Centre in Hamilton . <p> Please call Healthline on 0800 358 5453 . And go to healthpoint.co.nz to find your local testing station , they will be updated during the day <p> We know that on the first day of testing it can take time for systems to be stood up and queues can be long . Please prepare to be in a queue for some time -- wear a mask , take food and water with you , take a book to read or something to watch and please be patient and kind . Everyone is doing their best at testing stations , but the first day always tends to be busy . <p> DHBs are working on additional testing capacity throughout the country . <p> The total number of COVID-19 tests processed by laboratories to date is 2,571,452 . <p> Yesterday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The seven-day rolling average is 5,162 . <h> Vaccination update <p> Yesterday ( 17 August ) a daily record of 55,688 doses were administered . This includes 35,499 first doses , and 20,189 second doses . <p> More than 2.61m doses of the COVID-19 vaccine have been administered to date ( to 11.59pm on 17 August ) . <p> Of these , 1.65m are first doses and 954,000 are second doses . <p> More than 143,000 M ? ori have received their first vaccination . Of these , more than 87,000 have also had their second vaccinations . <p> More than 96,000 doses have been administered to Pacific peoples . Of these , around 60,000 have also received their second doses . <p> All DHBs had plans in place to continue the vaccination roll-out during alert level 4 , and those are now being activated . Some vaccination in limited sites will restart this afternoon . <p> From 8am tomorrow the vaccination programme will resume throughout New Zealand . <p> This will look different - vaccination sites will be operating under alert level 4 conditions and that means in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through . That is to enable distancing . <p> If you are one of the bookings that we need to move to ensure we have a bit more space , you will receive notification . Otherwise , the message is simple . If you were booked for tomorrow and you have n't heard anything , please go . <p> The most part we are intending to continue our roll out as planned . That means continuing to open up age bands . From today , those who are aged 40 plus can visit bookmyvaccine.nz to make their bookings . <h> NZ COVID Tracer <p> NZ COVID Tracer now has 2,926,215 registered users . <p> Poster scans have reached 325,352,493 and users have created 13,012,921 manual diary entries . <p> Remember we welcome robust , respectful and insightful debate . We do n't welcome abusive or defamatory comments and will de-register those repeatedly making such comments . Our current comment policy is here . <p> No . It 's the neoliberal way . Covid is doing a great job of ruthlessly exposing the folly of New Zealand 's willingness to rely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previous 4 decades . As an economic philosophy , it 's on life support . <p> ? But tax funds the government to fund the public services , and you sound like the sort of person that wants to keep taxes low - or do I have that wrong ? What I do know it that you constantly spruik house prices without any apparent awareness of the social consequences . <p> The NZ Dollar is a sovereign currency that is issued by the government through its spending and taxpayers are not currency issuers they are only currency users . The government spends first and taxes back later . Taxation maintains the value of the currency , controlling the quantity on issue by deleting it through taxation . " Monetary sovereignty is the power of the state to exercise exclusive legal control over its currency , broadly defined , by exercise of the following powers : Legal tender -- the exclusive authority to designate the legal tender forms of payment . Issuance and retirement -- the exclusive authority to control the issuance and retirement of the legal tender " . https @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was n't it would only work for the US dollar because it is the reserve . If we want to buy oil we have to convert to USD . If we print loads of NZD then it will devalue against the USD . And the price of everything will go up . It 's still bollicks for the USD but it makes even less sense for a non reserve currency . <p> MMT is an accurate description of how sovereign currencies operate . If you think that taxpayers and bond holders create our currency then I suggest that you live in some far off land of make believe . I suppose that you do n't believe that banks create money as credit either . NZ runs current account deficits , how do you suppose that they are financed without more currency and where does the money come from for us to add to our savings ? They also require more currency . I suggest that you look up ' sectoral balances ' online . <p> Sorry to let you down , but I do n't think we can . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's why even there is one case , we will have to go through level 4 lockdown . If housing is getting worse and hospitals are still having understaff issue , more medical staffs will leave NZ , then we will have some serious crisis ahead . <p> I visited a friend in hospital last week and was shocked at how many beds were jammed in one large room . There was barely room to place a small chair between beds . It looked 3rd world . The nurses were lovely though ... how they put up with it I do n't know . I know for sure now I will avoid going into hospital like the plague . <p> Took me 6 months to get a spot at my local GP . They were n't accepting new patients , not even casual visits . They eventually hired a new doctor who came over from the UK . I was position 40 something of over 200 on the waiting list , this is in Masterton . <p> Some questions : 1 . What is the cost benefit analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a viable strategy with a leaky vaccine , animal reservoirs and C19 becoming endemic everywhere else ? 3 . Why do we need to lockdown now when the most at risk have been vaccinated ( mainly people over 65 ) ? 4 . Why do n't we leave primary doctors free to treat patient early with the various protocols now in place in many countries ? <p> yes , more young people get the disease and some end up in hospital and ICU but they do not die more from it as the CFR is lower for the delta variant . so there is no comparison possible with the Spanish flu . Again early treatment is the key for improve outcome in all age groups ( e.g. I-MASK+ ) . <p> I did n't say young people would die more . The reference to Spanish Flu deaths was because deaths are an excellent proxy for serious cases . In the linked article the physician said " sicker , longer , faster " to describe young people getting Delta . The Spanish Flu comparison holds because the immune response could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It is precisely the suppression of these broadly protective innate Abs that makes previously asymptomatically infected individuals more susceptible to disease . It is also precisely this phenomenon that explains why a first wave of a natural pandemic is followed by a second wave in younger age groups . <p> The even bigger amplitude of that second wave merely reflects the overwhelming contribution of a population 's innate immunity to its overall immune protective capacity . So , this is why we 're now seeing more and more disease in younger age groups , and even children , although they were perfectly protected during previous waves . Extending mass vaccination campaigns to these younger age groups is the most irresponsible public health proposal ( decision ? ) ever as <p> Spanish flu comparison does not hold at all . You need another 215 million odd dead to get to the mid range figure of the Spanish flu , in todays numbers . I mean covid figures have been massaged like crazy , but I think they would struggle to get it to 200 million . And like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could talk about cytokine storms , sure , but that 's not unique to the Spanish flu . <p> oh so lets vaccinate them last then .. oh we are . Lets be honest this vaccine roll out is a disgrace . Why are there not nurses etc going around all schools on a 8 week rotation to get people jabbed , why are large workplaces not allowed to vaccinate ( i know we asked and they said no ) ... it is a cluster .. typical of this government . Hope in 2 years they pay the price . <p> Stop comparing this to the Spanish Flu . Mid range estimate for the Spanish flu deaths is 50 000 000 . Population at the time was 1.8 billion . That is 1 in every 36 people on the planet dying . To get that to todays numbers we would need 219 million covid deaths . And those were all ages it killed pretty much indiscriminately . There is n't a debate at that level . We all agree it 's a devastating pandemic . And society , very understandably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's more the delta variant may not be much more deadly . It may be more infectious though measuring infectivity is tricky because of asymptomatics and even the sick do not always get tested / counted . So perhaps it is perhaps it is n't . It would n't be the first time something has been blown out of proportion with this mess . However it 's easier to calculate the mortality rate as it 's a bit harder to miss dead people ( although what counts as a covid death has also been seriously contorted ) . This public health england briefing is from a couple of months ago but the sample size is decent , and given the english definition for a covid death is so loose ( any death within 28 days of a covid positive test is a covid death ) it will likely lean towards over estimation if anything . It puts mortality rate at 0.1% which is bang on seasonal flu ( maybe , we do n't really measure seasonal flu very well either ) https : **31;1503;TOOLONG . ... It does seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . However that mortality rate is at least 50% less than earlier strains which were around the 0.15% rangehttps : **34;1536;TOOLONG ... Which would seem to imply it 's of similar danger . Less deadly but more spready . This is not surprising as virus tend towards less virulence not more . Dead people do n't make good viral vectors . The sweet spot is a bit sick but not so much as to be bed ridden . A bit coughy and sneezy but still more or less able to go about your business spreading the virus . The Spanish Flu was an aberration . Of course that does not mean it can not happen again , but the delta strain does not look like it will be the second wave of the spanish flu . Calm down people . <p> Background in biology . Stayed interested in science . To be fair I have spent way to much time on this topic . I kind of despise how much time it 's sucked out of my life . Nevermind the time we have wasted on this as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car crash in slow motion . I find it hard to look away . I 've definitely lost a lot of faith in New Zealand , humanity generally and scientists ( although not science ) . But I have kids so I kind of feel like I have to make my opinions heard . I really do n't know what the hell we are giving them . But I want it on the record that I thought it was bs . I have all the frailties of any average human . What really gets to me is the arrogance shown by people like Wiles and Baker . So certain of something that far better credentialed scientists then them really struggle with . And the utter weakness of politicians . They just take the path of least resistance . I may well be wrong , lockdowns might work and so might masks and social distancing and all this other made up pseudo science . But the people who tell us these things " absolutely work " are lying and doing a grave disservice to science and humanity . The best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if they had to say ...... Instead they give us their completely dishonest " certainty " . And they supress debate which is a cornerstone of science and a free and open society . Siouxsie Wiles in particular has been actively anti-science in her personal attacks on people who have far more expertise than her . She can disagree that 's fine . But to personally attack scientists who by any measure are far , far more qualified than her is embarrassing . But hey she has bright red hair and so is easy to make into a cartoon . It appears that 's enough to be the go to expert nowadays . <p> Well said . So perhaps there is a bigger agenda to the narrative being spun . Cui bono ? Klaus Schwab is quite the social engineer - " You 'll own nothing and be happy " . And our own PM tells us not to talk to our neighbors and we will be your only source of truth . Little tells perhaps ? Ivermectin anyone ? <p> .... we 're gon na have to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority are able to be fully vaccinated the better ... got my first jab yesterday ... sadly , they no longer stick it in the butt ... shoulder injections only ... not much fun .... still got a sore spot there ... good news is , if the Gummster dies from Canolavirus , the arm will live on ... anyhoo , the medical research from England says to get the second jab 12 weeks after the first , not 3 weeks as suggested in NZ .... <p> Butt wud have bent and blocked the needle , daresay . You are dead right . The 12 week gap would have allowed a far greater number to have at least had one dose by now . Think they are modifying now accordingly . <p> it would be interested to know how many live-year we would have gained if we had invested those billons on more hospitals , better pay , conditions and training for nurses and doctors , campaigns on public education on metabolic health ? Maybe it is time to treat c19 as just another disease , nothing more nothing less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is ample evidence that elimination has resulted in a much healthier economy than those with suppression ( as an anecdote my friend in the UK has n't visited a hairdresser in a year and a half , but there is heaps of hard data ) . And if elimination is the strategy then hard and early is the way to give the best chance to ( a ) eliminate , and ( b ) keep the lockdown as short as possible . 2 . Yes . R0 under level 4 last year was estimated as under 0.5 so with Delta being twice as contagious should still have R0&lt;1 and therefore elimination has a good chance of working . We should revisit once sufficient vaccinated - but we are not there yet . 3 . Because it still has a significant kick for the under 65s . Just Google Long COVID . Personally I would n't want to risk my IQ dropping by 7 points after an ICU stay - not sure about you ? 4 . Because we have no natural immunity in our community unlike most other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and risk of severe consequences would quickly overwhelm our ( under resourced ) health system . <p> There is no cost/benifit . Only Covid related physical heath costs are considered . Mental health or other non covid19 related health costs get no consideration ( i.e postponing cancer scans ) as do the broader economic costs . Impacts on children are also completely ignored . <p> This might help answer some of your questions ; Norway 's National health chief just declared that the covid pandemic is over ( for Norway ) . They determined that covid is less dangerous than the flu with an IFR of 0.05% compared to seasonal flu 0.1% . They determined that covid is , and will remain endemic . As many predicted , New Zealand 's elimination strategy is a fool 's errand.https : **32;1572;TOOLONG ... In other news a science journal article from a few days ago has conclusively shown that naturally acquired immunity produces " Ultrapotent Antibodies " that are effective against the nasty covid variants .

I was booked for Friday .

Good chance our Level 4 works but depends on people sticking to the rules . <p> Exactly squishy . But we will only know what is tested . And travelled people still mingle and go to the supermarket . So , bottom line is can we measure and contain delta with the same tools as before ? Germans outflanked the static French defences in WW2 because of complacency and assumption . Guess time will tell . <p> ... the latest UMR political poll does suggest a significant swing against the government is underway ... <p> We will have to live with Covid-19 , elimination is not a permanent solution ... so , we 've improved from 126'th in the world to 118'th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ... but , this moribund government does appear to be slowly awaking from their Covid slumbers ... <p> Time to get a bit smarter , and use the natural barrier between the north and south island to prevent National lockdowns .

Lucky none of the affected Saturday nights test game . If they did , the smaller crowd may be a blessing . but all of a sudden , you have a super spreader event . <p> They need to hurry up and approve the vaccine for children .

Then it may be easier to track down other possible cases . <p> Amazing the focus on cases in MIQ when airline crews can now come into the country freely without having to isolate .

The Government has dropped the ball on vaccinations , ALL front line staff , border staff , airports , ports , hospital staff etc should ALL be vaccinated or NO JOB , human life is more important than human rights , whats the use of human rights when your DEAD , or after covid injured for life , lungs very weak etc . <p> Apparently people who are vaccinated still get it and pass it on . Some reports are saying the viral load in the vaccinated is much higher . You may be in more danger from a vaccinated person than an unvaccinated if you yourself are not vaccinated . I guess this should all help with gaining herd immunity . The death rate from COVID is now similar to the flu so I would n't get too worked up about it . <p> Would love to see your data for that claim because what I 've seen shows that only to be the case if fully vaccinated - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long COVID , which is very nasty and much more common that " long flu " . <p> This is what happens when the government sets different sets of rules for different sets of people .

@@33147236 <p> With the arrival of the Delta variant of COVID-19 in New Zealand , a public health expert is becoming increasingly concerned not enough Maori and Pacific people have been vaccinated . <p> So far there have been nine confirmed cases in the latest outbreak , though that number is expected to rise rapidly in the next few days . The list of locations of potential exposure across Auckland and Coromandel is in the dozens , many large venues with hundreds of people , and the source of the outbreak has n't been found . <p> Collin Tukuitonga , associate dean Pacific and associate professor of public health at the University of Auckland told Newshub Maori and Pasifika are particularly at risk from Delta . In typical circumstances each infected person goes on to infect between six and nine others on average . Lockdowns help bring that number down , but many Maori and Pasifika work in essential services and in overcrowded housing . <p> " We 've known for many years Maori and Pacific folk are at increased risk , given the socio-economic conditions - particularly crowded housing ... and there 's much more higher prevalence of underlying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , which puts people at increased risk of infection , " Dr Tukuitonga told Newshub . <p> The Government 's first mass vaccination event held at the end of July was held in Manukau , and initially targeted at locals - but there was little uptake , so invitations ended up going out to people across the whole city . <p> Around 16,000 people got their first doses of the vaccine at the event , which after a bumpy first morning was ultimately hailed for its efficiency . But Dr Tukuitonga says the wrong people ended up getting most of the jabs . <p> " I thought the big mass vaccination event in Manukau was really ineffective . We had about 1000 Pacific people and just over 1000 Maori injected out of the 16,000 . <p> " The problem with that is you make worse the inequities that we 've seen - in other words , we were vaccinating lower-priority , lower-risk people ahead of Maori and Pacific people . <p> " That would be my single biggest disappointment - we should have been much further ahead with vaccinating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with people who say that we should be much further ahead overall , but particularly for Maori and Pasifika people . " <p> Ministry of Health data shows just 9 percent of Kiwis who 've had their second doses are Maori , despite Maori making up more than 16 percent of the population ( though Maori do have a younger population than Pakeha , and under-16s have n't been approved to receive the vaccine yet ) . Pasifika are also lagging , making up 6.2 percent of second doses behind their 7.4 percent share of the population ( but again , with the same caveat they are typically younger than Pakeha ) . <p> Aside from the elderly and their carers , Maori and Pasifika were n't given any special treatment in the vaccine rollout . <p> " We have been advocating for some weeks now that a targeted approach to Pacific people is needed - involve Pacific leaders , Pacific church leaders , community groups ... and to make the process a lot simpler , " said Dr Tukuitonga . <p> " We 're not actually vaccinating the priority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the community at risk . More effort , more options , more community engagement , better information flow and more readily available vaccination centres are what 's needed .

@@33157234 <h> Managing ewes when covers are low <p> Farmers facing poor feeding levels going into winter need to be planning and considering their options . <p> The dry in some regions of New Zealand has resulted in sheep farmers wondering how they will get through the coming winter and the impacts this may have one the number and weight of lambs weaned . Massey University 's Professor Paul Kenyon looks into the issue . <p> It is well established that poor feeding levels and thin ewes in late pregnancy and in lactation results in decreased colostrum and milk production , lighter lamb birth weights and reduced lamb vigour , brown fat levels and bonding behaviours between ewes and their lambs . <p> Combined , these result in lower lamb survival and lighter lambs at weaning . Therefore , farmers facing poor feeding levels going into winter need to be planning and considering their options . <p> Information is the key and this needs to be focused on feed availability and predicted ewe demand . Farmers need to determine , even if it 's just an estimate , current feeding covers and winter supplement reserves , including winter crops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ewe body condition , number of fetuses carried and indicators of early versus late lambing ewes , whether this is through mating harnesses or via pregnancy scanning . <p> The folllowing outlines what farmers may wish to consider during the early-and-mid-pregnancy period . <p> In early pregnancy ewes can be returned to maintenance feeding levels to allow pasture covers to recover - if it is still warm enough for growth . This can be achieved with allowances in the range of 1.2 to 1.5kg DM per day , depending on ewe size or by grazing down to approximately 700kg DM/ha . The group of ewes that farmers may wish to feed above maintenance levels are thin ewes to allow them to gain condition . This should be considered in a highly fecund flock , as most ewes will be carrying multiples , and it 's the thinnest 15 to 20% of ewes that likely have the biggest negative impact on overall ewe flock performance . <p> In late pregnancy , multiple bearing ewes can not eat enough herbage to meet their nutritional needs . They try to meet this demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the winter rotation before the majority of the flock , in a truck-and-trailer approach . It may be tempting for some farmers to offer good condition ewes slightly below maintenance levels , as a means of saving feed . However , farmers need to be careful with this approach if ewes ' loose excessive condition . <p> If mating harnesses have been used , ewes without tup marks should be sold to save feed . If covers are extremely low , farmers who traditionally breed hoggets should consider not breeding them this year . In mid pregnancy , farmers need to get their flock scanned obtaining information on dry , single- , twin- and triplet-bearing ewes and data on early or late lambing . This - combined with body condition - will allow for targeted feeding for the remainder of the pregnancy period . Farmers may be concerned about the cost of this information . However , Australian modelling has shown that if best practise feeding guidelines in pregnancy and lactation are followed , based on the previously mentioned scanning information , for every dollar spent up to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sold , saving feed . If pregnant ewes need to be sold , due to low pasture covers , there are three options to consider -- late lambing ewes , singleton bearing ewes or older ewes . Late lambing ewes will on average result in lighter lambs at weaning time , which are often less valuable . Singleton bearing ewes can never wean as much total lamb weaning weight , compared to a multiple bearing ewe that successfully rears more than one lamb . <p> Mid-pregnancy is the period to utilise winter crops such as brassicas as a means of ensuring ewes are well fed and to save pasture for later in pregnancy and in lactation . In the last few weeks of pregnancy , bulb-based brassicas can limit ewe intake due to their high-water content and should be avoided . <p> Post pregnancy scanning , if herbage levels are still below where they should be , the amount of feed individual ewes are offered in the mid-to-late-pregnancy period should be based on the hierarchy of need . <p> Ewes can be divided into four groups . Ewes that need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bearing ewes . Followed by better condition , first cycle multiple bearing ewes . Then the first cycle singletons -- and lastly -- all of the late lambing ewes . Remember these later lambing , second cycle ewes , which might be 20 to 25% of the ewe flock , are in an earlier pregnancy stage at scanning and therefore can be offered lower feeding levels and pushed a bit harder . Further for these ewes , their late pregnancy period will be in the early spring period , hopefully when pasture covers are rising and therefore , they can cope with being pushed a bit harder in winter . <p> Whether farmers have their pregnant ewes in two , three or four management nutritional groups in the winter rotation post scanning , should be based on feed availability . When covers are low holding the less demanding ewe groups back and focusing any spare feed on first cycle , multiple bearing ewes -- especially thin ones -- is the optimal approach when using targeted feeding . <p> Better condition multiple bearing ewes and singleton bearing ewes can be offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly lower post grazing covers . However , during the last three ewes of pregnancy , post grazing covers and allowances will need to be increased further . <p> It is also important in the mid-to-late-pregnancy period that farmers consider the order of paddock grazing for their winter rotation . They need to ensure those paddocks that are best for lamb survival and growth are grazed easiest in the rotation . This means these paddocks have the longest time to regain covers prior to set stocking and have multiple bearing ewes in them for lactation performing at a high level . <h> More like this <p> Farmers and growers affected by drought or floods in Marlborough , Tasman , West Coast , Canterbury , Otago and the Chatham Islands will have access to Rural Assistance Payments ( RAPs ) , Social Development and Employment Minister Carmel Sepuloni has announced . <p> Farmers in Hawke 's Bay have now experienced two successive years of bad droughts , which has stretched their farm management skills to the limit .

@@33160232 <p> by Lindsay Shelton One of the things we 've learnt from Wellington 's annual film festival , which ends tonight , is that New Zealand film-makers are continuing to make films in spite of continuing to have trouble finding the money . <p> The local industry is now in the fourth decade of its resurgence , with a proud record of achievement . But local filmmakers are continuing to work as things were at the start -- refusing to be stopped though the system does n't provide enough financing . <p> Almost all the 12 New Zealand features selected by this year 's film festival had some finance from the Film Commission or from television funds . But for almost all of them this finance was a minor part of their budgets . Which required their creators to work for little or nothing in order to complete the dreams which have been entertaining and informing the rest of us . <p> I thought of this today when Fergus Barrowman was tweeting from a screen industry conference in Auckland . At first he referred to " cinematic vision on a shoestring . " And , later : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But young film-makers with growing ambitions can not survive for long on micro-budgets , or on shoestrings . <p> A film festival highlight was the premiere of a magnificently-restored and re-edited version of Geoff Murphy 's Utu , which was made 30 years ago with a budget of $3m . ( The restoration was carried out with admirable participation by the miracle-workers at Peter Jackson 's Park Road Post Production . ) The film tells a spectacular story of revenge , set in the time of the 1860s land wars . Geoff and his cinematographer Graham Cowley ( who was producer on the restored version ) told a panel at the film festival that it would cost $30m to make a similar film these days . And such a budget could not be found , unless changes to the story and to the casting -- " name " stars from overseas -- were made to suit international audiences . Which means that such historically-important local stories have no hope of being made any more . ( Vincent Ward 's River Queen was the last one , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And problems thereby ensued . ) <p> It was a National Government which set up the Film Commission in 1979 , Investment from the Commission made local production possible . But the focus of the current government seems to be on encouraging other country 's productions . <p> This was particularly highlighted when during the festival the government announced a screen-financing review which moved more support into the area of international film-making , leaving the locals as the poor relatives . The government was embarrassingly clear about this when it announced the changes . <p> " We want more international screen productions to come to New Zealand and utilise our world-class expertise and scenery , " said Chris Finlayson . <p> " Attracting more TV production and investment in New Zealand will boost the economy and provide greater continuity of work for Kiwis and their families , " said Stephen Joyce . <p> The emphasis on enticing productions from other countries to come to New Zealand is nowhere clearer than in the description of new assistance for television productions : <p> We are creating a new TV-specific production incentive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( previous $15 million ) and a rebate rate of 15 per cent on all qualifying expenditure . This reflects the TV production business model and will allow for studios producing television series pilot episodes , made-for-TV movies and mini-series to apply for the grant . Local TV productions will also be eligible for funding . <p> New Zealand production is relegated to one last sentence , tacked on at the end . Local stories ? Only an afterthought . <p> Utu earned applause from its film festival audiences . As did the brave documentary by Annie Goldson and Kay Ellmers about New Zealand 's involvement with the war in Afghanistan . These two film-makers also worked with a budget that in no way covered all their costs . This was a fact of life in the 1980s , and it 's still a fact of life for New Zealand stories on film , in spite of the fact that the industry has grown enormously , thanks to the international successes of Peter Jackson and his top-grossing feature films . Sir Peter is wellknown for his generosity in enabling local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has set an admirable example of showing that you do n't have to leave home to achieve world-wide success . <p> But many of the local filmmakers at the film festival were talking about the impossible search for bigger budgets with which to tell more " big " local stories such as Utu , in order to compete with the " big " international productions that the government is so keen to attract here . Some were even harking back to the days of tax incentives -- which became reviled by politicians , but which briefly enabled some great films to be made . Including Utu . <p> Lindsay Shelton was director of the Wellington Film Festival from 1972 till 1980 .

Photo : NZ Herald <p> Somewhere in Auckland there is a woman who may be in medical or personal crisis . <p> And police are desperate to find her , and help her . <p> Sometime two weekends ago she gave birth to a baby girl but for some reason the woman discarded her newborn into a pile of recycling that was picked up by a truck and dumped at an Onehunga sorting plant . <p> More than 100 trucks delivered loads to the plant that day - from all across Tamaki Makaurau/Auckland - and if police did n't have their work cut out for them already , within 24 hours the country was plunged into a national lockdown . <p> Police say they are determined to find the woman who gave birth to the nameless baby girl , firstly to make sure she is safe but also so the abandoned infant can be laid to rest . <p> Detective Inspector Scott Beard told the Herald how frustrating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a morgue without any family , without any respect , without any love . <p> Police got the call the night of Monday , August 16 . <p> The baby 's body had been found by staff sorting recycling at Visy Recycling in Onehunga . <p> Officers raced to the scene , cordoned it off , started an intensive and arduous examination of the area where the baby was found . <p> Her body was later taken to the Auckland mortuary and a post-mortem examination was done . <p> The pathologist was able to confirm the baby had been carried to full term . <p> But that is about all . <p> Her cause of death and ethnicity are yet to be established . <p> " At this stage we are not 100 per cent sure whether she was stillborn or otherwise , " said Beard . <p> " We are keeping an open mind - we do n't know her cause of death . " <p> Further testing - including toxicology - is being done and it may be some time before there are any answers . <p> However @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Investigators are keeping an open mind - and casting no judgment - on the woman . <p> " It may be a young person and there are cultural issues ... shame or embarrassment about being pregnant so has hidden it , " muses Beard . <p> " If it was a first pregnancy it 's likely the mother will have complications so that is a worry . <p> " It could be someone older who carried the pregnancy without anyone knowing . <p> " It 's just so sad that in this day and age ... someone can think that is the only option for them . " <p> Beard revealed that the next step in his team 's investigation was to work with forensic scientists on the baby 's DNA profile . <p> That could then be run through various databases available to authorities to see if either of her parents or family can be traced . <p> " That is a work in progress , " he said . <p> A blue plastic sack style carrier bag found near the body is being examined and detectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beard suggested earlier the baby may have even been inside the bag . <p> They are also looking at every load that came to the plant the day the baby was found . <p> " There were 100 trucks that came in that day from across Tamaki Makaurau , all three Auckland districts , " said Beard . <p> " So we are working out where all the trucks came from . " <p> He said it had been established the baby was born in the two days or so before she was found but police were no closer to finding out where or how that birth had happened . <p> On Friday last week clothing found near her little body was photographed and released to the public with an appeal for anyone who recognised items to contact police . <p> One of the items was a Christmas-themed green onesie with an image and caption of a " baby deer " . <p> In an odd twist , the investigation had earlier been dubbed Operation Deer - a random name generated from a police database . <p> " That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We had already named the operation before the clothing items were found . <p> " We have had a few people contact us about the clothes but nothing of significance .

" he wondered . <p> " But we totally get that Covid is the priority - that the safety of all New Zealander 's comes first . <p> " It 's just a bit more difficult . " <p> He said the case had affected his staff and he hoped that the baby 's mother could be found soon to help everyone get closure . <p> Detectives working on Operation Deer were trained and seasoned investigators but this was a unique case that had touched them all . <p> " It 's a different kind of case ... we can get adults hurting adults and someone dies , but when it 's a baby with no ability to care for themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect them ... <p> " Babies are just so vulnerable and they need their family .

@@33178238 <h> Free faecal liquid in horses : What factors are at play ? <p> The proportions of starch , sugar and protein eaten by horses appear to be a factor in the presence of free faecal liquid , research suggests . <p> Free faecal liquid is characterised by the excretion of faeces in two phases -- one solid and one liquid -- which may cause dermatitis on the hindlegs . The liquids and solids may be passed together or separately . <p> The cause of the condition is not known , but results from previous studies indicate that feed ration composition and management factors may play important roles in its occurrence . <p> Researchers Katrin Lindroth , Jan-Erik Lindberg , Astrid Johansen and Cecilia M ? ller performed a study in which data on feed rations , feeding practices and management factors were compared between horses with free faecal liquid and those without it . <p> The researchers had one case and one control horse on each of 50 private farms in Sweden and Norway . The forage on each farm was sampled three times for analysis . <p> The comparisons showed that , collectively , the horses were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and were subject to similar management practices . <p> However , the horses with free faecal liquid were fed higher proportions of concentrates in their diet and lower average amounts of straw and lucerne compared to the control horses , who did not discharge free faecal liquid . <p> " Case horses were reported to be fed twice as much concentrate per 100 kilograms of bodyweight a day as control horses and had a higher daily intake of starch and water-soluble carbohydrates , " the authors reported in the journal Animals . <p> The horses affected by the condition also tended to have a lower daily intake of digestible crude protein and neutral detergent fibre compared to the control horses . <p> Overall , these differences were small but are of interest for further studies of factors causing free faecal liquid , the researchers said . <p> Discussing their work , the researchers noted that most of the case horses were reported to have an ideal body condition score . <p> A higher proportion of case horses compared to control horses tended to be kept as companion animals .

" But as fewer horses with free faecal liquid than control horses were in any training , it is possible that the presence of free faecal liquid is perceived by the horse owner as a hindrance to training . " <p> Overall , feeding practices and management factors , without factoring in the feed itself , were similar for horses with and without the condition . <p> " Case and control horses in each horse pair were kept on the same farm and subjected to the same general management and feeding practices , with only minor variations in these variables between case and control horses .

" <p> Here , several techniques for spicing up your sex life , according to experts . <h> How to Lay the Groundwork for Spicing Things Up <p> You might feel ready to dive into experimenting with new toys , positions , or something like role-playing but also find that you or your partner are grappling with underlying fear or hesitation . This is due to messaging that certain types of sexual play are not acceptable or are shameful , says Macadaan . That 's why it 's important to first reflect on and get in touch with what you learned around this in order to bolster openness around sex , she explains . <p> " It 's also really important to talk openly with your partner about what you are each comfortable with , " she adds .

" <h> Techniques to Turn Up the Heat <p> It 's easy to feel overwhelmed by the many ways you might be able to switch up your between-the-sheets routine , but Kate Balestrieri , Psy.D. , sex and intimacy therapist and founder of Modern Intimacy suggests thinking of it as simply adding a new or less frequently included dimension to your sexual repertoire . " This could be a mindset , a position , an accessory , fantasy , etc. , " she notes . <p> A few steps to consider taking when you 're first getting started : <p> Get academic . <p> Balestrieri recommends checking out the sexual education site OMGyes , whether you 're solo or partnered . " It 's a great resource for vulva owners or the people who are intimate with them , " she says . " Their science-backed research on pleasure offers tons of new ways to play . " <p> Even if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell your partner about a fantasy you 've had . " Giving your partner access to your hidden , sexual thoughts can feel vulnerable and sexy to both of you , " says Moali . " Through this , you may also be able to open the door to exploring shared sexual interests . " <p> Along the same track : Read erotica and listen to steamy podcasts or stories ( an app to try : Dipsea ) . <p> Get creative with toys . <p> When you think about sex toys , dildos and vibrators are likely the first examples to pop into your mind . But there are a variety of toys that can be used all over the body to crank up the intensity and fun of foreplay -- during partnered or solo sex . Balestrieri recommends the following : <p> TheTrojan Ultra Touch Fingertip Vibrator : " This one 's unique in that it allows you to use your own hand to touch , but changes the sensations you or your partner receives , making it great for nipple , clitoral , or other erogenous zone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy Jane : " An amazing start for prostate stimulation , this toy gives you access to the P-spot through stimulating the perineum or the anus . " <p> If you want to get more hands-on with toy selection , Amy Baldwin , sex educator , sex and relationship coach , and co-host of the Shameless Sex Podcast recommends going on a date to your local sex toy shop -- solo or with your S.O . " Walk around the shop and check out all of the toys that are available to you , " she advises . " The best sex-positive shops will have knowledgeable employees who can tell you more about each toy while providing specific recommendations based on your preferences . " <p> You can then add the toys you find to one of three lists labeled , " yes , " " no , " and maybe . " " Some toys might be a strong yes while others might be a strong no , and that 's for you to decide , " says Baldwin . From there , you can start out with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexually-charged communication , Vrangalova recommends trying any of the following if you want to get started with dirty talk : <p> Start by describing what you 're doing to each other , going to do to each other , and would like to do to each other . <p> Pick some names or honorifics you can use for each other ( slut , whore , boy , girl , daddy , sir , ma'am , etc . ) . <p> Recount a porn video you watched together . <p> Invite aggression to the party . <p> Sure , you might not be ready for full-blown Christian Grey-level activities , but moving from more vanilla to rougher play with a partner might appeal . " If you 're new to pain exchange during sex , you might try some light biting , pinching , or spanking before moving to more aggressive moves , " says Balestrieri . <p> However , a word of warning to bear in mind along the way : " Always get enthusiastic consent before you try something aggressive and check-in throughout to ensure your partner is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe word , so you both have a hard stop if anyone gets uncomfortable . Remember to engage in adequate aftercare after your aggressive sexual experience to help each other transition back to your everyday lives and to debrief . " <p> Vrangalova recommends setting up a weekly or bi-weekly or monthly -- whatever works with your schedules -- research and development play date . Every time , one of you can introduce a new toy , accessory , or sex act for you to both try to whatever extent you are both comfortable with . <p> As she notes , " Some things might work great , and you might incorporate them more regularly into your sex life ; others might not work out and you get to laugh about them . " And ultimately , openness and experimentation with the activities that did n't work out can elevate your overall pleasure . <p> The bottom-line , according to Macadaan : " It 's normal for sex to ebb and flow throughout a relationship , but if sex and intimacy decrease to the point of feeling disconnected , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that part of your life as a couple .

Internationally , he was the face of karate ; at home , one of Japan 's most beloved leading men . He has died aged 82 . <p> Shinichi Chiba was born Sadaho Maeda in Fukuoka , the third of five children . His father was a pilot for the Imperial Army ; his mother was a former athlete . Chiba shared his mother 's passion for track and field sports , winning the National Sports Festival of Japan during his third year of high school , before training for the Japanese Olympic Team . However , a debilitating hip injury , sustained while working a part-time construction job , would ultimately thwart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sport Science University , Chiba redirected his passions towards martial arts and trained under legendary karate master Masutatsu Oyama . <p> At the age of 21 , Chiba was scouted by Toei Studios , one of Japan 's premier film companies , and would appear as the lead in Invasion of the Neptune Men in 1961 . While most famous for the mocking it received on comedy film-review show Mystery Science Theatre 3000 , it nonetheless marked the start of a long career with Toei , under whom Chiba would star in more than 125 lead roles . <p> Chiba at the 2003 premiere of ' Kill Bill ' in Hollywood ( Getty ) <p> That same year Chiba also starred in Drifting Detective : Tragedy in Red Valley , the directorial debut of Kinji Fukasaku . It was under Fukasaku 's direction , Chiba would later state , that the actor formed " the skeletal bone structure " for his acting career . The two formed a long-lasting collaborative partnership that resulted in several of Chiba 's career highlights , such as Hiroshima Death Match ( 1973 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendship would last the length of both men 's careers and allowed Chiba to expand his scope beyond the martial arts genre , starring opposite Vic Morrow in Fukasaku 's space opera Message from Space ( 1978 ) , and alongside Glenn Ford and George Kennedy in the post-apocalyptic Virus ( 1980 ) . Notably , both films broke the record for most expensive film to be made in Japan at the time of their release . <p> By 1969 Chiba had established his own training school for martial artists with dreams of the big screen , while further establishing himself as an icon of Japanese cinema in the role of the titular Karate Kiba ( 1973 ) . However , it was with Shigehiro Ozawa 's The Street Fighter ( 1974 ) , the first US release to be rated " X " for violence , that Chiba earned his international breakthrough .

Unlike the character of Terry Tsurugi in The Street Fighter , this role notably allowed Chiba to showcase his considerable charisma and comedic skill to his western audience . <p> There is a prevailing tendency among Chiba 's biographers to overstress the fingerprint left on Chiba 's career by Tarantino ; such a narrow and distinctly western retrospective risks misrepresenting Chiba as a sort of grindhouse cult actor . By the turn of the Eighties , Chiba had thoroughly cemented his place as a legend of Japanese cinema , having starred in more than 100 feature films . Now approaching middle-age , Chiba successfully transitioned away from the intense action roles of his youth , while also establishing himself as a stunt director and fight choreographer . <p> He had also apprenticed two of Japan 's freshest and most enduring talents , Hiroyuki Sanada and Etsuko Shihomi . Chiba would later cast Sanada in the lead role of his own directorial debut , Yellow Fangs ( 1990 ) , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a man who resisted all typecasting , the result was not a martial arts film , but instead a horror/adventure about a historical 1915 bear attack . <p> Chiba 's first marriage was to actress Yoko Nogiwa , with whom he had co-starred in the detective series Key Hunter ( 1969-1973 ) . They had a daughter , the actress Juri Manase , before divorcing in 1994 . Chiba is also survived by his sons Mackenyu Arata and Gordon Maeda , who also both pursued careers in acting . <p> Sonny Chiba , actor and martial artist , born 22 January 1939 , died 19 August 2021 <h> Latest stories <p> Socceroos coach Graham Arnold has vowed to pick his strongest possible lineup for Tuesday 's World Cup qualifier against Group B minnows Vietnam.Winger Martin Boyle is a doubt for the clash after tweaking a hamstring in Friday 's impressive 3-0 win over China in Qatar but Arnold says otherwise his squad is fit and healthy for the clash in Hanoi . <p> A prominent statue of explorer Christopher Columbus on one of Mexico City 's principal avenues is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the capital 's mayor , Claudia Sheinbaum , says.The 19th-century bronze statue was taken down from the Paseo de la Reforma boulevard last year for restoration work ahead of an annual protest . <p> Tasmanian Liberal Premier Peter Gutwein has indicated the island state will maintain its hard border approach if necessary , counter to the federal government 's coronavirus reopening plan.Mr Gutwein described the plan , in which restrictions are eased when vaccination rates hit 70 and 80 per cent , as sensible based on modelling and advice . <p> Officers responding to the shooting of a violent criminal who attacked a police guard at a Queensland hospital did n't know which room he was in and had trouble accessing the building , a coroner has been told.Tyson Jessen , 28 , was wanted for armed robbery in Victoria when he was arrested on an extradition warrant in Queensland in November 2018 , an inquest was told on Monday . <p> A man has died at a fly-in fly-out copper and gold mine in South Australia.Mining company OZ Minerals and contractor Byrnecut said on Monday an underground mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday afternoon . <p> A report on the impact domestic and family violence has on workplaces shows Queensland businesses may be vulnerable if they do n't understand or adhere to their obligations.The Domestic and Family Violence as a Workplace Issue report was compiled by the Queensland Chamber of Commerce and Industry . <p> Josh Frydenberg says the Australian economy has proved to be remarkably resilient in the face of political tensions with China , the nation 's number one trading partner.In an online address on Monday , the treasurer likened China 's stance to last century 's Cold War , but with some key differences this time around . <p> The Western Bulldogs are confident their vaunted midfield is deep enough to cover the loss of Marcus Bontempelli if the club captain is ruled out of their AFL preliminary final against Port Adelaide.Scans have cleared Bontempelli of structural damage to the right knee he hurt in the last few minutes of the Bulldogs ' thrilling semi-final win over Brisbane . <p> More money , better performances , added pressure , vicious rumours , keyboard warriors -

Non- organic cotton on the other hand requires heavy use of pesticides and fertiliser for a substantial harvest .

@@33206240 <h> Equality , Equity &amp; The Great Race Of Life <p> THE WORD " EQUITY " is appearing more and more frequently in New Zealand 's political conversations . It is the new " go to " word for activists , journalists and , inevitably , politicians . It peppers political speeches , media releases , newspaper articles , television interviews and , naturally , it 's all over social media . <p> For many -- perhaps most -- people , the word ' equity " is a synonym for the word " equality " . And , to be fair , this is very often the way politicians expect the word to be understood . But the assumption that " equity " and " equality " mean roughly the same thing could not be more wrong . The difference between these two words is as important as the difference between " reform " and " revolution " . <p> Most New Zealanders believe in and expect to enjoy " equality of opportunity " . They recoil from the idea of people receiving preferential treatment . Everybody is expected to line-up straight behind the start-line before the starter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life . Very few people , however , expect the runners to cross the finish line at the same time . Most accept that in a contest someone comes first and someone last . A race in which everyone crosses the finish-line at exactly the same moment is not a race -- it 's a jack-up . <p> But " jacking-up " the race is precisely what the proponents of " equity " believe in . What they are seeking is not " equality of opportunity " , but " equality of outcome " . If there are people in the race who have had the advantage of professional coaching , then those denied that advantage need to be advanced several metres ahead of the start-line . If there are runners who have enjoyed excellent nutrition all their lives , then those who have been poorly nourished since childhood must be similarly advanced along the track . If there are competitors who , on account of their ethnicity , enjoy a greater measure of confidence in their ability to win the race than those whose ethnicity has accustomed them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advancement . Calculate these handicaps correctly and every runner should cross the finish-line simultaneously . Hey Presto ! -- Equality of Outcome ! <p> Except , of course , that 's not the way it would go -- not unless the people calculating the handicaps had guns . What sort of seasoned runners are going to consent to seeing others positioned so far ahead of themselves ? Rather than compete on such terms , many athletes would simply walk away from the contest altogether . Those awarded handicaps in the name of equity would then have to be reassessed and assigned a new handicap . How else could everybody be guaranteed to cross the line together ? Not that anyone would be there to applaud them when they did . If the outcome of a contest has already been thoroughly engineered , why would anyone turn up to see it ? Life is uncertain . So is sport . That 's why people watch . <p> The partisans of equity insist that their only goal is " fairness " : all they are seeking is a society in which everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " winners " and " losers " ; a society in which the very idea of some people being allowed to " succeed " while others " fail " is regarded as obscene . <p> " Team Equity " will always get a hearing in New Zealand , where " fairness " is celebrated as the Prince of Virtues . What they will not find so easy to sell , however , is the idea that fairness requires people to be treated differently . That 's because Kiwis understand " fairness " to mean everybody being treated the same . Just watch what happens to someone who tries to jump a queue in New Zealand , or is given more than others are getting . Those responsible will be told in no uncertain terms that while everyone is entitled to a " fair go " , that does not mean they 're entitled to receive special favours from people who do n't know the meaning of the words . <p> This is where the propensity of New Zealanders to treat equity and equality as synonyms leaves Team Equity facing an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the argument has shifted well beyond the generally accepted notion that the indigenous people and the beneficiaries of colonisation were guaranteed , and continue to receive , equal treatment . But , " Equal treatment " , in this context , can only mean that all the advantages accruing to the destroyers of Maori sovereignty must be left untouched , while the tangata whenua , stripped of their autonomy by " the imperial project " , are condemned to play a never-ending game of catch-up . Team Equity is demanding a solution considerably " fairer " than that . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> What that fairer solution might look like is set out in the He Puapua Report . Its authors have come up with a twenty-year plan to give effect to what they see as the promises of equity ( not equality ) embodied in Te Tiriti o Waitangi . Essentially , they see Maori and Non-Maori running in the same race , but on separate tracks , until such time as both sets of runners become genuinely competitive . And the handicap ? Well , that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribution of the New Zealand state 's fiscal resources , achieved by the construction of a new , and more equitable , te Tiriti-based constitution .

Its only possibility of success lies in selling equity as equality -- which was the great achievement of the First Labour Government . How did they do it ? Not by saying they were going to advance the interests of exploited working-class New Zealanders ahead of privileged middle-class New Zealanders , but by promising to build a nation in which everybody had the same access to a job , a home , universal public healthcare , and an education system which gave every citizen the best possible start in life .

It 's supposed to grow and improve as time passes , just like our ownership of a house does as we pay off the mortgage . A good analogy when we look at the lack of ownership of good housing for Maori . The He Puapua idea is good in that it gives those who feel excluded a chance to feel included and do things their way . I get that . There are a couple of issues I have that make me doubt it will happen . Firstly Chris talks of the difficulty of selling this idea to the rich pakeha but of course there are plenty of Maori that are doing ok , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Pakeha that will never own their own home in the current situation . Although we are talking large numbers of disenfranchised Maori , our social problems are not just racial . The other issue I have with the report is it will be hugely expensive . Parallel systems . Can we afford that when we could easily tax our wealthy a little more and wisely use that money to make all our systems fairer and more inclusive . As a comfortably retired pakeha my opinion might be canceled because I just do n't get it , but what I do get is that NZ has a very small population that can barely pay for its needs now let alone run an expensive social experiment with no guarantee of a successful outcome . In my opinion we do need to make our society more inclusive and part of that is improving our systems the other part improving the low wages . Just how we do that I 'm not sure . <p> BG . My thoughts are that the idea behind the report is that for the Maori and Pacifica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel included . There is a feel good factor I 'm sure . However as my comments went on to say I do n't see the report being implemented anyway . I 'm sure the Government would try to drip feed the idea eg. starting with our health system , but if you take the idea through all the ministries it would not only be inefficient but also unaffordable . <p> You are both missing the point that under the white system the brown communities are not getting their fair suck of the sav mates . It 's not working so something needs to change . It 's about freedom , understanding and control . And yes , there is enough money , the government is not run like some household budget . <p> lone Comet . You say we have enough money . We 're living off borrowed money now . So I say BS . We have n't enough money to run one system let alone two . We either run a system for the " brown communities " as you put it , and let the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is happy with . <p> Apparently instead of giving doctors and nurses a pay rise , they are putting in less qualified ' heath workers ' to do their jobs who for ever reason are unable to qualify higher , and paying them more instead . <p> Lowering of medical standards continue ! <p> Same for education in NZ . Now everyone is supposed to pay for an expensive degree . Whether you are in the trades or not . Whether you speak the language , have comprehension and capable of passing the course or not . Everyone is expected to pass . <p> Our previous system which had world class health workers , professionals and no shortages of trade workers who knew what they were doing , has been abandoned for the neoliberal ' equity ' . <p> Equity is not equality . <p> Equity means that someone who is unlikely to be qualified , are building your house and nursing your parents and the profits siphoned off to business interests . <p> Chris I googled EQUITY just for fun . Two definitions came up . 1 Fairness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the synonyms for ' value of shares ' interesting : ownership , rights , proprietorship . Is n't that what the whole thing is about ... ownership ? If so , what fair price on ' shares ' so those who seek ownership get what they want . Shares could be sold , or maybe should simply be assigned without purchase . Deciding who should have how many shares in what , that will be the big challenge for this country . It seems to me that your preferred system is that of the 1st Labour Govt -- nobody/everybody owns all the shares and everyone can universally access/enjoy dividends ( services ) as and when required . So why should we then have two health systems as proposed , instead of big universal one ? As for same access to the jobs , is there some sort of law these days that has changed that concept ? And as for education system giving every citizen the best possible start in life , I think in NZ it 's all there for the taking , there 's plenty education to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rich to pay for it all . But there are only so many ' rich ' to tax , so at some stage you may want to think about the govt trading for profit with other countries ( oil for example ) . Then there is the other worry -- the changing attitudes in NZ . Not everyone wants ' ownership ' in a prosperous NZ , not everyone sees value in education or striving hard to get ahead , or going after opportunities . After all , the system has been evolved so highly , that it 's now designed to carry all of us -- forever . It is so expensive now and gobbles up so much of that ' rich tax ' money , there 's hardly anything left for the good things your 1st Labour Govt set out to achieve . Did they set out for NZ to be a welfare state ? Maybe , but it does n't sound like it . <p> Your cartoon was missing the frame showing the standard neoliberal model , a 3m high concrete wall topped with razor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch for free ( with complementary food &amp; drink of course ) . <p> ' What that fairer solution might look like is set out in the He Puapua Report . Its authors have come up with a twenty-year plan to give effect to what they see as the promises of equity ( not equality ) embodied in Te Tiriti o Waitangi . ' <p> This is just more delusional nonsense on the path to extinction via collapse and starvation that has been delivered by people in privileged positions of power or influence who are actually ignorant fools ( or well-paid liars ) .. <p> There is no ' twenty years ' . <p> That has been very clear for a long time , and has been vividly emphasised by latest report on fossil fuels -which this mad society is 100% dependent on . <p> The vast majority of fossil fuel reserves owned today by countries and companies must remain in the ground if the climate crisis is to be ended , an analysis has found . <p> The research found 90% of coal and 60% of oil and gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a 50% chance of keeping global heating below 1.5C , the temperature beyond which the worst climate impacts hit . <p> The scientific study is the first such assessment and lays bare the huge disconnect between the Paris agreement 's climate goals and the expansion plans of the fossil fuel industry . The researchers described the situation as " absolutely desperate " . <p> Of course , even that commentary indicating we can no longer continue using fossil fuels is actually bullshit because even if we stopped using them today the effects of past emissions continue to overheat the Earth . <p> That said , we already know that insanity has become fully institutionalised and the crimals/clowns that set policy will advocate continued ' economic growth ' and other such bullshit that is completely detached from reality in a world that is well past peak oil and undergoing accelerating meltdown . <p> As I pointed out to my local council just a couple of months ago when challenging their bullshit about " Finding a Fair Way " , what could be more unfair that eliminating all prospects of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council refuses to accept reality ? <p> The same bullshit is delivered by the regional council , whose ' plans ' for the next 10 years include ' growth of population ' and expanded use of fossil fuels . <p> As I said , insanity has become fully institututonalised and the system is riddled with incompetent fools who have n't got any idea what they are talking about , and who refuse to do any research . <p> It is SO INTERESTING to live in these times of institutionalised lunacy . <p> As for equity and equality , well we are going to find out all about them in the next year or two , as the system collapses a but more . <p> Gail Tverberg , always on the ball but always guarded in her comments , points out that we are sliding down the energy curve right now , and its going to get a lot worse . <p> But ALL proper analysis get ignored ( of course0 by the clowns and criminals that constitute the political body , and they continue to make everything that matters worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> As CB has pointed out on numerous occasions , as I have , it 's the money system and the banks that are at the heart of most of our problems . <p> What could be more unfair or more inequitable than one sector of society being allowed to conjure money out of thin air and then charge interest on that money conjured out of thin air ? <p> What locks the current energy system is place is not the banks or the politicians but that the great majority of voters do n't want to give up the cheap and convenient energy in fossil fuels . It fuels our lifestyles very easily and cheaply . <p> No reduction in living standards or an increase in the cost of living is acceptable to the majority of adults . Also , the necessary changes will hit the poorest the hardest . <p> The political class knows this . And it does n't vote for career suicide . <p> Equity may be the new buzz word but its been around for a bit . I thought I knew what it meant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when tertiary education was all about widening participation the number of enrolments shot up hugely but for two groups , brown of skin , success eluded them . Measured in pass rates and course completions success for brown people was well lower than the average , in a few well-published instances , abysmally low . But in fairness , those cases were more a reflection of the providers than the students . The focus then shifted from putting bums on seats to achieving student success , both at Ministry and intuitional levels . In some high-stakes programmes institutions were accused of affirmative action by having a targeted quota but for those working at the front line achieving student success meant putting into place support for those who needed it . Resources were provided . At risk students were identified and high-achieving tuakana were identified who could provide good role models . And that experience and responsibly gave them more confidence too . It did n't work for all because success in a tertiary context is complex , not only what the institution can provide in terms of support and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abilities , but also the existence of a curriculum that attempts to affirm the prior knowledge and identities of others , and a host of outside factors that the institution has no control over . Intergenerational poverty and the need to work beyond what most students do , for instance . So student success is not straightforward and never guaranteed . <p> Did it work ? For some , very much so . Did pass rates improve ? In some cases , yes , in some cases no . But without the focus on equity , as I knew it , future opportunities may not have opened up for a good many . Selling it to most staff was not easy , I suspect a parallel to selling He Puapua to Pakeha New Zealand . <p> The ( slightly left leaning ) Brookings Institute in the USA studied the problems of poverty at length and concluded that a child born in a ghetto had to do three things in order to automatically gain entry into the middle class . Those three things were : <p> 1 . Finish high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit crime <p> I 'm sure it 's the same situation here . Unemployment is very low and companies are crying out for staff at all levels . A kid who kept his/her nose clean and left school with decent literacy and numeracy at just 16 would easily slot into a trade apprenticeship and within 5 years be earning more than his teacher . In ten years would be earning more than the school principle . <p> Nope . Andrew is doing the Ostrich thing again . If it 's " not so hard " then why did hundreds of thousand kiwis leave NZ ? Shit money , shit jobs , shit bosses , absolutely sfa prospect of advancement , ridiculous levels of competition , grind it out with old worn out equipment , the list of shit is endless . Piece of cake have a spoonful of cement . <p> Rather than highlighting the difference between the meaning of " equity " and " equality " as being stumbling blocks on the road to a more just society , we should instead compare " democracy " with " Democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As long as we allow Capitalism to rule the roost , as we do , and not require that its power be tempered by the principles of Democratic Socialism , neither " equity " or " equality ' will ever be achieved . <p> The only way the govt can get the recommendations of He Puapua past the NZ public is by repeatedly denying they are being implemented . And it can only achieve this with the active collaboration of the media . The mainstream media have reliably shouted down politicians -- most notably Collins and Seymour -- whenever they have questioned its implementation . A classic of the genre is this interview in May by Tova O'Brien of David Seymour ( which recalls the disastrous encounter between the BBC 's Cathy Newman and Jordan Peterson ) .

It has been a difficult decision to make according to Councillor Alf Filipaina , Chair of the Parks , Arts , Community and Events committee . <p> " We know how much Aucklanders love the events we put on . But we put their health and wellbeing first and given how contagious the delta strain is , we did n't want to run these events until we were more certain of the future levels and when events can be safely run .

@@33222236 <h> Intel Alder Lake explained : How it enables a new generation of PCs <p> Intel 's next PC microprocessor , Alder Lake , marks a radical change for Intel . Its first mainstream Core hybrid processor mixes " performance " and " efficiency " engines to deliver either performance or longer battery life when your PC needs it most . <p> According to Intel , Alder Lake is due " later this fall , " most likely as a 12th-gen Core chip . Intel will manufacture three versions of Alder Lake -- one for the desktop , and two more for laptops -- with up to 16 cores and 24 threads . Alder Lake will also mark Intel 's introduction of PCI Express 5 and DDR5 memory , executives said at its Intel Architecture Day Thursday . <p> Interestingly , Intel has co-designed with Microsoft a special thread scheduler , destined for Windows 11 , that will optimise performance . Desktop and laptop PCs with Alder Lake inside them should mix and match higher performance where it 's needed and offer longer battery life , as Intel continues to get better at assigning the right processor core for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should deliver 19 percent more performance than today 's 11th-gen " Rocket Lake " desktop chip . <p> The bottom line ? It 's probably fair to say that a major overhaul of the Intel Core PC is in the works for this fall . <p> Intel <p> A summary of Intel 's Alder Lake chip . Note that hyperthreading , a staple of most modern PC microprocessors , is available only on the performance cores . <h> What is Alder Lake ? <p> Alder Lake , Intel 's next-gen Core architecture , will ship this fall , inside desktop and mobile PCs . Intel will offer one two-chip socketed desktop processor , plus two mobile chips : one for mainstream PCs , and one for thin-and-lights and tablets . They 're all built on Intel 's newly-renamed Intel 7 process , from 9-watt tablets to 125-watt desktops . <p> Alder Lake configurations will look like this , below . ( Intel also uses the term " P-Cores " to describe performance cores , and " E-Cores " to describe the low-power efficiency cores . ) <p> Desktop : 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance cores , 8 efficiency cores <p> Ultramobile : 2 performance cores , 8 efficiency cores <p> When Intel first disclosed Alder Lake last August , we knew then it would n't be a traditional Intel processor . Inside are two types of processing cores : a " performance " core that will turn on for applications like games , and an " efficiency " core used for background tasks , like email syncing . <p> Arm has used this hybrid approach for many years , and the niche Intel Lakefield processor did as well . Neither excelled at performance . Raja Koduri , Intel 's senior vice president of its AXG group , sought to differentiate Alder Lake , calling it a " performance hybrid " -- think Ferrari SF90 Stradale rather than Toyota Prius . <p> Intel 's Alder Lake chips will be manufactured for three different classes of PCs . <p> Intel Architecture Day was for chip nerds . We 'd expect Intel Innovation , a show Intel will hold on October 27 as a replacement for the venerable Intel Developer Forum , to answer the questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake will run , the branding and model numbers , and how much these chips will cost . <h> Major changes coming with Alder Lake PCs <p> We already know of major changes affecting how Alder Lake PCs will be built , especially by DIY PC builders . For one , Alder Lake 's desktop processor will use an LGA1700 socket , an open secret that has surfaced as board makers and chip cooler makers design around the new chip . The larger LGA1700 socket replaces the standard LGA775 socket used for well over a decade in the PC space , which means you 'll need to buy a new motherboard and cooler if you 're building an Alder Lake PC . <p> Alder Lake also uses a hybrid physical memory interface that supports four different memory types : DDR4-3200 , LPDDR4x-4266 , and also the brand-new DDR5 technology and its DDR5-4800 and LPDDR5x modules . ( DDR5 , a new memory technology developed in 2017 , has been in the works for years , though it 's arrived a bit later than expected . ) Arik Gihon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake will be able to clock the memory speed up or down , saving power , in response to real-time heuristic analysis of the work being performed . Intel 's Alder Lake will offer you the option of buying new , hotter , more expensive DDR5 memory , but you should also have the option of reusing your older PC memory . <p> Just as your car 's engine is really a collection of individual parts , so are Intel 's " chips " becoming a collection of individual logic blocks packaged together in various ways . Gihon referred to them as " building blocks , " and showed off some of the unexpected differences between the desktop and the mobile chips . In the diagram below , for example , you can see that the desktop Alder Lake chip lacks Thunderbolt capabilities and has a smaller number of integrated graphics cores than the mobile Alder Lake chips do . <p> Intel <p> According to Daniel Rogers , the product manager for Alder Lake , the presence of fewer Xe EUs ( 32 , as opposed to 96 ) on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Note that Alder Lake supports up to four Thunderbolt 4 ports as well as Wi-Fi6e . <p> Finally , Intel 's Alder Lake will include Intel 's first support for PCI Express 5 , announced in 2019 . PCIe Gen 5 supports up to twice the bandwidth of PCIe 4 , or 64GBps across 16 lanes . That , of course , will be likely gobbled up by both graphics cards and SSDs . An early snapshot of the Alder Lake chipset shows it offering x16 PCIe Gen 5 for graphics cards and a x4 connection to PCIe Gen 4 , for SSDs . <p> Alder Lake 's overall performance remains somewhat of an open question . Remember that Intel 's first attempt at a hybrid processor architecture , Lakefield , came and went with reports of poor performance . We do have the first inkling of how Intel 's performance core will perform , however . <h> Intel 's new performance core <p> Intel 's " performance core " or " P-Core " is essentially the legacy of its Core chips , carried forward into Alder Lake . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Skylake , Rocket Lake -- but Intel has its own internal code names for just its CPU cores , too : the little-used " Sunny Cove " codename , for example . Officially , this is " Golden Cove , " but you 'll see it referred to merely as just a performance core . But , according to Intel 's Koduri , this is the core that 's designed for pure speed . <p> According to Yadi Goaz , the director of the Intel Core CPU architecture , the performance core was designed to step up in general single-threaded CPU performance , but also anticipate the needs of AI and other functions in laptops , desktops , and servers . Intel solved the latter problem with a new AI matrix engine coprocessor . It has a new smart power management controller , too . <p> Intel <p> An overview of Intel 's performance core within Alder Lake . <p> While Goaz delved deep into the intricacies of the design , there are a few broad takeways : the P-Core is essentially wider and deeper than before , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of code . The chip 's caches have been improved to better accommodate data misses . The performance core also integrates a new microcontroller that can examine the needs of applications in a microsecond , even faster than a millisecond . " The result is higher average frequency for any given application , " he said . <p> Goaz said Alder Lake 's performance core will offer a 19-percent improvement over the " Cypress Cove " core found in Rocket Lake , based on a variety of conventional , current benchmarks : Spec CPU 2017 , Sysmark 25 , PCMark 10 , and more . That comparison is based on running both chips at the same frequency , 3.3GHz . " This level of improvement is even greater than what we delivered with the Sunny Cove core over the Skylake core , " Goaz said . <p> Intel <p> This is how Intel views the performance of its performance core within Alder Lake . <p> For new applications , Intel developed a set of new instruction extensions , called Advanced Matrix Extensions , or AMX . AMX was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling points for hardware for the data center . <p> Why even develop desktop Alder Lake chips with efficiency cores , ? " You 're absolutely right -- battery life does n't matter in desktop , " said Stephen Robinson , a CPU architect and Intel fellow . " But the thermals do . Fans , cooling power -- at some point , you have a limit . " <p> And that 's why Intel designed its new efficiency cores . <h> Intel 's new efficiency core <p> The first thing you need to know about Intel 's efficiency core is that ... well , it 's a performance core , too , of a sort . Formerly named " Gracemont , " the Intel efficiency core is essentially a fourth-generation Atom chip that lacks the hyperthreading capabilities of the Intel performance core . " Our primary goal was to build the world 's most efficient X86 core , while still delivering more instructions per clock than Intel 's most prolific architecture to date , " Robinson said . <p> Intel <p> An overview of Intel 's efficiency core within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sixth-generation Intel " Skylake " chip , and Intel 's efficiency core apparently supersedes it in every way . Four of the E-Cores ( also manufactured in Intel 's Intel 7 process ) take up the die space of a single Skylake core . <p> The new E-Core also delivers 40 percent more performance than Skylake . If you put four E-Cores against a dual-Skylake system using four threads , you 'd still get 80 percent more performance with less power , Robinson said . " We exceed Skylake Core performance by consuming less power in a smaller footprint , " he added . <p> Intel <h> Intel Thread Director : how it all fits together <p> Intel 's Thread Director is a thread scheduler , a sort of traffic cop in the operating system , ensuring that high-priority operations are dealt with first , and making sure that a microprocessor is n't starved for data . Now , with Alder Lake , the question becomes : Which task goes first , and on which processor core type should it run ? <p> Intel <p> That 's the job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Windows 11 . Until now , apps running in the foreground ( such as the web browser you 're using to read this story ) were assigned the highest priority . <p> Thread Director goes a step further , analysing the performance needs of each thread , assigning them to the right type of core -- and then re-assigning them on the fly if new threads appear . Rajshree Chabukswar , the senior principal Intel engineer in charge of the effort , said Thread Director will manage common consumer tasks like gaming , gaming and streaming , productivity apps , and more . Because Intel Thread Director is running in hardware , not software , developers wo n't have to try to assign these priorities themselves . <p> Intel <p> Intel Thread Director can dynamically reallocate threads between the available performance and efficiency cores . Here , you see some high-priority ( dark green ) tasks running on the efficient cores , and some medium-priority tasks running on the performance cores . It 's up to Thread Director to reassign these . <p> Some questions remain . For one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Director support will be incorporated into the " upcoming Windows 11 release , " implying that Windows 11 should support Alder Lake at launch . But it 's still not clear whether Windows 10 will enjoy the same support . Chabukswar said there 's still " hybrid goodness " with Windows 10 , but added that Windows 11 will provide the ability to dynamically shift threads back and forth between performance and efficiency cores . It sounds like Windows 10 may lack that capability , making the combination of Windows 11 and Alder Lake that much more efficient . <p> " The ordering of thread scheduling and other things are taken care of in Windows 10 , " Chabukswar said . " Windows 11 takes it to the next level . " <p> Chabukswar also implied that Alder Lake will run differently on Windows 10 versus Windows 11 , but it might not be as straightforward as higher performance scores . Instead , she said a Windows 11 system with Thread Director enabled may be more efficient in bouncing tasks back and forth between the performance and efficiency cores . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks handed off to E-cores , will performance improve as the P-Cores are freed up ? Or will battery life lengthen ? It may all take some testing . <p> This week , Intel said nothing about Meteor Lake , the eventual successor to Alder Lake . It did , however , close out its Intel Architecture Day with a message from its new chief executive , Pat Gelsinger , reminding everyone to attend Intel Innovation on late October . Could this be a launch party for Intel 's Alder Lake laptops ? We hope so . <h> Featured <h> Slideshows <p> ?

@@33225235 <h> What you do n't know about working with AWS <p> August 27 , 2021 , was my last day at Amazon Web Services ( AWS ) . I spent two years there , most of it running the company 's open source marketing and strategy team . While ostensibly helping the world better understand the open source work AWS does , we actually spent most of our time inside AWS , helping product teams understand why and how to contribute to the relevant open source upstreams upon which their services might depend . The rest was spent outside the company , working with open source companies such as Confluent and Databricks to improve AWS partnerships with those companies . <p> Oh , and along the way , I helped put out dumpster fires that erupted when AWS was perceived to be doing " bad things " to open source companies and communities . <p> In my experience , much of the ire directed at AWS over open source is misplaced . No , it 's not that AWS is perfect , though the company remains one of the world 's biggest contributors to open source projects . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can see the data for yourself by running this code . ) Rather , it 's mostly an error in thinking of AWS as a monolithic entity with a common approach to open source . This is one of the primary myths about AWS that leads to misunderstanding , but there are more , as I 'll try to tackle here . Nothing I 'll write here is secret , though it 's almost as if Amazon hides it all in plain sight . <h> Two-pizza teams <p> Amazon Founder and former CEO Jeff Bezos instituted the " two-pizza rule " early in the company 's history : " We try to create teams that are no larger than can be fed by two pizzas . " This is a bit of an exaggeration , but the principle is religiously adhered to across AWS . Teams tend to be relatively small and , just as important , they are almost wholly autonomous . <p> What does this mean ? Well , it means that you might be right that service team X is n't currently contributing back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same is true of the other service teams ( more than 200 of them ) . The ElastiCache team , for example , employs one of the five maintainers of Redis . Other teams make significant contributions to Rust , Apache Lucene , Kubernetes , OpenTelemetry , etcd , Apache Iceberg , OpenJDK , GraphQL , and more . <p> Are there service teams who do n't yet work with open source upstreams ? Of course , just as there are at Microsoft , Google , Alibaba , etc . But while I worked for AWS , I saw this shifting . It 's a slow process precisely because Amazon almost never works by top-down fiat . If you want Amazon to contribute more , you need to focus on individual teams and , just as importantly , you need to speak Amazonian . <h> Yes , those LPs are real <p> By " speak Amazonian " I 'm referring to the language and thought process embedded in the company 's 16 Leadership Principles ( LPs ) . Before joining AWS I thought the LPs must be cheesy sloganeering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out they provide a common framework for more than one million Amazon employees to talk to each other and work together . They permeate virtually every discussion at AWS , including the famous " 6-pagers " that are used to raise ideas and decide operational plans . <p> When I joined AWS , I initially avoided using the LPs in discussions . It did n't go well . I 'd say , " We should contribute to project X because it 's the right thing to do ! " Blank stares . " We need to give engineers more time to contribute to project Y so we can influence the project 's direction . " Raised eyebrows . I was getting nowhere . <p> But then I tried framing my arguments with the LPs and things got much better . I started saying things like , " It 's hard to ' Obsess over Customers ' and deliver innovation with ' Frugality ' if we do n't ' Earn Trust ' with the communities we depend on by making code contributions . This also allows us to ' Insist on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better position to ' Deliver Results ' and support customers . " <p> Suddenly , people understood what I meant . It 's not that they were dense before ; rather , I needed to speak the language that calls out the principles that govern everything that is done at AWS ( and , indeed , all of Amazon ) . If you want to change behavior at AWS , you must frame the desired outcome using the LPs . My team became increasingly adept at doing this , and it 's paying off in ever-greater service team involvement in the projects upon which they depend . This is not to say there is n't room for improvement . <h> The spirit is willing <p> In my time at AWS , I never heard a single person disparage the importance of open source . Quite the contrary . I know it 's fun to caricature AWS as a bunch of evil henchmen intent on strip-mining open source , but I never encountered anyone that fit that description . Rather , when I 'd have disagreements with service team general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their business , our disagreements invariably came down to which LPs we weighed heaviest in a particular situation . <p> For example , " Customer Obsession " comes first for all Amazonians , but it can be read in different ways . I might view open source contributions as critical to obsessing over customers in the medium to long-term , but a service team general manager also must consider the near term , which might mean creating a private branch of code to ensure a company could rapidly fix bugs or deliver features customers were demanding . It 's also the case that although customers all seem to like and want open source , many value the operationalisation of that code even more ( something that Tim Bray pointed out years ago ) . <p> This means that ensuring a seamless customer experience in the short term can sometimes consume the engineers who might otherwise be contributing to the longer-term success of a given project . I 've seen this changing for the better at AWS but , again , there is no one-size-fits-all approach to open source in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means that LPs such as " Ownership , " " Invent and Simplify , " " Insist on the Highest Standards , " and " Deliver Results " can seemingly conflict with the desire to partner well with commercial stewards of open source projects . If a customer wants Apache Kafka made easier for them , the immediate response is to build a service that you can manage on their behalf , with as few moving parts or opportunities for failure as possible . Another response is to partner to ensure that seamless customer experience . Though AWS has perhaps historically found the first option easier to deliver , I 'm encouraged by all the success I saw with Confluent ( in the Kafka case ) , as well as other open source companies . <p> In this area and others , AWS still has a ways to go -- but then we all do . One of the things I 've loved most for more than 20 years in open source is just how much more we , as an industry ( and as individual people and companies ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one has cracked the code on the perfect way to build and run an open source project or business . We 're all still learning . <p> So let 's be patient with each other , and seek to understand why a person or company operates as it does , as I 've tried to do here for AWS . <h> Featured <h> Slideshows <p> ?

The current implementation of INetAddress relies on the OS in a blocking call . The plan is to make it pluggable . <p> The proposal is not being targeted to any specific version of standard Java as of September 9 . Without an SPI such as the one being proposed , applications will continue having to use workarounds .

And now they seem to have decided that the best way to do that is to emulate it . But their agenda betrays a profound lack of understanding of the unique challenge posed by China 's coupling of an authoritarian political regime with a dynamic market economy . <p> Millions of Chinese firms , including some of the world 's most innovative , are occasionally asked to serve the regime 's political objectives -- an unprecedented marriage of pioneering private companies and a Leninist one-party state . Western countries can not match it , and should not begin to try . But much of the US economic policy response to China is misdirected . <p> For example , the United States wants to curtail China 's support for state-owned firms , despite the overwhelming evidence that such assistance starves private Chinese businesses of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies such as Huawei and Alibaba , which produce goods that US consumers eagerly buy . It does not come from state-owned firms like aircraft manufacturer COMAC , which has never made a profit and , more important , has prevented the emergence of a private-sector Chinese equivalent of Boeing . <p> In fact , the private firms that now dominate the Chinese economy took off only after former Premier Zhu Rongji closed or privatized hundreds of thousands of state-owned companies in the early 2000s . The closures released capital to private firms and cleared the way for them to grow . Does anyone seriously believe that the Chinese economy would be stronger if policymakers were to undo Zhu 's reforms and revive all the old loss-making state enterprises ? <p> Or consider the US obsession with the Chinese government 's so-called " Made in China 2025 " plan , which channels subsidies to private firms in " strategic " sectors such as semiconductors . The jury is still out on whether the billions of renminbi spent to support such industries will prove effective , but the evidence so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company , not the Chinese champion Shanghai Semiconductor . And until now , the huge sums that China has plowed into this sector have resulted in spectacular failures such as the Hongxin Semiconductor , and the emergence of close to 60,000 new companies that have no technological expertise but are seeking to capitalize on the subsidies . Such outcomes are all too common when governments subsidize industrial sectors , perhaps owing simply to a lack of accountability . After all , who is held responsible when billions have been wasted and the officials who allocated the funds have moved on to other posts ? <p> The growth of China 's business sector has been fueled not by support for state-owned firms or industrial policy , but by powerful local governments ' backing of private firms -- including Hyundai in Beijing , and Tesla and General Motors in Shanghai . " The commercial goal of selling more GM Buicks and Chevrolets in China becomes a political and economic campaign to enhance the power and might of the city of Shanghai , " says one long-time observer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Shanghai Inc. , with the mayor as the chairman and CEO . " <p> The support of local governments is particularly crucial for private Chinese firms . For example , the East Hope Group became the largest private aluminum producer in China with the support of the small city of Sanmenxia in Henan Province , despite the fierce opposition of the state-owned giant Chinalco . <p> Chinese local governments also compete ferociously with each other to attract business -- a crucial factor in allowing private firms to grow . This reflects the rivalry between the Communist Party of China 's powerful local secretaries , many of whom eventually become members of the CPC 's Politburo . In contrast , the central government ministers who run industrial policy and state-owned firms almost never make it into the party 's top tiers . <p> If the US forces China to dismantle its support for state-owned firms and roll back its industrial policy , it would succeed only in removing the shackles on the private sector , making it more likely that other innovative private companies , supported by local party secretaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers would benefit , these Chinese firms -- regardless of their intentions -- have no choice but to comply when asked to advance the CPC 's political goals . <p> But US strategy instead seems focused on emulating the worst aspects of Chinese industrial policy . One example is the Facilitating American-Built Semiconductors Act , recently introduced in Congress , which would provide investment tax credits to US chip manufacturers . This follows the US Senate 's approval in June of a $52 billion investment in the sector as part of the US Innovation and Competition Act . <p> It is easy to understand why the US semiconductor industry would welcome the $52 billion . But besides the questionable equity of subsidizing wealthy US firms that use chips , the measure will produce the same result as the billions that China has poured into semiconductors . It will spawn companies that specialize in obtaining free money instead of investing in new technologies and products , causing the US semiconductor industry to fall further behind the leading global players . <p> So , what should America do instead ? Late in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that " the best thing we can do if we want the Russians to let us be Americans is to let the Russians be Russian . " His advice also applies to US policy toward China today , with the added complication that the current authoritarian superpower also has a market economy . <p> The real business-related challenge the US faces vis- ? -vis China is the tradeoff between national security and the benefits of economic exchange , not China 's support for state-owned firms or its industrial subsidies . And the worst thing America could do is to enact industrial policies of its own . <p> Chang-Tai Hsieh is Professor of Economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business .

Easy trap for any country to fall into . <p> It 's unlikely US would lead the manufacturing of semiconductors ever , but I do n't think that 's the point of this act . There 's a global trend in subsidizing foundries at the moment and the point is to add to supply chain resilience rather than compete with TMSC . The issue is , semiconductors move in very large volumes with a very wide variety , and since there 's no manufacturing supply chain in the US to make this competitive , this could essentially become another subsidized industry . And that 's not good for global competition and innovation . <p> Fair points , and so long as few to no electronics are actually built in the US ( most are built in China ) then this will likely not be competitive anyway .

But I know that for a lot of families , cooking the same meals , or having takeaways every week , just is n't a viable option . My ever-exhausted sister and her busy husband , for example , have three young kids who wo n't eat anything consistently unless it 's chocolate , fries or pizza . Eating out -- even if it 's at McDonald 's -- somehow always manages to cost them a small fortune . <p> It 's no coincidence that meal kits have found a lucrative niche among families like theirs . When the concept first took off in Sweden in the late 2000s , they were designed precisely with the modern family in mind -- one where both parents were at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , healthy home-cooked meals with our increasingly busy , convenience-driven lives , it did n't take long for the concept to gain traction , spreading across the continent to central Europe and , by 2012 , the United States . <p> Around the same time meal kits were taking off in the US , the idea had also made its way down to Aotearoa with the launch of My Food Bag , co-founded by celebrity chef Nadia Lim , in 2013 . A few years later came the slightly more gourmet service Woop ( which stands for " world on our plate " , in case you 're wondering ) , followed by Bargain Box , a more budget-friendly option launched by the My Food Bag team . Then , in 2018 , saw the arrival of HelloFresh -- the German meal kit juggernaut which , in less than three years , has managed to gobble up a large share of the local market . <p> The Hello Fresh empire arrived in New Zealand in 2018 .

More people than ever are trying out these " essential services " in lieu of supermarket chaos , and while they all share the same business model , they do have important differences , highlighted in a recent study by consumer-focused research website MoneyHub . <p> Over the course of six months , the team subscribed to the four largest and most popular meal kit delivery companies in New Zealand , consuming more than a 100 different meals for a side-by-side comparison of almost every detail you could ask for including cost , cooking time and packaging waste ( taste , unfortunately , was deliberately omitted as it was deemed " too subjective " ) . We 've summed up their key findings on which company did well in which areas . To read all the details and see photos from every meal , head to the MoneyHub website . <h> Prices and plans <p> Other than Bargain Box , which offers just two types of plans ( classic and vegetarian ) , the remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as a plant-based plan from My Food Bag using entirely vegan ingredients .

Designed to cater for the largest number of people out of all four services , a regular plan with five meals can be as low as $6.30 per plate for six people ( $190 per week ) , $7.30 per plate for four people ( $140 per week ) , and $11.50 per plate for two people ( $115 ) . <p> Remember : meal kits are designed so that the bigger your order ( more servings , more meals ) , the cheaper it works out per plate . <p> A bird 's eye view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( inclusive of its $10 delivery fee ) ranks second in the price-per-plate stakes .

It 's worth noting , though , that if you 're in the South Island , an extra $5 delivery fee applies . <h> Packaging and ingredients <p> Woop may be the priciest of the four , but the comparison found it made up for it by containing not only the highest quality of local ingredients , but also producing the least amount of waste . Its pre-prepared sauces and precisely portioned ingredients were found to leave the least amount of food waste and unused ingredients , while its recipes also required the fewest and simplest " pantry items " ( ingredients not included in the box ) . <p> Most of Woop 's packaging is made from materials suitable for kerbside recycling , but Woop also lets you return all your packaging to the company directly ( granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food residue ) , which it collects at your next order and properly recycles .

After the terror attack in New Lynn on September 3 , the prime minister pledged that the counter-terrorism bill would be pushed through parliament swiftly . It 's an expansive piece of legislation that makes planning a terrorist act , training for one or providing material support to a terrorist a crime . The bill has created odd bedfellows at parliament , with Labour and National coming together in support . Meanwhile Act , the Greens and Te Paati Maori are united in opposition . The government has promised that the bill will pass by the end of the month . <p> The government says the bill is needed because of the changing face of terror . RNZ reports that justice minister Kris Faafoi said police and intelligence need new legal authority to catch terrorists before they act . " Across the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than larger organised terrorist groups , and , as we 've seen , New Zealand is not immune to these events , " he told parliament yesterday before the bill passed its second reading . According to Faafoi , the government could n't consult much on the bill because it would have exposed " a national security risk " if terrorists knew of holes in the law . <p> Opposition to the bill has been significant , especially with the fast timetable . Green MP Teanau Tuiono warned parliament that previous counter-terrorism laws were often turned on Maori and Pacific communities , citing the 2007 Urewera raids as an example of abuse . " The new planning or preparation offence has been characterised by some experts as thought crimes , difficult to define in practice or defend against in legal proceedings , " he said yesterday . <p> Even National leader Judith Collins , who is working with the Labour benches , admitted to having some reservations .

" <p> What 's the hurry ? The prime minister says the law is n't being rushed , rather it was first proposed in 2018 and slowly worked its way through the government bureaucracy . There 's a chance that parts of the bill could be changed this week , but the Greens and Act have asked for a delay to get the balance right between stopping terrorists and protecting disadvantaged groups . Former Labour candidate Shane Te Pou suggested in the NZ Herald that the bill needs careful public consideration and not a rush after heartbreak and heightened emotion .

Argentina has extended export restrictions until the end of October in an attempt to keep a lid on domestic beef prices , which increased over 65% in the country since mid-2020 . <p> Meat Industry Association chief executive Sirma Karapeeva says NZ will not be able to increase exports to fill the supply gap left by South America . <p> " At the moment , we are in the low point of the New Zealand processing season , so we do not anticipate any significant immediate gains forr New Zealand exporters , " she told Rural News . <p> " However , if Brazil is n't able to send beef to China over a longer period , it might seek other markets , including ones serviced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she adds . <p> " While NZ will not be able to increase exports to fill the gap , there is a concern that if Brazil can not access the China markets for a longer period of time , it might seek to diversify and increase its exports to other markets such as Indonesia , the Philippines , the Middle East , and other south-east Asian countries . " <p> Karapeeva says if Brazil stops exporting to China , even for a short period , it will have a significant impact and it will be difficult for other countries to fill the gap . <p> " Argentina 's beef export restrictions will limit its ability to fill the gap and Australia 's exports are significantly down due to the herd rebuilding , " she explains . <p> " Uruguay and the United States might be able to increase their exports but would n't be able to fill the gap left by Brazil .

" <p> What the research found was " pretty confronting , " says Fraser . <p> " For 25 years we 've been studying different roles . <p> " We 've looked at home loan lenders , teachers , paramedics , executives , emergency room staff in hospitals ... and in comparison financial advisers scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roles . <p> " Worse on mental health , on wellbeing , the highest level of stress , the highest levels of feeling overloaded , " says Fraser . <p> But what was driving those poor results ? <p> " By far and above it was all the regulatory change and the constant changes hitting them in the industry , and it 's been happening for 15 years , so it 's been relentless . " <p> " We want people to put on their own face masks before they help others and so we need to understand the mental well-being of our adviser community because they are dealing with the general public on a daily basis . <p> " Being an adviser can be a lonely game and you couple that with the changes the industry is going through and the Covid-19 environment where no one really knows what 's going on , " Tremethick says . <p> The study will also look at who is thriving in the industry and how they manage to stay productive and positive . <p> " What do they do with their time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He says one of the things they discovered in the Australian survey was thriving advisers were just as frustrated by the change and by the regulatory shifts as others . <p> " But it was much more about how they did n't let that frustration run their behaviour and consume them ... they still focussed on how do I respond to that and what is best for my business . <p> " We can use this to inform and regulation and compliance moving forward . " <p> While Tremethick says he does n't think Kiwi advisers are worse off than their Australian counterparts he 's hearing more and more regularly that " ... there is an overwhelming sense it 's getting hard and people are struggling " . <p> " There 's the economic climate that 's quite different , you 're running a business potentially from home with homeschooling and whatever else - it 's tough out there . <p> " We are hoping the adviser community gets behind this because we want to know where we are at and what we need to do to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... a study that tells us how we can get better I think is really important . " <h> Comments from our readers <p> On 24 September 2021 at 1:30 pm seandnz said : <p> In my opinion , the current compliance regime seems to be designed for large corporates who have huge resources , even the new FMA CEO is from a corporate background monitoring banks and large organisations , but that is not the make up of the adviser market in New Zealand . <p> Maybe the FMA need to separate corporate regulation from small business regulation , I know there is some differentiation but there is no way a small business owner can keep up with that and we will end up with burnt out advisers who leave the industry , and that is not a good outcome for the consumer or the adviser and the financial services industry . <p> In my experience , the adviser market in New Zealand is mostly not corporatised and is made of small business owners , and these hard working advisers do not have the resources to really cope with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ licensing model may look line . <p> I think the regulatory bodies do not understand how a small business is run , think about it , advisers have to deal with finding new clients , look after existing clients , employment law , taxation , keep all their paperwork in order ( which has now tripled ) , keep their education up to date , keep their memberships up to date and everything else they need to do . <p> Advisers are going to get burnt out if we do not change to a more realistic regulatory body who understands corporate and small business .

@@33288231 <h> Triumph Street Twin <h> Words Peter Louisson Photos Tom Gasnier <h> It may look similar to the t100 but the new entry-level Bonneville is fresh from the ground up , including a new 900cc motor brimming with torque . Is this the must-have retro of 2016 ? <p> It has been around since the late 50s , the Bonneville , Triumph 's parallel twin-cylinder motorcycle named after the company 's streamliner which set a world speed record at the Utah salt flats in 1956 . After years of success with the Bonneville the company folded and was resurrected by John Bloor with machines packing three-cylinder engines . The Bonneville made a comeback in 2001 as a retro twin . A few minor updates followed , capacity of the parallel twin growing from 790cc to 865cc in 2005 , and scoring fuel injection in 2009 . <p> Now Triumph has done a total reboot , the new Street Twin the first ( and the baby ) of a family of five fresh Bonnevilles . New frame , new engine and new old look . The price is old too . At $15,990 it is precisely $290 more than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money you get a different and a better machine . Back then it had nothing in the way of electronics , just " essence of motorcycling " . Now it feels much the same , but gets the safety electronics ( TC and ABS ) as standard . <p> For 2016 pretty much everything is new except the styling , which of course is also new but it 's merely another take on what the bike looked like originally . The basics appear similar even if it is all new . The engine is still the centrepiece , even if it is now watercooled ( not that you 'd notice ) , and the chain is still unfashionably on the right side . Even the name is new , Triumph hoping to cash in on the popularity and prowess of one of the best middleweights ever , the Street Triple , by calling its Bonnie baby the Street Twin . Sounds fast huh , especially with those sweet Vance and Hines pipes . Er , not exactly but then that 's not the point , is it ? The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the new one because that 's more or less where it 's creating peak torque . <p> In its evolution to Euro4 emissions status it has lost revs and power , down from 50kW at 7500 to 41kW at 5900rpm . That may be disappointing for rev-heads but torque actually increases by 18 per cent , up from 69 to 80Nm , and the peak arrives at 3230rpm instead of 5800rpm . There 's 68Nm available by 2000rpm , so the cruiser that handles just got a whole lot cruisier . <p> The reason it has more low down grunt is the adoption of the 270-degree crank which promotes torque development and reduces vibrations inherent in a parallel twin design . Further , the new engine is more economical by over one-third -- it can do mid 3s at 100km/h -- and that means emissions drop by the same amount . We saw 4.5L/100km overall . <p> Two factors aid economy , the use of water cooling and ride-by-wire throttle . And the latter is significant too for it makes the adoption of traction control possible . The former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instead of just whacking a big square-rigged radiator under the steering head , Triumph designers have crafted a long , skinny water cooler and mounted it vertically between the uprights of the chassis tubes , where it is all but invisible . The retro look demands that , and you have to peer hard to spot that it 's liquid cooled ; there are still plenty of fins on the engine so at first glance it seems like the old air/oil-cooled Bonneville . Yet another advantage of this upgrade is longer service intervals , now out to 16,000km from 10,000km previously , though you 'd probably want to do an oil change around the 8000km mark . <p> While on the tech front , brakes are n't much different from before and they feel great , a 310mm single disc up front acted upon by a two-piston caliper but now there 's unswitchable ABS fitted as standard . The rear unit is strong too . TC can be overriden , and needs to be if you want to attempt any acrobatics . And that 's a major difference from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough grunt to hoist the front , but if you 're doing just the right speed and hold your tongue just so , the new Bonnie will rear up , thanks to its added torque . <p> Other new bits ? A fresh frame with more upright forks mean slightly quicker steering to counter the gryoscopic effect of the 18-inch front wheel . There 's also a seat redesign with added foam , still set at a handy 750mm height , a new instrument ( tacho no longer provided ) , and a fresh brushed stainless steel exhaust system . <p> The riding position now places a bit more weight over the front end , and there 's said to be better cornering clearance ; you have try some to get the pegs scraping . Overall weight has dropped too . It 's quoted at 198kg dry , and comes in at 212kg fuelled , whereas in 2009 the T100 was 230kg . The 18kg saving does n't make it any quicker to 100 ( with less power and revs it 's slower by 0.3sec at 5.09sec ) while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vs 3.1sec ) . Not really enough that you 'd notice . <p> Suspension by Kayaba is a development of the existing with extended travel . And the ignition is no longer in its former hide and seek location ; everything is easier on the new machine . Detail finishing is good , and there 's even a USB socket under the seat so you can charge your phone in an emergency , providing you remembered the cord . If you 're in to personalisation there are over 150 accessories available , some bundled in ' inspiration ' packs . <p> If you 're wondering how it compares with the old-new Bonnie , think of the latest version as much the same , only more polished in most regards . The look is unmistakable , especially about the engine , updated with a slimline ( but smaller ) tank and lots of flat grey metal bits , often contrasting with black items ( footpegs , mirrors , around the headlight area ) . <p> The riding position is brilliant for everyday use , especially for town running . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . The tank is impossibly narrow at the rear , so you feel knock-kneed when gripping it with your legs . We 'd opt for the rubber knee pads to make the tank feel a bit more substantial . Levers are span adjustable both sides , and the clutch action is lightweight and feelsome , cog swapping oh-so smooth , despite there being only five gears . <p> The engine is great , and is stronger than ever . It pulls without complaint from low revs -- ca n't give you a number , no rev counter -- and is particularly easy-going in fourth gear at urban speeds . Torque ramps up with verve from 80km/h in top . As before , 100-110km/h is relaxed for rural runs , so if you 've a few too many points against you this machine is unlikely to get you into further strife . Not that it ca n't but that 's just where it feels best . Vibes at social speeds are all but absent . <p> We rode it over some pretty dodgy surfaces and the suspension worked as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front and only preload changeable at the rear . The fork dive has been expunged and the rear shockers are absorbent on their lowest position . There 's plenty of seat room for two on the ST , and more than enough torque to get the job done . <p> We liked the Pirelli Phantom tread pattern , harking back to when this was the tyre to have in the late seventies . They grip well too , sufficient to lean over enough for the peg feelers to touch . Steering is n't especially quick , as expected with the slightly larger front wheel , but it 's tasty and the bike is sticky , confident and stable when pushed . <p> Is this still the most desirable modern classic or have others like Ducati 's Scrambler or Moto Guzzi 's V7 caught up or surpassed the British institution ? We 'd say not yet . The V7 does n't have the punch of the Bonnie motor , while the Scrambler is quicker and more agile but suffers from a brittle ride . It 's also more expensive if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything but retaining the look , Triumph has successfully updated a retro roadster to a modern classic .

It was transactional in nature -- in return for home and food , the dogs would give us protection , long range hunting retrieval and the opportunity to put a hat on them and/or make them wear shoes . <p> A greater partnership the earth has never seen . <p> When not wrapping up dead cats like burritos , the ancient Egyptians would adorn pet jackals with elaborate collars . But it was n't until the 1900s and the mass manufacturing of cameras that people suddenly realised the staggering potential of dressing up dogs in human clothes . Since then , we 've never looked back . <p> Right now , It 's time to take stock , reflect and recharge . The planet is currently overheating , shaking with political polarisation and squirming with viruses like the contents of a dozen petri dishes stuffed into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best dogs wearing dog costumes that I have managed to find online . <p> 20 ) Reindeer antler headpiece <p> Christmas is a time of sharing , and what better time to involve your furry friend in confusing human holiday customs ? In this scene found on AliExpress , Puffles is screaming in confusion from the cultural dissonance he 's experiencing from wearing a yuletide accessory in what is an obviously Halloween setting . He does n't understand . And he never will . <p> In the 2001 film AI : Artificial Intelligence , director Steven Spielberg spent millions of dollars to make a teddy bear talk and walk around like a little Ray Winstone . Twenty years on , all you need is 15 minutes , an old raggy scrag of a teddy bear and a near to breaking point Shih Tzu called Munchkin to create the same effect . How do those Oscars feel now , Steven ? <p> Houston , the 1-year-old Shih Tzu , demonstrates here how to tear the marrow from life : by mixing the luxurious sophistication of velvet smoking jackets with angry pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter Magritte ? Or is it , in fact , a plush cartoon golf club ? It 's certainly not a cigar , as listed by owner and costume creator Kordy on costume-works.com . The wave of confusion and anxiety this costume generates puts it in the 18th slot . <p> Simple . Elegant . Classy . I would marry any dog that promised to wear this to our wedding . That 's not to say it would be an easy courtship . I 'm a middle-aged human man , this is a fluffy haired poodle . The chances of there being numerous cultural complications and misunderstandings would be greatly increased . But , at some point during the evening , he 'd turn and look at me over his shoulder . <p> There 's a couple of things going on here . Firstly , I 'm pretty sure those are boobs attached to the head of this costume . Secondly , that is the same wispy white fur one would usually expect to see on a discounted cushion at Kmart , so kudos for the upcycling . <p> Thirdly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I can see from the look on this dog 's face that it 's been empowered by the totem of the spider . This canine is no longer Rufus . He is now Sharrrughlur , Lead Hunt Mistress of the Undying Blood Moon . And he is going to hunt down some arachnophobes and scare them back into the womb . <p> Another pooch who 's completely disappeared into the role . The look on his face conveys a complex web of emotions . <p> Angus Squatobee , first mate on the USS Bonedigger , watches the shore slowly grow smaller and smaller . His love , Miss Snowball , is just a white dot , but he will not look away until she has disappeared from view completely . He had to accept the Navy 's commission , their 18th pup was on its way and Angus needed to provide . But at what price ? Will the remittance back home to help the pack survive another winter be enough to wipe all the blood off his paws ? <p> Yes goddammit . He would kill who he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pups and Miss Snowball were safe . He would rain down hellfire on the whole world if in return they would continue to laugh and bark and wee outside . <p> If by that his damnation would be sealed , he would walk into the fire laughing and singing a song of the sea . And love . Always love . <p> It 's a widely misunderstood aspect of Mr Spock and Vulcan psychology that people think Kirk 's cool mate was without emotions . In actual fact , Vulcans are chock full of feelings , perhaps even more than us humans . They 're just really good at pushing them deep down inside until they all come bubbling up again when they 're on heat and want to get busy with anything that moves . <p> The first food-themed costume on our list and it 's a good example , albeit a morally confusing one . The ruffles are absolutely gorgeous , and the purple pops against the coffee-brown of the comfortable-looking felt material . <p> But what is a puppy latte , exactly ? Would you drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation where you did n't want to cause offence ? The answer is : of course you would . <p> This is here mainly because of the little gloved hands on this costume . Are they not the cutest little gauntlets you 've ever seen ? Imagine them trying to grasp a normal-sized glass of water . I would absolutely squeal . <p> 10 ) Lobster Chihuahua <p> Photo : Getty Images <p> Someone thought to themselves " man , I need some passive income " , borrowed their mate 's pet chihuahua with the bug eyes , and a dog lobster costume , and hit the beach . Not long after , they were running a photoshoot which would form the basis of an indispensable stock photography portfolio . <p> And you 've got to admit , it works . This little lobster dog is all of us : quivering little balls of meat inside a hard shell . I bet this is exactly what Jordan Peterson was on about when he used lobsters to argue that hierarchies are naturally occurring and therefore justifiable in human society . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costumes and this one is a stone cold classic . I mean , it 's undoubtedly why sausage dogs were bred in the first place . And if that does n't prove our mastery over nature , well , I do n't know what will . <p> What I do know is that if you chuck this little guy on the hot plate outside a local Bunnings , I will come running because this banger-bark-machine looks good enough to eat . <p> As we work our way into the single digits , it 's getting harder and harder to contain my excitement . This is where we 're getting to the absolute vinegar strokes of the exercise . Because it seems like some kind of magic trick that one simple costume design can produce such joy in one 's heart . <p> The dog above is clearly dog sized , but also , somehow , bigger than a human ! ? This is what all great art does , it shakes up your frame of reference and forces you to look at the world from a different perspective . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knight style " ? What kind of design is " magic tape " ? There 's not a hope in hell we 'll be able to answer any of these questions , but just maybe the answers we 're looking for are inside all of us . <p> Credit where credit 's due , this is a well-detailed costume clearly made with respect for the original . The muscle sleeves are rippling with power , the gold chains are rippling with shiny gold pizazz , and the mohawk skull cap is rippling with follicle power . <p> The dog model is , of course , absolute perfection . That face is a fierce mug , at one moment asking you to pity the fool and at the next warning you about the dangers of using drugs . <p> A great dog costume does n't exist in a vacuum . It can only become great when filled by the perfect pooch for that costume . Here is a example of costume and dog working together to create something that elevates both . <p> I 've never seen anything succeed in retaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . By all rights this dog should be cowed in shame . Instead she is proud , secure , laser-focused . Again , here is something we can learn from the dogs . She achieves this nobility because she gives less than two fucks about what you think -- she 's just here to make sure Santa gets those goddamn gifts ready and loaded onto the sleigh . Productivity was down by 1.8% compared with the same quarter last year , and she would rather give up her stock options than fail to achieve on this quarter 's OKRs . <p> We 're getting to the business end of this vital and personally rewarding list , and it is classics all the way down . <p> This costume makes great use of the " walking costume " format which , if used in conjunction with a small to mid-sized pooch , can achieve a scale-accurate Yoda . Imagine having the wee Jedi master walking around your house , or standing by you looking hopeful while you cook dinner ? <p> This costume is priced at $29 USD but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life . <p> Is this the best dog costume ? No . Is it the best gift for a dog-owning incel ? Yes . The Joker has given solace to misanthropic nerds everywhere , so of course the invisible hand swooped in and provided the perfect way to dress up their doggy pal . It 's a win for everyone , but none more so than this dog who is rocking this look with confidence . <p> Honestly , this is a perfect argument for why God should have given dogs hair . <p> This costume provides us with an example of the great paradox of human/dog relations . If a person was to turn up on my doorstep wearing a stripy t-shirt and brandishing a cheap guitar with the intention of belting out some Jack Johnson , I 'd put the hose on them . However , picture the same scenario with a forlorn wee pug dressed exactly the same , and I 'd invite the poor thing inside for a sampler box . <p> Eventually , I 'd probably agree to going in on a timeshare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why this costume ranks so highly . The internet is awash in dogs dressed as the famous wee Irish imp . You can go for an attached pot of gold or a fake beard and pipe , but really all you need is some cheap green cloth , a hat and a cardboard buckle . <p> And so here we are . We 've reached the pinnacle of dog costume technology . Hundreds of thousands of years of constant innovation have led us to this : the realisation that each pair of legs on a dog could represent a single humanoid figure . Once we realised this , there was no way back . <p> Yes there are other variations on the four leg optimisation format , but this costume remains , in my mind , a classic and the high water mark of the field . <p> Firstly , check out the detailing on that chest . That 's high level design research of a standard not seen since mid 90s fantasy RPG video games . <p> Speaking of RPGs , there 's some excellent character work being realised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retains only a sliver of dignity from his days in the Royal Navy . General hygiene and regular skincare has been abandoned in favour of a rapacious love of gold that led him to the bandit ways of the high seas . <p> By contrast , his bosun taking up the rear is clearly an alcoholic wastrel , judging by his leaning posture . He might tip over at any point , he 's already lost an eye to a drunken escapade -- probably involving a fire pit and an impromptu game of beach skittles . <p> Exquisite and thoughtful world-building makes for a memorable and compelling dog costume . Here we find stories of bravery and daring on the ocean , but also cautionary tales of our inherent shortcomings under the eyes of God . Dogs can be our companions and even our servants , but their most important role is that of teacher . They want to help us , but will we listen ? Or just give them belly rubs ? <p> Honestly , I 've got to an age where I 'm willing to admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money and hard work to produce . We rely on donations to fund our work .

Tara Ward power ranks our favourite celebrities as they continue to battle it out for charity . <p> Call me a banana , cover me in googly eyes and peel me quickly , because what a pearler of a week on Celebrity Treasure Island . Richie Barnett was eliminated , Chris Parker swapped teams , and one team went batshit over a beetroot salad . Vegetables have never been cooler and neither have googly eyes , and after the game 's biggest physical threat was sent home by a pair of giant chopsticks , who knows what could happen ? Nothing makes sense on this glorious hot potato of a reality show , and yet , everything is as it should be . <p> And Exhibit B was how the CTI castaways spent their week , watching in shock and awe as Daddy Buck Shelford pulled off the surprise of the century , smashing Richie Barnett out of the competition using nothing but two big sticks and a paua pie in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be alive , and an even better time to be watching the telly . I 'll give you a moment to talk amongst yourselves , then let 's crack into the rankings . <h> ELIMINATED <p> Richie Barnett <p> Jeepers creepers , as Anna Simcic would say . Testosterone bombs keep exploding on CTI ( Tammy Davis BOOM ! Art Green BOOM BOOM ! ) , but rugby league star Richie Barnett went out with the biggest bang . He had a tough week , after the Katipo women bought pizza at the CTI market when he told them not to , he was n't voted in as captain , and he hurt his knee in a challenge . <p> Worst of all , he could n't stack five blocks on a table quicker than Buck Shelford , which meant rugby was the winner on the day . <p> Kimberly Crossman <p> Kim was eliminated just as she began to play the game , the victim of another sneaky Lance Savali blindside . Lance put Kim up against Anna Simcic in a torturous " hold these ropes until you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympic swimmer . Her CTI hopes and dreams collapsed , as did her muscles . Crossman ? More like Crosswoman . <h> THE REST <p> 11 ) Candy Lane <p> Candy continues to cha-cha-charm everyone into a false sense of security , even persuading Buck Shelford to shake what his mother gave him . You can feel in your waters that the merge is coming and the Ovary Agreement is calling Candy 's name , and this dance queen is about to shake things up like a conga line on a bouncy castle . I have absolutely no proof of this ; I am merely a googly-eyed banana of prediction . <p> 10 ) Lana Searle <p> Lana scored the bargain of the year by buying a pizza for one coin in the CTI pirate market , pissing off Dad ( Richie ) no end . But she who loves salami and cheese shall have the last laugh , as long as you 're not the one splashing her on a boat during a challenge . Joe Daymond , I 'm looking at you . From now on let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled crust , please and thank you . <p> 9 ) Jess Tyson <p> Jess proved yet again that she 's a whiz at the charity challenges , winning another $5000 for her charity by guessing she was Oprah . She also revealed a secret connection with Lance , which was strong enough to make him change his elimination picks with a single nod of her head . Incredible to see . Oprah could never . <p> 8 ) Anna Simcic <p> While the rest of us lack the strength to hold a biro for five minutes , Anna barely broke a sweat during an elimination challenge that saw her hang near-horizontally with nothing but two tiny ropes to keep her steady . A true legend and absolute physical beast . <p> 7 ) Brynley Stent <p> Power couple Chris and Brynley were torn apart when Chris was pinched by Katipo , leaving the Puzzle Queen with nothing to do but spill her alliance secrets to Kim . Look , it 's fine . Brynley found a new BFF in this delicious steak and cheese pie , but please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some things should be enjoyed in solitude , and pies are one of them . <p> 6 ) Edna Swart <p> A picture says a thousand words , and Edna Swart 's delightful facials say even more . The poor lamb spent the week in a state of rabid frustration , and she 'd be at the top of these terrible rankings if only she could find someone to take her seriously . Edna wants to put Chris and Brynley up for elimination , but Lance wo n't listen . She wants all of Chris and Brynley 's clues , but they wo n't share . How did she end up surrounded by these clowns ? When will the sheeple wake up , and why are n't we eating more zoodles in the hellfire year that is 2021 ? <p> 5 ) Joe Daymond <p> Just when you think Joe is here just for some delightful product placement and to win his charity $5000 by catching a grape in his mouth , he revealed himself as a mastermind in Lance Savali 's alliance . Joe faked his own elimination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all along , proving he 's here for the long game . I 'm only sorry he did n't bring his jim jams for those TimTams . <p> 4 ) Chris Parker <p> Cruelly ripped from Repo 's warm embrace , Chris had an emotional week , even though he got to wear all his orange Katipo clothes again . He struggled with the pressures to be everything for everybody , which is exactly how I imagine the googly-eyed banana felt in the captain 's challenge . <p> It 's a tough ask to bring the " Chris Parker effect " to a team that ca n't catch a break , no matter how many tins of spam and beans they have , and it 's tricky to know your old team wants you gone as well . Give the man a break ! Send him to the poo cave for a rest ! The Parkernator must be protected at all costs . <p> 3 ) Buck Shelford <p> This is the journey we 're here for . Once seen as terrifyingly grumpy , Sir Shelford has mellowed his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be enjoying himself . He 's down with the kids , he 's kicking the competition to the curb , and he 's chowing down on the paua pie of his dreams . Hold onto your googly eyes : maybe Buck Shelford is playing the best game of all . <p> 2 ) Angela Bloomfield <p> New Repo captain Ange is here for one thing , and one thing only : " chocolate , chocolate , chocolate , chocolate , chocolate " . Look , are n't we all ? Is n't this game just one big lark for some fun TimTam product placement and a jaunty stroll along the beach ? No ? Fine . <p> 1 ) Lance Savali <p> Lance is playing such a bewildering game that he 's even confusing himself , which makes him a tactical genius . He holds all the strings and all the googly bananas , bluffing his way through Edna 's intense interrogations and inheriting Richie 's clues .

However , the QV Quartile Index tells a different story in the city 's central suburbs . <p> In the 12 months to January 2021 , central Auckland 's upper quartile average house price grew by $490,936 ( 18% ) . At the same time , the lower quartile average increased by $123,827 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the second half of the year , with upper and lower quartiles keeping relatively in step until August , at which point central Auckland 's $2m+ houses grew at twice the rate of the houses at the opposite end of the spectrum . <p> QV general manager David Nagel commented : " Though there is still plenty of competition between first-home buyers and investors , we seem to be getting to the stage now where many of them are reaching their affordability and credit limits . <p> " While prices are still on the up , they have stopped going through the roof at such a strong rate as we previously saw throughout 2020 . Instead , now we 're seeing the limited supply of higher-end stock being subjected to greater price pressure , which is the reverse of what we saw previously . <p> " This is probably both a ' catch-up ' , as well as a result of listing shortages . " <p> It was a similar story in Wellington city , where the upper and lower quartiles have both grown by 18% over the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the second half of last year . <p> In the past six months , however , the average house price in the upper quartile has increased by $242,766 ( 17% ) while the corresponding average in the lower quartile has increased by $92,814 ( 13% ) . <p> " In other words , the gap is growing between houses in the $1.5m+ bracket and the ones that fall below Wellington city 's current average $1,044,244 price tag -- traditionally the types of homes that first-home buyers and investors target the most , " said Mr Nagel . <p> In Tauranga , the upper quartile has increased by 21% ( $260,034 ) over the past 12 months . At the same time , the city 's mean average house price and lower quartile average have increased by 18% . <p> " It may not seem significant when you look at it as a percentage , but it can be a lot in dollar terms , " Mr Nagel added . " In Tauranga , we 're talking about a difference of more than $160,000 -- that 's how much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on top of the significant gains that the lower quartile has made . " <p> In the 12 months to January 2021 , Hamilton 's average upper quartile house price increased by $142,033 ( 15.9% ) . At the other end of the spectrum , the lower quartile average increased by $80,430 ( 17.5% ) . <p> That gap widened over the last six months with the upper quartile increasing by 12.9% and the lower quartile increasing by 9% . <p> It 's a completely different story in Christchurch , where the lower quartile has consistently been out-performing the upper quartile over the past 12 months . <p> In the 12 months to January 2021 , Christchurch 's upper quartile average house price increased by 9.4% ( $83,741 ) while the lower quartile went up by 13.6% ( $46,085 ) . There was a difference of 2% between the two over the last six months in favour of the lower quartile , and a difference of 4% in the last quarter -- indicating that the gap between the bottom and the middle of the market is closing . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increased volatility of the upper quartile of the Christchurch residential property market . In October and November , for instance , the upper quartile actually outperformed the lower quartile by some fractions of a percentage point . <p> " Again , half a percentage point may not seem like a huge difference but in real dollar terms , the upper quartile average price has increased by more than $70,000 in two months , while the lower quartile average increased by less than a third as much . " <p> Dunedin is another exception to the growing gap between upper and lower quartiles in our main centres . In the 12 months to January , the upper quartile average increased by $96,973 ( 12.1% ) while the lower quartile increased by $61,207 ( 16.9% ) . <p> Over the last six months , the upper quartile and lower quartiles increased by 9.7% and 11.8% respectively . In the last quarter , the upper quartile grew by 3.7% and the lower quartile went up by 6.8% . <p> " There appears to be a much greater amount of competition between first-home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunedin than in other major centres , relative to the top end of the market , " said Mr Nagel . <p> " However , I expect that one day in the not-too-distant future we 'll get to the point where potential purchasers reach their credit limits and some of that competition putting upward pressure on prices begins to dry up as a result . " <p> One of the largest gaps between upper and lower quartiles is in Queenstown -- and that gap is only getting wider . In the 12 months to January 2021 , the average property price in the upper quartile increased by a whopping $228,476 ( 10% ) , while the lower quartile added $15,658 to its average price ( 2.1% ) . <p> There was a sharp drop immediately after lockdown last year and a number of speed wobbles since , but the upper quartile has shot up $125,046 in the last two months alone , for instance , while the lower quartile has grown by $11,153 at the same time . <p> " I suspect that when our borders open once more and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability seep into the lower end of Queenstown 's residential property market , " Mr Nagel added . <h> Join the ScoopCitizen Community <p> 20 years of independent publishing is a milestone , but to keep Scoop thriving we need your support .

Auckland is now at step one of the alert level three pathway , Northland and parts of Waikato are in regular level three . Reach me on stewart@thespinoff.co.nz <h> Today 's 1pm and 4pm updates , summarised <p> Auckland will remain under its current alert level three restrictions until at least 11.59pm on Tuesday October 19 . This will be reviewed in a week , on October 18 . <p> Northland and parts of Waikato will remain in the classic , stricter , level three until at least 11.59pm on Thursday October 14 . This will be reviewed on Wednesday , October 13 . <p> Vaccinations will be made mandatory for all teachers and school staff from January 1 , 2022 and for some in the health and disability sector from December 1 , 2021 . Weekly testing will be required for unvaccinated school staff up until the new year . <p> The plan to reopen Auckland schools on October 18 has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Covid-19 . All are in Auckland but 21 have not yet been epidemiologically linked to the wider outbreak . <p> And a friendly reminder : Our coverage of Covid-19 depends on support from Members.Join us here . <p> Covid-19 response minister ( and education minister ) Chris Hipkins appeared live on RNZ Checkpoint shortly after the 4pm briefing this evening to discuss vaccine mandates in the education sector . Lisa Owen asked the question on every parent 's mind : will school-aged children in Auckland be home for the rest of the year ? Hipkins would n't give a clear timeframe but also did n't rule it out . Read a condensed transcript below or watch the full interview here : <p> Owen : Can you give us a guarantee that school 's going to be back , in Auckland , sometime this year ? <p> Hipkins : There are no guarantees when you 're dealing with Covid-19 . <p> Do you think it 's likely , minister ? <p> I think there 's a good stance , but we 'll review it week by week . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're learning from home for the first week of the school term . That 'll give us further time to get higher rates of vaccination and also to look at what the case numbers are showing us . <p> We do have some ability even now at alert level three for those senior secondary school students who are needing to complete assessments and so on and need to be on the school site to complete assessments , there are provisions available for them . We are making arrangements for exams to still be able to proceed at the end of this year regardless of where we 're sitting with things . <p> As you 'll probably appreciate , some parents are kind of hanging by a thread here , right ? They 've had a long period of time where they 're assuming a whole bunch of responsibilities . So can you just be as clear as possible -- let 's talk about primary school -- do you think it is likely that primary students will be back at school before the end of the year or should parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I fully understand the plight of those parents who 'll be listening to this . we want to get their kids back to school as soon as it 's safe to do so . I ca n't put a specific time frame on that . If I was giving odds , again , I do n't think that would be fair . I do think there 's a good chance we 'll be able to reopen schools and have kids back in school but I do n't want to put particular deadlines , dates , timeframes or odds on it . <p> I understand the deadlines , dates , and the odds . Let me put it another way : are you reviewing scenarios which would be that students are not returning to school by the end of the year ? Are you gearing up a scenario that fits that ? <p> Look , that would be the worst case scenario- <p> Yes but are you preparing for that , minister ? <p> All scenarios are on the table and we look at the implications for all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that would be the worst case scenario ... I 'm still optimistic that we 'd be able to get to a better place than that . <p> Professor Nick Wilson from the department of public health at University of Otago has welcomed vaccine mandates in the health and education sectors announced by the government today . <p> " This is entirely justifiable from a duty-of-care perspective and is an increasingly common approach in other high-income countries , including Australia , " he said . For those health and education workers who refuse to be vaccinated against Covid-19 , there will often be alternative work roles available where they do not interact with the public . " <p> Wilson said the decision not to open schools in Auckland next Monday will " give more time for the introduction of safeguards " alongside the new mandates . <p> He also encouraged the strengthening of Auckland 's borders to prevent spread to other regions , as well as a border around the South Island , where " we probably should be aiming to have some border controls so as to replicate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for over 500 days " . <h> 4.15pm : Vaccinations to be mandatory for all teachers by 2022 <p> All school and early learning teachers , and staff who have contact with school students , will need to be vaccinated by the start of next year . <p> The government has confirmed vaccines will be mandatory for many in the education sector , with a first dose required by November 15 . Schools and early learning providers will then need to maintain a vaccine register confirming their student-facing staff are doubled jabbed from January 1 , 2022 . <p> Speaking at today 's 4pm press conference , Covid response and education minister Chris Hipkins revealed this would include support staff such as teacher-aides , administration and maintenance staff and contractors . " Secondary schools and kura will also be required to keep a Covid-19 vaccination register for students , " he said . <p> Schools in Auckland will no longer reopen in a week 's time , but all employees will first require a negative Covid-19 result when returning to school grounds in the future . This will also apply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who are not fully vaccinated in the period leading up to January 1 2022 , will also be required to undergo weekly Covid-19 testing , " said Hipkins . " Work is continuing on whether mandatary vaccinations will be required in the tertiary education sector . " <p> Asked what will happen to those who remain unvaccinated by the start of next year , Hipkins confirmed they will no longer be able to work in their job after the vaccine deadline . Students , however , will not need to be vaccinated . " That 's really important , " said Hipkins . <p> Vaccines also mandated for some in health and disability sector <p> Meanwhile , anyone conducting " high-risk work " in the health and disability sector will also need to be fully vaccinated by December 1 this year . " Under these new requirements , general practitioners , pharmacists , community health nurses , midwives , paramedics , and all healthcare workers in sites where vulnerable patients are treated ( including Intensive Care Units ) must receive their first dose of the vaccine by October 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include certain non-regulated healthcare work , such as aged residential care , home and community support services , kaupapa Maori health providers and Non-Government Organisations who provide health services . " <p> Hipkins said mandating vaccines was n't an " easy decision " , but with vaccinations not yet approved for young children -- and the high risk presented in the disability sector -- this was a necessary step . " A high rate of vaccinations will help to protect staff from getting sick and passing Covid-19 onto loved ones . It will also reassure those who are anxious about their children attending school and early learning services . " <h> 4.00pm : Lockdown restrictions to stay in place in all three regions <p> All three currently locked down regions will remain under current restrictions , Jacinda Ardern has announced . <p> In summary : <p> Auckland remains in level three ( step one ) for at least another week . <p> Level three settings will remain for affected Waikato area and Northland until at least 11.59pm Thursday . <p> " We want the R value to stay as close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has crept up a little in recent days . This means the number of cases will grow . If followed , our alert level restrictions can help slow this spread . " <p> Auckland 's lockdown will be reviewed again in a week , while the restrictions in Waikato and Northland will be reviewed on Wednesday . <p> Schools in Auckland will also not reopen next week as previously planned for , said Ardern . The current state of the outbreak in Auckland has heightened the need for robust safety measures to be in place before schools reopen . " Further public health advice will be provided next week , " said Afdern . " Distance learning will instead recommence at the beginning of term four . " <p> This week will culminate with " Super Saturday " -- a national day of action encouraged to bolster vaccine uptake . " While we vaccinate , restrictions are still important , " said Ardern . Acknowledging the shift to the new version of alert level three in Auckland last week , Ardern said the general rule was that people should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Small pockets of transmission have occurred at level three workplaces in the sectors of construction , food delivery and taxi services , said Ardern . Surveillance testing is now under way . <p> Waikato and Northland to stay in level three until Thursday night <p> Despite no new cases being announced in Waikato today , the parts of the region currently in alert level three will remain under restrictions until 11.59pm on Thursday night . A move to level two will tentatively be confirmed on Wednesday . <p> Similarly , despite no new cases cropping up in Northland , the tip of the country will also remain in level three until at least Thursday night . " While we have n't had any new cases in Northland since the case emerged on Friday , without clear information about the exact places they travelled to , we 're relying on testing , " said Ardern . " This is an incredibly frustrating situation . " Ardern said she had asked health officials to take all possible steps to try and and determine whether any Covid spread had occurred . <p> Ardern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Announcement due on alert levels and vaccine mandates <p> We 're about to hear from prime minister Jacinda Ardern , director general of health Ashley Bloomfield , and the Covid-19 response minister Chris Hipkins . <p> First and foremost , we 're due to receive an update on whether restrictions can be loosened in any part of the country . Currently , Auckland is in stage one of the revamped level three pathway ( or whatever it 's called ) while parts of Waikato and all of Northland remain in the OG , stricter , version of level three . <p> We 're also expecting an announcement on vaccine mandates , possibly for the education sector . <p> As always -- follow along with our live coverage by keeping this page refreshed or tune into the livestream below : <p> A special note from The Spinoff publisher Duncan Greive <p> Without wanting to get too Bernie Sanders-meme with it , I am once again asking you to consider donating to help The Spinoff .

Jacinda Ardern , joined by Ashley Bloomfield and Chris Hipkins , will reveal next steps at today 's 4pm presser . <p> In a press release , Maori Party co-leader Rawiri Waititi said keeping the alert level restrictions as they currently are will lead to more deaths . " The reality is that the government has failed to deliver to Maori , " he said . " They have failed to uphold their responsibility to Te Tiriti o Waitangi . And now we are on the brink of a catastrophe that none of us are prepared or resourced for simply because they wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strategy and the vaccine rollout on the general population has left Maori " out to dry " , said Debbie Ngarewa-Packer . " Maori are now presenting over half of daily cases . We need to be placed back into a level that will break the circuit of this outbreak for Maori. " <h> 2.05pm : Today 's key numbers , in chart form <p> Here are the key figures from today 's 1pm update , as charted by The Spinoff 's Harkanwal Singh . <p> As you can see , today saw a dip in new cases compared to yesterday 's mammoth surge . However , today 's 35 new cases is still one of the highest we 've seen since the peak of the outbreak in August . And taking into account testing numbers are lower on a Sunday , it remains concerning . <p> The second and third charts show the number of hospitalisations and cases infectious in the community . Both are trending upward at a time when we 'd very much like to see the opposite . <p> Both North Shore Hospital and Auckland City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in staff being stood down . <p> In today 's 1pm media update , the Ministry of Health said two staff members at North Shore Hospital have now returned positive results for Covid-19 following a confirmed case in a patient receiving treatment in the dialysis unit . The connection between the three cases is being investigated . <p> " A number of staff have been stood down initially as a precaution , and all those staff who have been tested have returned negative results , " said the ministry . " The dialysis unit remains open , with measures in place to manage potential risk to both patients and staff . " <p> Meanwhile , three staff members at Auckland City Hospital have also tested positive -- including one who was fully vaccinated . Of the three , two were tested at a community testing site while one was tested as part of routine workplace surveillance . Initial investigations have shown there are no links to the NICU parent case . <p> There are currently 33 people in hospitals around Auckland with Covid-19 . <p> Whole genome sequencing has definitively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wider Auckland outbreak . <p> Due to sample quality limitations , whole genome sequencing could not link the case to a specific cluster , however resampling has been undertaken and ESR are working to improve the data quality of additional sequencing . The case remains in an Auckland quarantine facility . <p> A second person who is thought to have travelled with this case has been contacted but not yet located , said the ministry . <p> More information on the Northland case and their travel companion may be released by the prime minister Jacinda Ardern at today 's 4pm press conference after pressure to confirm whether or not the pair have gang links . <p> " Public health staff continue to work closely with the person to determine any locations of interest or exposure events associated with the case , " said the ministry . There are currently 21 close contacts associated with this case . The household of the case and travel companion are included in this number . <p> " Anyone in Northland should remain vigilant for symptoms , particularly anyone who has visited a location of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times specified should get tested and isolate until they receive the result , " the ministry said . <p> There are 35 new community cases of Covid-19 , all in Auckland . It 's the final set of new cases ahead of a major lockdown announcement this afternoon , with Northland , Auckland and parts of Waikato currently in some form of alert level three . <p> Of today 's new cases , 14 have so far been epidemiologically linked to the wider outbreak . Twenty-nine of the 60 cases announced yesterday were infectious while in the community . <p> There are now 33 people in hospital with Covid-19 , including seven people who are intensive care . <p> As is to be ( unfortunately ) expected , the Sunday figures for both testing and vaccination took a bit of a hit compared to last week . Nationwide , 15,349 tests were processed including just under 7000 in Auckland alone . 42,226 vaccine doses were administered , comprising roughly 9000 first doses and 33,000 second doses . <p> Meanwhile , the Ministry of Health has confirmed the case reported in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " While the case remains under investigation , the public health risk is deemed low given the person 's vaccination status , regular test history , good use of the NZ Covid Tracer app and rapid contact , testing and isolation of family members , all of whom also returned negative results , " said a spokesperson . <p> Finally : there are no new community cases to report in Waikato today . All 31 existing cases have been linked to the original index case in the region , believed to be the first case reported in Hamilton East . Yesterday across the region , 1,212 swabs were taken , and 3,292 vaccinations administered . <h> 12.50pm : A special note from The Spinoff publisher Duncan Greive <p> While we wait for the 1pm update , a note from The Spinoff 's managing editor Duncan Greive : <p> Without wanting to get too Bernie Sanders-meme with it , I am once again asking you to consider donating to help The Spinoff .

" This person came to Northland with a gang member assigned essential worker status , falsified the reason she was coming , " Peters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning said there was no evidence of this , Peters has continued to raise suspicions . " Was there any association between the Mongrel Mob and these two women ? ... In terms of the health of Northlanders , we should know that now , " Peters told The AM Show . <p> In a follow-up post on his favourite social media platform , Twitter , Peters accused the government of refusing to share information . <p> If the govt knows who the second woman is who travelled around Northland with a COVID case , then Northlanders need be told who she is as only Northlanders will know where she has been -- and is now . <p> The govts refusal to share the info just guarantees the virus is spread . <h> 10.30am : PM should have fronted media yesterday , says Collins <p> There were 60 community cases yesterday -- the highest since the start of September . <p> Collins said people would have been unsettled by the rise in new cases and someone from the government should have fronted on camera . " National have been critical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when case numbers were very low , but if Jacinda Ardern thought it necessary to speak directly to the media then , why now with 60 cases is she missing in action ? " asked Collins . <p> There are questions that the prime minister does not want to be asked , said Collins , repeating her claim that gangs have been spreading Covid-19 . " Now is the most important time for Jacinda Ardern to face the media . " <h> 9.10am : Visitor to Waitakere Hospital tests positive for Covid-19 <p> A person has tested positive for the virus after arriving at the hospital yesterday . They were tested based on displaying Covid-related symptoms symptoms and returned a positive result . <p> Three non-clinical staff will be stood down and patients in the area at the time have been identified .

" I am worried that gangs are being made the fall guys for something that they have had no control over , " said Brash in a press release . <p> " We are told that gangs are responsible for spreading this virus . If that 's true , the government should confirm it . If there is evidence -- let 's see it . " <h> 8.20am : Another major cabinet decision looms <p> As happens most Mondays at the moment , Cabinet will meet today to discuss alert level restrictions . But this week , it 's not just Aucklanders waiting to hear what Jacinda Ardern will announce . Currently , parts of Waikato and all of Northland remain under the older , stricter , level three lockdown while Auckland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows for picnics . <p> All of these will be reviewed today , with the PM and director general of health Ashley Bloomfield set to reveal next steps at the traditional 4pm press conference . <h> 8.05am : NZ confirms purchase of new antiviral Covid-19 treatment <p> New Zealand has purchased 60,000 doses of an experimental Covid-19 treatment called molnupiravir . <p> It follows similar orders being made by countries like Australia , but the drug will not be rolled out until it has passed a Medsafe assessment . Overseas reports have claimed the antiviral med could see hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 halved . <p> " Antiviral medicines are an additional tool the Government is adding to our toolbox to fight Covid-19 , " prime minister Jacinda Ardern said . " We are continuing to use a stamp it out strategy . But this purchase of 60,000 courses is based on the same population basis as the likes of Australia and Singapore , and is not an assumption about the level of Covid we may have in the future . " <p> Ardern said the pill could help alleviate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still the best way forward . " This purchase ensures we have molnupiravir to treat those with mild to moderate Covid-19 , " said Ardern . " But I ask all New Zealanders to get vaccinated as the best protection from the virus and so we can regain our way of life with as few restrictions as possible . " <h> 7.45am : Katikati Covid-19 case retests negative <p> The Bay of Plenty can let out a sigh of relief . A person in Katikati reported as testing positive for Covid-19 over the weekend has been retested and returned a negative result . Their family members have also subsequently tested negative . <p> Speaking to RNZ , prime minister Jacinda Ardern said the person had a high CT , which could indicate an historic case or that the person was just beginning their infectious period . <p> While Ardern said the Bay of Plenty could now relax : " We want people to continue to be vaccinated . " <p> She said while this test was ultimately negative , it showed the delta outbreak was not just an issue for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lockdown has sparked a war of words between gang leaders and Winston Peters . The former deputy prime minister went on Newshub to claim without evidence that a positive case who plunged the region into level three was travelling with Mongrel Mob leader Harry Tam . He 's categorically denied the allegation . It 's unclear where Peters is getting his information . What is is clear is that Covid-19 minister Chris Hipkins , during an emergency press conference on Friday evening to announce the lockdown , was frustrated with this latest case . She 's refused to cooperate with health authorities for contact tracing , was hard to track down and travelled to Northland using false documents . A second person with her has evaded contact tracers as well . <p> The Covid numbers : 56 new community cases were reported yesterday in Auckland , 3 in Waikato and 1 in Bay of Plenty . 61% ( 20 ) of the previous day 's total were in the community while infectious . There are now 423 active cases . 81,831 people were vaccinated Saturday . <p> Life with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulletin currently in France , wrote in response to last week 's announcement of a vaccine passport for New Zealand about the situation with the French version , known as a health pass ( pass sanitaire ) : <p> " We now have a QR code on our phones which we have to show at any restaurant , museum , public venue or to fly . It 's straight forward . It means that we no longer have to keep a record of where we go by scanning QR codes of the places we visit . The important difference is that you can get a health pass for 72 hours by having a negative Covid-19 test . These are done at pharmacies for a fee of 25 euros . This means that unvaccinated people can go places ... although at the cost and inconvenience of having tests . " <p> This is part of The Bulletin , The Spinoff 's must-read daily news wrap .

@@33311235 <p> At the start of a big week for vaccination in New Zealand , Siouxsie Wiles and Toby Morris lay out the stakes , and tackle the frequently asked questions . <p> The Spinoff 's ongoing Covid coverage depends on support from members . Learn more here . <p> Listen up , Aotearoa . This week , culminating in Super Saturday , we 're making a really big push to get as many people vaccinated as possible . Why ? Because the clocks have changed , the weather is improving , and summer is just around the corner . <p> But this summer is likely to be really different to last summer . Last year , we did n't have Covid-19 in our community . This year , the delta variant is here . That means to stand a chance of spending this summer doing the things we enjoy with the people we love we need everyone who can be vaccinated to roll up their sleeve and get vaccinated . <p> Why Super Saturday ? Because time is ticking , and the vaccine does n't work straight away . The Pfizer vaccine requires two ( identical ) doses for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protection two weeks after you get your first dose but wo n't be fully protected until one to two weeks after your second dose . That means to be ready for summer , you need to get your first dose now . You do n't have to wait till Super Saturday , but if you do get your first dose that day , and your second dose three weeks later , you 'll be fully vaccinated in late November . If you wait six weeks between doses , then you 'll be fully vaccinated by mid-December . <p> If you 've still got questions , we 've have pulled together this FAQ which will hopefully help . If you are already on the V Team , then spend this week helping to get your unvaccinated friends and family over the line so that come Super Saturday they 'll roll up their sleeves and join the rest of us . Most importantly , though , approach them with patience , understanding , and empathy . <p> How were the vaccines developed so fast ? <p> No shortage of money and super-streamlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true the vaccine trials will continue for the next few years ? <p> Yes , but this does n't mean we do n't have enough information to use the vaccines now . Rather , the trials are continuing because we need to know how long a person 's protective immune response lasts after they 've been vaccinated . We 're also getting information on the millions of people around the world like us being vaccinated outside of those trials . <p> What 's in the Pfizer vaccine ? <p> You can check out the Consumer Medicine Information summary for the Pfizer Comirnaty vaccine from Medsafe here . <p> The " active " ingredient is the recipe our cells need to make the SARS-CoV-2 virus spike protein . It comes in the form of mRNA and is very fragile . Because the mRNA ca n't enter our cells on its own , it 's wrapped in what 's called a lipid nanoparticle coat . That 's a fancy way of saying teeny tiny balls of fat . The other ingredients are salts and a sugar called sucrose . The sucrose keeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low temperatures . <p> Who ca n't take the Pfizer vaccine ? <p> The only people who ca n't take the vaccine are people who are allergic to any of the ingredients . Because the teeny tiny fat balls are used to deliver other medicines too , some people may have already made antibodies to them . The likely candidate is the lipid ( 2-hexyldecanoate ) , 2 ( polyethylene glycol ) -2000-N , N-ditetradecylacetamide . <p> Who can take the Pfizer vaccine ? <p> Everyone who is n't allergic to any of the ingredients . The vaccine is safe if you are pregnant , trying to get pregnant , or breastfeeding . I 've written a lot more about that here . It 's also safe for people with cancer , HIV , and who are immune compromised . <p> Do I really need to get vaccinated even if I 'm young and healthy ? <p> Yes ! As Toby and I have explained before , Covid is a multiplayer game , and we need every player on the field . If you are worried about the health of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you should get vaccinated here . <p> Why do we need two doses , and should I wait three or six weeks between them ? <p> The trials showed that one dose offers some protection , but we get much better protection with two . The trials tested a three-week gap between doses but countries like the UK and Canada rolled out the vaccine using a longer gap . Studies are suggesting people might make a better or longer-lasting immune response with the longer gap , but the data is still for from crystal clear . That means either gap is fine but with Covid-19 in the community , it would be better to take the three-week gap . I 'm between doses and moving mine to the three weeks so I can get my second dose this week . <p> Is it true vaccinated people can still get Covid ? <p> Yes , but their chances are much , much , much lower . I 've explained more about that here . But it 's also why it 's really important that we still wear masks even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I 'd say so , but what kind and when is n't clear yet . I 've written all about that here . It 's likely that the elderly and those with compromised immune systems will be getting them sooner than everyone else and I imagine the Ministry of Health 's vaccine taskforce are looking at the data now . <p> How does the Pfizer vaccine actually work ? <p> The vaccine uses a process that happens in our cells every single minute of the day . Our genetic material is in the form of DNA which sits inside a special compartment in our cells called the nucleus . When a gene is turned on , its DNA is copied into mRNA . This process is called transcription . The mRNA then makes a one-way trip out of the nucleus and into the main body of the cell , known as the cytoplasm . In the cytoplasm are little machines called ribosomes , which take the mRNA and build a protein out of the message it contains . This process is called translation . <p> As I explained earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recipe to make the virus 's spike protein encased in a lipid nanoparticle coat . When it 's injected into our body , the lipid nanoparticles help the mRNA get taken up by some of the cells that are hanging around in our arm . Once inside the cytoplasm of the cells , the mRNA is unwrapped from its lipid coat and used by our ribosomes to make the spike protein . <p> Once the spike protein is made , the cell destroys the mRNA , so it probably only hangs around for a few hours or days . The cell also chops up the spike protein and displays the pieces on its surface for our immune cells to see . That triggers our immune response which trains our immune cells to recognise the spike protein and so destroy the real SARS-CoV-2 virus if they see it in the future . <p> How will we know the long-term effects of vaccines ? <p> Its true that vaccines have only been used for a short time so we ca n't know for certain how they will affect us long term . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing that would suggest they are going to have long term effects . It 's a little bit technical , but Dr Helen Petousis-Harris has written a nice summary of how the safety of the Covid vaccines is being assessed here . <p> How do I talk to my friends and family who 've fallen for misinformation ? <p> The important thing to remember is to approach people with patience , understanding , and empathy . You wo n't be able to help them by getting angry and shouting facts and figures at them . Instead , you need to approach the task not as a battle to be won , but as a conversation to get to the underlying reasons why someone has been susceptible to misinformation in the first place . That means asking questions and really listening to their answers . Find the values you share and build from there . <p> I 've written more about this here , as well as how to spot misinformation here . I 'd also recommend you read up on the Disinformation Dozen and Pandemic Profiteers here . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce . We rely on donations to fund our work .

@@33311236 <h> Staying in the loop <p> Colt sizes up another roomful of Eternalists to be overcome in Bethesda 's new Deathloop . IMAGE : SUPPLIED <p> DEATHLOOP <p> From : Bethesda <p> For : PS5 , PC ? ? ? + <p> By HAYDEN MEIKLE <p> This seems like one of those games that will either knock your socks off or leave you wondering what all the fuss is about . <p> Deathloop has certainly provoked some polarising opinions since its launch as a timed console exclusive for the PS5 -- ironic , as it comes from Bethesda , now owned by Xbox maker Microsoft . <p> Perhaps ' ' polarising ' ' is a bit strong . It does seem a lot of leading gaming outlets have given Deathloop a perfect score or close to it , regarding it as perhaps the best game released in this still-young new console generation . <p> But some regard it as merely average . Others , like me , can see a lot of good things in the game but also wonder if it is really as jaw-droppingly amazing as others seem to think . <p> Deathloop has n't grabbed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ghost of Tsushima or the 26 different Fifas I own , and I ca n't quite put my finger on why . Possibly it is residual scarring from Returnal , the similar-but-different rogue-like shooter that landed on PS5 earlier this year and used a vaguely equivalent structure , and also drove me nuts . <p> In this , you play Colt , an assassin stuck in a time loop on an island called Blackreef , used by a scientist called Egor Serling to experiment with the concept of immortality . <p> Colt was once a Visionary , one of the eight people drawn to Serling 's cause , who were given the freedom of the island with the hedonistic ability to do whatever they liked all day , surrounded by hangers-on called Eternalists , then wake up the next day with no memory and the chance to cut loose all over again . <p> The time loop suddenly spits out an anomaly -- or two . Colt develops the ability to retain his memory and starts to realise things are not ideal . And a woman called Julianna also breaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and must be stopped . The cat-and-mouse game is on . <p> Gameplay is split over four regions at four different times of day , and Colt 's quest is to track down his eight targets and learn how and where they can be taken out . <p> It 's a trial-and-error process , as the loop resets at the end of each day , or when Colt is eliminated himself . So you follow leads , retain key information about the targets and use it to work out how to do the ' ' perfect run ' ' -- whacking all eight targets in a day . <p> Colt can also unlock and earn various power-ups that can help him achieve his quest . <p> There is a multiplayer element ( which can be turned off ) in which opposing gamers can assume the role of Julianna and enter your game to turn you from hunter to hunted . <p> There is a lot of information to process but the game does a good job in presenting it , and in reminding you what you need to doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stealth elements mixed with a bit of parkour and wild gunplay , and it 's all set in a cool art deco-ish world that has the flavour of the Swinging Sixties . <p> If you like a bit of humour and chaos , Deathloop has plenty going for it . <p> My only real word of caution is that some will not enjoy the whole loop mechanic , and this might be a case of being in it for a good time , not a long time . 
@@33311237 <h> Practising the art of salvage <p> The arts , and our artists , in Aotearoa , and even more so here in the South , are suffering , writes H J Kilkelly . <p> H J Kilkelly <p> The image of an artist is different for everyone . Tortured outsiders , committed to a life of poverty in the pursuit of beauty , mystical sorts , twirling endlessly/standing in front of a canvas whenever the mood strikes/writing flowing easily from the veins , complaining a lot , but that 's OK , coz , oh , the suffering makes for better art , does n't it ? <p> Even what is art is underestimated . I challenge anyone to go a day without engaging with any kind of art ; it 's the shows you might go to , yes , but it 's also the music you listen to , the design of the products you 're buying , the books , podcasts , films , TV shows you engage with ... it 's much , much more , but our artists are drowning and I can assure you , it 's not romantic in the slightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Aotearoa who has chosen the arts as their field of practice , have heard every possible argument or sentiment possible about our careers . Could n't you just choose to do something else ? What 's your " real " job ? Yeah , but is n't that , like , your hobby ? I mean , it 's your passion - why should you be paid for it ? It never gets old hearing the unsolicited suggestions of " have I considered .. ? " coz yeah , I probably have , thanks . <p> For those who dismiss the arts ' contribution , the economics alone are pretty staggering . Figures from Manatu Taonga , the Ministry for Culture and Heritage , show that in the first month of the Delta alert level restrictions there was an estimated $466 million loss of economic activity - a daily average of $13.3 million . <p> Not only do we contribute to the economy , artists are consistently held up as pou for society 's greater wellbeing , the arts as fundamental to our humanity , bringing empathy and entertainment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ societies . In Aotearoa , the wellbeing of our arts practitioners , ironically , is potentially the worst it has ever been . <p> I 'm a producer . Not many people know what that actually means . Let 's just say it 's multifaceted . But Emily , the other half of my production company , recently referred to what we 've been doing increasingly of late as salvage , an exercise becoming more common in the current durational piece , Already Stuffed Arts Ecology Meets Pandemic . <p> Some have coined the term " unproducing " , referring specifically to when we 're undoing the months ( and sometimes longer ) of work that have gone into preparing for an event suddenly mothballed by a level change . Salvage , unfortunately , even more devastatingly , sees us picking through the remains of chopped contracts , unsuccessful funding applications , increasing spends with lesser resources , and deciding what projects to keep , what to postpone , who to let down and what to just give up on . <p> I hear you say , well , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but let 's now add to that the vulnerability of not only having your creative work out there for everyone to judge and be an expert on , to have your extremely limited resources dictated by archaic structures outside your control and to consistently be picked apart by those who consider supporting the arts a waste of money when there 's " more important " things to fund , all the while maintaining your integrity , your reputation , your track record , because did I mention , unlike the start-up sector where the expected first-year fail rate is about 90% , we get often just one chance to prove ourselves , or struggle for decades to even get on the funding hamster wheel . <p> As a company , we are " lucky " . We sell out most events we do . By all artistic accounts , we 're considered successful . However , cultural success is not financial success . Cultural success is also not wellbeing success . <p> The arts , and our artists , in Aotearoa , and even more so here in the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and if we do n't start acknowledging this , lifting up our artists and truly recognising the need for what we bring to a society , we 're going to face an attrition rate with unchecked momentum . Art reflects our history , documents our lives and speaks truths often too confronting to face without a fourth wall to protect us from the reality . We 've got something to offer the world , immense skillsets and , you know what , would really appreciate it if folks would stop suggesting we get " real " jobs . #valuethearts.

It is anticipated that the services market globally will top US$1.1 trillion in 2021 . <p> And there 's more good news on horizon , with IDC anticipating that the market will continue to expand through 2023 and 2024 with growth between 3.8 per cent to 4.0 per cent annually . <p> These anticipated growth rates come after a broad slowdown in growth that struck in 2020 , as COVID-19 embarked on its rampant march around the world . <p> IDC 's mid-term and long-term market growth expectations have actually increased slightly from its previous forecasts in April by 20 to 50 basis points each year , pushing the market 's anticipated long-term growth rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 4.1 per cent . <p> The main driver for this positive shift has been stronger demand for IT and business services across several regions outside the United States , particularly in areas where large government-led digitalisation programs and schemes are taking place , including in the Asia Pacific region , according to the firm . <p> However , IDC also noted that its Asia Pacific growth outlook has not changed significantly since its last forecast but continues to show steady recovery . <p> The growth outlook for the larger economies , such as Japan , South Korea and Australia , remains in the 2 per cent to 3 per cent range while the smaller economies are clocking faster growth , the firm claimed . <p> In fact , IDC has lifted its near-term and long-term growth forecasts for New Zealand and Singapore by 15 to 20 and more than 30 basis points , respectively . <p> As for the other emerging markets in the broader APJ region , the firm 's outlook remains largely unchanged , with the analyst firm suggesting those countries can still enjoy a better growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short-term growth is more susceptible to extraneous factors . <p> " The need for digital transformation and the demographic squeeze on ( the right ) talent pool , expedited by the pandemic , global supply chain disruptions and lose monetary policies , have created the perfect push and pull for enterprise buyers ; therefore , our long-term growth outlook for the IT and business services market remains sanguine , " said Xiao-Fei Zhang , IDC global services markets and trends research director . <p> " Additionally , we are seeing large services providers also making big bets , both organic and inorganically , on the operations and product side , which enjoys more than twice the market growth of the existing IT/business services market , according to our latest Digital Engineering &amp; Operational Technology Tracker 's latest figures , " he added . <p> And while some segments have seen greater growth than others , it is clear that this year has so far witnessed some level of investment resurgence . <p> Industry analyst firm Synergy Research claimed earlier this year that cloud infrastructure services spend in the second quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter and a surge of 39 per cent over the tally for the second quarter of 2020 . <p> However , the firm 's latest estimate was still up by 53 per cent year-on-year when looking back at the same quarter last year . <p> Meanwhile , the as-a-service market in the region was up 62 per cent quarter-on-quarter to a record US$3.1 billion , ISG noted . <p> Clearly , the future continues to look rosy . <p> " The demand environment for technology and business services is as robust as we 've ever seen , " said Steve Hall , partner and president of ISG . <p> " This is not just pent-up demand coming out of the pandemic , but a real structural shift for the market as enterprise customers accelerate their digital transformation strategies , modernise their legacy environments and move to the cloud . <p> " We see this trend continuing for the foreseeable future , even against some economic headwinds .

As the prime minister announced this morning , that means the virus is spreading in a way that means we need to take action to protect the most vulnerable and to prevent pressure on the health system . <p> What does this red setting mean ? Is it basically lockdown ? <p> By no means . The red setting , which comes into place when the health system is facing an unsustainable number of hospitalisations and action is needed to protect at-risk populations , means hospitality and retail can open , but there will be limits on gathering sizes and physical distancing measures required . <p> Schools will open , but with public health measures in place . <p> Working from home will be encouraged , and masks will be mandated in the settings where they are now . <p> As Jacinda Ardern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amount of freedom relative to what Auckland has now .

" <p> How far off is Auckland from reaching 90% double dosed ? <p> As of the Ministry of Health 's Wednesday update , all three Auckland DHBs are at 89.1% ( 16,000 vaccines away from hitting 90% , according to the prime minister ) , and 72.8% for second doses . <p> Cool , but when will Aucklanders be able to leave the city and travel around the country ? <p> Decisions are yet to be made on whether people could move out of Auckland when it is in the traffic light framework and the rest of the country still in the alert level system , but they are working on a system which would require vaccine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a significant logistical challenge ... but we expect for the holiday period , people will want to be reunited , we have set ourselves a goal to try and establish whether or not this will be possible in time for those milestones .

A couple of weeks ago , Auckland moved into step one of the plan -- we can have double-bubble outdoor catch-ups , do outdoor exercise classes and send our kids to early childhood learning centres , basically . The second step would allow retail outlets to open , with masks and physical distancing , as well as public facilities such as pools and zoos , and up to 25 people to gather outside . <p> " We have a collective goal now -- but in the meantime , we will keep assessing the settings we have , and if it 's safe to do so , use the step downs we have already talked about , " said Jacinda Ardern during her speech announcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject , Ardern added : " Until Auckland moves we 'll keep using the steps .

The rest of the country must wait for every DHB to hit 90% . At that point , the country will move collectively to the orange setting .

" Whole of health system is focusing resources but can manage -- primary care , public health , and hospitals . Increasing risk to at risk populations .

Tertiary education will have to be distance learning only . <p> Will any financial assistance kick in when we 're at red ? <p> Yes . Finance minister Grant Robertson this morning said he will be proposing financial support targeted at the most affected businesses when the red setting is in place . <p> " One of the issues that we are working through is what to do in terms of businesses who decide not to be part of the vaccine certificate regime , " he said .

@@33352234 <h> Creeping beauty : An appreciation of moss <p> The weird flat plant has been unloved for too long , writes Sharon Lam . <p> In 2014 I discovered a very cute trend of marimo moss balls , little spheres of moss that can grow with just a bit of daylight in a glass of water . Impulsively , I bought one off AliExpress for $2 . When it arrived I researched how to keep it alive , wanting the best for my new lifelong friend . It was only then that I discovered they were actually very illegal in New Zealand . If released into waterways , the cute moss balls were capable of didymo-esque terror , and a Christchurch student in 2012 had gone to court for importing and selling them locally . I immediately " turned myself in " and a biosecurity employee came in a high-vis jumpsuit to take the unopened parcel away . <p> Marimo moss is not actually moss . It is an algae , originating in ponds rather than on land . In general , moss is not a transplantable being , and is almost impossible to grow and replicate on command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Without shoots or roots , and with leaves that are only a cell thick , they have quite remarkably sown themselves in almost every type of ecosystem on Earth in some 12,000 variations . <p> In the extremely good book Gathering Moss , Robin Wall Kimmerer explains the troubles a very rich unnamed figure goes to curate his own authentic moss garden . He hires a team of round-the-clock specialists and consultants , including Kimmerer . She can only recommend spraying theoretical " moss milkshakes " , insisting that moss simply takes time , and lots of it . In the end he resorts to pillaging a nearby forest , cutting and pasting mosses into his artificial arena . When they inevitably die , they are replaced via more pillaging . Was buying marimo moss online any better ? <p> I later came into a less pillagy way to appreciate moss . It was a trip during architecture school , when a group of us visited Ian Athfield 's former home , a sprawling amalgamation of rooms across the Khandallah hillside . It was blue , sunny . Atop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemingly at eye level , it felt like Santorini ( at least for someone whose entire impression of Santorini is from The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants 2 ) . <p> Among the architectural wonder and poor person 's Mediterranean illusion , I became distracted by something else . A bright yellow patina screamed out across various white horizontal surfaces . I took out my camera and snapped away . The yellow looked like a flattened coral reef , with all its colour and complexity growing within the width of a half-height wall . In the rivulets and rosettes were visions of shapes , animals , the future , hidden resentments , and so on . It was the first time I really saw lichen and moss . <p> Beautiful ( image : supplied ) <p> Like an ex in Wellington , I started seeing it everywhere . On the war-era remnants of Matiu Island , on fences in suburban Christchurch . It being 2016 , I made a dedicated Tumblr to post the miniature landscapes . I always took the photos top-down , with the moss removed from its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and focused . In captions , I named each one based on instinctual flavour -- Cookie Monster , Mermaid , July , Not Too Much . <p> In the five years since , I have collected photographs of moss and lichen from Cape Reinga to Orokonui , the temple walls of Angkor Wat , tree trunks of Borneo rainforests and rocks of Okinawa beaches . I moved my blog to Instagram , keeping the name " Moss and Me " . After taking hundreds of photos , I felt like I should actually learn about moss and lichen and very quickly realised the name was not just grammatically incorrect but also scientifically incorrect ( most of the photos are of pure lichen , with no moss , and while both are non-vascular , moss is an individual plant while lichen is a combination of algae and fungi growing together ) . <p> I started to add amateur scientific identification , courtesy of the free introductory NZ lichen guide by Dr Allison Knight . I learnt that moss was used by indigenous women in North America and Aotearoa as sanitary pads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hibernation . I learnt that lichen has had notable value in history , with people in the 19th century scraping the rocks of Scotland to sell as colour dye and people in the 21st century scraping off " sexy pavement lichen " to sell as Viagra . Their value is in part due to their slow growth -- up to 2cm a year . Undisturbed , a single lichen can outlive civilisations ( up to 10,000 years ) and lichenometry helped determine the age of the Moai of Easter Island . <p> Suddenly , I got what Kimmerer meant by " moss coloured glasses " . It was not about having a jar of illegal moss on a coffee table . It was understanding how " attentiveness alone can rival the most powerful magnifying lens " . The green , yellows and oranges of slivers of city and country were now appearing as a Kill Bill-esque alarm system , alerting me to a whole new layer of life .

And yet for most of us , we 've hardly tried to get to know moss at all . We have come into their world to hose them out with brute force and chemicals , and for what gain ? Moss and lichen are highly sensitive to pollution -- if anything , their continued presence should be reassuring , not encroaching . <p> Perhaps , like many acts of antagonism , it stems from fear . Instinctively we understand that they were here before us , and will be here long after . As the ethereal movie The Green Knight poses : " We deck our halls with it and dye our linens.But should it come creeping up the cobbles , we scrub it out , fast as we can .... green is what is left when ardour fades , when passion dies , when we die , too ... moss shall cover your tombstone , and as the sun rises , green shall spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all you hold dear will succumb to it .

@@33382237 <h> Effective representation via STV <p> There is an Extraordinary Council meeting this Thursday where we will be discussing the Tairawhiti resource management plan governance options , some committee recommendations to council , reports of the Chief Executive , the Representation Review Final Proposal , and Gisborne Holdings Ltd 's 2021 annual general meeting and appointment of shareholder policy . <p> Council 's strategic planning team is leading a review of the Tairawhiti Resource Management Plan ( TRMP ) . Having a strong and appropriate governance body in place , in terms of decision-making , will support the successful delivery of the TRMP review and freshwater planning programme . It is the role of governance to provide vision , direction and leadership to support implementation . Preliminary discussions have been had with mana whenua about forming a co-governance committee to support the TRMP review process . This review will take years to complete so having a co-governance committee to tackle this is an ideal situation . <p> The Representation Review Final Proposal for representation arrangements for the 2022 triennial election will be voted on during Thursday 's meeting . Council is required to resolve a final proposal that best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair and effective representation and publicly notify this . In notifying the final proposal , Council is required to state both the reasons for any amendments to the initial proposal and the reasons for the rejection of submissions . <p> In light of this requirement , and in particular the call by many submitters to establish separate rural and urban general wards , staff have requested more analysis of the potential of the single transferrable vote ( STV ) electoral system to provide effective representation of the district 's communities of interest . This analysis has now found STV can provide effective representation for both communities of interest spread across Gisborne District and locally geographically-based communities of interest . However , this will only occur in " at-large " elections or in sufficiently large wards generally considered to be at least five-member wards . This supports the council 's decision for its final proposal to provide two district-wide wards . <p> An " at-large " election for eight councillors from one general ward and five elected from one Maori ward would also have the following further benefits compared to separate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general voters to vote for all general councillors , giving them a sense of having a greater say in running the district . <p> It provides voters with a greater choice of candidates . <p> It provides residents with more choice when approaching councillors after the elections . <p> It makes it easier for councillors to act in the interest of the whole district in line with oath to office . <p> It frees council from the constraint of the +/- 10% rule and the requirement to seek local government commission endorsement of any non-compliance with the rule . <p> The final proposal will be subject to appeals from earlier submitters . The appeals will be considered by the Local Government Commission and they can choose to hold a hearing if they wish to . <p> We are all shaking our heads in disbelief after the Government announced its intention to continue with its 3 Waters reform programme last week .

While not debating the pros or cons of either election method it is significant that there was no binding referendum for such a change in Gisborne district yet the Government felt obliged for such a need when a change was made nationally to MMP .

But they did n't because they had orders to only show their faces if their nemeses " the Deviants " should happen to show up . <p> We are told these " Eternals " have been living among us for seven thousand years . They have been there for pretty much every event that Billy Joel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few more besides . Although , to be fair , finding a rhyme for " Tenochtitlan " ( y'know , the last great city of the Aztecs ) might have challenged even Billy 's undoubted genius for the pithy couplet . <p> However , around 500 years ago , the Eternals destroyed the last of the Deviants -- who , it turns out , look like something between a dragon and a Rottweiler , but made out of left-over pasta -- and for the last half-a-millennia they 've just been kinda hanging , doing their own thing , making their own lives and slowly losing touch with each other . <p> Supplied <p> Eternals is overlong , overstuffed with character and has too much explaining to do while it lays out its story .

Summer berries and stone fruits might not make an appearance , but there are plenty of seasonal varieties best enjoyed with snow on the ground . On this list , you 'll find fruits that are probably available at your grocery store anytime of the year , but are in their prime -- and will definitely taste best -- during the winter months . Spoiler : Citrus is king . Lemons , oranges , and grapefruits are all in season during this time . Maybe this year for the holidays you make a bright and zesty citrus salad to go alongside that roast ? ! <p> Clementine <p> Photo credit : Isabelle Rozenbaum - Getty Images <p> These are the perfect little transportable citrus snack .

I find it a bit too tart and slightly bitter to eat on its own without a sprinkle of sugar to balance it out . Either way , you 'll have plenty of the softball-sized citrus starting in January all the way through early summer . <p> Here 's a hack : Instead of peeling these , slice them open and scoop out each bite with a spoon . Typically , they are available starting in the winter through the spring , at least the ones grown in California . They are sweet with tiny , edible , crunchy black seeds .

It 's the best time to enjoy those sweet , juicy , and sour little fruits , oranges included . Look out for these November through May .

@@33417238 <h> Peter Dunne <p> As political proclamations go , it was neither the boldest nor the most inspiring , but , in the circumstances , probably one of the more realistic of recent times . <p> Judith Collins ' assertion that she would be still Leader of the National Party next year is probably true as far as it goes , but it also acknowledges implicitly that she is likely to face a challenge at that time . <p> Since she took the leadership in mid-2020 because she was the only candidate still standing after the disastrous Todd Muller interlude , she has effectively been on borrowed time . <p> After all , no one expected National to come within a bull 's roar of winning Labour 's 2020 Covid-19 election . The absolute best Collins could have hoped for was to staunch the gaping wound and limit National 's losses . <p> In the event she could not do so -- although to be fair she tried her best ( besting the Prime Minister in at least two of the three television debates ) but she was not helped by the various scandals that emerged at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader who led National to one of its most ignominious defeats . <p> Unlikely second chance <p> But even if she had succeeded and done better , her survival as leader was unlikely . <p> National has always been more ruthless in dealing with leaders who lose elections than Labour . Walter Nash , Norman Kirk , and Bill Rowling lost more elections for Labour than they ever won , and Mike Moore was given another chance after Labour 's 1990 annihilation -- but Jim Bolger is the only National leader since the days of Holyoake to be given a second chance immediately after losing an election . <p> So , the prospect of Judith Collins retaining the National Party leadership on a long-term basis has always seemed fanciful . <p> Much has been made of National 's woeful performance in Opposition as a reason for getting rid of Collins , although that is probably overstated . National has certainly bungled many opportunities since the election to score heavily against Labour , but at the end that may not count for all that much . There would have been few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2017 , yet it was still able to claim power , albeit in unusual circumstances , after the 2017 election . <p> Two questions facing National <p> The old maxim , " Oppositions do not win elections , governments lose them " remains relevant . <p> For these reasons , only two questions remain about the National Party leadership -- when will the coup occur , and who the next leader will be . The first question is probably harder to answer than the second . <p> At this point , the first quarter of next year seems the most likely time . Within that , the usual Caucus retreat in early February would be the obvious moment . That would enable the Party to begin the new Parliamentary year with the new leadership in place and give the new leader time to both define their style and build the team around them . It would also allow about 20 months before the 2023 election to put together the policy platform and select the best candidates to put National in the strongest position it could be to contest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Party can not afford to let things drift on much beyond Easter next year , for practical reasons . They are less to do with voter appeal than they are with candidate selection and fundraising . <p> Bridges reinvented <p> Good prospective candidates are unlikely to come forward if there are still doubts about the leadership and National looks set for another drubbing . The same applies to potential donors who will be unwilling to make significant donations to another campaign like that of 2020 . <p> The question of who the new leader will be is less unclear . <p> Simon Bridges is the obvious choice . <p> He is untainted by having led National to an election defeat -- he was deposed several months before the last election -- and more importantly , has assiduously reinvented himself as a kinder , gentler figure . <p> In so doing , he has followed the tried-and-true path of a political comeback . First , came the cultivation of a more laid-back and relaxed public image -- in his case , slightly longer and more unruly hair , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was the gentle self-mocking on television chat and game shows , carefully showing a softer and more humorous side than the brash politician he came across as previously . <p> There was also the mandatory book , so overtly not about politics , yet covertly setting out the new Bridges ' message . And all the while , accompanied by the constant denials of ever wanting or intending to seek the party leadership again . <p> Not without precedence <p> While Bridges ' return would be unusual in the context of New Zealand politics , it is not without precedent -- Sir Bill English came back to the National Party leadership in 2016 , thirteen years after being deposed , although the circumstances were vastly different . <p> A more interesting parallel comes from across the Tasman . <p> John Howard was an abrasive and brash Treasurer under Malcolm Fraser . <p> Howard subsequently became leader of the Liberal Party but was dropped in 1989 because he was seen as no match for then Labor Prime Minister Bob Hawke . Once Hawke had departed the scene ( and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional election defeats ) a more mellow Howard was restored as party leader , going on to win four consecutive elections and become Australia 's longest-serving Prime Minister since the dominance of Sir Robert Menzies from the 1940s to the 1960s . <p> There is still a mighty long way to go before National can even dare to dream of such a heady future . It can not happen until National closes the door on its last two disastrous years . Changing the leader is but the first step . More important will be the development of a coherent policy programme and message to the electorate at large , which still seems as far away as ever . Yet that will be the difference between National looking like a genuine contender at the next election and just another also-ran the way it does at present . <p> Changing the leader will not of itself change that -- but it will put the Party in a position where it can look forward once more . <p> Simon Bridges will therefore need to show he really has risen above the failings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's plan for the country 's future .

@@33426231 <h> Wairau scheme ' demonstrates its worth ' during July weather event <p> The value of the Wairau River Stopbank Scheme in protecting residents on the Wairau Plain from flood was tested to its very limit during the region 's recent storm event . <p> On July 17 the stopbank network withstood what is now thought to be at or just below the 1 in 100-year design flood for the Scheme . <p> " The return period for the 17 July flood still requires detailed assessment but based on the 1992 hydrology review it will be at or just below the 1 in 100-year design flood , " Rivers and Drainage Engineering Manager Geoff Dick told Council 's Assets and Services Committee last week . <p> The flood event 's peak flow has now been assessed as being in the range of 5200 - 5300 cumecs or just below the target scheme design flow of 5500m3 . <p> Mr Dick presented a comprehensive report on the flood event to the committee including an assessment of the scheme 's performance , a summary of the damage , the repairs proposed and capital upgrades <p> He said the weather event " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a ' design ' or slightly ' below design ' flood but the scheme " did its job " . <p> Four emergency evacuations of residents occurred at Renwick lower terrace , Spring Creek , Tuamarina pocket and Morrins Hollow to ensure safety while the peak of the flood went through the system . For the majority those evacuated returned to dry undamaged homes . <p> " Overall the scheme performed well but there were three significant stopbank breaches , significant sections of stopbank that either had no freeboard or over topped and significant but expected system damage , " said Mr Dick . <p> The three key stopbank failures were at Pukaka floodway east bank , Waterfall Creek at Tuamarina pocket and lower Wairau at Morrins Hollow . Preliminary assessment suggests the Pukaka floodway and Waterfall creek breaches were due to a combination of over topping and variable stopbank construction quality over time , and at Morrins Hollow due to piping under the bank . <p> " In addition to the three breaches we had piping through a stopbank at Spring Creek due to an unsealed but redundant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tear , overtopping on the Diversion true left bank stopbank that inundated the Blind Creek pump station and complete loss of nearly 400m of edge stabilisation rock work at the Diversion mouth , " he said . <p> " Of 100-150 flood gates along the network , only two of significance leaked . Overall the scheme is considered to have performed well and consequently saved an enormous amount of associated flood damage across the lower Wairau plains . " <p> The volume of water lost into the floodplain due to either breaches or stopbank over topping was a small fraction to what a major bank breach or banks down situation would have resulted in , he said . <p> Repairs are well underway prioritising restoring full flood security to the stopbank system before next winter but a complete programme of recommended works involving more than 100 separate repair jobs at an estimated cost of $11.2M is anticipated to take until June 2024 to complete . <p> The funding of the local share balance to be found be considered as part of the current 2022-23 annual plan budget process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of total scheme asset value , well within the expected range of 3 to 10 percent for a design or near design flood event . <p> The majority of the schedule of repairs are anticipated to be eligible for LAPP ( Local Authority Protection Programme ) and NEMA ( National Emergency Management Agency ) funding which will significantly reduce the expected cost burden on scheme ratepayers . <p> Considerable thought will need to go into the work required at the Diversion to repair the 360m section of eroded bank at the river mouth and a recommendation on how best to approach this will be tabled in the new year . <p> A more detailed review of scheme performance will be undertaken once the current schedule of repairs nears completion to inform Council of options for ongoing upgrades to further increase scheme security and capacity as part of preparing the next Council Long Term Plan . <p> Assets and Services Committee Chair Clr Nadine Taylor observed that future upgrades should be seen as an investment into protecting the assets of Marlborough 's ratepayers and said funding this investment was a discussion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users .

" is no-one . Take competence for example , it will not surprise me at all if Level 5 equivalence is only an interim staging post , and in the near future , that will change to Level 7 or degree . That 's the situation ahead in Australia and they are staring down the barrel of a(nother) big adviser exodus over the next 4 years . IMO , the officials who determine the policy will just never be satisfied about anything . The new recruits to the regulators will have read about something more that they can champion in their stay in what is often a revolving door position . My big beef is actually that there is never any proper cost benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit of the consumer " as though that justifies anything . But one day the consumer advocates might wake up and see that the costs of supplier compliance are rising every day , and that it is the consumer who is actually paying those costs by way of higher fees and interest rates . I think the Regulatory Impact Statements provided by Government and officials are largely a crock and are nothing more than a tick-cross explanation ( sans any calculations supporting ) of which options of the ones they considered they preferred . IMO Treasury has lost the hard analytic focus they used to have - they too are into feelings over facts .

@@33468240 <p> The global supply chain woes flowing out of the Covid-19 pandemic have caused delays , problems and higher costs for many businesses and individuals . But they have n't been bad for everyone . John McCown , founder of New York-based Blue Alpha Capital , has crunched the numbers on just how well the container shipping industry has fared . The results are mind blowing . <p> According to McCown , net income for the container shipping industry in the third quarter of 2021 was US$48.1 billion . As he puts it , that 's a staggering US$43 billion , nine-fold increase on the US$5.1 billion profit the industry made in the third quarter last year . Interesting that third quarter 2020 figure was already nearing record highs . The sector has now delivered record earnings for four straight quarters . ( Sounds a bit like New Zealand 's banks ! ) <p> McCown points out that these results are far from what was expected at the beginning of the pandemic . So what has happened ? <p> Economic upheaval has long been associated with the rise of radical and extreme politicians . In recent times the Global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is often touted as a factor in the rise of Donald Trump , for example . <p> Going back a lot further fallout from the Great Depression is associated with the rise of Adolf Hitler and the road to World War II . Now , a working paper from the Bank for International Settlements , the central banks ' bank , looks at the role of failing banks in the rise of the Nazis . <p> We study Germany 's 1931 banking crisis , collecting new data on bank branches and firm-bank connections . Exploiting cross sectional variation in pre-crisis exposure to the bank at the center of the crisis , we show that Nazi votes surged in locations more affected by its failure . Radicalization in response to the shock was exacerbated in cities with a history of anti-Semitism . After the Nazis seized power , both pogroms and deportations were more frequent in places affected by the banking crisis . Our results suggest an important synergy between financial distress and cultural predispositions , with far-reaching consequences . <p> While different factors contributed to the financial crisis during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became largely synonymous with the collapse of Danatbank , Germany 's second-largest bank . Following a banking crisis in Austria earlier in May , German banks had endured major foreign deposit withdrawals and interbank deposits declined . Danatbank itself faced unsustainable losses when one of its borrowers , a large textile firm , defaulted . In July 1931 , it failed . Newspapers at the time quickly singled out Danat and its leading manager , Jakob Goldschmidt , as key actors during the crisis . As central bank support was limited because of depleted reserves and the political conflict between Germany and France over World War I reparations , Danatbank 's troubles triggered a bank run by retail depositors , followed by a system-wide banking crisis . <p> We show that the German banking crisis not only reduced output , but also had important political consequences . It boosted the electoral fortunes of the Nazi Party through both economic and non-economic channels . We collect historical information on bank branch networks and bank connections for the universe of 5,610 joint stock firms . These novel data enable us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all major German municipalities . Our empirical strategy exploits that the biggest German banks lent countrywide and that the German economy was heavily bank-based , with persistent bank-firm relations . <p> We establish that municipalities more exposed to collapsing Danatbank suffered sharper economic declines . Their incomes during the crisis fell by 7.8 percentage points ( p.p. ) more than the average 14 p.p. decline across cities . Crucially , bank distress bolstered the Nazi Party 's performance at the ballot box - localities affected by Danatbank 's failure voted significantly more for the Hitler movement . Figure 2 below summarizes our key finding : in locations exposed to Danatbank there was a clear upward shift in voting for the Nazis . It added up to 2.9 p.p. to the party 's votes between September 1930 and July 1932 , equal to 15% of its mean vote gain and 37% of the standard deviation . <p> Our findings are robust to a wide range of alternative specifications . We examine whether the memory of the hyperinflation ( 1921-23 ) or cities ' export exposure could account for changes in voting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Irish " Celtic Tiger " economy got a lot of good international press , and was talked up by the likes of John Key .

Over the years my outlook has changed somewhat . Without wanting to generalise too much , I now realise some of these people are just confident types , and some others are blowhards . ( Of course there are some who are both knowledgeable and confident ) . <p> These days , of course , social media provides a soapbox to anyone who wants one . <p> Self-help author Mark Manson covers all this and more in an article about the Dunning-Kruger Effect . This occurs when a person 's lack of knowledge and skills in a certain area causes them to overestimate their own competence . In contrast , this effect also causes those who excel in a given area to think the task is simple for everyone , and underestimate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . <p> Perhaps the most frustrating thing about the Dunning-Kruger effect is that it 's incredibly difficult to overcome . And that 's because it 's wrapped in contradiction . <p> How do you get someone -- or yourself -- to look for something they ca n't even see ? How do you correct an error if you do n't even know you made one ? <p> This is the paradox of trying to overcome our own ignorance : The very thing that would help us see our mistakes is the same thing that would keep us from making them in the first place . <p> You ca n't reason with a conspiracy theorist precisely because they did n't form their beliefs with reason . Had they the ability to change their beliefs based on reason and evidence , they would n't have believed in wild conspiracy theories in the first place . In fact , they think they 're the only ones being reasonable to begin with . <p> Part of the problem is that there is comfort in the feeling of knowing . People do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like we 've made more sense of the world . When we can make sense of the world , we feel safe . Whether that belief is true or not does n't matter -- it just has to give us some relief from the anxiety of not knowing . <p> The point about uncertainty is a very good one in this Covid dominated world awash with uncertainty . Many people really struggle with uncertainty , especially when they 're not used to it . Thus they 're keen to grasp onto any certainty they can find . Even though it may turn out not to be certainty at all . <p> Remember we welcome robust , respectful and insightful debate . We do n't welcome abusive or defamatory comments and will de-register those repeatedly making such comments . Our current comment policy is here . <p> The Queensland Health flyer is a nonsense - for starters influenza has hardly been controlled 1100 deaths in Oz in 2017 and 900 in 2019 , 500 odd in NZ hardly speaks of control . <p> Of the ' controlled ' diseases listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 different species who 've been infected with COVID-19 , usually from humans -- if they can harbor it , and then infect humans , then you ca n't eradicate the disease like we 've been unable to eradicate yellow fever , because monkeys get it and they just do n't like to put their arms out to get vaccinated , and it 's really tough to get them to stand in line . ' <p> The only thing controlled is the compliant media whose biggest advertisers are the government and big pharma . <p> ( BTW There were lockdowns and quarantines throughout history ( from the 14th century in Dubrovnik ) . In New Zealand there were quarantine islands up until the early 1900s . It 's a cycle we go through every few hundred years when a new disease comes along ) <p> Money is created as debt , when a bank lends money it is created as a debt to the borrower and when the loan is repaid the money no longer exists . This debt can not be passed on to future generations as it belongs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as its liability when it spends and this is an asset to the private sector and it is not a liability to future generations . <p> Larry Randall Wray is a professor of Economics at Bard College and Senior Scholar at the Levy Economics Institute and he tells us this , <p> " The Government does not , indeed , can not borrow its own currency in order to run a budget deficit . When government sells bonds it simply debits bank reserves and credits the purchaser with a treasury ( essentially just reserves with higher interest ) ; government does not obtain anything to use as a medium of exchange--it merely changes the form of its liability . Thus , bond sales and purchases are part of monetary policy -- not a borrowing operation -- they help the central bank to hit its interest rate target " . <p> " I would say they 're going down the wrong road , I mean , it 's a fool 's game , I mean this is a model of development that 's promoted across the world , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financial services centre . But as every country 's doing that , there 's a sort of race to the bottom where you have to offer some even more tax incentives , more deregulation . And ultimately it 's a loser 's game , basically . " <p> Well the Nazis , in their formative stages in search of funding , were themselves reasonably adept bank robbers and more than likely targeting the same localities that are mentioned here as giving them some electoral momentum . Hardly think that was a preconceived strategy but of some irony nevertheless . <p> There 's no shortage of houses , only a distorted concentration of ownership . <p> 38 per cent of Auckland homes are owned by investors , with similar proportions in Waikato , Bay of Plenty , and Gisborne . In Queenstown , 48 per cent are now held by investors . There is also a trend of more urban areas having a higher proportion of investors with over six properties ... In Auckland , a little over 22 per cent of investors own six or more properties .... <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number if taxation and other incentives were not available ? " But it 's a business , just like any other , and should be privilege to the same benefits ! " . <p> Answer ? No it is n't Shelter is n't a business , it 's a necessity . One from which productive business endeavours emanate , and should be treated as such . Or do we keep going down this road until we have camps of tent-dwellers festooned across Auckland , similar to those inhabited by the poor wretches in Calais at the moment ? <p> In the earlier days trading banks did not lend on residential mortgages . That was the territory of building societies , savings banks , state advances &amp; solicitors . when the trading banks entered the fray mortgage interest rates , for occupancy households , were set well below those for commercial/business activities . Somehow that margin has disappeared more or less . Surely a landlord is a business concern and should be paying the same interest on any borrowing as any other business ? <p> It 's the different collateral that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the loan is irrelevant to the lender . The fact is that houses are much easier for a bank to sell , than are businesses or business assets . And that 's largely because there 's a much larger pool of people wanting/needing to buy a house than there are people in the market to buy a business or business equipment . <p> Yes point taken . Except in the earlier scenario I mentioned that lower interest rate for household mortgages was actually imposed by the RBNZ through direct government legislation . That was not uncommon . For example the meat industry was afforded , through the meat hygiene mechanism , low interest rates to assist investment into improvements to qualify for EEC regs when the UK entered there . Seems to me that those low interest rates coupled tax write offs &amp; depreciation were far too liberal/generous for property investors/speculators in the first place . Therefore there has been precedent available to the RB to " encourage/discourage " through tiered interest rate structures . <p> Very True . With crisis be it Health , Economy and excessive money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost its value , today Million dollar has no value for many and for many others even raising thousand dollar is an issue - So rising inequality is bound to create some revolutionary changes in future . <p> Current establishment and bureaucrats , agencies have over time became Rulers instead of serving are manipulating to rule to serve their personal vested biased interest . Very hard to find leaders ! <p> This is why the United States can not industrialize as long as the house prices absorb this high a rate of income , and as long as the banking sector is supporting this , and as long as the political parties say we will not tax real estate so that all of the rising land value will be able to be pledged to banks to pay interest instead of to pay taxes . Essentially , it 's the ( lack of ) taxing of real estate in the United States that has subsidized the increase in housing prices , because housing prices are worth whatever a bank will lend to buy a house . If you have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more and this money is n't taxed away , the price is going to go up . So you have the government policy , the bank policy , all trying to promote this high diversion of income into paying land rent . Again , this is the exact opposite of what Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill and classical economics and the whole 19th century had advocated . This has priced American labor and industry out of world markets . <p> If you have to pay 43 percent of your income for rent , then even if the government were to give you all of your goods and services for nothing , all of your food , all of your clothing , all of your transportation for nothing , you 'd still have to pay so much money for rent and for health care that you could n't compete with labor in Asia or the Third World or even Europe . And so this is what has essentially excluded the United States from having a successful empire . It 's the greed of the financial sector , basically , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as happened under Margaret Thatcher in England and then Tony Blair . You 've had both countries essentially enter permanent austerity programs , and the only way to cure this is for housing prices to go down . But if the housing prices go down , then the banks will go broke . That 's why Obama said he had to support the banks : because if he 'd actually lowered the housing prices to realistic levels , that would enable America to survive , but the banks would go under . Until you 're willing to restructure the banking system , you 're not going to be able to industrialise the American economy . - Link <p> Technology is changing fast specially after pandemic and most politicians and bureaucrats still using old tactics to lie and manipulating not realizing that world has changed and earlier could get away with interview to print media or may be one or two television and people had no option to raise their view but now with social media every word they speak , every lie and every manipulation is highlighted and exposed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been misquoted .. best example Mr Orr coming out to say that rbnz has no control on housing market .............. Really , he has that audacity as still living in ivory tower and not aware that he stands exposed . <p> Reserve Bank governor Adrian Orr is not doing himself any favours with his revisionist approach to the house price issue . Not so long ago , he was saying increasing asset prices , including house prices , were a feature and not a bug in the bank 's policy response to the pandemic because they make consumers feel wealthier and spend more . This week he suggested his bank 's policy settings have only a minor impact on house prices . <p> He actually has quite a bit to answer for . The bank has been consistently under-forecasting increases in inflation and house prices , and overforecasting unemployment . While no one is expecting perfection in these times , the ongoing nature of the forecasting issues is concerning .

Media Release -- 31 January 2014 <p> As the final settlement day is reached for flat land residential red zone property owners , a significant milestone can be marked in the recovery , says the Canterbury Earthquake Recovery Authority chief executive Roger Sutton . <p> In total 7,349 properties were zoned red due to the level of land damage caused by the earthquakes . <p> Since the first red zone areas were announced in 2011 , thousands of property owners have accepted the Crown offer and moved out of the worst affected areas to start afresh . <p> " Today is a day of mixed emotions , " says Mr Sutton . <p> " Although we will always reflect on what we have lost and how much has changed , the end of the flat land zoning process shows how far we have come . It is heartening to know that so many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start over in their new neighbourhoods . " <p> Around 70 property owners have indicated they are unable to meet the settlement date they originally selected and advised CERA they will not be moving today as planned . As their agreements are legally binding contracts , penalty interest fees are being charged unless extenuating circumstances warrant these fees to be waived . <p> By the time all flat land settlements are completed nearly $1.5 billion will have been spent by the Crown to purchase the properties . <p> Mr Sutton reiterated that the cost of maintaining the infrastructure in the Residential Red Zone to homes where owners had not accepted the offer , or did not move today as agreed , is not viable long term . <p> CERA has been working closely with electricity networks and the Christchurch City Council , to ensure services are disconnected once the Crown takes ownership of a property . <p> The Council 's City Environment acting general manager Terry Howes says " although the council will continue to provide very basic services to properties where people were living , the cost of providing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the usual cost per household for water supply , waste water collection and refuse collection , providing access and dealing with stormwater . In reality this is not sustainable in the long term . " <p> Roger Sutton says that today 's focus though is on 98% of eligible property owners who decided to accept the Crown offer . <p> Statistics collected by CERA and CCC with the help of Statistics New Zealand , show most people have chosen to stay in the Christchurch region , often moving just a suburb or two away . <p> " What we now know for certain , is that the majority of residential Red Zone property owners were able to stay close to their neighbourhoods . Based on Census 2013 information , over half of all movements by people in areas with high earthquake damage were within just four kilometres . This is particularly important for maintaining that sense of community belonging and pride that we as Cantabrians are known for . "

Physiological murmurs result from the large amount of blood and the high velocity of blood flow in the equine cardiovascular system . Pathological murmurs result from either stenosis -- narrowing -- or regurgitation of one of the heart valves . <p> Stenosis is rarely seen in horses and most pathological systolic or diastolic murmurs are caused by valvular regurgitations or congenital defects . <p> The study team , reporting in the journal Animals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regurgitations . However , limited information exists about the accuracy of these broad rules in warmblood horses . <p> The main goal of this study was to link certain findings with the stethoscope to the results of the echocardiographic examinations , to determine whether there was agreement on the valve affected , as well as to find out if the loudness of the murmur coincided with the grade of regurgitation and presence of dimensional changes . <p> They used data gathered on 822 warmblood horses presented for cardiac examination in a large equine referral center in northern Germany . <p> The horses were presented because of either a clinical complaint such as poor performance or collapse , or because of a heart murmur or arrhythmia detected as an accidental finding . <p> The heart of each horse was thoroughly assessed by one of five experienced veterinary practitioners at the clinic using a stethoscope . In total , 653 of these examinations revealed one or more heart murmurs . <p> The most common findings with a stethoscope were left-sided systolic murmurs ( 68% ) or left-sided diastolic murmurs ( 15% ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these horses , revealing regurgitations of the mitral valve as the most common valvular regurgitation ( 77% ) , followed by regurgitations of the aortic valve ( 23% ) . <p> Thirty-one percent of the horses that underwent an echocardiographic examination displayed dimensional changes in one or more compartments of the heart , with the left atrium being most affected ( 21% ) , followed by the left ventricle ( 13% ) . <p> The researchers reported that agreement between the findings with the stethoscope and those of cardiac ultrasound was substantial if one or more murmurs and regurgitations were present . Agreement was almost perfect if only one murmur and one regurgitation were found . <p> The stethoscope was particularly well suited for detecting left-sided systolic and diastolic murmurs , with 87% of left-sided systolic murmurs being caused by a mitral valve regurgitation and 81% of left-sided diastolic murmurs originating from an aortic valve regurgitation . <p> " We found a fair agreement between the grade of regurgitation and the respective murmur , " the study team reported . <p> " Association was particularly good between mild regurgitations and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ based upon the loudness of the murmur was less reliable . Dimensional changes were usually linked to more severe regurgitations and higher-grade murmurs . <p> " Ultimately , we can say that cardiac auscultation is an integral part of any cardiac examination and very well suited to identify the cause of a murmur in case of left-sided isolated murmurs and mitral valve regurgitation and aortic valve regurgitation , which show an almost perfect agreement between auscultation and ultrasonography . " <p> They noted that if right-sided murmurs and more than one regurgitation are present , agreement is lower and the technique is less suited to identify the valvular regurgitation as being the cause of the murmur . <p> " The limiting factor in this case is that only the grade , timing and location were used to describe the murmur . If character could have been taken into account , a higher agreement may have been achieved . <p> " We could determine a fair agreement between the grade of the murmur and the severity of the regurgitation .

Work and the product of work is allocated by ' mother right ' among kinfolk according to their productive ability and reproductive need . <p> The overthrow of the ' mother right ' created the first class divided society , the patriarchal mode of production , where men exploited women 's productive and reproductive labour as domestic slaves . But Marx and Engels did not acknowledge the existence of a distinct patriarchal mode , nor its survival embedded in the later tributary and capitalist modes . <p> Yet as an exploited and oppressed class confined to slavery , women fought against their defeat . Their resistance to patriarchy over 10,000 years is the historical thread that carries the life of the Commune through successive dominant modes as women 's class struggle for liberation . <p> This was true of the Commune of Paris 1871 when women played an active role in the insurrection against the reactionary capitalist patriarchy of France . It was also true of the Russian revolution of 1917 which laid the foundations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolution destroyed by global counter-revolution . <p> Today the essence of the Commune is kept alive in the growing struggle against capitalism 's drive to destroy the historical power of the proletariat to end rotten capitalism as the last class society to make way for the return of the Commune . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> Neoliberalism was the last chance for dying capitalism to restore profitable production . It failed to exploit workers sufficiently to make enough profit to avoid the onset of terminal crisis . The restoration of Russia and China as rampant capitalist rivals only prolongs the agony . <p> As capitalism decomposes , it exposes the rotting corpses of previous modes of production in its bowels . Slavery , serfdom and unfree wage labour return with all their reactionary cultural crap rising to the surface . Nationalism , racism and sexism eat away at the material gains of the class struggle since the 19th century , provoking the long overdue backlash as nature reacts to capital 's barbarism . <p> Marxists recognise the class war between labour and capital as the contradiction between nature reproducing itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed as the class struggle for the socialist revolution to end capitalism , to return to nature and create the conditions for a post-capitalist future . <p> It was clear to the young Marx as a student of the scientific advances of the enlightenment , that capitalism was its own worst enemy and would end up as the anarchic , self-destructive mode today . The rise of the irrational , the cult of the individual , mired in the particularity of nation , race and gender , acts to destroy the secular , scientific , and universal truths of life in the material world . <p> The battle to defeat the Climate deniers and the Covid deniers illustrates perfectly how ignorance of science and reason , expressing itself as a cultural war , is really the class war between humanity , reproducing itself within nature , against capital 's destruction of nature . <p> This contradiction between labour and capital puts the working class on the side of nature .

@@33521236 <p> Rafael Gonzalez-MonteroWe have tried to resolve this matter confidentially for months . <p> I do n't know what 's wrong with Rafael . He seems affable , but clearly makes promises he does n't follow through on . And two young staffers got shafted after he promised he would protect them . Rafael has never contested the facts . <p> We offered him a confidential mediation that would be binding on everyone , so we can all move on . It was simple , fair and easy . But his lawyer got in his ear and he refused . I guess lawyers do n't get paid if we settle matters.As you can appreciate this is a matter that we have to pursue . The victim and the witness were treated abysmally by Rafael . I do n't think it was deliberate . Just careless and incompetent . Frankly I do n't know what 's worse . My request to you as Speaker is included in the press release sent to you by email earlier.1 . Investigate Rafael 's handling of the Nick Smith debacle.2 . Tell Rafael he has to answer our questions -- they are n't going away.3 . Release the investigation report.4 . Update us on the Francis report on the recommendations to stop bullying . Clearly people need to read it for tips . I have also emailed you the questions I 'd like you to tell Rafael to answer . From the very beginning , when I first wrote to Rafael in August , he wo n't answer any questions . <p> Also tell Michael Quigg writing me threatening letters does n't work and is counterproductive . Bullying this worker and me kind of reinforces our argument that parliament is a bully 's cesspool . Anyway , what happened to the Francis report ? We 'd also like the Burt Investigation report released too ? Nick is Nick as we all know , but it 's about a bigger picture . We will be organising a petition calling on you to agree to the four requests above . I 'll send the petition through later . I 'm sure you would rather be doing other things , as would I. But your people caused this injustice and refuse to take responsibility . Now I have to do their bloody job . Fucking hopeless . I know you have responsibilities to follow professional advice .

The union submitted questions to Mr Gonzalez-Montero in August . Instead of answering , he has lawyered up and gone missing in action . <p> WE REQUEST SPEAKER RT HON TREVOR MALLARD DIRECT HIM TO FRONT UP <p> Mr Rafael Gonzalez-Montero , the Chief Executive of Parliamentary Services , is the legal employer of all staff at parliament . After an inquiry Nick Smith MP was found to have bullied a young staffer who was blameless . It was so serious Mr Smith resigned . <p> Shockingly , despite promises , the victim 's contract was not renewed , and he has been left with legal bills . When One Union wrote to the chief executive , he lawyered up and now refuses to answer any questions . <p> We ask the Speaker of the House Rt Hon Trevor Mallard direct him to do so . <p> QUESTIONS THAT DEMAND ANSWERS <p> WAS THE VICTIM KNOWINGLY PLACED IN AN UNSAFE PLACE ? <p> It is claimed Nick Smith MP had a reputation of being a bully . Is this true ? <p> Because of this reputation , senior managers in Parliamentary Services ( PS ) raised concerns about appointing the victim to work with Smith . What steps were taken to have their concerns addressed ? <p> Were any plans and training provided for the staffer to perform his role ? If there were n't any , why not ? Was there any monitoring done at all ? Why not ? <p> Why was the staffer told by senior managers to " put up " with Smith , and he would be rewarded with a better job after the election ? Is this the norm ? <p> WAS THERE A HISTORY OF BULLYING ? <p> We understand many other staffers have resigned because of Smith 's behaviour . Is this true ? How far back ? <p> What steps were taken by PS after these terminations or complaints ? <p> Have any personal grievances or complaints been raised by any previous employees ? If so , what were they and how many ? Was any compensation or payments made to any former employees working with Smith ? If so , how much and how many ? <p> Did Gonzalez-Montero or any PS manager request the witness or victim formalise a complaint against Smith ? What promises were made to them ? <p> Gonzalez-Montero summoned the victim to his office . He made assurances of protection to the victim . Why were they made , and what were they ? Why were they not honoured ? <p> WHY DID THE INVESTIGATION DRAG ON ? <p> Why did the inquiry take over a year ? Is that normal ? What was the full cost of the report ? <p> Could PS have initiated the investigation themselves after learning of the incident ? What steps in the first week did PS take after hearing of the incident ? Why did the victim and the witness have to put their careers on the line ? <p> National 's chief of staff and whips office were actively involved in the incident . Why did n't they make a complaint ? What role did they play in the investigation ? <p> Once the draft report was completed , why was there further weeks of delays ? <p> WHY IS THERE LEGAL MURKINESS ? <p> Was the victim advised of his legal or support options ? Why was he advised not to take a Personal Grievance ? Why is the CEO now claiming he ca n't take a PG ? <p> PS recommended a lawyer to the victim . How was that decision made ? Is that normal ? What payments were made to the lawyer ? Why did they stop ? <p> Did Smith have legal advice ? Did any parliament entity contribute to Smith 's legal costs ? If so , who and how much ? <p> What pastoral care and HR support was provided to the victim ? If none , why not ? <p> WHY DID THE CEO REFUSE TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT ? <p> Was the victim and the witness told they were not to discuss the report and its findings ? Was Smith told the same thing ? Did PS advise what consequences were if there were breaches ? What were they ? What actions were taken against Smith for his public statements ? <p> Some media were clearly briefed . The victim and the witness were publicly maligned . Why was the victim refused support by the chief executive ? <p> At this time the victim met with the CEO at a caf ? , not his office . Is that normal ? At that meeting the victim pleaded for a factual public statement to be released setting the record straight . The CEO refused . Why ? <p> WHERE IS THE REPORT ? <p> Why is the victim not provided a copy ? Who has copies ? <p> Why is the report not released , given it was about a public matter and tax funded ? <p> PS has internal capacity for cases as ordinary as this . Why is a senior law partner dealing with it ? What legal fees have been paid to this law firm ? <p> Once we have the answers , we can fairly assess the level of culpability of PS leadership . That then gives us the basis to determine what would be a fair outcome to restore the mana of the victim . <p> ONE UNION has written to the Speaker of the House today requesting he take action against the chief executive of Parliamentary Services over his conduct relating to bullying by Mr Nick Smith MP . <p> The union alleges Mr Rafael Gonzalez-Montero and others cynically used the victim and the complainant as pawns in a campaign to get rid of Smith . After Smith was forced to resign , the victim and the witness were abandoned . <p> The Summary <p> Chief executive Gonzalez-Montero forced a young victim , against his wishes , to participate in a year-long investigation against Smith . <p> The chief executive promised the victim he would personally protect his well-being , his employment and his career . A similar promise was made to the primary witness of the bullying . <p> Instead , during the investigation neither of the junior staffers had their employment contracts renewed . They lost their jobs , and their parliamentary careers are over . The victim still owes money for the lawyer he was appointed by the chief executive . <p> Gonzalez-Montero 's lawyer has threatened the victim and myself that if One Union goes public with their story , Parliamentary Services may sue the victim and myself personally for damages . Smith was a bully and was held accountable . But , Gonzalez-Montero 's actions , are those of an abuser . He should be held accountable too . <p> The Francis Report two years ago said parliament was toxic and abuse was rampant . It made 83 recommendations . Nothing has changed . <p> We request the Speaker agree to the following : <p> Hold an inquiry into Gonzalez-Montero 's handling of this matter . <p> Direct the CEO to answer the union questions on this case . <p> Release the final investigation report . <p> Provide an update on 2018 Francis report . <p> The Background <p> In August 2020 Parliamentary Services chief executive Rafael Gonzalez-Montero launched a formal investigation into the bullying by Nick Smith against a junior staff member in July . After Smith was advised of the complaint , he countered with a complaint against the alleged victim . <p> The chief executive summoned the young staffer to his office and advised he was being investigated too , and he was required to co-operate with the inquiry . The young staffer said he did n't want to be involved because he felt it would hurt his career . He was right , it destroyed it . The chief executive said the staffer did n't have a choice . <p> The Promise <p> Gonzalez-Montero , however , assured the victim that he had nothing to fear . He made a heartfelt personal promise that as chief executive he would protect the staffer 's wellbeing , his employment , and his career in parliament . A similar reassurance was given to the primary witness who was the actual complainant . <p> The chief executive said this was a chance for parliament to show it would hold powerful individuals accountable . It seems Gonzalez-Montero was motivated by the Francis Report two years earlier that had lambasted the toxic parliament culture and identified numerous cases of bullying and abuse . The report made 83 recommendations and said parliament had to take action . <p> Under the Bus <p> Gonzalez-Montero provided the victim a lawyer . The first invoices were paid . Then they stopped . After that the victim had to borrow from his family to pay the legal bills . <p> When the preliminary inquiry report was finally produced , it was shared with the participants . A brutal media smear campaign was immediately launched against the victim and the witness , causing enormous stress to both young people . It was clear certain media had been briefed against the workers . As the attacks intensified the victim requested a meeting with Gonzalez-Montero . The chief executive told the victim to meet at a Wellington caf ? rather than his office . <p> At this meeting the staffer begged the chief executive to put out the facts in a media statement to counter the lies . Gonzalez-Montero point blank refused , saying he had a wider responsibility to maintain relationships with politicians . It is clear his responsibilities , in his mind , did n't include telling the truth , keeping his promises , or protecting his staff . <p> When the victim asked what his legal complaint options were , he was advised that path would not be good for his future career . <p> The Resignation <p> When the inquiry report was finalised , its findings were the same as what was stated in the draft report . It confirmed that Smith was guilty of bullying and harassment . It also found the victim blameless . The victim and his lawyer were permitted to read the full report but have no copy . <p> When then National Party leader Judith Collins told Smith the report was about be leaked , he immediately resigned from parliament . Gonzalez-Montero refuses to confirm who has copies . Did Judith Collins ? The chief executive refuses to release the final report . <p> The Betrayal <p> The union believes the victim was used as a political pawn in an internal party power play . The chief executive , with his wilful silence , betrayed his employees . <p> Despite Gonzalez-Montero 's early assurances , the employment contracts for the victim and the witness were not renewed . Neither are now employed in parliament . Once the political hatchet job was done , the chief executive lost interest . <p> This is an unambiguous and dark warning to victims of bullying in parliament : keep quiet and do n't come forward . <p> The Sordid Aftermath <p> Because the victim was compelled by Gonzalez-Montero to cooperate with the year-long investigation he is now in debt . Everyone else had their legal fees picked up by the taxpayer . <p> Gonzalez-Montero currently is offering no compensation to the victim . Apparently , they do n't want to set a precedent . He and his lawyer say if they are required to attend a mediation , their position wo n't change . <p> The senior law partner representing Gonzalez-Monterosays he is very relaxed . Given they are paid close to $1000 an hour , that 's no surprise . The taxpayer funded trough is very deep for those who protect the powerful against the vulnerable . <p> Gonzalez-Montero has been at pains to say to the union how bad he feels for the victim . <p> When I reminded him of his earlier promise to protect the victim and his career , the chief executive initially claimed he could n't remember the meeting . When I said he had sent an email to the staffer to make an appointment with his secretary , and National 's chief of staff had confirmed she was present , he offered to put in a good word for any future suitable job vacancies the victim may apply . No promises of course . This is beyond muddle-headed idiocy . Who thinks like this ? <p> Gonzalez-Montero is paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to lead over two thousand employees in parliament . He would n't last a day in the private sector . <p> The Prime Minister <p> This deep injustice happened on Jacinda Ardern 's watch . The prime minister asks us to be kind to each other . We agree . There are times for soothing words and an empathetic smile . But in this matter , firm action is required . <p> Character integrity is measured by how we treat those with little power . This is a time for the prime minister and the Speaker to instruct Gonzalez-Montero to fix this mess he created . Or sack him . <p> &gt;https : **33;1400;TOOLONG ...

We are hunting him . Chang is an owner of multiple Shake Shed &amp; Co. ice cream parlours and serially exploits his workers . When in trouble , it seems he liquidates the affected companies , then transfers their assets to other companies he owns . <p> Chang Xi , of Shake Shed &amp; Co. ice cream parlours , was ordered by the Employment Relations Authority to pay one of his victims $15,000 . Chang has gone into hiding , although his businesses still operate . Help us track him down . <p> The Authority recently found Chang guilty of exploitation and mistreatment of a young female employee . Like many exploiters , Chang did n't even bother to attend the Authority meeting . Instead , he removed his name as director of the company . Though the young victim was awarded nearly $15,000 , Chang has paid nothing , and the company has been liquidated . The worker was robbed . The repercussions for Chang ? Nothing ! <p> It seems the Employment Relations Authority has all the authority of a wet bus ticket . <p> Chang 's employee at Shake Shed &amp; Co. in the Coastlands mall was forced to quit her job after just six weeks because of Chang 's abusive and illegal behaviour.Chang was found to be directly responsible for several serious employment breaches . <p> The Authority ruled that Chang had " failed to comply with the minimum procedural fairness standards " , failed to pay wages on time , failed to provide the worker with rest and meal breaks , and unreasonably required her to remain at work during a medical emergency . He also breached his duty to act in good faith when giving the worker an unjustified warning , after she complained about her treatment . <p> Put simply , they found Chang guilty of being an abuser and exploiter.The Authority ordered Chang 's company , BB Icy Limited ( trading as Shake Shed &amp; Co. ) pay $14,796 in compensation to the worker . Despite the Authority hearing taking place in August 2020 , the Authority took 10 months to release their decision . <p> By the time the Authority got off their butts and did their job , the company had been put into liquidation to avoid any responsibility . Chang has paid nothing . Great system , if you are a crooked capitalist . <p> In New Zealand there are effectively two laws : one for employers and one for workers . If a boss steals from their employees , it 's treated as a civil misdemeanour . But when an employee steals , it 's a criminal matter , and they could go to jail . <p> Chang is now the director and sole shareholder of a new company called BB&amp;C Limited ( note the almost identical name of his previous company ) . On the Companies Register , Chang describes it as " motor vehicle body repairing " . Yeah , right . <p> Shake Shed &amp; Co. is a common store in malls around NZ and seems to be run as franchises . Chang was formerly the master franchisee for the entire Shake Shed &amp; Co. chain . Whilst it 's murky whether Chang still controls Shake Shed &amp; Co. stores , he did directly run at least two , one in Paraparaumu and one in Christchurch . <p> We know this because workers from both these stores complained that Chang refused to give staff breaks . They have to stand all day . Unfortunately , the workers are too scared to come forward . <p> But you can step up for them . <p> Despite puff pieces over the years in the business press , there are no photos of Chang on public record . We want to find where he lives , what he looks like , and what he is up to . Can you help us track him down ? <p> This is a story of several hard-working people who came to New Zealand in search of a better life . Instead , their dreams were shattered in the tiny township of Pio Pio ( just south of Te Kuiti in King Country ) . But this time the locals are stepping up to end this mistreatment . <p> It all started with a victim we call Allan* . He was employed at the Piopio Superette by Avinash Mudaliar and his wife Bidya . Like thousands of migrants in this country , he was forced to give cash back to his employer to keep his job and remain in New Zealand . Under immigration visa rules , Allan was contracted for $25.50 an hour . But what is becoming a new norm in arrangements like this , he was required to return everything above the minimum wage back to his employers . <p> The evidence is undeniable . We have audio recordings where the Mudaliars directly implicate themselves . In one , Bidya demands Allan to pay money back , saying " otherwise you wo n't get paid " . In another recording , Avinash instructs Allan that this money is required every week , otherwise he wo n't get his next pay-check . <p> If that was not enough , the Mudaliars sent texts each week stipulating how much money Allan was to pay them . Bidya claimed that giving money back was part of the " deal " that they and Allan had entered into . Of course , there was no deal , merely a powerful party forcing its will on a powerless party . There is no shortage of evidence , just a lack of justice . <p> Allan had no choice but to comply as his visa was attached to the job at the Piopio Superette . If he lost his job , he would face deportation . Over time Allan became increasingly resistant to these extortionist demands . His growing courage drew the anger of Avinash , and Allan was dismissed for " serious misconduct " . Apparently he left a pie warmer on . Allan was hand-delivered his immediate dismissal notice by a relative of the employer while he was at home . Allan was banned from his workplace and has not allowed to step inside since . <p> This was an egregious act to get rid of a victim who started to stand up for himself . We claim that in just seven months the Mudaliars extorted over $4,000 from Allan . <p> One Union have filed a Personal Grievance case to get Allan 's money returned . We are also seeking compensation . The Mudaliars deny the allegations . However since we agreed to help Allan , we have been contacted by locals and former employees with their own stories of mistreatment by the Mudaliars . Apparently this has been going on for years . <p> One long term resident told us that a worker of the Superette would visit her home to make calls to relatives back in India . This victim left New Zealand mentally broken and financially destitute . In our union work e come across this situation too many times . The local say that there has always been a high turnover of staff who have been many victims of exploitation . <p> Another former worker who had to return to India tells us that over the course of nearly two years working for the Mudaliar 's he was paid $9 an hour , later raised to $11 an hour , working up to 70 hours a week doing shifts of 16 hours . There were no chairs in the store and the worker says the workers would have to stand for the entirety of their shift . He says he was never paid more than $600 in any week even after working 70 hours . We are taking his case now too . <p> Stories like this are just the tip of the iceberg . There are more former workers of the Mudaliars with similar stories of exploitation who are afraid to come forward . But something inspiring is happening . Since we got involved , the locals have stepped up to support the workers . The local newspaper King Country News is following this story up . Good on them . Real news still happens , even if it 's only in small towns . <p> Locals in Piopio have been going into the store to give the Mudaliar 's a piece of their mind about their exploitation . Apparently the employer has made a complaint to the police about their treatment . Would n't it be nice if the police were there to arrest exploiters for criminal theft , rather than people who call an exploiter out . The Mudaliars have threatened to sue me for defamation . Telling the truth is something exploiters are n't used to . They think it 's a crime . Beyond irony . <p> Police are investigating and trying to find out who drove the tractor into the store . The locals say the community has closed ranks . Nobody is saying a thing . We are told the superette has lost a lot of trade . As the locals find out more of what is going on , they are mobilising in support of the workers and against exploitation . <p> Workplace abuse has become too commonplace in New Zealand . But communities coming together to confront exploitation will end it . Pio Pio sets an example for us . It 's a great start . <p> **38;1514;TOOLONG <p> Matt McCarten is the director of UTU for Workers Campaign .

The longer this case has gone on , the more fantasies Sidhu has spun to us . <p> The most ridiculous defence Sidhu claimed was that Vikram had used the company credit card whilst Sidhu was overseas , withdrawing thousands of dollars at the SkyCity casino . According to Sidhu 's logic , he was not liable because Vikram had stolen from him . Except , Vikram has no access to the card . <p> Despite several requests , Sidhu has not produced the times or details of withdrawals at the casino , or air tickets showing he was out of the country at the time he claims his card was used . That 's because it 's all a fabrication . <p> I 'm not sure whether Sidhu has mental problems ; is a compulsive gambler ; a habitual liar ; or a thief . I suspect all four . <p> Vikram has only been at SkyCity twice , with Sidhu , at his boss 's insistence . Vikram does n't gamble . His boss told Vikram to meet him there after Vikram insisted on resolving the non-payment of his wages . The other time , Sidhu got drunk and contacted Vikram to drive him home . Interestingly , at the casino , Sidhu got Vikram to use his credit card and withdraw several hundred dollars from a machine for him . Sidhu claimed he was too drunk to undertake the transaction himself . <p> I would n't put it past Sidhu to think that this could back up his breathtakingly stupid lie . I am now sure there are multiple withdrawals from the company credit card at the casino . I would n't be surprised at the end of this saga if we find the money owed to the many victims has been flushed through the casino by someone with a gambling addiction . And it 's not Vikram . <p> Sidhu 's latest counterclaim to the Authority is that he had actually paid Vikram through an overseas account . He does n't say why he choose to pay his employee through an illegal money laundering process . The Authority have asked him to produce the records of these transactions . He has n't . That 's because they do n't exist . I 'm sure if this was true , it 's a serious crime . The Police and the IRD , I hope , would be very interested . <p> How the Scam Went Down <p> Vikram started on 1 November 2019 as Sidhu 's Business Operations Manager . His employment agreement shows an annual salary of $62,500 for 40 hours a week ( $30 an hour ) . Vikram did n't actually get his employment agreement until December , and received no wage payments for his work in November . The reality was Vikram was required to work 85 hours per week . Because of that , he was effectively paid $14 an hour . <p> Even worse , though Vikram worked for Sidhu for 12 weeks , he was only paid four times for a total of $2,800 during his entire tenure . We have the bank records . According to the IRD , Sidhu made no PAYE payments . <p> Vikram had two roles : providing and managing security guards for several locations , and overseeing several businesses owned by Sidhu scattered around Auckland . This required Vikram to transport security guards to and from venues and travel long distances between businesses every day . Vikram 's contract included him providing a car and having his mileage costs reimbursed at the IRD rate . We have downloaded Vikram 's GPS and he is owed $5,200 . <p> More distressing , other workers pleaded with Vikram to help get their wages from Sidhu . Vikram on occasion paid other employees out of his own pocket , as he did n't want them to suffer the same exploitation he was . <p> Throughout his entire tenure as the manager , Vikram contacted Sidhu numerous times to get himself and other staff paid . Sidhu , like all scammers , kept saying he was too busy . Sidhu even had the cheek to lecture Vikram of his " employment responsibilities " to keep the other employees away from him . <p> After numerous , fruitless attempts to get paid , and facing financial destitution , Vikram had no choice but to cease working for Sidhu on 22 January . <p> Boss Goes Into Hiding <p> When we first raised this matter with Sidhu , he tried a charm offensive saying it was all a misunderstanding . He offered to sit down with Vikram and us , and sort it out amicably . A date was set . He was a no-show . Then , his phone was blocked to us , and emails went unanswered . <p> We filed a Personal Grievance last April accusing Sidhu of stealing from Vikram . But when we found out about the many others , we said he was at the extreme end of exploitation . Overall , we calculated Sidhu owed Vikram over $30,000 in unpaid hours . But Vikram just wanted to sort it out quickly . As a compromise , he would settle for getting paid for the 40 hours a week in his contract and having his travel costs reimbursed . Sidhu should have grabbed the offer . Clearly his arrogance and his greed were too strong to overcome . <p> For months Harry Sidhu has been in avoidance . On 6 July he has been ordered to turn up to a public forum and explain his conduct to an Authority Investigation meeting . Like all con-men I assume he will gamble that he can lie his way out of this . <p> Our system has for years lets these exploiters off the hook . New Zealand workers have to be protected from crooks like Sidhu . Let 's see if workers can get justice . We will update you after Vikram and Sidhu 's day " in court " . <p> *name has been changed to protect the worker . <p> CAN YOU HELP ? <p> Where is Harry Sidhu ? <p> If you know anything about Harvinder ( Harry ) Singh Sidhu , or know anything about his exploiting or his casino activities mentioned in this article , please contact us at justice@utu.org.nz <p> Spread the Word <p> It 's important that we in the community do n't let unscrupulous people exploit vulnerable workers . We must all step up and do something about it . Please share this article with others . <p> A would-be rapist attacks a young female employee working alone in a Milford Mall clothes store . Her screams alert mall security and the assailant runs off . Neither the bosses of the retail chain STORM , who owned the store , nor the Milford Mall in Auckland , report the matter to the police . There is no follow-up welfare check , let alone support , for the victim after the attack . When the young woman writes an email to her bosses , raising their lack of concern for the safety of their employees , she is sacked . <p> THE ATTACK <p> The predator was a large brute . He entered the store pretending to buy a dress for his partner . When the employee , Milly* , turned , he grabbed her from behind and dragged her to the back room . She is petite , but she fought back and screamed for help . Fortunately , a security guard was walking by and interrupted the attack . The thug was allowed to run off . <p> Milly rung her boss . The owner 's boyfriend , Marc , was on his way for a routine visit , so she waited for him . He was with another man . They took no notes about the assault and shortly after sent her back to work . <p> This was a young woman who was traumatised . An hour earlier she was physically attacked and only escaped being raped by fluke . It took Milly 's younger sister to turn up and take charge . She took Milly home . <p> Later , when I criticised Marc 's casual indifference , he retorted that he had paid for her coffee . When I met the owner Deborah Caldwell , several weeks later , she said she was unaware that Milly had been touched by the attacker and how serious it was . Good grief ! <p> THE WOULD-BE RAPIST RETURNS <p> Over the next fortnight , neither Deborah , Marc , or any senior managers , enquired after Milly 's emotion or physical state . The situation then worsened . The assailant returned to the mall . Like many victims , Milly internalised her trauma . She did n't want to be seen as troublesome , so did not inform her employers . Instead , Milly told the mall security , who agreed to escort her to and from her car each shift . Why they did n't take the film footage of the criminal and give it to the police is beyond baffling . When we called the cops , they were appalled . This would-be rapist had been stalking young women alone in stores and attacking them . If they had known about this attack , they would have gotten the footage and put him in jail . <p> HELPING IN PONSONBY <p> A fortnight later , Milly was called by one of her staff , who was covering for the day in the Ponsonby store . The staffer was working alone , had no breaks all day , and had not eaten . She was told by some wag at head office to squat under the desk if she wanted to take a break . Milly went in , on her day off , to let her go and get something to eat . <p> Milly loved her job and was happy to go the extra mile . Her Instagram page shows she put her heart and soul into her work . Milly was told she had turned the store around from its lowest point to its highest , resulting in the store getting a new fitout due to its success . Milly spent a lot of her free time creating a social media presence , constantly promoting the STORM brand , and personally creating a large number of new VIP customers . <p> Milly became upset when she noted the absence of security cameras in the Ponsonby store , which had been promised after her attack at the Milford Store . The Ponsonby store is closed up after dark by a lone female staffer . Later that night , Milly sent an angry email to the owner and the three senior bosses , including Marc , about this apparent lack of care for the safety of employees . She also raised the matter of Marc being a bully and screaming at young female staff . Milly asked for a commitment that staff would be treated with respect . <p> The next day Milly was summoned to a meeting . She thought this was a meeting where she could discuss and resolve her concerns . Given the success of her store , she believed there may have been discussion about her remuneration . How wrong she was . <p> THE FIRING SQUAD <p> The owner , Deborah Caldwell , her boyfriend Marc , and two senior managers were there . Firstly , they accused Milly of circulating her email to all of the staff . She had not . Milly had said the Ponsonby worker would resign because of her treatment . They berated her for presuming to speak on behalf of other staff . The worker did indeed resign , the very next day . <p> When Milly was asked what she wanted to say , she started with " I am pretty ready to resign if you do n't ... " ( she was going to outline the things she needed changed ) . She was interrupted by Marc , who said " Alright you 've resigned , you said it , you 're out , bye " . The meeting ended . It lasted six minutes . <p> When Milly texted Deborah after the meeting saying she had not resigned and did n't want to leave the company , Deborah asked her to return the store keys and property . A young woman was ordered to a meeting , alone , after raising complaints about the safety and treatment of staff and the behaviour of the owner 's boyfriend , Marc . She was then ordered out of the meeting and immediately terminated . <p> ARROGANT AND STUPID <p> Deborah and the boyfriend insist to this day that Milly resigned . The mind boggles at their arrogance and stupidity . I was , and am , aghast at their behaviour and how callous and tone deaf they were about this attack . <p> Milly was so traumatised by the harrowing experience . She has had a hard time since , dealing with four assaults -- the attack and attempted rape ; the lack of follow-up care ; the refusal to listen to concerns about bullying ; and the sacking of a victim . This , from an enterprise that markets itself to women to feel better about themselves . Just stunning . <p> I asked Deborah Caldwell and STORM to apologise and make amends . Instead , they enlisted a lawyer who wants to scrap it out . Sometimes , you ca n't save stupid from stupid . <p> A CALL TO JUSTICE <p> Milly has taken a long time to recover and only feels ready now to get justice . I want everyone who reads this article to sign our petition here , resource us here , volunteer here , and share this article with all your friends . <p> I 'm sick of employers abusing their workers and getting away with it . I hope you are too . <p> *Milly is an alias , for obvious reasons . <p> EMPLOYER DETAILS : <p> Company name : Blackstar Holdings Ltd t/a STORM <p> Employer name : Deborah Caldwell <p> Employer number : 021 376 878 <p> Employer email : deborahc@stormnz.com <p> Employer address : Level 1 , 172 Ponsonby Road , Ponsonby , Auckland 1011 <p> and <p> 35D Surrey Crescent , Grey Lynn , Auckland <p> Please sign our petition to end exploitation in New Zealand and visit our website utu.org.nz to find out how you can help further . <p> &gt;https : **33;1664;TOOLONG ... BROKER ORDERED TO MEET UNION -- RICH BOY EXPOSED AS LIAR AND POCKETING WORKERS MONEYhttps : **34;1699;TOOLONG ... https : **39;1735;TOOLONG ... 08 May 2021 18:52:40 +0000https : //thedailyblog.co.nz/ ? p=139621For 18 months a pawn broker has been using legal tricks to avoid having to turn up to a meeting with our union and explain his dishonest behaviour . The Employment Relations Authority has finally directed James Delmont to meet with the union to answer for his illegal actions . <p> Delmont will have to explain why he sacked two workers after a staff meeting at the beginning of the 2020 Covid-19 lockdown . <p> At this meeting , Delmont told all employees they were to take all their accrued holiday leave and that he was compulsorily reducing their hours . Two older women with families questioned his right to do this without discussing it with affected workers first and considering other options . <p> By law , they were right . He could n't do that . The government paid employers the $580 wage subsidy for their workers on the basis they kept them on . <p> Within days of the meeting Delmont announced a redundancy process , but just for those two workers -- not for the other 36 staff . Unsurprisingly , he told them they were to be made redundant because Covid-19 was forcing him to cut costs . No one for a minute believed that . <p> Initially , he promised them some of the wage subsidy in lieu of redundancy pay . Two days later Delmont told them he had found out employers were n't required to give employees any of the subsidy . In fact , it seemed he could keep all the Covid-19 money without any strings attached . <p> Clearly , Delmont had n't heard the prime minister say that we are a team of five million , and that she trusted employers to use the subsidy to keep their workers at work . When Ardern smiles radiantly and asks us all to be kind , these creatures see an opportunity to steal free money . It seems the nanny state is fine when it 's at the workers expense . At the time , hundreds , if not thousands , of employers got away with stealing the wage subsidy money from desperate workers . I remember taking calls from many devastated victims . <p> Where this guy made a mistake was when he claimed the redundancy process was undertaken for all employees . It was n't . On that lie alone it became an open and shut sacking case . His lie fell apart completely when he advertised these two women 's jobs the following month on SEEK . <p> When he was caught telling these lies , he went into hiding . He did n't answer calls or emails . For 18 months he has used tricks and gameplaying to avoid having to front . He knows he 's a thief and a liar . He 's also gutless . <p> Delmont is a rich boy from the leafy suburbs . You can tell what he is just by his photo . His parents own the company . You know this type . This about two brown working class woman calling him out in front of all the other workers . Worse for him , they were right , and showed up his ignorance . He retaliated with petty spite . <p> The women say since they were dismissed they have received dozens of stories from current and former employees on the outright dishonesty and corrupt practices carried out by Delmont and his pawn broking business . Ugh ! <p> We were always prepared to reach a fair outcome for these workers . Clearly , it 's not in Delmont 's character to consider that . I presume that 's because his whole life is about taking advantage of other people , so why would he stop now ? <p> Delmont has to attend a meeting on 27 May . If he does n't apologise and give these women the money he was supposed to give them in the first place , then I will ask you to join me on a picket line outside his house . <p> I want his parents to know what a spoilt and nasty child they have raised . Time to step up for justice . Put your name down for the UTU squad below . <p> Today , on International Workers Day , we announce the launch of a new union : UTU for Workers Union . Our mission is to build a working class , grassroot , campaigning movement to stop exploitation and end workplace abuse in Aotearoa-New Zealand . <p> The Working Class Challenge <p> The international trade union movement is in a fight for relevancy to the majority of the working class . Decades of relentless attacks on the workers ' movement have been devastating . <p> In our country , out of over 1.5 million private sector workers , less than one in fourteen ( 7% ) are members of a union . If we exclude the large private companies , unionisation in the private sector is effectively non-existent . More than half of the workers employed in the private sector do not even have the option to join a trade union nor be covered by a collective agreement . <p> Despite the good work the present unions do for their own members , the rest of the working class has lost ground in terms of income and protections . Non-unionised workers have no power to improve their position . They are at the mercy of their boss . <p> As a result , when workers in non-unionised workplaces have an employment dispute , they must seek support from an expensive lawyer , lay advocates , or a friend . Most exploited private sector workers receive no access to justice . Unscrupulous bosses know this . <p> The increase in vulnerable migrants and widespread casualisation , along with the growth of labour hire companies and dependent sole contractors , has seen the number of precariat workers in New Zealand explode . This has led to a culture of fear and isolation . As a result , workers ' power , incomes , job security and self-confidence have declined . <p> The situation is similar in most western countries , and if we do n't shake it up , the international union movement in the private sector will descend into irrelevancy . It is unacceptable that we morph into a network of staff associations for relatively better-off workers . That would be a betrayal of our history and all the working-class fighters who came before us . <p> A New Activist Movement <p> The old ways no longer work for the overwhelming number of private sector workers . The only question any serious worker rights activist must consider , is not if we protect and organise all workers , but only : how ? It is clear we need new forms of organisation . <p> I have been part of the One Union project group for the last three years . We have been actively trialing various models in our attempt to find a sustainable and effective way to meet the new challenge . We believe we now have the solution . Today we announce the formation of the UTU for Workers Union . <p> The Mission of UTU for Workers Union <p> Our purpose is to build a mass movement to stop exploitation -- migrant and non-migrant -- and end unchecked workplace abuse that non-unionised workers routinely suffer . <p> The use of UTU is deliberate . We summarise it in Maori terms -- justice . When a victim is exploited or abused , their mana has been diminished and it must be restored . That is UTU . <p> As the first step , we have to actually help individual workers with their immediate problem . For the last year we have been providing representation to any worker from non-unionised workplaces who needs help . <p> The jungle of predator employment advocates and lawyers scamming vulnerable workers is sickening . They get screwed by the boss , and then again by their advocates , some of whom do sweetheart deals with bosses . The advocate gets their fee , but the worker is forced to accept a few crumbs . Simply outrageous . <p> The good news is that when we have backed up our representation with a direct campaign , through picketing or media exposure , the exploitative boss has realised the power of the worker feeling they have gotten justice . The boss knows to be more careful in the future . We have had some success in having bosses agree to ongoing compliance monitoring . <p> We have found that workers want to join a union . In almost all occasions , there is no union . If there is , they do n't use their resources to help non-members . That might make sense if you look at unions as business units , but completely wrong if you see them as a justice movement for workers . There are only two categories of workers -- those in unions , and those we must get into unions . <p> Up until now we have not asked workers to join us . From today we will accept workers as members and supporters . Our membership is open to everyone , whether they are employees , or dependent contractors . We will help any worker who is in distress . <p> What must unite us is not what work we do , or who our boss is . Instead , we have to join together as a working class . The old and true clarion call , " an injury to one , is an injury to all " , is as relevant today as it ever was . All unionists must fight for justice for all workers . <p> If any applicant is from a unionised site or sector covered by another union , then of course they must join that union . It must be noted that we are solely focused on the vast majority of non-unionised private sector workers who are exploited and abused in the non-unionised world . <p> By having an inclusive and broad strategy , we believe many workers and allies will step up to build a powerful workers movement dedicated to stopping exploitation and workplace abuse . <p> How do we Rebuild Working Class Confidence ? <p> We can do this in three phases . <p> Help Victims First <p> If we claim to be pro-worker , we have to earn the right . Our first priority is to resolve individual workers ' immediate problems . This is the most important thing to anyone . Support any victim , and they become a union ally -- and in time , an activist . <p> We currently force exploiters to pay thousands of dollars of unpaid wages and backpay legal underpayments . We have prevented unfair sackings , stopped harassment and bullying , and won compensation and fair outcomes for hundreds of workers . In the last year alone , we have won hundreds of thousands of dollars for victims . This is only the tip of the iceberg . We need more people to help . Until they do , exploitation will continue . <p> Our case work is now carried out by the One Union Trust , which operates in partnership with the union . The trust has a dedicated legal team of three lawyers led by a former senior trade union official . <p> Confront Criminal Bosses Directly <p> We have a dedicated UTU Squad . We hold UTU Vigils for Justice actions directly outside the businesses and homes of exploiters and abusers . Every community needs a local UTU Squad . <p> We host a weekly radio programme on 104.6 Planet FM , Wednesdays at 12.40pm . We tell the truth about these exploiters and abusers . <p> We organise online Action Station petitions to mobilise support for victims , and let communities know about their local exploiters . <p> Build Solidarity <p> After a boss has been found to breach minimum employment standards , we monitor compliance and enforce legal minimum codes . Thousands of workers in small workplaces do n't get their minimum entitlements . We can fix that through constant vigilance . <p> We also monitor visa compliance . 350,000 workers are reliant on a boss for their visas . <p> Workers will feel safer by regular check ins . Over time , we will patiently build a more collective confidence in their workplace . <p> Migrant Exploitation <p> The most exploited and abused group of workers are migrant workers on temporary visas . Any project to eliminate worker exploitation in New Zealand must include campaigns that focus on migrant workers . We are judged as unionists on our commitment to the most vulnerable members of the working class . <p> The Migrant Workers Association partners with us and leads this work . The One Union Trust provides practical case representation for victims . MWA and UTU spearheads campaigns that rally the community against specific cases of injustice . Their fight is our fight . <p> Thousands of workers are bullied , sacked , underpaid or exploited every day . As a group of volunteers , we do our best to help these workers . <p> Unfortunately , we are coming across an increasing number of employers who are deliberately exploiting and bullying vulnerable employees . Many victims are too scared to even ask for their minimum rights and protections . <p> Our employment legal system is broken . When victims do decide to stand up , the lengthy delays and high costs prevent them from getting justice through the legal process . <p> Guilty abusers are allowed to pay a fraction of what they owe . They get full and permanent confidentiality , and are free to repeat their abusive behaviour . This has led to the rapid spread of exploitation and bullying in our workplaces . <p> We have a very simple plan to stop it . <p> These three law changes will end exploitation and abuse at work overnight . <p> If exploiters know they could go to prison , they will stop their abusive behaviour . <p> 2 . If an owner sells or closes their business to avoid justice , the employer shall be held personally liable for any money owed to a victim . Currently many employers who exploit ' sell ' their business to an associate before their case is heard . <p> Cases must no longer be automatically dismissed on these grounds . <p> 3 . Any worker 's claim of under $20,000 must be held within one month . A mediator shall decide the matter and any compensation is to be paid within 14 days . More expensive or severe cases shall be decided within 3 months . <p> Currently , victims regularly wait for more than a year just to get their case heard . <p> With your help , we can stop criminal exploitation by employers in our country . <p> Sincerely yours , <p> UTU JUSTICE FOR WORKERS CAMPAIGN <h> Why is this important ? <p> We want thousands of people to sign this letter . We want to convince the prime minister that many New Zealanders want to her to change the current laws , so victims will get prompt and fair justice . Only then will workplace exploitation and abuse stop . <p> Who are we ? <p> UTU for Workers Union is dedicated to campaigning to stop workplace exploitation and abuse in Aotearoa NZ . We fight for justice . <p> We provide employment advice and advocacy for any worker in a non-unionised workplace who ca n't afford a lawyer . <p> The campaign is co-ordinated in partnership with the Migrant Workers Association . They provide pastoral and visa support to exploited migrant workers . <p> Currently our name is One Union , and we are an incorporated society and registered trade union . From May 2021 we will formally be renamed UTU for Workers Union . <p> We would like to meet with you and other locals . Please come and share with us your advice on what we can do about it . Hopefully we can form a local group to work with us so we can organise a campaign to end exploitation in Tokoroa . <p> &gt;Teenage Schoolgirl Waitresses -- Predatory Manager -- Owner : " Not My Problem " https : **31;1776;TOOLONG ... https : **39;1809;TOOLONG ... 02 Oct 2020 19:41:10 +0000https : //thedailyblog.co.nz/ ? p=132787This story started out as two workers pushed out of their jobs in an upmarket Auckland caf ? . Teenage waitresses at the caf ? were required to attend work but were only paid when they were physically on the floor . The rest of the time they sat in the staffroom unpaid . It was outrageous , but it was a simple case of exploitation . However , during a meeting with the bosses , it went dark . <p> The manager , we found out , was having serial " relationships " with his schoolgirl charges . There were accusations of favourtism . When I queried the owner , she said she did n't get involved in the romantic relationships of her employees . Really ? These schoolgirls were 16-year-old . He was their adult boss . <p> This case began when I met two teenagers who worked after school . Both of them were from reasonably wealthy families who did n't actually need to work . Their parents wanted them to have the responsibility of earning their own money . The caf ? was in the swanky end of town . The customers were the well-heeled . <p> We settled this particular case in mediation which the girls were very happy about . Unfortunately for us , the terms of settlement mean I ca n't identify the people involved or the business . But by telling this story , other young workers might come forward and get justice . This story wo n't be unique . <p> I am told by other young hospitality workers that not being paid for downtime whilst still being required to be at work , is not unusual . This is pure exploitation . I hope any affected worker will contact us if this is still happening in their workplace . Managers seeking sexual favours is standard fare in many workplaces . But schoolgirls preyed upon by their adult manager is something much more sinister . This is serious abuse at the top end . <p> I got a call from an official from another union who asked if I would help with a case . I was introduced to two young teenagers . They were both bright and chatty . One was 16 and the other 17-years-old . The two girls had been frozen out of their part-time jobs after they had complained about their treatment to their bosses . <p> At this workplace , the waitresses were mainly students on part-time shifts . There was a rostered start time , but no finish time . When the workers arrived , they were sent to the staffroom . They did n't go onto the floor to serve customers unless instructed by the manager . When it got quiet , they 'd be sent back . They would clock in and clock out as the moved between the floor to the staffroom . They were only paid for the time on the floor . This is illegal . Clearly , it is exploitative . <p> These two girls had kept all their shift and wage details . After reading through their evidence I could see they were shortchanged in about one in three shifts . Over the months they had worked there , it amounted to several thousands of dollars . One girl was paid for 20 minutes on one night but was required to sit in the staff room for four hours . <p> Whilst this is an outrageous case in its own right , I thought the employer would claim a ' misunderstanding ' and backpay the two workers and we could move on . But no . Their lawyer responded in her first email that the company had no case to answer . <p> I looked up the business on-line . The company had several other upmarket outlets . The owner lived in a leafy liberal enclave and proudly promoted environmental causes on her website . Over several exchanges , her lawyer , on her behalf , continued to refuse admitting any wrongdoing . This was before I was writing for Daily Blog and had no UTU truck to turn up outside their caf ? to focus their minds . Eventually , they reluctantly agreed to mediation . <p> The boss turned up with an entourage exuding charm and relentless positivity . Her sales pitch was she was doing the girls a favour . According to this self-proclaimed benefactor , all the schoolgirls she employed really appreciated that they could sit in the staffroom for long periods and complete their homework . And having the opportunity get paid for interludes on the floor was a win/win for everyone . She beamed at me expectedly . I think that was a cue for me to praise her largesse . <p> Clearly , I could n't see her big picture . When the girls said they were ostracised after they raised their complaints , she was affronted and asked for evidence . When they went through several examples of being left out of the " it " crowd , such as not being invited to parties and banned from the Christmas party , the boss and her lawyer feigned boredom with eye rolls . I finally understood the popularity of the teenage film " Mean Girls " . Ugh ! <p> Just before a break , things got real nasty . One of their flunkies present covertly slips the lawyer a note with a side whisper . The lawyer looks up at us . She reads out a name and asks the 16-year-old if she knows the name . The young woman next to me tenses . I immediately respond : " we will answer after the break " . The lawyer smirks . " It 's a simple question , we 'd like her to answer it ? " I clip back that these girls have just said they were bullied by their managers and this was an example . The lawyer asks for the mediator to force the girl to answer . I told them to piss off ! <p> In the break , the 16-year-old said the person was her 25-year-old manager . They 'd had " an affair " . Her mate said that everyone had been annoyed at work because she had got preferred shifts from the manager . I asked if there were others . They said there had been four girls during the time they were employed . I sat there stunned . Both girls had been there less than a year . " That 's one about every two months ? " " Yes " . Geezers . <p> We reconvene . I ask did they know the name they raised before the break . " Yes " . " Why was it raised then ? " " There were issues between the manager and her , she had n't disclosed . " Me , looking at the boss , who is n't looking quite as poised . Does she think it 's appropriate for her managers to groom their young employees for sex ? She replied employees ' romantic relationships were n't her business . Did she feel a 16-year-old entering into a relationship with her adult manager was not her business ? The gap between her and her 25 years old boss is surely a generation gap . The owner replies it 's no longer a problem as he no longer works there . " Was he sacked ? " No . According to the boss , he was " very popular " , and she continued to have a " good relationship " with him . Extraordinary . <p> The young girl pipes up , helpfully letting us all know she " takes full responsibility for her actions " . There are certainly people in the room who should be taking responsibility for their actions . But not the youngest person , and certainly not the victim . The sound of crickets on the other side of the table was deafening . Disgusting ! <p> I 'd had enough . The gloves came off . The only thing that saved this owner was that the two girls did n't want to drag the process out any further . And understandably , the victim did n't want her parents to know the full trauma she had been through . A deal was done , the girls got all their wages backdated and in addition received a modest compensation . They thought it was fantastic . I wanted more , a lot more . But then , it 's not about me . None of the other side acknowledged their former employees ' mistreatment , let alone offered an apology . <p> As with any case in mediation , any outcome it is confidential , and the perpetuators do n't have to admit any wrongdoing . And they never do . At least the girls were chuffed . They were so happy they got some justice . They were rapt about getting all their back hours paid and getting an unexpected lump sum compensation . <p> But the boss and her flunkies were never held accountable . It cost them some money . But loose change , really . The owner never conceded her managers or herself had done anything wrong . <p> The opportunity to write articles on the Daily Blog will tip the scales for future cases like this . I am now able to write what really goes on in the real struggles of working-class people in the precariat . I can do this before I get muzzled in the legal framework . <p> This article should upset you . But I want to inspire you to help me do something about how vulnerable workers are being crushed every day . <p> We will campaign to publicly expose these exploiters and abusers . To help the project I purchased our little UTU bus . It 's getting fitted out at this very moment and will be ready next week . I needed $5,000 to get it on the road . I 've never done a Give-a-Little Page before I started writing on Daily Blog a fortnight ago . I am extraordinarily grateful to many Daily Blog readers who have chipped in over $2,500 so far . I need to raise the rest by next week . If I had this bus when I first met these girls , I would have turned up at this caf ? and exposed their employer 's behavior . <p> If you know of similar incidences of workplace abuse email us at justice@oneunion.org.nz <p> If this story upsets you as much as it does me , then help me do something practical about it . Our little team are doing our best . If you can chip in , I 'd be grateful . Click through hereand help us reach our funding target so we get our little UTU bus on the road . <p> This really is a story you need to share with everyone you know . The more people who know , the easier it will be to end exploitation and abuse in the workplace . <p> Thank you / Nga Mihi , <p> Matt McCarten is the National Director of One Union and an UTU Trustee <p> Two young mothers are crushed by the casual cruelty of their exploiter . A soon-to-be father was refused leave to attend his spouse in labour . A young mother was told to send her baby to India so she could work more unpaid hours . A husband was asked for $35,000 for his wife to keep her job . The exploiter outfoxes MBIE and state justice . It is left to the citizens of Tokoroa to organise and demand justice for the victims . <p> My previous article on the exploiter distressed many readers . OneUnion have filed serious exploitation charges against Challenge petrol station owners Harjit Singh and his son Udamjit Singh from Tokoroa . These two exploiters now owe $130,000 just in unpaid wages for three employees . There will be more . The OneUnion team went to Tokoroa last Friday to meet the workers and talk to locals . The reality of the exploitation is even worse than we thought . <p> My team spoke to the spouse of ER , one of the petrol station workers we are representing . We thought we had correlated all the case details when we originally filed the workers ' cases . When Sarah and ER chatted to our team , we realised it was worse . Sarah says when the boss went to India for three months , ER was required to work 15 hours every day from opening to closing , for the entire time . Not a single day off . That 's over 100 hours a week for 13 weeks . When Harjit returned , ER got his first day off in three months . Within four hours the boss called him back to work . Sarah through tears said on Friday " ER works so hard and the boss could n't even hack four hours , when he makes ER work daily stretches of 15 hours . " <p> The couple told the boss they were expecting a child and arranged for two weeks parental leave . On the day of Sarah going into labour she phoned ER to leave and take her to the hospital . For hours ER was crying on the phone to Harjit , begging to send someone to relieve him . He would n't . <p> We asked why ER did n't just leave . ER said he was frightened because Harjit said if he did , ER would lose his visa . Sarah says " this blackmail was the worst part . " It took three hours before the boss arrived . Sarah was in hospital for three days . On the fourth day , Harjit rescinded ER 's leave and demanded he to return to work . Through tears Sarah said " they took away the most important and magical moments of our life . " <p> Exploiter Sacks Young Father And Outfoxes ERA <p> Shortly after this outrage , ER 's employment was terminated after he asked for his holiday pay and to have his unpaid hours reduced so he could help his family . Yes , you read that right . He was summarily dismissed . ER did n't get the visa support he was promised . He did n't even get the holiday pay he was owed . The exploiter then deliberately dragged out the legal process for nearly two years . <p> The workers tell us Harjit was coming into the petrol station every day , whilst at the same time telling the Mediation Service he was bedridden , and could n't even take a conference call . His lawyers were so embarrassed at his many bald-faced lies they quit in succession . Harjit went through five lawyers . <p> When the Employment Relations Authority finally instructed Harjit to attend an investigation meeting , he transferred ownership of the station to his son , three days before the meeting . Then he liquidated his company . The ERA have washed their hands of it and say it 's now our responsibility to deal with the liquidator . The liquidator tells us to naff off . <p> The Human Damage : The Community Rallies <p> As a result of the termination , ER lost his visa sponsorship which made him liable for deportation . As new parents , and ER newly unemployed , the couple had to borrow thousands of dollars to apply for a partnership visa . Sarah said she is traumatised and has become consumed by this injustice . She thinks about it every day . <p> On Friday , the OneUnion team went to the local supermarket to distribute leaflets and to assess the mood of the locals about Harjit and Udamjit Singh 's exploitation . Many of them had read my Daily Blog article online and were delighted people were stepping up for these workers . Everyone knew about the father and son 's exploitation . Samples of the comments were : " God , we really hope you get justice we will do everything we can to help " ; three-quarters of people said they would attend a protest : " Let us know when the protest will be . We will be there . " <p> Others read the flyer in their cars and then came back to express their condolences , and to let Sarah know they would tell everyone they knew . The local Cosmopolitan Club have been tremendous . We picked up over ten locals who volunteered for any campaign . <p> Our team got to meet Sarah 's mum . Her mother , a kuia in the finest sense , could n't understand how the law and " the system have failed . " My team said she was in a quiet fury and almost lost for words . She did say " I knew how horrible this all was , because I have never seen grown men like my son-in-law cry the way he had been . This really hit us in the heart . " <p> And just when you think you know what a crushed heart feels like , it gets worse . <p> Young Mother Told to Send Baby to India <p> We met another young mother on Friday . I 'll call her KT . She also worked for this father-and-son criminal racket . She was n't one of the workers we were representing . But after reading my Daily Blog article she drove from Tauranga on Friday with her partner to see us . <p> Two years ago , both her and her husband needed to have jobs , hoping that with their employer 's support one of them could get permanent residency . Harjit , the father , agreed to employ KT . Unfortunately , her husband could only find a job in Tauranga . As such they had to live in different towns . <p> Although her contract was for 40 hours a week , and KT had a newly born baby , Harjit insisted she work up to 60 hours a week . The additional hours were unpaid . This was very hard on KT and her daughter . Harjit found a diary in which KT was recording her hours of work . He confiscated it . She started a new diary . He confiscated that too . KT had no choice but to endure this to keep her job . <p> For a while KT 's mother came to visit from India and was able to look after her granddaughter . Business owners near the Challenge station said they remember watching " the poor girl work all day . " KT was working 12-hour shifts . The locals said they " could see she was being abused . " When we told the local neighbours the truth on Friday they were outraged . One of the locals said " she is such a sweet girl who obviously broke her back all day as her baby was at home with his grandma . " <p> After KT 's mother 's visitor permit ended , she had to return to India . KT asked Harjit to reduce her hours to just the 40 hours in her employment agreement , so she could spend time with her baby . He said no . He said it was n't his problem . If she wanted his support for her visa , the baby had to go to India . <p> Many migrants want so badly to build a better life for them and their family . Both parents have to work long hours and endure exploitive conditions . They have to endure this abuse in the hope of getting a permanent visa with their employer 's support . <p> I have come across several parents who have had to send their children away . KT 's baby is now in India . It is heart wrenching . Migrants tell me of only knowing their babies by Skype . They miss their babies ' first steps , their first words , their tears . The parents cry a lot . <p> The Brutality of Evil <p> One day out of the blue , KT 's employment ends . Udamjit the son , phones KT to say his father has sold the petrol station to him . This was of course the manoeuvre to avoid the ERA . As such , Udamjit was now the boss and said she was not to come to work anymore . She was dismissed from that very moment . KT never returned to the station and has never received her final wage . Nor her holiday pay . <p> KT 's husband was furious and went to Harjit asking about her visa support . Harjit replied the couple would now have to pay him $35,000 to support the visa for KT . The husband told him where to go . <p> The couple now live in Tauranga on one income . They went to a lawyer . They are now $5,700 poorer and their lawyer got them nothing . With the COVID 19 pandemic they have even had his income dramatically reduced , and ca n't afford to be reunited with their child . KT is owed $32,000 . Of course , we will represent them for free . <p> The OneUnion team say KT and her husband are a lovely couple . The couple are still in shock that someone could do this to them . The couple say Harjit and Udamjit have destroyed their lives . One of our team was a young volunteer and was in tears . On their way back to Auckland she texted that KT is " the loveliest girl , quiet and shy but with a beautiful nature " . <p> Both couples and their friends were incredibly grateful for our support . But why should workers have to be grateful ? They have to thank people they have never met , because they ca n't get simple justice we used to all take for granted ? <p> Prime Minister Needs to Step Up <p> Our employment laws are a joke . They protect bosses . Our institutions are failing . How does it take 18 months to even get a hearing in the Employment Relations Authority ? How is it that MBIE inspectors tell bosses the name of employees who reported them on their confidential exploiter hotline ? Our commercial laws are corrupt . How does an exploiter get to transfer his business to another exploiter , and then get away with his crime with the press of a button ? It 's clear there is one law for bosses and one for workers . A worker would already be in prison if they did a fraction of what this boss did . <p> Blatant exploitation is becoming a normal state . Migrants are terrified of being deported if they speak up for themselves . That 's because it 's true . Immigration officers turn up on their doorsteps with deportation papers within 14 days after an exploiter reports them . Some of our bureaucracy is bloated , and we have lazy politicians at the wheel . <p> After this election the new prime minister needs keep Andrew Little as Workplace Minister . She needs to also appoint another senior MP as the Immigration Minister , who has the seniority and the political will to ensure the exploiters are firmly held to account and the exploited get prompt justice . The only suitable person I can think of is David Parker . <p> What to do ? <p> New Zealanders have to step up . Communities have to own this abuse in their neighbourhoods . <p> Here is my immediate action list : <p> I will write to Challenge NZ to demand they investigate Harjit and Udamjit Singh 's actions . If either of them are guilty ( they are ) , Challenge must rescind their contract . <p> I will formally request MBIE Labour Inspectorate , IRD and Immigration NZ to investigate these two men . <p> We will launch a petition in Tokoroa to get 1000 citizens to sign up to a campaign to end exploitation in Tokoroa , and to hold these two exploiters to account . <p> We will organise a public rally in Tokoroa in a month 's time . Our demand is that Harjit and Udamjit Singh to apologise to these workers and put things right for them . Otherwise they should leave town . <p> Will you help ? <p> If you know anything about Harjit Singh or his son Udamjit Singh , or could help in some way , email justice@oneunion.org.nz . <p> I 'd like to get our UTU bus to Tokoroa . Would you make a small koha to help get us there ? Please go here . <p> Matt McCarten is the National Director of One Union and an UTU Trustee <p> &gt;https : **33;1850;TOOLONG ... Fired Because They Asked For Fairness : Boss Pockets Money -- Coward Goes into Hidinghttps : **33;1885;TOOLONG ... https : **39;1920;TOOLONG ... 24 Sep 2020 21:29:06 +0000https : //thedailyblog.co.nz/ ? p=132459This morning we were supposed to be in Mediation with James Delmont , the boss of Dollar Dealers -- the Auckland pawn shop chain . But he 's a no-show . Apparently , he 's made other plans . <p> Delmont has managed to worm his way out of fronting for sacking two workers during the first COVID 19 lockdown . The Mediation Service told us at 4pm yesterday they no longer had a mediator available in Auckland . They offered a zoom conference call instead , with a mediator from Christchurch . Delmont quickly latched onto this opportunity , insisting it had to be face-to-face or nothing . Pathetically , the Mediation Service offered him a time seven weeks from now . <p> When I got back to my office and was told this , I went off my head . Delmont sacked two workers , without notice , pretending it was a redundancy issue . He then pocketed their wage subsidy . This was 20 weeks ago in May . These workers have been waiting since then to have Delmont attend a mediation and explain his actions . However , Auckland 's Mediation Service are so disorganised they blithely decided these workers could wait another 7 weeks . That would mean the workers would have to wait 6 months just to get to the first step . I have another case where the bosses are taking a worker to mediation . They got a date within two weeks . Disgraceful . I was n't having any of this crap . After a very ' assertive ' discussion with the Mediation office , they managed to find a mediator after all . <p> Although the whole process , since we were advised there was no mediator to then finding one , took less than two hours , Delmont said he had made other plans that could n't be changed . Really ? Maybe he had a hair appointment that had opened up . <p> However , he did find the time to try and contact one of the workers from his cell phone . He was advised from the start he was n't permitted to contact a former employee once the legal process commenced . In the criminal courts it 's a crime to contact witnesses . It 's called intimidation . Of course he did n't respond to me when I asked him to explain himself . Some people like Delmont believe rules and good behaviour do n't apply to them . <p> I met the two workers last night for our prearranged meeting and advised them the mediation was off . They were obviously very upset . One has n't been able to find work during the COVID 19 pandemic , and the other had taken a day off from work to attend the Mediation and would n't be able to work today . Just the cost of getting to my office is a burden . Delmont and his ilk who abuse others are oblivious to this reality for working class people these days , and if they did know -- they would n't give a toss . <p> After debriefing with the two workers , I realised the case against Delmont and Dollar Dealers is even worse than I thought . When we first raised the dismissals in May , some unnamed " HR " person sent an extensive , elaborate redundancy process they claimed they had used . Last night the workers tell me nothing of the sort happened . They were the only two employees the company had spoken to about potential redundancies . Originally , Dollar Dealers said they would pay them the COVID wage subsidy . This was our tax money , which we gave to bosses so jobs could be protected . But Delmont told them at their termination meeting that he had changed his mind and he " would keep the money because he could . " They got just four days ' pay in lieu of notice and walked off the job immediately . <p> Right from the start , I wondered why these two women were targeted . Last night it became clear . When the lockdown started Dollar Dealers announced all employees would have to use their accrued holiday leave . Both these women had challenged management 's right to do this without consultation . Shortly after they were told they were being made " redundant " . <p> When my union got involved it became apparent Delmont had concocted an elaborate fabrication that it was a legitimate redundancy due to COVID 19 . I never believed it , because no business with 69 employees would go through an entire redundancy process just to make two workers redundant . Especially as their normal monthly staff turnover is three . Advertising vacancies on SEEK within a month gives the game away . <p> The women say since my previous Daily Blog article they have received dozens of stories from current and former employees on the outright dishonesty and corrupt practices carried out by this company . I have asked they send this information to me for future publication . <p> In summary though , it works like this . Desperate people come in with family jewellery and other expensive heirlooms to use as collateral for short term loans . They get the loan for a fraction of what the items are worth . After deducting an ' administration fee ' they get charged 35% interest . Many ca n't meet the payment schedule and their goods are forfeited . They can be then resold for up to ten times the loan made to the former owner . In the US , they used to call these people the Mafia . It 's legal here . <p> Skimming through social media pages show the extended Delmont family are clearly part of the ' rich and famous ' lifestyle crowd . It seems their beautiful lives and privileges have been largely possible through the misfortunes of the poor . I note all the Dollar Dealer stores are in working class areas , whilst members of the extended Delmont family live in palatial mansions in the leafy suburbs . <p> When you absorb what types of people would run a business model like that , it 's easy to see why Delmont would have no problem sacking two employees and then pretend otherwise . <p> As you 'd expect under the COVID 19 climate , business is booming for loan sharks . Dollar Dealers is soon to open up a new store in Hamilton . Our UTU bus should be up and running by then . We are looking forward to attending the launch party to expose their practices to the good people of Hamilton . <p> I was always prepared to reach a fair outcome for these workers . Clearly it 's not in Delmont 's character to consider that . I presume that 's because his whole life is about taking advantage of other people , so why would he stop now . <p> I 've written to him this morning ( attaching this article ) and amended our claim for the two workers . We will claim compensation for their normal wages from the time they were sacked ( that 's $16,000 each in lost wages for the last 20 weeks ) and I will add their normal weekly wage $800 a week until this matter is settled . For the stress and fear he has caused these two women he 's going to have to do the right thing and compensate them for $10,000 . I 'm adding the 3% monthly interest , he charges his clients . Workers should never have to pay to get justice from an unscrupulous boss , so he 'll get our invoice too . <p> If you have any information on James Delmont or Dollar Dealers , or would like to help , contact us at justice@oneunion.org.nz <p> We have our campaign bus ready for action to support a campaign to end exploitation . We are looking forward to visiting Hamilton for Dollar Dealers ' opening of their new store . We would appreciate any koha to get on the road .

EXTORTS AND BLACKMAILS WORKERShttps : **32;1996;TOOLONG ... https : **39;2030;TOOLONG ... 20 Sep 2020 16:53:15 +0000https : //thedailyblog.co.nz/ ? p=132223Toko ... businessman Harjit Singh is accused of blackmailing employees to pay cash and work free overtime for three years . Failure to pay the boss meant the workers would lose their jobs and be deported . OneUnion filed a case for two workers to be reimbursed nearly $100,000 for wages , overtime and annual holiday pay . <p> Harjit Singh , was the owner of the two petrol stations Challenge Aotea and Mobil Tokoroa ( the latter was recently later renamed as Challenge Tokoroa ) . Harjit employed the workers for three years from 2016 . Since the workers first raised their claims 18 months ago , the owner has used an everchanging line-up of five different lawyers in a cynical strategy to delay and frustrate the case against him . Three days before he was instructed by the Employment Relations Authority ( ERA ) to attend an investigation meeting , he ' sold ' the Challenge Tokoroa station to his son and liquidated his company . Harjit then filed with the ERA to dismiss the case because his company no longer existed . <p> His son Udamjit Singh was the manager of the business and we believe was an active participant in the abuses . We have recordings of Udamjit , as well as his father , demanding cash from the workers . OneUnion has been told that Harjit has also been exploiting other previous employees for years . The father has now gone into hiding , but we know he remains in Tokoroa with his son . <p> OneUnion demands that Harijit return $41,000 to one worker and $55,000 to the other . With penalties , interest and costs , the full amount exceeds well over $100,000 . <p> For nearly three years , these workers were required to work 55 hours a week . Recordings reveal how these workers were robbed . Although they were paid the correct wages as per their contracts , they were forced on pay day to hand over cash equal to 15 hours work ( i.e. the difference of 40 and 55 hours ) . This amounted to $250 -- $300 a week . <p> If a worker did this to a boss , the police would arrest the worker and they would be imprisoned . Clearly , we have one law for bosses and one law for workers . To rub salt into their wounds , the workers paid PAYE on money they had to give to their boss . Neither worker was paid for public holidays nor received their annual holiday entitlements . <p> Harijit admitted to OneUnion that the two employees did work 55 hours a week , although he denies they had to pay him money back . The recordings show otherwise . To get himself off the hook , he offered each worker $7,000 if OneUnion would agree to drop the case against him . <p> Harijit has been dishonest throughout the entire process to the workers , OneUnion , the ERA and even to his own lawyers . He tried many excuses , such as his apparent bad health , to avoid being held accountable . He even got his doctor to write to the ERA saying he was incapacitated at home . That fell apart when he was seen walking around Tokoroa in fine form . <p> Eventually , when the Authority had tired of his tactics , they ordered him to attend their hearing . Three days before he was booked to appear , he sold the Challenge Aotea in Tokoroa to his son Udamjit , who was the manager . Harijit and Udamjit think they have gotten away with their crime by using dubious legal tricks . We shall see . <p> When we first filed this case , Harijit owned two Challenge petrol stations in Tokoroa . We advised the Authority that Harijit was seeking to get rid of both stations before he was held to account . He sold Challenge Tokoroa shortly after we filed our case . Now we hear that the purchaser has taken Harijit to court . Totally unsurprising . His son now has the Challenge Aotea station . <p> OneUnion has linked up with the Migrant Workers Association to get justice for these two employees . We are visiting Tokoroa on Friday 25 September to meet with community leaders and the extended whanau of the two exploited employees . <p> We have advised Challenge NZ of their franchisee 's criminality last Friday . This was all news to them . Harijit is no longer a franchisee , so there is little they can do . However Udamjit is now a new franchisee . We will provide our case file to Challenge . They have agreed to investigate the matter and take appropriate action . We will monitor this commitment . <p> The Tokoroa community has a proud history of fighting for workers ' rights . We have no doubt the good people of Tokoroa will show the rest of our nation how to win justice for minimum wage workers who have been exploited . Harijit Singh and his son Udamjit need to make it right . <p> Harijit and Udamjit should not be allowed to be employ workers , let alone sponsor visas for migrant workers . OneUnion is compiling a dossier on both men for the MBIE Labour Inspectorate , Immigration NZ , and the Inland Revenue Department . One Union will request action from these government entities . <p> If you have any information on Harjit Singh or his son Udamjit Singh , or would like to help the campaign to end exploitation in Tokoroa , please contact us at justice@oneunion.org.nz . Julia will contact you back . <p> We have our campaign bus ready for action to support a campaign to end exploitation in Tokoroa .

Please go to here . <p> Dollar Dealers sacked these workers on the spot , with no redundancy pay in the middle of the COVID lockdown . Dollar Dealers then pocketed the COVID subsidy for themselves . The workers got nothing . The boss made money . Shortly afterwards Dollar Dealers advertised vacancies . None of the ' redundant ' workers were offered their jobs back . <p> This was a clear case of an unscrupulous company targeting certain workers for sackings using the coronavirus crisis as cover . Taking taxpayers money meant for these workers reveals the ethics of the owners , Peter Delmont and his son James Delmont . Ironically it reinforces the stereotypes portrayed in film and media of the shady characters who run pawn shops . <p> OneUnion has filed a case against the employer on behalf of two workers . We do n't believe for a minute there were any genuine redundancies . The employer went through an insultingly fake consultation requiring employers to give feedback within 48 hours . Within days several employees were called in , terminated on the spot and ordered to immediately leave the premises . <p> Initially employees were told the company would pay any redundant workers the outstanding COVID subsidy . However it seems once the employer realised there was a loophole in the subsidy scheme that did n't require them to pay out the money to specific workers , they reneged . The redundant workers got nothing . Next time you hear about employers telling the government that they can be trusted to do the right thing when the taxpayer give them dosh , do n't believe them -- ever ! <p> Dollar Dealers has over 66 employees . Given the annual staff turnover in the national retail sector is 50% , that would mean through natural attrition they lose an average three employees a month . The employer tell me they only made three workers redundant . Duh ! <p> So they would have us believe , that despite having a government subsidy for their employees , they went through an elaborate consultation process with their entire workforce , just to reduce their workforce by three ? Really ? Dollar Dealer advertised for staff within a month . <p> We have a mediation meeting this Friday . If I was n't so outraged , I 'd look forward watching them trying to explain themselves with a straight face . The truth is they deliberately sacked these workers for dubious reasons that we are not aware of . Eventually we will find the real reason . <p> Sadly , many employers have taking advantage of the COVID crisis to sack workers they do n't like and pretend it 's a genuine redundancy . That 's outrageous enough , but pocketing the taxpayers gift that was meant to help save a workers ' jobs , is sickening . We as a community must stop this abuse and hold these people accountable for their behaviour . <p> If we do n't get a fair outcome at mediation with Dollar Dealers , we will launch a campaign for justice against the owners . <p> You can help in two ways . <p> We have our campaign bus ready for action . I 'd really appreciate Daily Blog supporters offering a small koha to get us on the road . With your support we can start visiting Dollar Dealer stores and mobilising locals against their corporate abuse . Please go here . <p> If you can offer practical support either through social media , or being part of our UTU squad email **28;2071;TOOLONG will contact you back . <p> A Hamilton business owner is accused of threatening to " expose " a former employee after One Union filed a claim against the employer for $26,000 in unpaid wages , and the return of $10,000 the worker was forced to pay to keep her job . <p> The employer is Ms Sejalben Patel ( aka Sejal Patel ) , the owner of Skin Delight Limited , that employed the worker between March and December 2018 . Patel has owned several businesses over the years and has engaged in similar exploitation of her employees . <p> Attempts to get this worker justice has gone on for over 18 months without success . After Patel was advised last week that the case is now filed in the Employment Relations Authority , she unlawfully contacted the worker with a series of texts and calls , threatening blackmail to the worker on unspecified matters unless the worker withdrew her case and terminated the union as her representative . <p> The union 's claim alleges the worker was required by Patel to work for no wages for the first three months of employment . Thereafter the worker was paid less than 30 hours weekly , despite working for 50 hours . It seems taxes were not passed to the Inland Revenue Department . In addition , Patel pressured the worker to pay a $10,000 " loan " to keep her job . When the worker requested this money back as promised , Patel threatened legal actions against her . <p> Disappointingly , when the Employment Authority arranged formal mediation last August , Patel was a no show . Afterwards she did admit to the essential facts of the case and offered to enter into good faith negotiations to resolve the matter . Yet despite Patel 's many promises , none of this loan has ever been returned . Nor has she made any offer to pay any of the unpaid wages or outstanding holiday pay she owes the worker . <p> Despite the union 's direct warnings to Patel , and the filing of a formal complaint with the police , Patel continues to harass this worker and another member of her family . We have instructed the worker to block her calls and pass on any communications from Patel to us . The emails and texts from Patel are damning evidence and will be tabled in the appropriate forum . <p> We are aware of at least one other occasion where Patel has threatened another former employee with similar tactics . As a consequence One Union has had to support a formal court non-molestation order against Patel . We have also filed an urgent application to the Employment Authority requesting immediate actions for financial penalties against Patel for harassment , in addition to the repayment of the loan and unpaid wages . <p> It is critical that employers like Patel are held to account for their bullying and menacing behaviour . Patel has engaged in an ongoing pattern of abusive and exploitive conduct against vulnerable workers . We settled an earlier case with Patel for a former employee with an almost identical story . At that time she gave a commitment to us she would stop her exploitative behaviour . It is now clear she has not . We are aware of another similar case underway against her . In the last month we have been contacted by several other people who have passed on other disturbing information about Patel . In the last month we understand Patel has made serious allegations against people she has had a dispute with . These people have strenuously denied her claims .

Matt McCarten -- Time for real leadership for Maori in Labour ? https : **32;2136;TOOLONG ... https : **39;2170;TOOLONG ... 18 Nov 2019 03:15:32 +0000https : //thedailyblog.co.nz/ ? p=120997The Labour presidential race is hotting up . Some activists inside the party and other political players warn for Labour to remain government next year they must elect someone who has campaign experience , as well as the political street smarts that has been missing in their presidents since Mike Williams . <p> Some in the press gallery have already anointed Labour relative-newcomer Habitat for Humanity CEO Claire Zsabo as the frontrunner . In contrast , Maori media commentators and senior union leaders promote vice president , Tane Phillips , as the only nominee with political campaign experience and the trust of blue-collar workers . <p> Maori , including supporters of Phillips , gathered over the weekend and expressed their frustration with the lack of progress on Ihumatao , and what they described as the invisibility of true representation in the party 's upper echelons . Others expressed fears that without solid campaign experience at the top , the party would become increasingly vulnerable going into an election year . <p> Current General Secretary Andre Anderson is a recent appointment and will take time to settle in . The other Vice President Tracey McLellan is standing down to run for the Port Hills seat . That means the Labour 's Head Office will have only Phillips in the central leadership who has any high-level general election campaign experience . <p> In his mid-50s , Phillips has held various positions within the party for years . As previous chairman of the Waiariki Labour electorate organisation he was the only person in the leadership who believed that Labour could take out Te Uruoa Flavell , therefore removing National 's only viable partner and pathway to government . Phillips is seen as a policy heavy weight by Maori in the party as their lead policy representative for Te Kaunihera Maori , the party 's Maori council . <p> I have known Phillips in the past as the head of the Pulp and Paper Workers ' Union in Kawerau . Phillips is the " blue-collar unionist " from central casting -- tough , warm , humorous , quick witted with the working class oratory gene . He comes from the same cloth as the people who founded the Labour Party -- and are still needed if the prime minister wants to keep her job . <p> As importantly , Phillips in his day job , is a strong workers ' advocate who fights for people in provincial New Zealand . He is already a proven leader in Maori , but has respect from union leaders and bosses alike . Having spent several years as part of the party leadership commuting to Wellington weekly I 'm surprised he is n't a shoo-in for the role . <p> Zsabo is a quality candidate , and is well-known within the powerful Auckland Labour circles . But critics claim she is like the rest of the leadership , creatures of the cities . She does n't have Phillips ' extensive rural networks that Labour desperately need . Nor does she have the first-hand direct knowledge of the party 's complex internal dynamics -- especially when it comes to navigating the complex relationship between the Maori Caucus and the wider Party . <p> Maori were dissed twice by Labour in our generation , and lost their seats to NZ First and then later to the Maori Party tossing Labour onto the opposition benches . <p> The current term has not been an easy one for the party 's Maori caucus . Their MPs have faced pressure from their constituents over the Government 's handling of Ihumatao , and the uplifts of Maori children by Oranga Tamariki . There is increasing concern about whether their voices are being heard by the wider caucus . <p> Phillips played a key role in Labour 's successful campaign to win all seven Maori seats back after 12 long years , whilst balancing the nuanced messaging for both the Maori and non-Maori constituencies . If he is elected president at the party 's conference he may be the first president who actually has serious fundraising experience . Union bosses are used to getting money off the rich , so he will be able to put that skill to use . <p> As a union leader in a rural community , he is used to mobilising the community . None of his predecessors have had that ability . A senior union activist in the party tells me Phillips is the only person who can confidently carve out a more defined centre left position for the party and put workers ' rights back into the mainstream of the party . <p> It 's ironic that opponents of Phillips say he has been tarnished because he served on the party 's Council during the alleged sexual assault of a female Labour volunteer . Given the alleged abuser was a parliamentary worker and a key aide to a senior cabinet minister I did n't see any senior MPs who knew something was right take responsibility -- which they should . They left it to the prime minister to burn up her capital for them instead . <p> " Put Jacinda and Phillips together and you have a picture of a complementary balance . But put Jacinda and Zsabo together and you have two very similar well-educated Auckland middle-class liberal women . We do n't need clones , we need diversity and we need to be able to recognise ourselves in the mix , " said one party insider who did not wish to be named for obvious reasons of self-protection . Though they do have a point . <p> Much has been said about lip service about breaking the glass ceiling for women aspiring to leadership . In my younger days I ruefully observed women were always the vice-presidents and deputy chairs . Thankfully that has changed . But diversity is n't just about gender . Diversity is about when two candidates are competent to do the top job , then diversity should be a determining factor <p> There is deep irony when both Labour 's deputy and their vice-president are Maori . <p> Labour now has the opportunity to support Maori having real leadership too , rather than being the sidekick bought out for ceremonial occasions to create the illusion of equality , when it is n't . <p> Matt McCarten is a Unionist , former Labour Party Chief of Staff and Left Wing Political General .

We do n't welcome abusive or defamatory comments and will de-register those repeatedly making such comments . Our current comment policy is here . <p> I asked this earlier today but got no answers . Why do people make pre-auction offers if the property is still going to auction ? Several houses have sold this week with no further bids in the room above the accepted pre auction offer , surely this means the buyer has over paid and should have waited to bid at the auction ? <p> Personally , if I made a pre-auction bid and say " Take it or leave it , now " but that does n't happen here . <p> Buyers are routinely coerced into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to auction ; that 's what the vendors want ' - and still use your bid as the highest offer - and if no one over-bids you on the day , you win ! ( Your bid remains firm , by the way . No second thoughts for you on the day ) <p> It 's lunacy if you ask me . And I 'm sure is illegal somewhere . But not here . It 's what we do - get used to it . <p> That 's what I think . The whole point of negotiation is to only concede if you get something back . I would only make an offer if they took the property off the market . What benefit does a pre auction bid have for the buyer ? They could be over paying by a 100k or more . <p> My thoughts is that there are still a number of home buyers out there with the mindset of competing with everyone else for a house . After all it was just a few months ago that things were mad . And you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd expect weary first home buyers jumped at the chance to place an offer before the bidding even started in order to FINALLY secure a house after months or years of losing . <p> We 've all been to an auction , whether it be for a car , a painting , furniture or a house that we 've made up our minds what our top price is . And most time , the process makes ' us ' overdo that . But whatever the asset sells for - that 's market price ; it 's current value . <p> Market price is n't a valuation , an opinion or a guess , it 's what something sells for and most importantly , can be paid for . <p> ( But I know you know all of the that ! And the real question should be , " Why did he pay so much ? Why did n't he offer $500k ? " ) <p> The last time I witness one of these shams , it started with something like " I have bid from the floor of $925,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now of course , the real estate agent was squashed up tight against the prior-to-auction bidder , cajoling them along and reassuring them that " You 've got this ! " , and if they were told " Look . You can withdraw your bid before this get going " I 'd be amazed ! <p> I repeat . The whole thing is a scam ; designed to entrap the unwary and those who might transact a property one every 7 years . <p> Do you know how auctions are run i other countries ? They start with , " Ok , ladies and gentlemen . Do I have $925,000 ? No ? Ok well $900,000 ? " <p> That is an auction process at its best . We do not have that here . What we have is a corrupte version of auctioneering . <p> No because its the seller that controls the price not the buyer . Basically both parties have agreed on a minimum price , the auction opens at this price and if anyone want to pay more they bid from there . My partner sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people with the opening offer got pipped to the post . Its not based purely on price , there are condition of sale that are signed off on before the auction starts that have to be agreed to by the seller . Auctions are only fun when you love the house and have plenty of money to simply smash the other buyers . I paid $55K over the next bidder for my place and ended up bidding against the vendor , did n't care , I knew what they wanted and met the price . <p> The market does n't really determine the price its a house not a car . I was prepared to pay $100K just for the view and the house was totally unique . Many other people probably could n't care less about the view or the private garden you can sunbathe naked in the suburbs but I was prepared to pay the extra . <p> Any asset for sale , however it 's being sold , is a quantifiable entity . Be that a car or a house . <p> Everyone knows ' it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth ( How 's that rust going in all your fixtures and fittings because you are so close to the salt water ! ) and the price paid mostly reflect what the buyer expert be able to recoup down the line ( those sea views ) whether THEY want them or not . <p> The only party that controls anything is the party that CAN pay . In most cases today , that 's the lender - the bank who facilitate the finance to a transaction . Take them out of the equations , and whatever the Seller thinks he controls - he does n't . <p> All the vendor can control is ownership of the asset . Does he sell today , or not ? And in asking themselves that question they are making a judgements about the future . The markets and most importantly , their own . <p> Not really I had some silly take it or leave it offers on my last place and crap like its valid to 5pm . It was see you later dickhead . Ultimately the seller determines the price , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not . <p> The seller determines IF they want to sell or not , not what the transaction price is . <p> Let 's say you 've just lost your job ; the job market in Tauranga for you is none existent , and you have bills/mortgages/school fees etc to pay . And you are made an offer below what you want but enough to pay your debtors . What are you going to do ? " See you later " might be a bad choice . <p> Do n't confuse your personal circumstances ( retired and downsized to a place that 's mortgage free ) to what most others have to face . Debt makes decision-making less than easy , and given the amount of Debt we have in the Private Sector , that decision-making is going to get harder . <p> In a hot market as we 've had for last 3 to 5 years ... people make a pre auction offer in the hope of bringing auction forward so less people will see house and competition will reduce . It you see it within 24 hrs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auction happens within 2 days ... then less people will have seen it . Makes no sense in a buyers market . Not sure it ever worked that well . Anyone get a win doing this ? <p> It was a serious question . I could n't see the advantage for the buyer but I suppose it could work in a hot market by limiting marketing time . I only buy through negotiation . I bought my current house after the tender process received no offers . I got it for below the original offers above price . <p> Hit the nail on the head . If you have a dodgy property to sell , auction it . The last thing you 'd want is someone doing their Due Diligence in the calm of any cooling-down period . And correct me if I 'm wrong , but any Buyer can go " Unconditional " at any time they like ? ie : They could make an Unconditional Bid before the ensuing sham auction process ? <p> No , if the vendor has inserted a condition related to going to auction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Secondly , on Due Diligence <p> I think most potential purchasers ' lawyers would most strongly advise ensuring due diligence prior to any bid at auction . Due diligence is common practice by potential purchasers who will be seriously bidding . From my experience at auctions one needs firstly to confirm the finance from the bank for that specific property as per the condition of any pre-approval ; this will involve assurances regarding the property 's valuation . If a LIM report is not provided by the vendor then a search of council files can be done at no cost and one can have a builder undertake an inspection at reasonable - or if a friend at no - cost .

It 's going to take a little while because people are understandably very nervous - But I think we do have to have a shift over time from focusing on every infection to saying : OK infection is here , we have to deal with it but what we really care about is ensuring we 're protecting with anti-virals , boosters , with whatever we have got at our disposal , protecting people vulnerable still to severe illness .

" <p> While there is still a need to raise the vaccination rates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that is a really important objective but we have to look at the balance of what all the downsides are of severe restrictions and how much of that we are prepared to tolerate " , Prof McIntyre says . <p> " The vaccines are performing terrifically well , we 're in a different situation with high vaccine coverage and that 's great . " <h> Delta made Aotearoa vulnerable <p> Prof McIntyre says New Zealand was most vulnerable to the Delta strain because at the time it escaped managed isolation into the Auckland community vaccination rates were still low . <p> If people are vaccinated they will probably be protected against the worst effects of Omicron and for the elderly or the immuno-compromised anti-virals will be available . <p> " So we 're in really really good shape . But the thing that we still have to focus on is unvaccinated because it does n't matter what letter of the Greek alphabet we 're talking about , they 're still in the firing line , " he says . <p> Prof McIntyre says in other parts of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receive one dose after being infected have a much greater level of protection against new variants . <p> Asked if low vaccination rates allow the development of variants , he says their emergence will be driven by " infection pressure " . <p> We are now in the post-vaccine world and need to recognise that this infection will be around forever and we need to be looking at how infections and vaccines interact with each other , he says . <p> In the future , there may be a live-attenuated version of this virus that vaccinated people can have which will provide a boost without giving people the virus . <p> These types of vaccines create nervousness because of fears of whether it has been weakened enough to not pass on the virus , particularly to children . <p> " There 's been interest in it but it 's something which is still evolving , " Prof McIntyre says . <p> The approach of having the vaccine go into the nose or breathing it in through an aerosol is another option for building up immunity . <p> " A live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done with flu , it may be something which really helps us as this whole endemic or transition to being an endemic virus evolves , " he says . <p> The goal is to build a broad immune response that would be similar to the immunity built up for measles and other childhood viruses such as chickenpox and polio . <p> " That 's why we have been able to get rid of smallpox because we were actually giving protection against the whole virus , not just a bit of it . " <p> It looks like a mix and match of mRNA vaccines ( such as Pfizer ) is effective - which is positive when trying to distribute the supply of vaccines worldwide , however , there would not be any advantage to New Zealanders using another vaccine for their booster shot , he says . <p> While early reports suggest the new variant Omicron may be milder than the likes of Delta , his prediction is that people are still at risk of severe disease if they are unvaccinated.

@@42769238 <h> Malicious advertisements on major websites lead to ransomware <p> Cisco has linked a highly effective attack using a ransomware program called Cryptowall to malicious advertisements seeded on major websites . <p> Malicious advertisements on domains belonging to Disney , Facebook , The Guardian newspaper and others are leading people to malware that encrypts a computer 's files until a ransom is paid , Cisco Systems has found . <p> The finding comes shortly after technology companies and U.S. law enforcement banded together in a large operation to shut down a botnet that distributed online banking malware and so-called " ransomware , " a highly profitable scam that has surged over the last year . <p> Cisco 's investigation unraveled a technically complex and highly effective way for infecting large number of computers with ransomware , which it described in detail on its blog . <p> " It really is insidious , " said Levi Gundert , a former Secret Service agent and now a technical lead for threat research and analysis at Cisco , in a phone interview Friday . <p> Cisco has a product called Cloud Web Security ( CWS ) which monitors its customers web surfing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CWS monitors billions of web page requests a day , Gundert said . <p> The company noticed that it was blocking requests to 90 domains , many of those WordPress sites , for more than 17 percent of its CWS customers , he said . <p> Further investigation showed that many of the CWS users were ending up on those domains after viewing advertisements on high-traffic domains such as " apps.facebook.com , " " awkwardfamilyphotos.com , " " theguardian.co.uk " and " go.com , " a Disney property , among many others . <p> Certain advertisements that appeared on those domains , however , had been tampered with . If clicked , they redirected victims to one of the 90 domains . <p> The style of attack , known as " malvertising , " has long been a problem . Advertising networks have taken steps to try and detect malicious advertisements placed on their network , but the security checks are n't foolproof . <p> Occasionally , bad advertisements slip in , which are shown on a vast array of websites that have signed up with the network or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often unaware they 're being abused . <p> " It goes to show that malvertising is a real problem , " Gundert said . " People expect when they go to a Tier 1 website that it is a trustworthy place to visit , but because there are so many third-party external links , that 's not really true . " <p> The 90 domains the malicious advertisements pushed traffic to had also been hacked , Gundert said . In the case of the WordPress sites , it appears the attackers used brute-force attacks -- which involves guessing login credentials -- to access the site 's control panels . Then , an exploit kit called Rig was inserted , which attacked the victim 's computer , Gundert said . <p> The Rig exploit kit , first spotted in April by Kahu Security , checks if users are running an unpatched version of Flash , Java or the Silverlight multimedia program . If someone 's computer is n't patched , " you 're instantly exploited , " Gundert said . <p> In the next stage of the attack , a ransomware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infamous Cryptolocker malware , is installed . It encrypts the user 's files , demanding a ransom . In another sign of the operation 's sophistication , the website where users can pay the ransom is a hidden website that uses The Onion Router , or the TOR network . <p> To navigate to a TOR hidden website , a user must have TOR installed , which Cryptowall helpfully provides instructions for how to install . Those who delay paying the ransom find it increases as time passes . <p> Because of the use of TOR and the technically complex attack chain , Cisco has n't yet been able to identify a group behind the attacks . <p> Gundert said it is likely that several groups or people with different skills -- such as malvertising , traffic redirection , exploit writing and ransomware campaigns -- are working together . <p> " You could have a threat actor putting together all of these pieces on their own , but there are so many different specialties involved in this attack chain , " he said . <p> Copyright 2021 IDG Communications . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reproduction in whole or in part in any form or medium without express written permission of IDG Communications is prohibited . 
@@42769239 <p> Many servers expose insecure management interfaces to the Internet through microcontrollers embedded into the motherboard that run independently of the main OS and provide monitoring and administration functions . <p> These Baseboard Management Controllers ( BMCs ) are part of the Intelligent Platform Management Interface ( IPMI ) , a standardized interface made up of a variety of sensors and controllers that allow administrators to manage servers remotely when they 're shut down or unresponsive , but are still connected to the power supply . <p> BMCs are embedded systems that run inside servers and have their own firmware -- usually based on Linux . They provide IPMI access through a network service accessible over UDP port 623 . <p> Security researchers have warned in the past that most IPMI implementations suffer from architectural insecurities and other vulnerabilities that can be exploited to gain administrative access to BMCs . If attackers control the BMC they can mount attacks against the server 's OS as well as other servers from the same management group . <p> " For over a decade major server manufacturers have harmed their customers by shipping servers that are vulnerable by default , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to no documentation about how to make things better , " said Dan Farmer , a security researcher who has analyzed IPMI security over the past two years , in a paper published Wednesday . " These vendors have not only gone out of their way to make their offerings difficult to understand or audit but also neglected to supply any substantial defense tools or helpful security controls . " <p> Farmer , together with HD Moore , chief research officer at Rapid7 and lead architect of the Metasploit penetration testing framework , ran scans on the Internet in May and identified 230,000 publicly accessible BMCs . A deeper analysis revealed that 46.8 percent of them were running IPMI version 1.5 , which dates back to 2001 , and 53.2 percent were running IPMI version 2.0 , which was released in 2004 . <p> " BMCs running 1.5 only had a single simple problem , but it 's a whopper -- nearly all server management ports had the NULL authentication option set , meaning that all accounts could be logged into without authentication , " Farmer said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by itself a problem but not a serious one , but working in tandem with the first it means that you can login to pretty much any older IPMI system without an account or a password . " <p> About 90 percent of the BMCs connected to the Internet that were running IPMI 1.5 had the NULL authentication issue , Farmer said . The privileges associated with the NULL account vary from vendor to vendor , but in most cases they grant administrative access , and even when they do n't the mere ability to execute any kind of commands without authentication is a bad thing , he said . <p> In addition , IPMI version 1.5 does n't encrypt the connection between a user and a BMC so man-in-the-middle and other network attacks can be used to sniff passwords or hijack the connection . " You might think of the security of version 1.5 as something akin to using the old , reviled , unencrypted , and easily subverted telnet command for remote logins , " Farmer said . <p> IPMI version 2 includes cryptographic protection and supports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own . <p> For example , the first cipher option , known cipher zero , provides no authentication , integrity or confidentiality protection , Farmer said . A valid user name is required for logging in , but no password is required . " The majority of servers have cipher zero enabled on their BMC by default , and HP Hewlett-Packard , who is one of the largest , if not the largest vendor of BMCs , had apparently never allowed you to turn it off until just recently . " <p> The researcher found that around 60 percent of the publicly accessible BMCs running IPMI version 2 had the cipher zero vulnerability . <p> Another serious issue introduced by IPMI 2.0 stems from its RAKP key-exchange protocol that 's used when negotiating secure connections . The protocol allows an anonymous user to obtain password hashes associated with any accounts on the BMC , as long as the account names are known . <p> " This is an astonishingly bad design , because it allows an attacker to grab your password 's hash and do offline password cracking with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Farmer said . <p> The analysis showed that 83 percent of the identified BMCs were vulnerable to this issue and a test with John the Ripper , a brute-force password guessing application , using a modest 4.7 million-word dictionary successfully cracked password hashes obtained from 30 percent of the BMCs . <p> " Of course numerous past studies have shown the effectiveness of what a serious attacker can do , and with orders of magnitudes faster speeds than I could muster on my consumer grade iMac , " Farmer said . " I 'd say that even a well-chosen non-dictionary based password of a dozen characters or less is suspect . " <p> Farmer calculated that between 72.8 and 92.5 percent , depending on password cracking success rate , of BMCs running IPMI 2.0 had authentication issues and were vulnerable to unauthorized access . <p> " While a quarter of a million BMCs is only a tiny sliver of the total computing power in the world , it 's still an important indicator as a kind of canary in the coalmine , " because BMCs that are behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " While management systems are often not directly assailable from the outside they 're often left open once the outer thin hard candy shell of an organization is breached . " <p> Farmer 's paper includes some recommendations for server administrators on how to mitigate some of the identified issues and better secure their BMCs , but the researcher concludes that ultimately the problem of insecure IPMI implementations will linger on for a long time . <p> " Many of these problems would have been easy to fix if the IPMI protocol had undergone a serious security review or if the developers of modern BMCs had spent a little more effort in hardening their products and giving their customers the tools to secure their servers , " Farmer said . " At this point , it is far too late to effect meaningful change . The sheer number of servers that include a vulnerable BMC will guarantee that IPMI vulnerabilities and insecure configurations will continue to be a problem for years to come .

@@42775236 <p> A debate in the U.S. about whether the National Security Agency should end its bulk collection of U.S. telephone and business records has come down to an argument over the meaning of the word " bulk . " <p> A year after the first leaks by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden were published , it appears that already scaled-back proposals to limit the NSA 's bulk collection of U.S. telephone and business records may not even happen . And officials with President Barack Obama 's administration , backing an NSA reform bill called the USA Freedom Act , have already begun to pick holes in its definitions . <p> An amended version of the USA Freedom Act that passed the House of Representatives in May would allow the NSA to continue to target wide groups of U.S. records , critics said , because of its expanded definition of the terms the NSA must use to define its searches . <p> President Barack Obama in January announced plans to end the bulk collection of U.S. phone and business records , and administration officials have said the amended version of the USA Freedom Act would accomplish that goal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collection depends on the definition of " bulk . " Deputy Attorney General James Cole told the Senate Intelligence Committee Thursday that the prohibition on bulk collection means the " indiscriminate " collection of U.S. records . The USA Freedom Act would allow the NSA to collect " large numbers of records , " if a surveillance court judge approves the request , he said . <p> Somewhat contradictory , Cole said the bill would prohibit the collection of all phone records in a ZIP code . " That would be the type of indiscriminate bulk collection that this bill is designed to end , " he said . <p> Large-scale targets <p> The language in the bill tells a different story , critics said . <p> " Senators , let us not use the phrase , ' bulk collection , ' as coded jargon for existing programs or nationwide surveillance dragnets , " Harley Geiger , senior counsel at the Center for Democracy and Technology , said during the Thursday hearing . " Rather , bulk collection , as any normal person would understand it , means the large-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crime or investigation . " <p> The version of the bill that passed the House would allow the NSA to target wide groups of U.S. records , critics said , because it allows an expended definition of a " specific selection term " that the NSA must use to define its searches . The amended version of the bill allows the NSA to target things " such as a person , entity , accounts , address , or device , " language that would give the NSA few limits on what groups it can target , critics said . <p> The amended USA Freedom Act " does not end bulk collection , " Geiger added . " The definition of ' specific selection term ' is deliberately ambiguous and open-ended . There is nothing in the bill that would prohibit , for example , the use of search terms Verizon , Gmail.com or the state of Georgia as a specific selection term . " <p> The USA Freedom Act may not even pass the Senate , however . During the hearing Thursday , several members of the Senate Intelligence Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the USA Freedom Act because its limits on the NSA would endanger national security , those senators argued . <p> Little change in policy <p> The result is that , one year after Snowden 's leaks , a heated debate continues about the appropriate role of government surveillance , but there has been little change in U.S. policy . <p> While Congress and Obama have taken measured steps toward reining in the NSA 's bulk collection of U.S. phone records , the NSA continues to operate the program . Policymakers , however , have taken almost no action , beyond a general statement from Obama that foreigners should have privacy rights , to limit the NSA 's surveillance programs targeting overseas electronic communications . <p> The lack of action in Washington is disappointing and harms the U.S. tech industry the longer nothing happens , said Daniel Castro , a senior analyst at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation , a tech-focused think tank . The leaks about NSA spying worldwide have soured much of the rest of the world on the use of U.S. IT products , he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's necessary and important , but policymakers " have n't waved the flag and said , ' what was happening before will not happen again , ' " Castro said . <p> While some policy debates in Washington , D.C. , take years to play out , speed is important in this case , as other nations look for alternatives to U.S. tech products , Castro said . " There 's basically a clock on this , " he said . " If you do n't address this in a certain period of time , you lose out on long-term competitiveness . Every day you do n't address this , you 're losing out . " <p> Castro does n't expect the controversy over the surveillance to die down . " It 's defining the brand of American tech companies as something that is both insecure and available to government surveillance , " he said . " Once you 're branded a certain way , it 's really hard to shake .

" It is time for action . As the Senate takes up this important legislation , we urge you to ensure that U.S. surveillance efforts are clearly restricted by law , proportionate to the risks , transparent , and subject to independent oversight . " <p> Praise for Snowden <p> Many civil liberties advocates have praised Snowden 's actions , saying the information he leaked to news organizations has ignited a much-needed debate on privacy and government surveillance . <p> " The revelations have an extraordinary impact on our country , " said Alex Abdo , a staff attorney with the American Civil Liberties Union 's National Security Project . " They 've really reinvigorated our democracy . They 've allowed a conversation that 's been long overdue about the relationship between new technology and privacy . " <p> While the U.S. public is still debating what the proper surveillance reforms should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is tremendously significant , " Abdo said . " We 're far from the end of our experience with the Snowden effect . " <p> Even beyond a still-heated debate over government surveillance , the Snowden leaks have led to a broader public debate about privacy in the digital age , Abdo said . <p> " The tech industry has been jolted a bit with the realization of how much Americans trust them to be good stewards of their private data , " he said . " Americans appreciate more and more just how much information both the government and private industry are capable of collecting . We now live in a world in which pervasive surveillance is possible , and , is in some circumstances , occurring . " <p> The Snowden leaks have prompted many tech services and Web users to take action , with encrypted traffic doubling over the past year , added Amie Stepanovich , senior policy counsel with international digital rights group Access . <p> " Given that the NSA and other governments ' surveillance agencies have traditionally operated behind a curtain of secrecy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are no longer operating in the dark , " she said by email . " Documents made available over the past year have meant that , for the first time , civil society and the public have been able to weigh in meaningfully on the limits of how states should spy on the world 's Internet users . " <p> The debate is " moving in the right direction , " Stepanovich added . " We have the support of the internet community at our backs , pushing forward toward real reform . " <p> Do n't wait for Washington <p> The Reset the Net campaign calls on Web users to take privacy into their own hands by downloading a package of privacy tools . <p> Internet services with hundreds of millions of users have pledged to use SSL and other privacy tools as part of the campaign . <p> Web users should n't wait for Washington to act on surveillance reform , said Ethan Oberman , CEO of SpiderOak , a Reset the Net supporter and provider of a privacy-focused cloud service . <p> " I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington , " Oberman said .
