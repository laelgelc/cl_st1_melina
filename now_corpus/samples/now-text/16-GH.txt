Carbohydrates ( rice , yam , fufu ) should be fist sized . <p> Same with meat or fish or beans . So if you struggle with your weight like I do , you should not be eating an entire Kenkey at a meal or a plateful of rice , or more than a piece of fish/ chicken , a handful of nuts or a bread roll bigger than your fist . <p> 3 .

All the yummy meals I made are less than 400 calories and yummy . <p> 4 . Thou shall not rush <p> That wedding , reunion etc. is n't a reason to starve or go on a bogus liquid diet only to gain all back cos it will happen .

Consistency <p> Work out 30 minutes 5 days or more a week no excuse . So many free exercises on YouTube . Walk in your neighbourhood or up and down stairs . If you want a flat Janet Jackson tummy do sit ups daily . <p> Beyonce bum : squats . Michele Obama arms : pushups . As soon as you wake up or before bed at home . Eat consistently healthy and watch your portion sizes . Cut out junk food and make actual tasty dishes . Do it for one whole year and see if you do n't see a change . <p> 6 .

I agree , so true ! If it is in your house , you are eating it ! <p> Get the junk food out of your house and wrap the food that 's not junk but you should n't be eating too frequently in a dark polybag and hide behind your cabinet- so you hardly see it . <p> Out of sight out of mind . Always have fruits and vegetables displayed in a bowl your house and you will eat more of them !

" <p> Dr Aryee is convinced that until one makes a personal commitment to live by these tenets , nothing much could be achieved . " People must show personal commitment towards accountability and responsibility " if we want to nip corruption in the bud . <p> She notes that the thinking among the generality of Ghanaians is that it is the minority who occupy the upper echelons in society and hold high offices who engage in corrupt acts and not the less privileged majority .

" <p> " If you take the Economic Intelligence Unit ( EIU ) report , they said 2017 and onward is going to be a period of prosperity for Ghana and that is because of the foundation that we have laid , it 's because of the work that we have done , we 've eliminated a lot of the deficits that were created by huge subsidies on utility tariffs , we eliminated a lot of the subsidies that created huge deficits on the cost of petroleum products , today as I speak , Tema Oil Refinery ( TOR ) is running , and producing petroleum products for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tanks and strategic reserves for petroleum products are all full , and , so , we have ships standing offshore Ghana with petroleum products , but there is no space to offload those products , and , so , we 've done a good job in stabilising various sectors of the economy . <p> " Today we are supplying diesel and petrol to Burkina Faso and Mali from our Bolga Depot .

@@8413236 <h> A major reason ... the current rampant breakdown of many marriages and courtships <p> Many marriages and romantic relationships never really crystallize into productive friendships or successful marital establishments because the people involved do not begin the relationship in the right way . In reality , there is no real marriage or courtship on any solid foundation for such situations , although the people involved and those around them keep thinking or believing that there is a genuine love relationship in operation . <p> Several things are disposable in our time --- disposal diapers , disposable syringes , disposable plates , disposable cutlery etc. , so we are unconsciously conditioned in our minds to also engage in disposable dating and courting relationships , and disposable marriages ! Solemn ! <p> Some marriages are actually " dead on arrival " . There are several divorce cases caused by incompatibility , whereby couples discover that it is practically impossible to live together because nothing seems to fit together properly between them . <p> They experience serious personality conflicts , differences of opinions , long physical separation , mistrust and distrust , differences of interests , irreversible hostile feelings , diametrically opposite lifestyles and beliefs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life . In many cases the partners can not be compatible intellectually , domestically , spiritually , sexually , and emotionally . <p> Incompatible courting individuals also find out that they can not click together at all in any way , and find themselves completely opposite to each other in all the most important aspects of a sweet and fruitful relationship that is meant for marriage . It is always better to quit at that stage in a courtship , than to force and marry , and then later divorce and create more damage . <p> If the required godly and wise rules and principles necessary for the consistent building and establishment of a good marriage or productive love relationship are broken and diluted by the people involved from the very beginning of the association , then they should not expect to have a successful courtship or marriage relationship . <p> In my opinion , the worst cases are when they start the relationship in deception , immorality , ignorance , rebellion , lies , greed , haste , and with an ungodly lifestyle ; or when the marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or is travelling abroad and must , therefore , marry someone very quickly ) ; or is done in frustration ( ex. anxiety to have children or financial help , or solve an unexpected problem of loneliness ) . <p> The truth is that fruits of joy can not emerge out of a tree grown in poor soil without " joyful nutrients " , or soil infused with " sad chemicals " . Fertilizers of change and nourishment could be added , if the lack of required nutrients is discovered early enough , and the people are determined to work diligently for change , modification , and restoration . <p> One of the primary reasons for the tragedy of several seemingly sweet courtships and happy marriages being on the rocks today is the poor knowledge and lack of understanding of the real meaning of marriage , which is exacerbated by the absence of the fundamental ingredients necessary for any courtship or marriage to survive and thrive . The foundation then becomes very poor and very shaky . This causes several courtships and marriages to be dead on arrival as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or other people around them ) could call the relationship " courtship " or " marriage " , but it would not be any proper and enduring courtship or marriage in reality . <p> DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE <p> In my opinion , Marriage is a committed romantic sexual covenant relationship between one man and one woman that demonstrates the best form of love , ordained by God for a common bond and an exclusive union that constitutes the highest institution of God on earth , through which other human beings enter the world to create families , develop into productive individuals with defined destinies , become sources of blessings for society , worship God as a lifestyle , and are used by God to fulfill His highest purposes in the world . <p> Hahaha ! Wow ! What a complex and winding definition of Dr. Kisseadoo for marriage ! But I believe that if you take time to digest what I am trying to convey , you will finally agree that the basic tenets of society for marriage are embodied in my apparent winding definition . <p> How can you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institution effectively , when you have no clue as to what it really is , or have been misled about its definition and real application ? <p> Some marriages and courtship problems are so terrible that the people involved look like chickens running around with their heads cut off ! Or like a deer in the middle of the road at night starring at a vehicle with its high beam shining in its face . <p> I remember the case of a friend who defended his Master of Biology thesis , and collected masses of data for two years and presented without a single statistical analysis . When the examiners asked him why he had no trace of statistics in his analysis , he simply stood starring at them . <p> When one examiner mentioned the use of , for example , Split Plot Design , or Randomized Block Design for his field experiments on plant growth , he even starred more into their faces in a stupor . <p> The fact is that he had no idea about these methods in experimentation , and his Advisor ( or Major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never mentioned it to him either . <p> One of the examiners shook his head and told him : " You do n't know what you are about . " The graduate student was asked to go back and spend another year to repeat some experiments and demonstrate statistical analysis before being awarded the degree . <p> In a similar fashion , the people planning the marriage may not have any real understanding of what they are actually planning for ; and the parents , elders , counselors , and pastors etc. do a poor job of not adequately helping the people to know what it means to court or to marry , because they might not also fully know or understand the institution of marriage themselves . <p> Sometimes the people supposed to teach and help you are struggling helplessly with their own courtships and marriages . Whatever stage that the courting or married individuals might be at any particular time , they must be encouraged to sit at the feet of well-tutored , experienced , spiritually-minded , and knowledgeable people with first-hand marital and family life information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could apply for lasting fruitfulness and success . <p> Some suggested solutions to deal with poor foundation in courtship or marriage <p> When we discover the root causes of the poor foundations for any establishment , they become the basis for the solutions to the problems . So , let us try to enumerate the root causes , and seek to deal thoroughly with each of them , one at a time . We can never lump all courtship and marriage problems into one sum , and deceive ourselves to think we can solve " the problem " as one entity in a single shot . The confusion , and lack of knowledge and real understanding of courtship and marriage , could be unquestionably attributed to : <p> 1 ) Wrong Definition of Marriage --- The prevailing modern trend of the redefinition of marriage , in opposition ( and in rebellion ) to what God the Creator of Marriage designed and purposed for humans . <p> 2 ) Bad Parenting or Absence of any Parenting ---The lack of good parenting and impartation of guiding principles in homes that teaches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Divorces and Broken Courtships --- The already painful and uncalled-for broken courtships and marriages that send wrong signals to ignorant or unstable people to think that marriage and romantic relationships are fragile , uncertain , casual , and could be used as cheap avenues to take advantage of people that you can pretend to be in love with . <p> 4 ) Lack of True Commitment --- The fast erosion of a spirit of commitment to duty in our societies that makes people to develop a casual and flippant attitude towards everything in life without any heart and mind commitment to observe principles and seek for excellence . This is particularly running wild among teenagers and young adults , which is very troubling . This makes it hard for people to be committed to the duties and sacrifices required by courtships , marriages , and family life . There is a strong wave of the toxic and infectious spread among populations , of the desire to obtain " free stuff " without labor , from agencies , governments , organizations , churches , workplaces etc . I identify the root @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true commitment is not properly taught and practiced . Students even want " free grades " and " free submission of tests , papers , and theses " by plagiarism , cutting and pasting , or someone doing it for them without any efforts on their part . <p> 5 ) Marital Unfaithfulness --- The escalation of unfaithfulness resulting from high levels of adultery and fornication . These are promoted by the explosion of nudity , pornography , and immorality in our communities that undermines the respect for sexual activities as an exclusive act reserved only for marriage . <p> 6 ) Lack of True Love --- Misinterpretation of mere physical attraction , infatuation , and sexual desire as real love that could be depended on for a permanent union of marriage . Lack of understanding , that love is an act of the will ( not just feelings ) to look out for the welfare , progress , and best interest of the one you love , whether you feel or not feel anything ; but the passionate ( feeling ) love in you is the spark to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for courtship or marriage . <p> 7 ) Immoral Lifestyles --- Many girls and women who offer themselves cheaply to men due to the desperation to have babies ; or get their financial , accommodation , and several material needs met . People force to live beyond their means , and therefore yield to the temptation to engage in immoral lifestyle and selling of their bodies for money and material things . <p> 8 ) Forced Marriages --- Forced marriages that are unprepared for , due to illegal or unexpected pregnancy , or the rush to solve a medical problem ( ex . A lady who might be told by a Doctor that she has a short time to have babies before the door is medically closed ) . <p> 9 ) Arranged Marriages --- Arranged marriages by parents and adults where the two people do not really love each other for any lasting marriage relationship . <p> 10 ) Ignorance --- Lack of pre-marital counseling , absence of training in the home that prepares people for future courtship and marriage , or poor counseling that does not provide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 11 ) No Fear of God --- Absence of the fear of God in the lives of many people that causes them to disrespect marriage , and neglect or refuse to seek the welfare of people they get into romantic or close relationship with . Unfortunately , this often includes even several people who are members of churches , pastors , leaders in churches and Christian groups or other religious bodies , or persons who portray spirituality but are merely religious . <p> We must identify and adequately deal with the roots <p> Parents , Guardians , Family Elders , Pastors , and Counselors , must ensure that their parenting , training , preaching , teaching , and counseling seek to address these root causes of our relationship , marriage , and family life problems . If all these factors are properly dealt with , then we could produce lasting solutions to the problem of many of our dead-on-arrival courtships and marriages . Just as Jesus opened the minds of the disciples to understand the scriptures ( Luke 24:45 ) , we need to pray and ask the Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of the institution of marriage , and good courtship that prepares us for a good marriage and fruitful marriage life . <p> God Himself says " Marriage is a mystery " ( Ephesians 5:32 ) , so who can finally make us understand what God calls a mystery , if God the Creator Himself does not provide us with the real meaning or marriage , at least at our human level , in a way that we can understand ? Yes , God will . We should be encouraged to believe that there is still hope for us and our children to repair our damages , and for future marital and family success .

" If these predictions are correct , Africa is set to close in on the remarkable growth rates seen before the 2008/09 global economic crisis . In addition to this , many African countries have improved their investment climate and conditions for doing business , thereby enhancing their long-term growth prospects . <p> The real beneficiaries of extractive industries <p> Yet , despite these positive milestones , the continued dependence of many African countries on extractive industries ( AEO 2015 ) means that not enough jobs are being created to provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for its wealth of natural resources , it is still home to six of the ten most unequal countries in the world . Moreover , approximately 72% of Africa 's youth live on less than US$2 a day , and nearly 50% of Africans live in extreme poverty ( Lagarde 2014 ) . This has led to mounting questions surrounding the ' real ' beneficiaries of Africa 's economic growth . <p> Such questions are particularly evident when it comes to trade and regional integration . While African exports were expected to strengthen in 2015 and 2016 , intra-African trade is still fairly low , especially when compared to the rest of the world . <p> Low intra-regional trade <p> Intra-regional trading and sourcing is currently estimated to account for between 10% and 12% of Africa 's total trade . This is relatively low when compared to other areas including North America who stands at 40% , Western Europe who has approximately 60% intra-regional trade and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation ( APEC ) which stands at 67% . While the EU 's intra-regional trade accounts for about 61% of trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supports 41% , the Association of Southeast Asian Nation ( ASEAN ) promotes 25% , and the Common Market of the South ( MERCUSOR ) stands at approximately 17% . Buying versus strategic sourcing <p> As a result of this low intra-regional trade , Africans have become reliant on buying products made outside of <p> the continent . In fact , African governments and organisations are generally recognised for buying products , instead of strategically sourcing them . Masimba Tafirenyika insists that " trade flourishes when countries produce what their trading partners are eager to buy . " He further argues that , " with a few exceptions , this is not yet the case with Africa . It produces what it does n't consume and consumes what it does n't produce . " This means that in addition to exporting raw materials , Africa is also exporting money through externally focused buying habits . <p> According to Anyanwu ( 2014 ) over the period 1995 to 2012 , over 80% of the region 's exports were shipped overseas , mainly to the European Union ( EU ) , China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were still raw materials to be converted into work in progress and finished goods , suggesting that Africa is industrialising other regions of the world at a faster pace than what is happening on the continent itself .

Far less than <p> 33% of current government procurement expenditure goes directly to African owned and based organisations . This means that Africa is generally supporting long-term job and wealth creation in other regions of the world . In addition to this , procurement practitioners in Africa are often relegated to the backbenches of corporate and public sector decision-making processes . Since procurement practitioners in Africa are often perceived as ' not ready ' to take strategic responsibility for supply chain management decision-making , finance is generally promoted to take on the lead supply chain management function . As such , short-term price gains tend to be the focus of African procurement and sourcing processes . This focus on price , together with many African producers inability to compete with global economies of scale , has resulted in the reduction of collective national and regional effort , limited intra-regional co-operation , and a lack of innovative strategic sourcing practices . <p> The end result of the current African economic picture is that while the rest of the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term developmental needs , the majority of African organisations are buying from outside the continent to meet short to medium-term needs .

Four months into 2016 elections , IMANI provides a comprehensive and detailed policy-focused report on the state of affairs in the past four years and suggest how identified gaps should be filled in the next four years . <p> The election year of 2016 comes at a very pivotal time in the history of the 4threpublic . This election is just after the first constitutional review activity done in 2015 . It also comes right after the Ghanaian economy has begun a slow recovery from a two-year energy crisis that has slowed down economic growth . <p> Significant in this dispensation has been the need to rely on the Supreme Court to clarify certain landmark cases related to governance and corruption , which still remain key attributes in determining the suitability of a political candidate . <p> Against this backdrop , expectations of the nation hinge on a matrix of intermingling objectives that they view as crucial to determining a winning candidate for the 2016 elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues that will arise . <p> Governance The discussion of governance presents a myriad of sub-themes which have piqued the interest of many-a-voter . The aftermath of investigative journalistic work by journalists like Anas Aremeyaw Anas and Manasseh Azure Awuni have focused the spotlight increasingly on abuses of office by various office holders . This has also emboldened civil society pressure groups like OccupyGhana and others to pick out topical issues for discussion in the general public space . <p> These dominant themes have created an increasing following that is constantly monitoring the barometer of perceived corrupt practices by public officials . Voters expect any upcoming government , be it the incumbent or an incoming one to take the issue of corruption very seriously and with a very swift and firm hand . <p> Public confidence in most government and state-appointed officials has been eroded with successive reports of flagrant scandals involving massive impropriety . As a matter of fact , the inability of Ghana 's parliament to accelerate the passing of the freedom of information bill almost a decade and half , compared to the speed with which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pursue a communication bill that was designed to eavesdrop on electronic communications clearly indicated to the interested public that where there is motivation , the legislature can indeed rally around and pass bills . <p> In similar vein , pressure groups like the Citizen Ghana movement have opened the gates to challenges to the right of disclosure by public officials of documents that hitherto were not available for public scrutiny , in relation to the bus branding contract . <p> This level of awareness means that voters are really now very interested in outcomes of good governance more than ever before . Governance will be seen to only advance with the passing of the Right to Information Act , as well as the ability of the next government to swiftly deal with the inability of the Auditor-General to bring the hammer down on abuses that have been discovered , of which excesses are into billions of cedis . <p> Legal Empowerment to Right of Information Insulation from victimization <p> Perhaps , the most important success factor in the 2016 elections will be matters of the pocket . The turbulent nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the effects of all-time high crude oil prices . <p> Another major niggling negating factor was a fall in the international price of cocoa , one of Ghana 's highest foreign exchange earners . For any economic management team , this is a murderous cocktail of negative externalities that will sink most countries into distress . <p> With expected revenues from oil falling by as much as 45% from a high or $110 per barrel in 2014 , to $75 in the latter part of 2015 , and further falls to around $50 , representing 3 year lows , the projections of oil based revenue have diminished . It is quite obvious that Ghana was relying too much on proposed oil revenue without looking much into diversification of the economy , almost falling prey to the Dutch Disease in the process . <p> A juxtaposed comparison with the oil-led growth during the boom years of 2012 -- 2013 , where oil-led growth was around 7.5% of GDP ( nearly 15% of total GDP in 2011 ) shows very interesting insight into the performance of the economy . <p> Sharp drops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in 2014 , and the shrinking of growth further to 4.9% and a projected 3.2% in 2016 is a clear indicator of poor year on year growth in GDP , in spite of increased government debt from both local and international capital markets . <p> The depreciation of the cedi by over 20% in 2015 made an even bad situation worse because imports became even more expensive to procure , industries dependent on imports and petroleum had ballooning costs , and in 2016 these wounds have deepened by what in some cases is a threefold increase in energy bills . <p> The freeze in capital meant very little in terms of local savings and therefore local investments . Most government activity was in the way of heavy borrowing , with some borrowing rounds being undertaken just to pay off previous debts . <p> Unless there is a radical shift in the fundamentals , most small businesses are not going to expand and consolidate but will rather go into barebones mode , where deformalization will be essential for survival . This will even make tax and revenue assurance all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A very clear prelude to some of these tax regimes are very opaque petroleum usage taxes purported to reduce the debt of Ghana 's state-owned Tema Oil refinery ( TOR ) and other parastatals . <p> It is very interesting to note that the pegging of the fund to which the petroleum levies go to do not clearly declare their receivables and exactly what they target in terms of debt reduction . Based on the current track record in terms of taxation policy , should the ruling government still remain in power , it must with tact and speed reverse the very retrogressive taxation schemes it has adopted annually to raise revenue . <p> The opposition parties must assure every Ghanaian , local and international investors that they will chart a new consultative path to defining the limits of what can be efficiently taxed to spur economic development . Simply put an optimal tax regime must define develop any political ambitions to raise more revenue . <p> Again here , obvious discrepancies in spending by Ministries Departments and Agencies ( MDAs ) that get ignored mean that there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spending . With the Auditor-General 's reports for instance , we see that within the years between 2009 and 2013 alone , over GHC 5 Billion ( $1.2bn ) has been lost to " irregularities " . <p> Compare this with the fact that the country has gone on the market for Eurobonds worth $1 billion around the same period . Between 2012 and 2014 a total of GHS 5,940,767,187.09 ( $1.6bn ) was officially reported missing or misused between 19 Ministries , Departments and Agencies , 18 Public boards and institutions which fall under 18 Ministries , 10 Polytechnics and Pre-University Educational institutions in 10 regions of Ghana . <p> $1.6 bn can end Ghana 's perennial electricity poverty . It can double the economic value of one of Ghana 's 10 regions . It can free Ghana of all donor support in the delivery of good drinking water . Donors have been taking up 80% of our water bills for some time now . <p> What makes a bad situation worse than the 70% debt to GDP ratio is the dogged insistence and dependence on bonds as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears that there is still no restraint in this regard . If anything , the adamant refusal to cut off a lot of waste in national spending and the raw devil-may-care attitude will not bode well in the very near future . <p> In the midst of all of this , the wage bill still takes a huge chunk of budgetary expenditure . In fact , rumours of a new Eurobond around just to help finance public sector wages indicate an increasing lack of creativity to tackle this burden . <p> The diversification of some of the national payroll sector activity and the devolution of activity like healthcare and education to the regional and district level , coupled with some local level management will actually do much to benefit the government if it rather invested into creating a sustainable system and the right structures for the implementation of such a model . <p> Any significant shifts in the international market prices of any of Ghana 's major exports will doom the nation to near insolvency . A whole litany of mishaps and ill-advised government expenditure means that intended benefits from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reasons for going in for these instruments in the first place . <p> If nothing at all , the yield and interest that new offers on the market offer should be a pointer to the unjustified risks . Ghana 's last bond sold at 10.74% , which at that rate for a sovereign bond is higher than domestic interest rates of about 112 countries in the world . <p> A radical shift in the philosophy of government expenditure will be the only savior to our fiscal malfeasances . The Ghanaian government can only make progress if it decides to slash spending on many unproductive areas and reduces the size of its government . <p> There can not be any way the centralized administrative process will work with its multiplicity of loopholes which are even more difficult to find because of the size of government operations . The government should have the will to clamp down on spending malpractices by its agencies and enforce the recommendations of the Auditor-General by empowering it to take the necessary legal action to remedy the recorded violations , else there would only be more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What perhaps has been forgotten is the threat of Ivory Coast as a destination not only of foreign direct investment , but also of industrial poaching . Just as in the 80s the government was suffering from cocoa smugglers , in the past two years , but in a more legitimate fashion , La Cote d'Ivoire is actively wooing industries and investors to set up shop in its shores . <p> Just 500 kilometers from Ghana , and an hour 's flight away is an economy with far more competitive perks , where cost of doing business is a fraction of the same cost here in Ghana . <p> In the medium run , the best metric of Ghana 's apparent lack of commitment in incentivizing businesses to thrive will be the quick rise of La Cote D'Ivoire at Ghana 's expense . <p> Summary Decision Points : <p> Stable Cedi <p> Stable Inflation <p> Government Bureaucracy <p> Business Friendly Regulations <p> Attractive business climate <p> Resilience <p> Revenue and Taxation <p> Debt , Debt and more debt <p> Government overspending <p> Unemployment <p> Cutting down wasteful spending <p> Prudent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide gap between rich and poor <p> Industrialization <p> The Mahama-led NDC government has sought to salve some of the smarting wounds of very poor growth in manufacturing by energizing one of its main campaign promises -- to restart the Komenda Sugar Factory . It has therefore commissioned the factory such that for all intents and purposes , it is fully functional . Perhaps , the mode of deployment of the factory is symbolic of the nature of almost all the 4th republican governments of Ghana so far . <p> Most of the drive towards industrialization in Ghana has been ill-timed , without the creation of economies of scale and an ecosystem to support industries . Very recently , the debate was even further sparked when the opposition party NPP leader also publicly declared to facilitate the creation of a factory in every district , 216 of them in all districts in Ghana . <p> This however is n't an alien phenomenon as governments in the fourth republic recognize this through one intervention or the other . The rural enterprises programme which was launched in Mankessim in the Central Region @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise support system is a typical example . <p> Under this programme , IFAD , AfDB and GoG were to provide US$185 million for supporting 600,000 rural poor Medium Sized Enterprises ( MSEs ) in 161 districts and municipalities across the country between 2012 and 2020 . <p> The model was to ensure the establishment of 36000 new businesses and strengthen 70000 existing businesses to scale up to profitability periods in their life cycles . <p> It should be mentioned that this followed from an M&amp;E report from IFAD confirming the relevance , efficiency and effectiveness of the previous phases of the Rural Enterprises Project which ended in 2010/11 . <p> Given that this project has travelled half of its life , it should be safe to conclude that its contribution to the total productivity basket measure against the objectives of the programme should have been enormous by now . <p> Again , the small scale industrialization initiative ( SSDII ) of the Ministry of Trade - a 5-year rural based industrialization programme which is to benefit all 216 administrative districts of Ghana is one worth mentioning . <p> Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implementing collaborators are to apply the Public Private Partnership ( PPP ) framework and the Corporate Village Enterprise ( COVE ) model in establishing commercially viable companies in all the Metropolitan , Municipal and District Assemblies ( MMDAs ) . <p> MOTI proposed in 2014 that the 216 MMDAs will be covered in the following structure : 30 in Phase 1 ( 2014 ) , 48 in Phase 2 ( 2015 ) , and 46 each in Phases 3 ( 2016 ) , 4 ( 2017 ) and 5 ( 2018 ) respectively . <p> The funding for the setting up of the SSDII-PPP Companies will come from equities by the respective MMDAS and private investors at the districts . <p> With the following key milestones envisaged under the SSDII , over 258,000 Ghanaians , especially those in the districts/rural areas will benefit from both direct and indirect employment , over GHc471 million ( US$174 million ) worth of exportable and locally marketed value added goods or products will be produced and sold , a total of GHc278 million or US$ 103 million , will be required from Government ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 59.21% ) under shareholding/equity contribution arrangement for the 5-Years SSDII Implementation Plan and that of the REP and the other policy frameworks such as the Private Sector Development Strategy ( PSDS II 2010-2015 ) , the incoherence of government policy towards solving the industrialization problem immediately surfaces . <p> These initiatives have been running concurrently since 1995 to date and have delivered little than desired results as the country has virtually nothing to show on " rural industrial development " if the numbers on industry output , value chains in Agriculture , job creation at the local level , rural urban drift and corresponding penalty , value received from non-traditional exports among many other indicators are anything to go by . <p> The question is do n't we have too many districts ? Average GDP of 160 million dollars and average population of 120,000 people per district does not allow for effective economic decentralisation . The districts are too small and weak to serve as viable units of industrialisation . The marketing , legal , design and engineering skills needed to succeed require larger aggregates of economic activity than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart thing is either to focus on the regional level or to create new local units of about $1 billion of economic activity . We certainly do need radical and fresh thinking about how to spur higher value creating activity in Ghana . Capacity is still too low in the economy . <p> Crucially , until the question of reliable and cheaply available electricity is comprehensively answered , the issue of industrial growth is very much unattainable ideal . <p> It is still quite clear that there is a huge variance between what industrialization actually is , and what the policy designers in the various parties perceive it to be . This is problematic in the perspective of the voters as it has tended to confuse them a great deal in appraising and appreciating choices to be made in this regard . <p> It is also clear that political parties benefit from this confusion to cite numerous moribund factories as purely achievements in an industrialization drive . <p> A great chance to revive Ghanaian industry is going to be lost because of misdirection of priorities . <p> Summary decision points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Important incentives <p> Cheap energy <p> Focus on facilitation <p> Innovative Decentralization based on Data and Metrics <p> Energy <p> A discussion on Ghana 's immediate future will never be complete without addressing perhaps the most influential sector of the economy that has been responsible for the nation 's industrial and productive fortunes over the last decade or so . Energy provision , or more specifically adequate energy production in relation to demand has become a recurrent influencer in Ghana 's drive towards sustained economic growth . <p> Key trend indicators for example show a cyclic flow of electricity usually with shortages around the months of May and June since 2008/2009 . Between 2012 and 2016 , the President of Ghana has made not less than 25 public statements promising to end Ghana 's electrical energy woes . The truth is that , while the energy generation capacity has increased , it has not increased commensurate to demand . <p> What aggravates the current situation is the fact that the anticipated $1 Billion Chinese loan ( out of $3bn ) to aid infrastructure in the energy sector materialized rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant by over 18 months . Even with the plant coming on stream , Ghana has had to depend on erratic supply of LNG from Nigeria . <p> The bid to stave off the acute electricity shortage , even more opaque dealings involving the state through the Ministry of Energy and other technical solutions providers have been brokered , involving the procurement of power barges . <p> Apart from the fact that the power barges arrived later than anticipated , the government negotiated a deal far from beneficial either by other options available or by benchmarked parameters . Estimated annual payoffs will be in the region of US $120 Million , whereas the government owes existing suppliers in excess of US$1.5 Billion . This is even on a measure deemed as " temporary " . <p> Independent power providers and the privatization of the ECG , the retailer of Ghana 's electricity sector , will be very crucial if there is going to be any sustainable flow of power eventually . <p> While domestic and residential power usage has risen to 50% today from 36% in 2000 , it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decline in industrial consumption due to the prohibitively high cost of electricity and other fuel sources , compared to other countries like Nigeria and La Cote d'Ivoire . <p> If solutions that are sustainable and more cost-effective are not deployed soon , it could cost the nation a decline in industrial activity and hence a loss of jobs . <p> The question of energy and fuel policy are also worthy of note . With the elimination of subsidies , it will be interesting to note the purpose of various taxes and levies on pump prices of fuel , considering that crude has not risen significantly in the last 8 months , whereas the ex-pump prices in the same time period have increased by some 15% . <p> While these could be attributed to foreign exchange fluctuations , it is also pertinent to examine what the government wishes to do with the fuel related levies that make for over 50% of the ex-pump prices . <p> Demand for energy for transportation and other activity is going to rise , especially if there is any revival in the fortunes of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand has reduced , thus freeing up their consumption , but overall , with new technology and dependence on electricity , demand for diesel and petrol will not only be exclusively for transportation , so it remains to be seen how these gaps will be filled by the provision of more affordable electricity . <p> It is hoped that a more open and less restrictive regime on solar technology be aggressively pursued . This means exemptions of duties and taxes on solar batteries and panels and ALL accessories , as against the policy that exists at the moment that are far from coherent . <p> It is expected that the existing restrictions that insist on solar providers having to register before practicing their trade does not bode well for ease of entry into business , which means that favored companies could easily corrupt what is a crucial space . <p> An open approach will ensure that cheaper and newer technologies in alternative energy would be explored and the marketability and suitability of these will become the right competitive advantages to build up such a nascent but crucial sector that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Perhaps , a local model that has been able to discharge this via beneficial private-public approach is the Community Water and Sanitation model which involves both private and public stakeholders in the provision of rural water . Such a model could easily be adapted to run alternative and renewable energy solutions . <p> Countries like Germany , Norway and quite a few states in the United States have been able to promote solar and other alternative sources of energy to the extent that they have surpluses . <p> These require huge capital expenditure but do not require the same amount of expenditure to maintain over their lifetimes , as well as the fact that they are sustainable , clean and green . <p> Without opening up the private sector and municipalities to engage in such , the nation might lose on such a cheaply available raw material for renewable energy . <p> Summary decision points : <p> Thermal Power <p> Temporary vs Permanent Solutions <p> Alternative Energy Sources <p> Renewable Energy Development <p> Private-Public Partnership <p> Agriculture : <p> Sadly , in the last few years , this sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus of government related activity . Just over 50% of the nation 's labour force relies directly on agriculture for livelihood , yet over the past 3 years , however , it is alarming to note that the annual contribution of agriculture to GDP has reduced by over 12% since 2009 . This means that farmers are earning less from the practice of agriculture . <p> Cocoa trees are already growing very old , and more are below peak production levels , yet new cocoa seedlings are not meeting the right level of demand to replace older trees . <p> Very little has been done to energize and assist small-scale farmers and boost food sufficiency in Ghana . Over GHS25 million was wasted in the form of agricultural assistance to farmers via the Savannah Accelerated Development Authority ( SADA ) , and while the loss has been written off due to drought , it is interesting that California , a state in the United States , with its worst drought in 1,200 years , still is able to produce ALMOST at the same levels . <p> At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty reduction strategies . These will never be productive as the focus on agriculture should be more on a drive to increased production and mechanization , and not just mere poverty reduction . <p> Between January and September 2015 for example , 90% of the actual expenditure in agriculture was for poverty based programmes . <p> A rather more businesslike approach to agro-based policy is very important to keep agriculture afloat and not gain marginal increases in growth annually , considering its very important position in the national narrative . <p> This will require programmes that are centered on motivation for increased mechanization , more scientific methods and a growth and export driven philosophy . It is surprising for instance that out of 180,000 metric tonnes of fertilizer required for the subsidy program in 2015 , only 90,000 was distributed . This shows a poor attitude towards yield improvement measures that would rather be more cost-effective and business focused . <p> A better way will be cross-sector facilitation between the ministry of Trade and Industry and the Ministry of Agriculture to see agriculture more as a fuel for local small-scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players could then be incentivized for investments in the sector in areas with good growth prospects . This can fuel the micro-level industrialization as well as energize that part of the raw material feed as part of that ecosystem for food sufficiency , export activity and agro-based industrial growth . <p> Summary decision points : <p> Mechanization <p> Production-based Financing v Poverty Alleviation Financing <p> Smart Agriculture Better variety seeds <p> Focus on Feeder Farms for Industrial Raw Materials <p> Social policy <p> Income levels of most economically active Ghanaians are low . A major characteristic of past Ghanaian governments has been one of promising , and in some cases , delivering myriad social interventions aimed at poverty alleviation , among other pressing issues that ail the common Ghanaian . <p> Of the major promises that Ghanaians have listened to over the years , issues related to stipends for the poor , like the LEAP , school-feeding project , stability and sustainability of health insurance and other related mother and child issues still remain paramount . <p> Most Ghanaians have gained directly or indirectly from most of these schemes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in the areas of education and health , which constitute expenditures that most disposable incomes at the family level are spent on . <p> In light of huge budget expenditure on education , and the subsequent hemorrhaging of the national kitty just to keep social interventions alive , it will be very interesting to see how support of activities like school feeding and other higher stake interventions are handled . <p> A clear example of such failures and the flagrant wastage of funds are the GYEEDA , SADA and more recently the scandals at National Service Secretariat and the implementation of several National Youth programs like Youth Enterprise Agency and others . <p> There has been no metric to clearly identify their significance and value for investment . Social programs have to have measurable outcomes and have to be treated like all other investments , with valuations on resource inputs to clearly determine whether the outcomes provide value for money . <p> Summary decision points : <p> Value for money <p> Clear metrics of benefits <p> Sustainability <p> Social mobility <p> Termination/end-point of support <p> Gender and inequalities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gender is that of the near parity of enrollment of girl children in primary schools , which is in tandem with SDG benchmarks and targets . <p> However , there is still a lot of inequality around wages in the informal sector , which engages 80% of Ghana 's labour force . From 1991/92 to 2013 , the share of women in wage employment in non-agricultural sectors was still no more than 30.5% , which is just an improvement of 0.7% from 1991/92 . <p> This is a very disappointing development which shows that despite a lot of awareness on rights of women , economically , they might not be any better off than they were in aggregate terms in the early 90s . Perhaps this trend also reflects in disappointing metrics when maternal mortality issues are investigated . <p> While Sustainable Development Goals established that by 2015 maternal mortality should be in the range of 54 deaths per 100,000 live births , the figure is still 3 times that of a 2015 rate of 164 deaths per 100,000 live births . <p> When women are poorer , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues even with the intervention of programmes like the National Health insurance scheme , as the healthcare factors are a composite of different economic and social factors . <p> Increased income levels however empower women to solve some of these problems related to anaemia , nutrition , basic ante-natal care and adherence to medication and diet instructions as well as easy access to healthcare facilities . <p> It is indeed disheartening to note for example that women 's healthcare issues are still not a national focus ; over 40% of Ghanaian women are anaemic . <p> Juxtaposed with child mortality rates for under 1 and under 5 children , it is evident that there is a very strong correlation between women 's well-being and major social issues related to their nutrition , welfare and vulnerable infants . <p> Income inequalities are on the micro scale biting very hard on Ghanaians because of the deformalized nature of the economy , and the fact that over 80% of the economy is not a formal one . <p> While poverty reduction goals have been met , poor wage and work conditions mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the job market . This can only perpetuate the status quo and make it very difficult for the poverty barrier to be crossed easily , as self-improvement and skills training will have to give way for basic survival . <p> District and rural authorities should be able to develop the capacity of the informal sector to improve earning capacity of their constituents through engagement of transparent stakeholders for skills development , money management and the creation of cottage industries to help with self-sufficiency and market access for products with added value . <p> Summary points <p> Child mortality <p> Maternal mortality <p> Skills development programs <p> Stakeholder engagement <p> Nutrition and health <p> Support for informal business models <p> Protection of informal businesses <p> Micro-level poverty reduction activities <p> Infrastructural development <p> Infrastructural Development has been a major election expectation since the birth of the nation . As one of the most obvious legacies of a government or regime , they have been at the core of most manifestoes . <p> The current ruling government in its Green Book lists multiple infrastructural developments from roads , bridges , sports facilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infrastructure stock of this country . <p> Most governments in Ghana are hailed the most for their addition to the stock on infrastructure , and it is high on every voter 's list . Particularly , estimates by the Finance Minister in November 2015 posited that Ghana needs to spend at least US$1.5 Billion annually in order to address some of the infrastructure deficit . This is plenty to go in in terms of expectations . <p> Critical in this sector will be the creation and expansion of routes that link agriculturally productive areas of the hinterlands to urban and peri-urban markets , which would then open up such areas for more aggressive agro-based activity . <p> Processing and low level manufacturing could also be assisted in the hinterlands by better road networks , which open up such areas for more commercial activity . <p> Many voted officials , especially at the parliamentary level bear the brunt of the dissatisfaction of voters by losing their seats at election time . <p> Disappointingly neglible railway lines have been added to the existing line since independence . The expansion of the bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly that an intra-metropolitan railway system will easily assist in the movement of people and goods in and around the cities in a more predictable manner , while easing road congestion . What remains to be seen is the commitment to the expansion of railways . <p> In the wake of recent scandals where monies for the advancement of railways rather got diverted into the branding of buses , it would have been very important for policymakers to have fully showcased how much equivalent investments into railways would have benefitted the nation . <p> However , the focus shown on railways has been very negligible by most of the parties , hence not presenting itself as a factor " sexy " enough to command the attention of voters . A sure winner in the discussions around infrastructure will be a very solid and actionable railway development plan that will have good coaches and supplement air transport across the country . <p> Overall , electrification has expanded rapidly , and the expansion of water especially in Accra and Kumasi serves as a basis for voters in these areas to expect more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been very commendable , and voters will not expect anything less from all the major candidates . <p> What needs to be taken into consideration therefore is what plans are being outlined for a sustained growth in the water sector , while maintaining the gains already made . This will mean also doubling down on wastage that comes from poor maintenance activity and illegal connections , which rid the water provision companies of significant amounts of revenue . <p> Overall , there should be a more decentralized approach to infrastructure development . The investments and the activities involved have very far reaching implications for the localities involved that requires that these investments are suited more towards providing better ecosystems for productivity to support local economic activities . <p> Summary decision points <p> Sustained investment in infrastructure <p> Energy infrastructure <p> Quality of work against contract valuation <p> Advancement of the rail sector <p> Education <p> The core theme of education in 2012 lost NPP its most significant traction . Its bold introduction of the free senior high school for all junior high students ( Free SHS ) Program got a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the strategy with relation to the resources available from a feasibility and implementation perspective . <p> The Mahama government on the other hand promised 200 day schools . While this promise has not been fulfilled in its entirety , a few of them have been commissioned to date . By the time of the elections , only about 40 or 50 of those 200 schools will have been commissioned , which by the standards set by the government is a 25% pass rate . <p> The promise to build two other universities , the University of Health and Allied Studies , as well as the University of Natural Resources , have been delivered . The government has also decided to convert 10 polytechnics into technical universities with the view to increasing focus on advanced technical education . <p> Unfortunately , these intentions , however desirable on paper , are not going to have impact even in the short or medium term because of a great lack of capacity to run these schools . <p> There is very little strategic focus on developing a vibrant curriculum . Teachers themselves are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst performers in school and choosing teaching as the last option . <p> IMANI had previously suggested systems where communities had more control over the recruitment , monitoring and evaluation of teachers , as well as school management at the local level . <p> These would ensure better accountability and results as reporting systems will be scrutinized better and school results would reflect the aspirations of the localities , as such training them in either skills for life after school that is suited to the community , or for better higher education . <p> Until there is some urgency in the quality of actual content of education delivered to children and students , Ghana 's abysmal ratings at the juvenile level in areas like math and science , where they were the bottom in 76 countries across the world by OECD in 2015 is quite telling of the dire situation . <p> Most of the graduates of that 2015 generation will be unleashed on a tottering nation with very little in terms of employable skills , quantitative and qualitative aptitudes and skill sets . <p> This will not only present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to businesses who will have to spend considerable amounts of resources to retrain them to make them even manageable . <p> This is also a time when vocational and technical education is far easier and has a higher potential to create more small business opportunities due to increased access to technology and cheaper and better ways to scale from technical vocations . <p> Funding for studies in these areas will mean the best pool of capable young people who can earn incomes right out of school , and a market for the rapidly burgeoning service industry in Ghana , which would also depend on a lot of this skilled workforce . <p> A large pool of poor quality labour also then creates a disincentive for any aggressive industrial development as a minimum level of skill will be required to run today 's and in effect the future 's more sophisticated industrial applications and factory lines . This is an area where the more competitive countries of Nigeria , Kenya , Senegal , Ivory Coast and Rwanda will outshine Ghana . <p> The last four years has been one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil production and a vibrant global economic scene was not taken advantage of . <p> Ghanaians have woken up to a nightmarish cocktail of underachievement and wastefulness .

The first-half saw huge scrutiny placed on almost every member of the Rossoneri squad at times , with the same old queries worryingly reappearing after Bologna ousted Milan at the Stadio Giuseppe Meazza , prior to two vital victories against Carpi in the Coppa Italia and last Sunday 's impressive 2-0 win over the Viola . <p> But what has changed then ? Quite frankly , nothing . Sinisa Mihajlovic 's side are still inconsistently consistent : a win here , a loss there , with no real continuation of form .

Firstly , let us look at the line-up on Sunday : <p> It was a straightforward but efficient 4-4-2 setup from Mihajlovic . There was nothing special in the line-up , and as a matter of fact , there were only five changes from the opening day loss at the Stadio Artemio Franchi . All of those five changes as well : ( Donnarumma/Lopez , Abate/De Sciglio , Alex/Ely , Montolivo/de Jong and Niang/Adriano ) were all Milan players at the time with M'Baye Niang the only one of those listed to have not sat on the bench that day due to an injury . <p> It is not as if Mihajlovic has brought about a notable change of personnel , but more so with his tactics .

Luiz Adriano 's exit is not unexpected as he jets off to China 's Jiangsu Suning , leaving the 21-year-old French striker alongside main man Bacca , with Mario Balotelli waiting in the wings . <p> What the coach has done is brought about some stability to a club that disregarded two of their finest recent players so soon after being appointed . They played as , funnily enough , a team on Sunday , displaying the necessary unity . <p> Even so , some supporters of other Serie A clubs have voiced their laughter toward a few Milan fans for overreacting to the win over Fiorentina , but was it really an overdone celebration by the Milanisti ? They are not the club they once were , and they should fully well know fighting for the Scudetto is but a dream in their current state . <p> Take Giacomo Bonaventura for instance , arguably the Rossoneri 's best player this season , ahead of Bacca . He has been lauded , myself included , for his performances but is he Milan standard ? Of course he is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not a Scudetto winner . <p> Look to the midfield that lifted the Champions League back in 2007 : Clarence Seedorf , Kaka , Andrea Pirlo and Gennaro Gattuso . Would Mr Bonaventura make it into that team at his current best ? No . Not by any stretch of the imagination . Some Milanisti have rightly accepted their club 's current fortunes , and should celebrate the victory over Fiorentina as some sort of advancement in their endeavours . <p> Most teams believe they should be fighting for the Scudetto , but it does not mean they deserve to be . This season , only four teams : Napoli , Juventus , Inter and Fiorentina deserve to be fighting for it , and arguably only the former two deserve to win the Championship . <p> This season , as hard as some of those Milan supporters will admit , is where there team should be in their predicament . If Silvio Berlusconi can not see that as well , and the Rossoneri go on to replicate the average at best results in Autumn , Mihajlovic will be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would happen . He may not be Massimo Cellino , but he would happily sack another coach if he did not get what he craved : Champions League football and a Scudetto fight . <p> Give him time , as we have constantly outlaid . If Milan lose to both Empoli and Inter in the Derby della Madonnina then the whole debacle starts again . Take a breather , enjoy the victory and relax in amongst the mercato ( albeit a very slow and uneventful one ) . <p> Milan have bigger problems to worry about anyway .

Clich ? d , sure , but Ashanti Gold know that too well , and will accept that there could n't be any better adage that aptly reflects their title defence in the 2015-16 Ghana Premier League . <p> Last September , the Obuasi-based side dethroned Asante Kotoko in their finest season in 19 years . Their last league triumph came in 1996 , but under Bashir Hayford , the Miners won 15 , drew seven and lost eight of 30 games to lift the coveted diadem . Effectively , the achievement confirmed their status as Ghana 's sole representatives for the 2016 Caf Champions League . <p> But how will they fare this time around ? <p> Can the Miners retain their title this season ? <p> To be fair , a second successive title might be a little too much to ask of the Miners , considering their toil in nicking last year 's crown .

The good thing is , he 's still there , and the outspoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his many critics one more time . There would also be Kudjoe Fianoo , who was rumoured to be heading for the exit after last season .

Then there would be the perennial dark horses of Berekum Chelsea , Aduana Stars , Liberty Professionals and Inter Allies who will all be hoping to dethrone the reigning champs . <p> And talking of pre-season , the Miners looked out of sorts in the 2016 Ghalca G6 Tournament , failing to move beyond the group stage . A scoreless stalemate with Chelsea , and a 1-1 draw with eventual winners Kotoko halted their quest . <p> The rigours and financial strain of combining continental and local competitions come with their own prices to pay too . <p> But no one , perhaps , gave them a chance to lift the league title last season .

Must Be Annulled <p> Just as most of us were beginning to put the Montie Three 's act of judicial criminality behind us , it has emerged that the man who was recently confirmed as the Deputy Minister for Local Government , Mr. Bless Oti , who also doubles as the National Democratic Congress ' Member of Parliament for Nkwanta-North , in the Volta Region , had actually said worse things on the same radio program that saw Messrs . Alistair Nelson , Godwin Gunn and Salifu Maase sentenced to 4 months ' imprisonment by the Supreme Court ( See " Attack on CJ Worse than Rwandan Genocide Propaganda -- Franklin Cudjoe " Citifmonline.com / Ghanaweb.com 7/30/16 ) . <p> Kwame Okoampa-Ahoofe , Jr. , Ph.D.I , however , beg to differ with Mr. Franklin Cudjoe , the Execuitive Director of the Accra-based IMANI-Ghana think-tank , that the invectives deployed by the Nkwanta-North NDC-MP against Chief Justice Georgina Theodora Wood were worse than those used by Rwanda 's Hutu radio and television broadcasters against that country 's powerful Tutsi ethnic minority and their Hutu sympathizers . Needless to say , the 1994-5 Rwanda genocide has no comparison , whatsoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent . Twenty years on , the Rwanda genocide remains at once the most barbaric and tragic of its kind in Africa . It is also the most humiliating and embarrassing to the dignity of the proverbial African personality . <p> What needs pointing out , now that the name of Chief Justice Wood has appeared in this national discourse on the institution of the Ghanaian judiciary and its membership , particularly those on the level of the Supreme Court , is the fact that since the June 30 , 1982 brutal assassination of the three Akan-descended Accra High Court judges -- the Supreme Court had then been abolished by the Acheampong-led junta of the Supreme Military Council ( SMC-I ) -- the key operatives of the erstwhile Provisional National Defense Council ( PNDC ) and the latter 's institutional successor , the so-called National Democratic Congress ( NDC ) , both led by Chairman Jerry John Rawlings , have persistently and consistently made every effort to run down the image and reputation of the judicial system in general , but particularly the Supreme Court of Ghana . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rawlings Posse to become a veritable law onto itself .

If he genuinely subscribed to the sacred and civilized tenets of democratic principles and culture , President John Dramani Mahama would have promptly demanded the resignation of rabble-rousing agitators like Foreign Minister Hanna Tetteh and Culture and Tourism Minister Elizabeth Ofosu-Agyare . <p> Indeed , the very attempt to malign the hard-earned reputation of Chief Justice Wood did not begin today . To be certain , as early as the beginning of 2009 , the Atta-Mills-led government of the National Democratic Congress would launch a blistering campaign against the Kufuor-appointed Mrs. Wood purely on ideological grounds . The head of the Ghana judicial system would also be bluntly ignored in a parliamentary address on the state of the nation , in front of the panoply of the diplomatic corps . This writer vividly recalls writing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wood not to resign out of crass NDC intimidation , as the Republic of Ghana was not the property of any single political party or individual leader , for that matter . <p> It well appears that the relentless campaign to oust the Chief Justice had been aimed at enabling the NDC operatives ride roughshod over the democratic and human rights of the Ghanaian people . There is a strange ironic twist about the fact that the overwhelming majority of the Mahama cabinet appointees who have ganged up against Chief Justice Wood , by appending their signatures to the circulating petition seeking to have President Mahama overturn the Supreme Court verdict against the Montie Three are women .

@@13633233 Perspective of Creation <p> By Joseph Annor It is an understatement to describe the universe as a vast and complex place . It is estimated that the universe contains over 200 billion galaxies made up of at least 1 billion trillion stars . Incredibly , some of these stars are extremely oversized . For example , NML Cygni and UY Scuti are estimated to have diameters of at least 2.29 and 2.4 billion kilometers respectively compared to the diameters of only 12,742 km and 1.39 million km of the earth and the sun respectively . All these stars and galaxies are constantly spinning on their axis and some revolve around others , etc. and etc . <p> Despite these extreme complexities , many scientists postulate that God did n't create the universe but the universe emerged as a result of an explosion of a " dense mass of matter " in about 13.7 billion years ago . However , the scientists can not explain where the original " dense mass of matter " came from . Nevertheless , the Bible states plainly in Hebrews 11:3 that God formed the universe out of nothing ( see also Col. 1:16 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does God exist and did he create the universe ? " I discussed that God created the universe and time . <p> Accordingly , this article discusses the following three different views about when God created the universe : <p> ? the Young Creationism ( i.e. God created the entire universe about 6,000 years ago ) ; ? the Old Creationism ( i.e. God created the universe millions or even billions of years ago ) ; and ? the Hybrid view ( i.e. God created the human world about 6,000 years ago but the planet Earth and outer space , God created an earlier period not disclosed ) . 1 . The Young Creationism <p> Firstly , the Bible dose not specifically state when God created the universe . However , it is believed that in the mid-17th century , Archbishop James Ussher and Theologian John Lightfoot examined the genealogies and the creation stories in Genesis and concluded that God created the universe and life in six days in 4004 B.C. Therefore , their works laid the foundation for the most predominant creationist view among Christians . However , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predict the age of the universe because there are gaps in the genealogies as some names are omitted from the biblical narratives . Nevertheless , it appears that any names omitted from the genealogies are not significant enough to have caused substantial error to the works of Archbishop Ussher and Theologian Lightfoot . Therefore , the creation activities described in Genesis 1 and 2 most likely occurred circa 6,000 years ago . 1 . The Old Creationism <p> The proponents of this view use both scientific and biblical arguments to support their positions and these are discussed in turn . Scientific <p> a . Fossil data indicate that the earth is considerably older than 6,000 years old . For instance , a team of academics from the University of Western Australia and Oxford University identified an Australian microscopic fossil evidencing cells living in an oxygen-free world over 3.4 billion years ago . The weakness of this proposition is that no one can confirm the reliability of the assumptions used to estimate the age of the fossils . For example , it is assumed that fossil material measured has been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the normal ratios , and the rate of decomposition has always remained absolute constant ; but the reliability of these assumptions can not be guaranteed . However , there appears some evidence that the rate of radioactive decay can change . Moreover , it is postulated that the intensity of Noah 's flood had impact on fossil materials and consequently , their assumed ages . a . The existence of common fossil deposits and other geological formations between the South American and African tectonic plates indicate that the two continents were part of the same landmass in the past . However , satellite data show that tectonic drift is a very slow process and that the two continents are still moving ( further apart ) at a rate of roughly 2 cm per year . Based on this observation , it would have taken about 200 million years for the two continents to have drifted into their current positions after their separation . Again , using the current drifting speed to speculate the drifting speed in the past assumes that the drifting speed has always remained constant but no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the time of creation , God regrouped the water covered the earth into oceans ( seas ) to create land . It appears that the continents were formed during this period . Also , the impact of Noah 's worldwide flood might have caused the fossil material to be transported between continents . a . Light travels at an amazing speed of approximately 300,000 kilometres ( 186,000 miles ) per second and light from the sun about 93 kilometres away takes approximately 8.17 minutes to reach the earth . However , the light from the most remote areas ( galaxies ) of the universe can take several billions years to travel to the earth . In fact , these galaxies and their stars are so far away that their distances are measured in light years ( that is how long per year it will take a light travelling 300,000 kilometres per second to reach earth ) . And the light we see is an image of an object from the past because speed of light is finite . It is therefore argued that if light of some stars have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then they can not be seen if the universe was only created 6,000 years ago . However , some have suggested that light from these remote areas of the universe could still reach earth even if the universe was created 6,000 years ago . For example , John G. Hartnett has discussed the following : I. The language in Genesis may in some cases describe only appearance . Therefore , stars were made millions or billions of years before Day 4 , but by the command of God , the light from all stars no matter how far away , all arrived and seen first at the Earth on the 4th day of the creation . The problem with this view is whether it is consistent with Ex. 20:9 , 11 , which reads , " ... For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth , the sea , and all that in them , and rested the seventh day ... " I. God created the entire universe 6,000 years ago , but by his miraculous power caused light to reach the earth from anywhere of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cosmos in the past have run at much faster rates ( especially during creation week ) than clocks on Earth , and therefore light from such regions had plenty of time to get to Earth in a matter of days , not millions or billions of years . It is suggested however that observational evidence does not support this hypothesis . I. The clocks on Earth in the past have run at much slower rates than clocks in the cosmos , especially during creation week . Therefore light from the remote parts of the universe had plenty of time to get to Earth in a matter of days as recorded by Earth clocks , not millions or billions of years . The hypothesis is simpler than number III . It is noted that this view requires that the universe has a preferred frame of reference , and there is evidence that this is the case as Earth appears to be near the centre of the universe . Biblical information Some of the Christians who uphold the old creationist view postulate that the creation days referred to in Genesis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unspecified period of time and can be as long as millions or billions of years . The weakness of this view is that the wordings such as " day and night , " " evening and morning , " " light and darkness " can hardly be understood as indefinite periods of time , particularly , as God described any passing of an evening and a morning as one complete day . <p> It is suggested further that while the Hebrew word for day , " yom " can denote an indefinite period of time such as in the expression " For the day of the Lord is at hand " ( in Joel 1:15 ) , the word yom always means a twenty-four-hour literal day when it is used with a numeral -- day one , day two , first day , second day and etc . Furthermore , Genesis says God created the plants , sunlight and insects on the 3rd day , 4th day and 6th day respectively . Therefore , if the 3rd day was actually such a long period , the plants created on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunlight and insects on the 4th day and 6th day respectively , since plants require sunlight and pollination by insects to survive and/or reproduce . <p> 1 . The hybrid view <p> This third view is somehow a blend of the first two views . It postulates that the creation activities recorded in Genesis 1:3ff actually occurred in 6 literal days in about 6,000 years ago but do not include the planet earth and the outer space , which God created at an earlier period not specified in the Bible . This view is better understood by examining McGowan 's analysis of the literary structure of the creation account ( the Literary Structure ) . Literary Structure of Gen1:1 - 2:3 ( Culled from Peter McGowan ) <p> Prelude/prologue : Gen 1:1-2 : In the beginning , God created the heavens and the earth .

" <p> " It was good " <p> B : " Let us make man in our image ... " <p> " It was very good " <p> And there was evening and there was morning - the sixth day . <p> Postlude : Gen 2:1-3 <p> Conclusion : " Thus , the heavens and the earth were complete " - God finished <p> Purpose : God rests on , and sanctifies the seventh day in celebration of creation <p> Analysing the Literary Structure According to McGowan , the Literary Structure indicates that : <p> ? the creation consisted of two halves with the same pattern . The first half consisted mainly with the act of separating ( e.g. dry ground separated from the sea ) and the second half mainly involved the populating of the separated habitats with living creatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sea and land also produces vegetation ; ? the creation had three phases involving light , water , and dry ground , with each requiring two steps separated by three days . In the case of the land ( the third phase of day 3 and day 6 ) , two distinct creation acts are recorded each time ; ? the creation account contains several definition statements introduced by the phrase , " God called the ... " " day " , " night " , " sky " , " heaven " , " land " , " earth " , " seas " ( 1:10 ) , with all these definition statements occurring only in the first three days ; and ? the prelude ( introduction ) and postlude ( conclusion ) while integral parts of the creation account , do not appear to be part of the six days creation as explained below . In the beginning Firstly , there is no explicit statement in Gen1:1-2:3 about when God created our rocky planet ( Earth ) and the water that initially submerged the planet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the Bible does not state that . Thus , while Genesis 1:1 provides that " in the beginning " God created the heavens and earth " , there is no explicit statement that the period " the beginning " formed part of the first day . The only specific statement about the first day is that God created light and separated it from the darkness . Similarly , all the things that God created on each of the subsequent 5 days are clearly documented . Accordingly : <p> ? the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges states that there is no record of when God created the " darkness " , and the ' " waters " also existed before the formation of the seas . Therefore " Light " ( upon which all life and growth known on earth depends ) was the first created thing ( and not darkness ) . However , Isaiah 45:7 and Psalm 104:20 state that God created darkness but do n't provide the time that it occurred . ? McGowan argues that the first day of the creation week begins in Gen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " each day follows the strict formula , And God said , ' Let ... ' ... And there was evening and morning - the nth day . " ? the Pulpit ( Bible ) Commentary states that while the phrase " in the beginning " can mean " at the commencement of time " and Exodus 20:11 appears to imply that this was the initiation of the first day 's work , ' the formula , " And God said , " with which each day opens , rather points to ver . 3 as its proper terminus a quo , which the beginning absolute may have antedated by an indefinite period . " ? the Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary stipulates that the phrase " in the beginning " implies " a period of remote and unknown antiquity , hid in the depths of eternal ages ; and so the phrase is used in Proverbs 8:22 , 23 . " <p> Consequently , the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges stipulates that " The Hebrew notion that , before the Creation , the universe ( i.e. the earth ) was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to in Psalm 104:6 " ( " You covered it with the deep as with a garment : the waters stood above the mountains " ) . Accordingly , it is generally accepted on the basis of Psalm 104:6 that God moulded the earth into hills and valley submerged in deep water before separating the land from the water to form the earth and seas ( see commentaries by Barnes ' Notes on the Bible , Benson Commentary , Ellicott 's Commentary for English Readers and Pulpit Commentary ) . <p> It appears therefore that the phrase " in the beginning " refers to a period that occurred before the start of the first day . Thus , God created the formless earth submerged in water in deep darkness , the outer space , angels and some other things in an earlier period not specified in the Bible . Also , the use of a similar phrase ( the beginning ) in Proverbs 8:22-24 to indicate that the personified wisdom existed before the creation of the universe supports this view . <p> " Heaven " and " Earth " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words -- " heaven " and " earth " suggest that the creation account is not about God 's creation of the entire universe but our human world . The word heaven(s) comes from the Hebrew word shamayim and can mean any of the following three : <p> ? the sky or any place above the ground . This usage was clearly the case in 2 Samuel 18:9 , when Absalom was described as hanging between " heaven and earth " when his head was caught hanging in an oak tree ( see also Gen 1:20 ) . ? the second usage is found in Psalm 8:3-4 where David used the word " heavens " interchangeably with " the moon and the stars " to represent the starry heaven/outer space . ? lastly , in 2 Corinthians 12:2-4 , Paul described God 's residence ( the paradise ) as the " third heaven " . Accordingly , the context determines which of the three heavens is being discussed . It appears that in Genesis 1:1 , Moses used the term heaven to denote the starry heaven because the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the second day . Thus , the sky was not the heaven that God created in the beginning . It is also highly unlikely that Moses referred to the 3rd heaven because God would already be living there before " the beginning " and indeed , Job 38:4-7 states that even angels existed before the earth was created . Accordingly , the term " heaven " in Genesis 1:1 denotes the starry heaven or outer space . <p> In contrast , it appears from the immediate context that in Gen 1:6-8 , 9 , 14-15,17 and 20 , Moses used the term heaven to denote the sky because both terms ( the heaven and the sky ) are used interchangeably to refer to the expense/fault/space that God created on the 2nd day . Accordingly , McGowan claims that other than the introductory statement in Genesis 1:1 , the term heaven is defined as sky at its first appearance -- exactly as it is expected in Hebrew literature . <p> On the hand , the word " earth " comes from the Hebrew word " erets " . God defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in Gen 1:10 ( ' God called the dry ground " land " or " earth " and the gathered waters he called " seas " ) . It is imperative to note that in this definition statement the earth excludes the seas contrary to our understanding today ; a point that 2 Peter 3:5 reiterated later that " ... the earth i.e. the land was formed out of water and by water . " It appears therefore that the Bible only specifies the time that God separated the land from the water but not the time that he created the original formless earth . Thus , it appears that God created the formless earth in the beginning , a period that antedated the first day of creation . It also appears that the earth remained in the formless state for a considerable period of time . For instance , Gen 1:2 states that the Spirit of God hovered over the water submerging the land . This appears to mean that a considerable time lag occurred between when God formed the planet earth submerged in water and when God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement of the Spirit of God over the water linked the two periods together . Accordingly , the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges states that the act of the Spirit of God hovering over the water ( with the Bible margin rendered as brooding upon ) portrays a picture of a bird spreading its wings over its nest and implies a continuous action ( i.e. a long period in action ) . <p> The Great Lights ( the Sun and the Moon ) The creation account states that on the 4th day , God created the great lights and placed them in the expanse of the " heaven " ( i.e. in the sky ) . It is imperative to emphasise that the passage does not mean that God created the sun and moon ( as objects ) on this day but their lights . However , as discussed earlier on , Gen 1:1 appears to indicate that God created the starry heaven including the sun and moon in the beginning ( i.e. before the first day ) ; accordingly , it appears that what God created on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the stars to provide light and/or regulate the seasons . This view makes sense for the following reasons . Firstly , to argue that God created the sun and moon as objects on the 4th day will also mean that God created all the stars on day 4 . Also , unlike places such Deuteronomy 17:3 , Moses did not even mention the sun and the moon by their names , presumably , to let the focus be on the light or the function they perform rather than the object themselves . In addition , while the sun and moon are definitely not the largest objects in the outer space , their visual appearance are more prominent than any other objects in the space and can be seen visibly with the naked eye . Thus , it appears God strategically put them where they are when he established their rotational patterns ( see Gen 1:17 ) , and their distances from earth are perfect for life to exist . It appears therefore that God formed the starry heaven including the sun and moon as well as the Earth at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but on the 4th day God enabled the sun and the moon to provide lights and/or energy to the earth . <p> The relevance of the 24 hours rotational cycle and regulation of seasons <p> Furthermore , the activities or things described in the six days creation appear to be relevant to the human world and not any other part of the universe . For instance , within the solar system , the earth is the only planet that has twenty four hour rotational cycle . Therefore , the light that God created and separated form darkness to provide a 24 hour day appears relevant to only earth , as other planets take different times to rotate on their axis . For instance , Jupiter , Mercury and Venus take 10 hours , 58 days and 243 days respectively to rotate on their axis . It is clear therefore that when God created the 24 solar hour day by separating the light from darkness it only related to the earth and no other planet because the length of their days are completely different from ours . In any case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and within our own Milky Way galaxy , there are several other stars like sun that other planet like objects revolve around . Moreover , the moon ( lesser light ) that God created is only relevant to and rotates only around the earth as some other plants have their own moons . <p> Similarly , the regulation of the seasons , days and years by the sun and the moon appears relevant to the earth because the seasons and years of the other planets are completely different from that of the earth . For instance , Mercury , Mars , Neptune and Pluto takes 0.24 , 1.88 , 164.8 and 248 equivalent of earth years respectively to revolve around the sun ( i.e. to achieve their own one year ) . It appears therefore that when God set the sun , the moon and stars to regulate the seasons and years on earth , it was very much relevant to our earth despite that the sun may be providing similar activities to the other planets in our solar system . It seems therefore that God 's creative activities in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Furthermore , according to Job 38:4-7 , angels were present when God created the planet earth . This indicates that God had created life somewhere before the earth was created and that the creation account does not pertain to God 's creation of the whole universe . <p> It appears from above discussion that Genesis creation account simply records the creation of the human world and not the entire universe , and it is from other scriptures such as Revelation 4:11 , John 1:1-3 , Col 1:16 that we know that God created all other things . Thus while God created all the universe , it seems that the entire universe was not the subject of the Genesis creation account and that is why the account only mentions briefly the creation of the planet earth and outer space as an introduction in Gen 1:1 compared with the extensive details provided about the creation of the human world . Further , while the timing of the creation of the human world ( consisting of atmosphere and dry ground ) is clearly stated ( i.e. about 6000 years ago ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the planet earth -- consisting of land submerged in water . It could therefore have occurred anywhere from 6000+ years ago to many billions of years ago . <p> What about Exodus 20:11 and Exodus 31:17 <p> The only scriptures that appears to indicate that God created the entire universe in six days ( and not only our world ) are Exodus 20:11 and Exodus 31:17 . The scriptures state as follows : <p> ? Ex 20:11 , " For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth , the sea , and all that is in them , but he rested on the seventh day . Therefore the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy . " ? Ex 31:17 , " ... for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth , and on the seventh day he abstained from work and rested . " It is significant to mention that the Exodus 20:11 passage is particularly important because it was part of the Ten Commandments , the only scriptures the Lord himself wrote . And since He created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was created . Therefore , we may interpret the Lord 's statement at its face value that God created the whole universe in 6,000 years ago . Alternatively , the Lord might have only referred to our human world as discussed above ; accordingly , McGowan has proposed the following explanation . Firstly , the Exodus passages resemble the Genesis creation account in several ways as they all discuss : <p> ? that God created the heavens and the earth ; ? six days as the creation period ; ? that God rested on the 7th day , blessed and sanctified the 7th day ; and ? seas and the contents . Thus , according to McGowan , there is a very strong verbal and structural allusion of the Exodus passages to the Genesis creation account . <p> McGowan suggests further that it is a fundamental Biblical exegesis rule that the semantics of the primary passage must regulate the secondary passage and not the other way round . Thus , the meaning of the original passage in Genesis can be used to establish the meaning of the secondary passage in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genesis creation account discusses only the creation of the human world ( i.e. the atmosphere and land ) and not the entire universe , then the Exodus passages are also only concerned with that and not the creation of the entire universe . Against this background , Rev 21:1-2 , Isaiah 65:17 , 66:22 , 2 Peter 3:13 all state that God will create again a new heaven and earth . This suggests that God 's creative activities have not been entirely completed , and the Genesis account maybe discussing God 's creation of the human world . <p> Conclusion <p> Firstly , the Bible states unequivocally that God created the universe . Accordingly , Paul stated in Romans 1:20 that " For since the creation of the world God 's invisible qualities -- his eternal power and divine nature -- have been clearly seen , being understood from what has been made , so that people are without excuse . " Similarly , 2 Peter 3:5 states that " For they deliberately overlook this fact , that the heavens existed long ago , and the earth was formed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . Against this background , the focus of this article has been when God created the earth and the entire universe . Accordingly , I discussed the three creation views -- the Young Creationism , the Old Creationism and the hybrid view . While the hybrid view appears very interesting and convincing , its own drawback is the Exodus passages that appear to indicate that God created the entire universe during the six days creation period in about 6,000 years ago . However , as discussed above , McGowan has explained why the Exodus passages may not be referring to the creation of the entire universe but the human world . <p> Lastly , it appears that the hybrid view is consistent with the scientific view that earth and the universe is older than 6,000 years . <p> References : <p> John G.

@@13637232 <p> Non-governmental organization , ... Thinkers International ( CTI ) has described as unnecessary waste of money and disadvantage for the Electoral Commission ( EC ) and Parliament to include Biometric Verification to the Constitutional Instrument ( CI ) 72 . <p> According to the group , even though the purpose for the proposal , acceptance and inclusion of Biometric Verification in the last 2012 elections and beyond , it should be dropped entirely by the nation in all its future elections . <p> In a press release copied to Peacefmonline.com , Critical Thinkers International ( CTI ) has outlined a number of reason it believes the use of Biometric Verification in elections is waste of money . <p> A. On the issue of the Biometric Machines being unnecessary now , below are some of our reasons ; <p> i . After the Supreme Court Judges(SCJ) ruled against the use of the Biometric Machine as a tool to prevent people who could n't be verified by it from registering and/or voting when the issue surrounding it cropped up during the 2012 Election Petition , of which the Judges based their ruling on the Article 42 of the 1992 Constitution which says ; <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above and of sound mind has the right to vote and is entitled to be registered as a voter for the purposes of public elections and referenda " , it currently means nothing including a Biometric Machine has the power to prevent anyone from voting as long as he/she is registered as an eligible voter . <p> ii . With the Electoral Commission(EC) currently pushing or have pushed for the inclusion into the current Constitutional Instrument ( C.I. ) 91 a rule which will allow people who can not be verified with their fingerprints during elections to be allowed to vote through a verification with their picturesFace Only(FO) , it has as a result rendered the use of Biometric Machines as a means of verification useless , and as a result defeated the actual purpose for which the machines have been intended for . <p> B. On the issue of the disadvantages CTI believe the Biometric Machines have brought to Ghana , below are some of them ; <p> i . A lot of money was wasted by the country for the acquisition of the Biometric Machines for the elections @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not serve its purpose during the 2012 elections . <p> ii . Due to the allowance of some people to vote without Biometric verification at certain areas and others not allowed to vote at other areas for same reason , it is believed by CTI that it in a way affected the 2012 election results and as a result served as a disadvantage to some of the political parties . <p> iii . The biometric machines prolonged the voting period from one day to two days and a result brought a huge economic loss to the country and a majority of its citizens . <p> iv . It robbed some people of their right to vote . <p> The above therefore shows that the Biometric Machines have become both unnecessary and a disadvantage , and so in order to help prevent its future similar bad consequences and more to the nation , it should be dropped during all future elections . <p> Aside that , CTI will like to advise the EC and Parliament to in the future do a better analysis of proposals they are presented with before pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid similar losses to the nation . <p> Disclaimer : Opinions expressed here are those of the writers and do not reflect those of Peacefmonline.com .

She died from stroke . Last month , it was a business partner . Same heart attack ! Most surprising , to me , is the increasing number of friends , some as young as myself , diagnosed with diabetes and high blood pressure . <p> Back in the day , our grandparents lived quite longer . They usually died ' natural ' deaths ... not a sudden pain in the chest or some stroke . Diet-related diseases were very rare then . Heart-related diseases were almost unknown . I must admit the trend of lifestyle has changed over the years but one thing that has changed most is our lack of knowledge in the potency of some naturally occurring medicines . <p> Today , we resort to chemical drugs at the least opportunity . Most people have become self-ordained pharmacists who run to the pharmacy to order whatever they want without any test or professional evaluation . We have thrown herbal medicine into the bin as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cardiovascular diseases ( CVDs ) are one of the top causes of death in Africa and , of course , the number one cause of death globally . CVDs include diseases such as coronary cerebrovascular disease , deep vein thrombosis , stroke and all the heart diseases . In a 2009 research by CDC ( Centre for Disease Control and Prevention ) in collaboration with Ghana Health Service and Ghana AIDS Commission , it was revealed that stroke was the fourth of the top causes of death in Ghana while ischemic heart diseases followed closely at six . In other words , it is likely for more people to die from CVDs than any other disease . <p> It is in this light that many have resorted to chemically-made drugs to treat such complications . The low and/or middle income-earning Ghanaian is often the victim because he/she ca n't afford regular checkups and intensive primary healthcare to detect or avoid such cardiovascular diseases . The diets of such earners often expose them to heart diseases . <p> Most of these drugs of CVDs are chemically made . However , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases . There 's a magic leaf nature has given mankind . This leaf is called olive leaf ! I stumbled upon olive leaves and I am surprised of its potency and efficacy on supporting good health . I asked myself , " how come the benefits of olive oil are commonly known while the much more powerful leaves are hardly mentioned in most popular searches as a remedy for most conditions ? " <p> Most educated/professionals would frown at the mention of natural/herbal medicine . I can understand the concern of many when it comes to herbal/natural remedies ; production , environment , scientific research and all . <p> Now , let 's look at the history of the use of olive leaves . <p> The olive leaf has been in use medicinally as far back as the 1800s in ancient Egypt . It has a plethora of health benefits . It was made into tea as treatment for malaria , hypertension , cholesterol-related diseases and diabetes in ancient Egypt . It was also used as a medicine to resist viral and bacterial infections . It has antiseptic properties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood vessels so blood could flow more easily . Now the science : <p> Around the world , research papers showing the potential health benefits of olive leaf extract are being widely published in respected journals and publications . <p> Based on several published research papers on Olive Leaf Extract , here is a list of summarized benefits : <p> * Cardiovascular Support - May help to support cardiovascular health -- this is supported by research in published in in the European Journal of Nutrition ( 1 ) . <p> * Blood Sugar Support - May help maintain of normal blood glucose balance in healthy individuals -- published in the peer-reviewed journal PLosOne conducted by The Liggins Research at the University of Auckland . <p> * High Antioxidants Support -- Olive leaf has demonstrated high antioxidant and free radical scavenging properties published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine . <p> Olive Leaf Extract is also traditionally used in Western herbal medicine for the symptom relief of the common cold , sore throats , coughs , immune support and used as a high-strength antioxidant . <p> It was especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrhythmia and prevent intestinal muscle spasms . This ability , particularly , helps to make it an anti-CVD remedy . <p> Particularly as a naturally powerful antioxidant , olive leaf extract protects blood vessels from damage and has been shown to be effective in protecting the heart from coronary occlusion . An antioxidant , as the name implies , simply is against oxidation . It prevents oxidation , thus , from occurring in the cells . Oxidation occurs in the cells when we breathe in . If an apple , for instance , is sliced and left for a while , it begins to discolor . That 's oxidation ; exactly what happens in our cells . These oxidative processes are responsible for most human pathologies . <p> When olive is taken over an extended period of time consistently , it is observed to reverse arteriosclerosis . Arteriosclerosis is a disease of the arteries where cholesterol deposits a solid mass ( called plaque ) into the inner surface of the arteries , thus , obstructing blood flow . This leads to many other heart-related diseases . <p> Clinical studies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaf extracts . Patients have testified relief from hypertension , diabetes , shortness of breath , chest pains , heart palpitation , numbness and burning sensation in feet , hands and joints , constipation , heartburn , menstrual pain , menstrual disorders , frequent headache and more . With little or no side effects , olive leaf extract stands out among the rest because it is a naturally occurring powerful antioxidant compared to others which have been chemically synthesized . <p> If nature has given us natural olive leaves as a remedy to CVDs and a host of other diseases , why opt for something else ? If you want to give a magical boost to your health , olive leaves are your best option . <p> I wish my friend knew about olive leaves earlier . He would have been alive to read this . My quest for potent , effective natural remedies has just begun . Look out for more ...

" <p> The Acting NPP General Secretary added : " We are particularly being guided by the declaration by the Supreme Court that once election results are declared at the polling station , under any circumstances , there is practically nothing that can be done about it .

@@13885231 <p> Kwame is a ... teacher stationed in Kumasi . He earns a monthly net income of GHC 1542.11 . He is married to Joyce , a personal banker at Bank of Africa . They have a three year old son . Kwame has a closing balance of GHC 13,345.00 in his bank account . Besides , he also has an investment with a net value of GHC 2,780.00 with Databank Ghana Ltd . <p> Kwame 's father is a British citizen . His 60th birthday is just around the corner . He plans on celebrating it with his family both in the UK and elsewhere . Kwame has just taken delivery of a set of documents from his father inviting him to attend his birthday party in the UK . In the invitation letter , the father stated : " ... I will fully pay for the cost of my son 's travel to the UK including his food , accommodation and living expenses for the two weeks he will be in the UK " . <p> Does Kwame need to provide his personal bank statement ? <p> Does Kwame need to submit his bank statement in support of his application despite assurances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in relation to his trip ? The answer is a " yes " . This is so for two reasons . <p> Personal ties to Ghana <p> First , to be eligible for a visa , Kwame must establish that he has sufficient personal ties to his home country . This is determined by reference to his personal , social , economic and financial ties . It is for Kwame to submit his financial documents including his bank statement to enable the ECO assess whether he has sufficient financial ties . <p> " Financial documents " are used in a sense to include all documents necessary to prove one 's financial and economic circumstances . These include bank statements , bonds and shares certificates , fixed deposits , etc . So in our hypothetical case , Kwame 's financial documents will be his bank statement and his investment certificate from Databank Ghana Ltd . <p> Kwame 's ability to show that he has sufficient financial circumstances is a requirement for proving his eligibility for the visa . The ECO is likely to refuse his application if he fails to establish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be the case even if the ECO is satisfied that Kwame 's father has the means to fully pay for Kwame 's trip . <p> Additional claims of maintenance <p> Another reason why Kwame must attach his bank statement is for him to establish that he has the means to pay for his own maintenance independent of assurances made by his father . <p> For the ECO to accept the claims of maintenance , Kwame 's father must show that he has enough funds available to adequately support not only himself but anyone normally dependent on him . It is not sufficient for him to merely provide his bank statement and pay slips to show his ability to pay . He must state the number of dependents he has , if any ; the amount of money he usually spends on them per month , the amount of money he proposes to spend on Kwame , and a statement that he has sufficient means to maintain himself , his dependents as well as Kwame . <p> Yet , there is always a possibility for the ECO to raise concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may refuse the application on the grounds that he is not satisfied that Kwame will be adequately maintained in the UK . This is where Kwame 's bank statement kicks in . By submitting his bank statement , Kwame has the chance to explain that though his father proposes to pay for his trip , he has himself made arrangements to pay for his maintenance despite assurances of maintenance by his father . Kwame must further state that should the ECO have concerns with his father 's claim of maintenance , his financial documents are proof that he has the means to independently pay for his maintenance . <p> Conclusion <p> The rule is therefore clear . Always attach your bank statement even if someone else is paying for you . This will be the case if your trip is being paid for by your friend or family in the UK , your employer , spouse , parent , etc . This rule however may generally not apply to students . <p> Disclaimer : This article only provides general information and guidance on UK immigration law .

These critics who we thought knew better rather ended up blindly copying the western cultures and neglected their own . The 21st Century Ghanaian embraces everything " white " as good in its own paradigm .

They even steal the title of our manifesto . So they have no deep attachment to the principles necessary to drive the promises they give . To them politics is all about ways and means . Nothing to do with actually making lives better . " <p> According to Nana Akomea , President Mahama , in putting together his 2016 manifesto , chose to either steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in NDC 's 2008 and 2012 manifestos , which he failed to implement when he had the mandate to do just that . <p> Nana Akomea mentioned some few examples in what the NPP described as its initial comments on the NDC manifesto . <p> Below is how the NPP summed up the party 's concerns about the president 's " serious trust deficit " : <p> * For example , Nana Akufo-Addo is promising to trigger the constitutional process to create new regions when elected in 2016 <p> * President Mahama now says he is also planning to trigger a similar process to create new regions . <p> * President Mahama also promises to elect DCEs . This is after the NDC in 2011 issued a white paper against the recommendation of the Constitution Review Commission to have DCEs/MCEs elected if re-elected this December . <p> * NPP promises to create new geographical development authorities to oversee the deliberate development of every inhabited corner of the country . <p> * President Mahama yesterday gave the same promise . <p> * In March 2016 , Akufo-Addo announced to the Chiefs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brong-Ahafo Region , that as part of his plans to transform cashew farming into a major cash crop and export earner for Ghana , he will establish a Cashew Marketing Board to regulate the industry and provide ready-market just as it is done for cocoa . <p> * Last night , President Mahama stole from Akufo-Addo yet again , saying , " We will establish a cashew board with its headquarters in the Brong Ahafo Region . " <p> * NPP was implementing ' One Child One Lap Top ' by 2008 , a policy spearheaded by the late Kwadwo Baah-Wiredu , President Kufuor 's Finance Minister . <p> * President Mahama is today promising to also give away one tablet one child after the NDC killed that scheme in 2009 , only to make it seem like a new idea and a new promise today . <p> * The NPP had a Deputy Minister of Education in Charge of Technical Education - Kwame Ampofo Twumasi was Deputy Minister of Education , Youth &amp; Sports in charge of Technical Education in 2008 . <p> * The NDC elected to abandon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it now as a new idea he wishes to implement if re-elected . <p> * NPP promises to implement in 2017 the National ID cards which President Mahama has totally abandoned since he took office . <p> * President Mahama , after listening to Dr Alhaji Mahamudu Bawumia last Thursday , now promises to do the same if re-elected . <p> * If re-elected , the President has repeated his 2008 promise given at the kNUST Energy Forum that an NDC government will provide " energy security " in Ghana before 2012 . Yesterday he repeated , " we will have off-takers for excess electricity " produced here in Ghana . He again made this promise in 2012 that Ghana would be exporting power if elected , only to hit Ghana with the longest power crisis on record . <p> * After watching many potential investors in our petroleum industry leave the country , President Mahama says he wants Ghana to become " the petroleum hub of West Africa . <p> * In its 2012 Manifesto , the NPP promised to make the Western Region " the hub of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on several platforms , including a speech delivered in Houston , Texas , in February 2012 , Nana Akufo-Addo said , the NPP was , looking at how Houston had successfully managed their petroleum industry through " the diversification and industrialisation of a state that used to be dependent on cotton . It is this model of the integrated petrochemical industry that we seek to build in Ghana , servicing the entire oil-rich West African . " <p> * President Mahama says it is his intention that " Ghana will have the best road network in West Africa by 2021 " . Now , we all know what the President means when he describes a road as best , do n't we ? Just last June he described the Dodo-Pepesu-Nkwanta Road he was commissioning in these terms : " ... If you take a look at the quality of the road , you can only admire the good work done . I do n't think that there is any other road in Ghana that is more pleasant to the eye than this one ... I also want to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Burkina Faso for the very high quality of work they have dine on this stretch of road . As I have said , this is one of the best quality roads in Ghana today , and I will urge the Minister of Roads &amp; Highways to bring other contractors to come and see so that they can emulate it in other parts of the country " <p> * In the same month , just two weeks after the road was commissioned , the Nkwanta South DCE , Alfred Kofi Wukanye , took the media on a tour to see for themselves the potholes that had developed on the 26 million Euro road done by the man who confessed to bribing the President with an American car <p> * In the words of one commentator , I K Gyasi , the President " poured fulsome and unstinted praise on the contractors , Messrs Umarou Kanazoe Constructuon Limited of Burkina Faso , and his bosom friend , Mr Jibril Kanazoe , the owner of the company , the same person who , out of eternal gratitude for winning contracts in Ghana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Mahama " <p> * The President says if Ghanaians make the mistake to re-elect him in 83 days ' time , it will mark " the beginning of new glory days of the railway sector . " Thankfully , he has given us a taste of what would happen to the billions of dollars of railway cash if Ghanaians make the mistake to give him another term . The GHS3.5 million money that was fraudulently used for that corrupt bus-branding deal , was cash meant for the railway sector <p> * He says he will " expand the investment under SADA to construct more irrigation facilities . " Recalling how some $200 million of SADA money flew away illegally to irrigate corrupt private pockets , what the President actually means to say is that he will give away more money through corruption in the false name of the people in the North . If he has failed to prosecute one single person for the hundreds of millions of dollars stolen from the people of the North through SADA then why would throwing more money at it deter any corrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President says the IMF programme he forced Ghana through " will be the last . " We must remind him that NPP successfully weaned Ghana off the IMF in 2007 and <p> * He says he is laying the same foundation he told Ghanaians he had laid in 2012 . What stops him from promising another foundation in 2020 just to be consistent ? " The 2016 NDC Manifesto is also noted for repeating failed promises . The NDC in 2008 promised to create full employment . Instead , what they did was to build a strong foundation for creating massive unemployment . NYEP left NDC 110,000 employed . Today , its replacement after the scandalously corrupt GYEEDA , YES , admits now has less than 70,000 young people employed , " Nana Akomea said . <p> Disclaimer : Opinions expressed here are those of the writers and do not reflect those of Peacefmonline.com .

@@14483236 <h> Type of voters ... Ghana . <p> In my opinion they are seven types of voters . We all vote based on different kinds of reasons and for diverse leadership qualities . Whatever rationale one has , our democracy grants one the right to vote and to use that right however one wants . However , the secrecy of the ballot entails we can never tell how well people use that right . Hence , it is important to have more civic education and a good constitution to strengthen people 's effective participation into the democratic process , not by merely voting but by voting based on credible information . Let 's have a look at what kind of voters we may be and the associated biases we can avoid . <p> 1 . The Self-Benefit Voter : <p> These make up a candidate 's support base as they simply can not bend . They are usually the party leaders , relatives , friends and sponsors who expect a direct benefit from the candidate 's victory . The quality of this support base can have a positive influence on the other types of voters . This voter 's reasons are compromised and engaging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biased and not open to criticism . Lesson : We ca n't change their minds , the only thing we can do is observe their conduct as this can reflect their true intention for the country . <p> 2 . The sympathy Voter : <p> For instance , these voters will vote for President John Mahama because of late Professor Atta Mills presidency was inadvertent cut short . These voters will vote for President John Mahama because the Late President Atta Mills trusted him with power . These voters will vote for President John Mahama because he did n't finish his term . These voters will vote for Nana Akuffo Addo because he has lost several times . The sympathy voter , is an emotional voter who will relate to the circumstances of the candidate and not the qualities . Emotional voting should be avoided by all means period . Lesson : These voters need to learn that the interest of the nation are more important than the compensation to a candidate in whatever circumstances . <p> 3 . The Wind Voter : <p> Are you a voter who goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the buzz words and spend more time chanting party slogans than debating issues ? You may want to fit in with peers and are too lazy to make independent decisions . You need to know that it is not about the name of the candidate but their message and track record . The ruling party and the strongest opposition usually captures these voters and the supporters may switch allegiance between the two . These voters need to look beyond the noise and watch the conduct of party officials not their words . Lesson : These voters need to learn the elections are not just for the moment but that their decision will shape them next four years . <p> 4 . The Undecided Voter : <p> This voter make his or her decision in the last few days . They spend most of their time listening or criticising all the candidates . They are pessimists and require more explanations from candidates and not rhetoric . They usually have nothing in common with the candidates or party and may feel there are segregated from the political process . The undecided may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have lost hope in them . These may also include minorities , certain religious groupings or races . Lesson : Politicians are not perfect but there is always a lesser evil , your vote may be amongst the best ones . <p> 5 . The Common Interest Voter : <p> This voter engages in the politics and spends time listening to candidates and fellow electorates . They are receptive to all candidates and prefer one who meets their most valued interest . They are usually the first timers or young voters who want tertiary education , the women who want empowerment , the nurses who want better working conditions or young entrepreneurs who want contracts . These voters will make good decision depending on how much information is made available to them . Due to their numbers they form a very good swing vote . Lesson : Do n't concentrate on one common interest with the candidate but look at the whole picture or the context in which your interests will be met . <p> 6 . The disaffected Voter : <p> These voters are highly discontented towards authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a candidate or party with a poor track record does not stand a chance . They are the employees or traders who ca n't get a loan , the graduate who ca n't find a job , the unpaid retirees , the nurses who got fired , the working class family that is financially stressed and the disgruntled unions , civil society or NGOs . This voter group distrusts politicians but lookout for better alternatives . These voters have experience with election candidates and will improve their choice with every election that comes . Lesson : Do n't make the mistake of giving up on voting , you are probably the most important group due to you large numbers and good judgement <p> 7 . The Sophiscated Voter : <p> This voter is educated , has a good job , may be highly engaged in politics , or is a political analyst or pundit and is well informed . This voter knows what he wants and asks the ' how ' questions . He is not influenced by populism or the wind of change but makes independent decisions . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifestos . He is sensitive to questionable characters and seeks improvement in the style of politics . This voter knows there is no best candidate but can objectively chose a better candidate . Lesson : Most of these voters need to engage more in debates with everyone not just amongst themselves , because they can add value to the process . <p> Politics as a game of numbers , a politician can not ignore one voter group for the other . Each group has some influence over the other and each group can be the difference between victory or loss . They say " your vote counts " but your good vote matters more . Identify which group you belong to , look out for the biases and choose wisely .

@@14593234 : 9 types of women who do n't reach this goal easily <p> Almost each woman wants to get married . Even if she does n't tell you about this . She still wants . This is the female nature , and this is absolutely normal . But for some reasons there are women who become wives and who do n't . <p> The simplest solution is to complain about men and hard women 's destine . But there is also another way : work on yourself . If a girl understands and accepts what is wrong with her , her chances on getting married happily will increase significantly . <p> 1 . Self-interested <p> This is a beautiful and bright woman who knows the worth of her charms . And she uses this instrument with talent and craft . Men lose their heads , because she beckons so much ! It is great to boast with her before friends , it is pleasant to spend time with her , to flirt , but this continues until she sees some profit . As soon as she reaches her goal , she easily stops all relations and keeps moving above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or anyone . As a result , a man remains with broken heart and wallet . She can be quite successful by herself but still everything she will want from a man will be money , profit and income . <p> 2 . Weird and too mysterious <p> Unfortunately , many women understand the phrase " there should be some mystery in a woman " in a wrong way . They confuse the depth of character and manysidedness with pure weirdness . And a woman simply becomes unpredictable : today she feels happy for his call , but tomorrow she is cool as ice . Today she wants to go to the cinema , but tomorrow she does n't . They complicate their relations by themselves in places where they should n't have done this . She plays games , invents roles while men value predictability ! But this " lady with a twist " reminds a car that suddenly decided that its owner will love its more if it becomes unpredictable . The owner turns the wheel right , but it goes left , tries to stop , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ... Each man has his own limit of patience . Sooner or later his psychics can simply give up and he will leave to the woman who can quickly make decisions and simply answer the phone . <p> 3 . With excessive anticipations <p> He should n't drink alcohol or smoke , all his salary should be hers , the mother-in-law should be like his own . Better not to have too much interest in football , but still be a very nice interlocutor . And , of course , he must be handsome and clever . These are just a few demands a lady may have to her man . Probably , such ladies had lots of disappointments in the past that resulted in a set image of what a man should do and be . Of course , she herself does n't want to change much , that 's why any fail she puts on the shoulders of her partner . And then even the most firm man runs away not wishing to put up with her constant demands and whims . <p> This is a specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who simply ca n't live without pointing others on what and how things should be done . But if in case of a man this is expected and acceptable , a woman can blow up mind with her moralizing and judgments . Soon this becomes unbearable . Such ladies can even take on themselves all male duties together with " pants " . If they do get married , then only with weak men . <p> 5 . Marry-face control <p> She is very similar to the type , described above , but here the role of mother is increased several times ! She tries to control all aspects of life of her man . And the man surely hates control and pressing . To be a man , he needs to make decisions and take responsibility for them . And how can he do this , if she already make the list of everything and gave orders ? Sometimes , total control may reach the indecent hight : following , checks of the phone and pockets . In this case , the woman humiliates not only herself but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any relationship . <p> 6 . Women who ca n't behave <p> In this category one can name both fishwives and those women who are simply far from social etiquette . He wants her to make pleasant impression on his family , friends and just people around , but she swears , ca n't stop drinking alcohol and flirts with other men . She strives to show that she is free and modern . Yes , she will surely fit the male company , but he already has friends . He needs the beloved woman . <p> And , as a result , you should n't believe progressive speeches , and ca n't even guess how to be the " modern " lady ! " <p> Each of us has hard times in life . This is normal and natural . It is more important how we accept such situations . There are women for whom the negative tone is the typical way of communication . She has heaps of work , no light in life , problems with money , friends got lost , and she is dissatisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the way , according to them , men became so small and weak . Yes , men like to protect poor , help unhappy , they like to be strong and powerful , to be protectors . But who will like to pity her all the time ? And such woman will stay alone sticking to the position of an unhappy thrown away woman by a cunning and ungrateful man . <p> 8 . Submissive <p> Being obedient and being submissive are two absolutely different things . In the first case , a woman listens to the words of her man , accepts his decisions and his wisdom . This is the correct approach . In the second case she completely dissolves in him . She nods and says " yes " to all his wishes , offers , comments or asks . As a result , she turns into a castle that gave up with no fight . Me have no interest in such women . The want to see an interesting woman who has her own life by their side . And they are not too against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Softly but steadfastly . <p> 9 . Feminist <p> Recently , many of them appeared . On the other hand , they are not willing to get married much . The only thing we can do for them is to treat with respect the fact that they trust in their idea - idea of feminism . Very often such women can do everything by their own and have no need in anything . They are ambitious and purposeful , they can make a good career , and their way of thinking is close to the male one . A man for them is just a pleasant addition . And if she somehow managed to get married , he will probably run away because will understand that he has nothing to do by the side of such woman . Men who are far from psychology claim that a woman-feminist is a diagnosis and ca n't be cured .

@@15022232 <h> Chris Wheatley <p> ... <p> Oct 24 , 2016 12:46:59 <p> The former Arsenal midfielder is enjoying working as technical director at Panathinaikos and opened up about his time in England as well as his unfortunate departure <p> EXCLUSIVE <p> Gilberto 's philosophical nature reminds you of a certain long-serving Arsenal manager at times . The Brazilian was 25-years-old when Arsene Wenger brought him from Brazil to play in one of the most physically demanding leagues in world football . He was a mainstay of the midfield which finished the 2003-04 season unbeaten , while he also helped them to two FA Cup trophies . <p> Now technical director at another of his former clubs , Panathinaikos , Gilberto 's job is to use his skill set to put the Greek side back in the big time again . <p> " It is a real challenge being a sports director , " Gilberto told Goal in his scenic office overlooking the Hymettus mountain in Athens . " It 's the first time I 'm in this job and you have to understand how everything works very quickly . <p> " I came to the club at the end of last season and did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best support I could to find the right players and balance in the team . There are a lot of challenges in the club and you have to slowly overcome them but I 'm enjoying it so far . " <p> Having played 78 times for the Greens and winning the league and cup double in Athens , it 's fair to say Gilberto knows enough about the history and significance of Panathinaikos . He admits he briefly spoke to Wenger and his former sidekick David Dein after taking up the role , seeking words of wisdom from the ex-Arsenal vice-chairman . <p> " We spoke about some things and I spoke many times with David Dein . We 're very close friends and I hope he will come to see one of our games soon . I spoke to other friends I have in the job and then you start to bring some new ideas to the club from what I 've experienced as a player - and things I 've missed as a player and to fill up this gap inside the club . " <p> The current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaching , with Thierry Henry and Freddie Ljungberg both examples of former Arsenal players who have gone down that particular route . Gilberto says the sporting director role brings about its own unique challenges , and while he has n't ruled out becoming a coach or returning to the Gunners in the future , he says his experiences as a player have helped him settle into his new job . <p> " At the moment I did n't have the feeling to be a coach . If you want to be a coach you must have this feeling and must live for it . You have to understand that sporting director is a full time job and the pressure is totally different and in some places being a coach is not easy - many coaches have been sacked very easily all over the world . <p> " At some point I will do my badges but that 's because I want to understand better what is behind the face of the coach , what he has to learn to become a successful one . <p> " You never know about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the deepest point of my heart that I have a great love and appreciation for . The most important part now is not to focus on that and focus on doing my job in the right way , to help them achieve their goals . If the team achieve their goals it means that everyone has done a good job . <p> " Everyday when I wake up I think what can I improve at the club , what can I do to improve myself and what can I do to give the club better service ? This is my own challenge everyday . Sometimes it is a lonely job . Sometimes you do n't have anyone to share your frustrations with . Sometimes you do n't have people thinking the same way as you but you have to encourage people to work as you want according to their abilities and try to help them improve for the club . <p> " I believe being a footballer can help a lot , especially when you approach a player , because I was on the other side before . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shy and too hard - to find a good way of approaching them . Even though they are young players , old player , big players - everyone is a human being and behind the footballer there is a human being . " <p> Working alongside Wenger , who recently marked 20 years as Arsenal manager , was evidently a career highlight for Gilberto and the manner in which he speaks and conveys his ideas bares similarities to that of the Frenchman . He says arriving in Europe for the first time brought up various challenges , but the biggest obstacle in his way was not being able to speak a word of English . <p> " He was really important because when I arrived at Arsenal I came as a man . I was 25 at the time and the good thing for him was that he did n't have so much to work with me . It was my first club in Europe and the Premier League is not so easy for any foreign player . It 's maybe a bit harder for a Brazilian player because we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you have to adapt to the way of playing which is difficult . <p> " The hardest thing for me was the communication as I could not speak English at the time . I had to work hard to learn the language and it was one of the gifts of playing in England , apart from football , of course . I would not have been satisfied when I left England if I had not mastered English even though I had success in football . <p> " It was important when he told me the way he wanted me to play . In Brazil we got the ball , played at the side and the back - it was n't aggressive going forwards . He spoke to me about it and I understood very well and this is the reason why I played regularly . " <p> Arsenal are currently spoilt for choice in midfield with the likes of Francis Coquelin , Granit Xhaka , Mohamed Elneny , Santi Cazorla and Aaron Ramsey all competing for a place . Since Gilberto 's departure in 2008 the club have struggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mikel Arteta and even Kim Kallstrom over the years . Gilberto attempts to explain why the club have found it difficult to find that all-round defensive midfielder and cites the fact that his successors have had no older role model to learn from . <p> " Coquelin had very good moments last year . I heard comparisons to me which I 'm happy about because it means people understood my role and the job I was doing . Maybe they did n't understand at first because at the beginning they expected a Brazilian player to score the goals ! <p> " I think the hardest thing for some of those young players who came after me was that they did n't have anyone older than them to learn things from , as I had with Ray Parlour , Patrick Vieira and Edu . <p> " They were there before me and worked with the coach for a long time . It was important to have those guys in front of me to see how they approach the game and learn from them . For some of the young players after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was quite hard . Maybe the ones who took their opportunity were Cesc Fabregas and Mathieu Flamini because myself and Patrick left , then they started to play with each other . " <p> While reminiscing on his time at Arsenal it becomes apparent about how tough a decision leaving the club was . In his penultimate season with the Gunners , a reinvigorated Gilberto took on the captain 's armband due to Thierry Henry 's injury and scored 11 goals from midfield in the process . He admits that his final season at the club was the most difficult of his time in England and reveals that he turned down the opportunity to join another unnamed club in England , instead opting for Greece and Panathinaikos . <p> " This 2007-08 was the season where I took a different role in the team because I had the captain 's armband as Thierry was injured . Everything worked well for me because I not only did my job as a defensive midfielder but I could help going forwards , scoring goals . <p> " The hardest thing was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was my last season for Arsenal . It was hard for me because I was making headlines as a defensive midfielder and delivering upfront without losing focus on my main role and after I came back late from the Copa America it was hard for me to watch the games from the bench . <p> " It was not easy for me to understand , I spoke to Arsene about it and it was disappointing for me . It was hard when I saw that it would not change and I made my mind to leave which was really hard for me . I had an opportunity to move to England but it would have been hard to play against Arsenal . " <p> Gilberto 's backstory is a fascinating one . He grew up in a poor family and took jobs at a young age which included working on a coffee plantation and as an upholsterer , the latter of which he learnt from his father who retired in 1991 . Having to provide for his entire family was a life lesson which has helped Gilberto understand his responsibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has since transferred to football . <p> " There are many people like me who had the same kind of upbringing " , insists a humble Gilberto . <p> " I grew up in a very small village and I would never myself have an opportunity at a football club , a trial or whatever . When I got my chance I wanted to do the best I could . I had frustrations at the beginning , then I went back to work again to help my family . <p> " I believe that what I had to do before football was important for me . It 's easy to get lost when you achieve your goals in football . I never lost the plot because I understood how the hard the life can be outside of football . For somebody who wants to succeed in football he has to understand that the footballers life is not so easy if you want to achieve great things . You have to work hard instead of complaining all time . To work hard , to be responsible and transfer it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I worked in a construction company which was hard work .

But few know where these lustrous locks come from and the journey they take across the globe . <p> Go online in search of a wig or hair extensions and you 'll be presented with a dizzying spectrum of choices . " Luxury " virgin hair from Brazil or Peru . " Pure " Mongolian hair . " Finest remy " hair from India . Sleek European weaves . But very rarely will you see hair from China advertised - even though that 's where most of it is from . <p> China is the biggest exporter and importer of human hair and harvests huge amounts from its own population , as Emma Tarlo discovered on a three-year quest to untangle what happens to hair once it is no longer attached to our heads . <p> " People who work in the industry are conscious of the fact Made in China is viewed as a negative label and market it in more glamorous ways instead , " says the professor of anthropology and author of Entanglement : The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair glossaries , blogs and tutorials and you 'll be told that Chinese hair is the coarsest , that Filipino hair is similar but much shinier , that Brazilian hair is " full-bodied with a beautiful bounce " and Indian hair is " versatile with a natural lustre " . Definitions are as varied as they are vague . <p> " The more you try to make sense of it , the more elusive it becomes , " says Tarlo . " European hair is the most valuable , partly because of its fine textures , the variety of its colours and because it is in shorter supply . " Most of this hair comes from countries in Eastern Europe , such as Russia , Romania , or Ukraine . <p> At the top end of the market is " virgin " hair - hair that has never been chemically treated - and " remy " hair , which has been cut or shaved directly from a donor . <p> And then at the opposite end of the scale is " standard hair " - often used as a more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otherwise , many sleek and shiny hair extensions start life as hairballs , collected from combs and plugholes . <p> " Chinese factories will often call the comb waste hair ' standard hair ' because a lot of the hair comes through that route , " says Tarlo . <p> " In terms of marketing it 's up to the integrity of traders all the way along the line to specify what hair is what . Quite a lot of mislabelling goes on and often the people buying it do n't ask questions anyway . " <p> This applies to the consumers in the salon too , according to Tarlo . <p> " People do n't want to be haunted by the ghosts of the people from whom the hair has come . There is still a ' yuk ' factor to the whole idea of buying and wearing other people 's body parts , " she says . The whole supply chain is shrouded in secrecy from beginning to end . <p> There is a whole industry around untangling , sorting and treating comb waste . While the finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final destination , it is likely to be a mishmash of hair from many Asian countries . " There is no distinction , it all gets mangled up , " says Tarlo . <p> " All over Asia , long-haired women will save the hair that comes out when they comb or wash it and once they 've got a few years ' worth they 'll sell it to the pedlars who go around these neighbourhoods calling out for hair , " says Tarlo . Out of a bag she pulls some of her own hair - it 's a dusty mound of comb-waste collected over three years and worth about 80p ( $1 ) , she says . <p> All this hair gets amassed , passed from trader to trader , until it ends up in hair-untangling workshops in parts of Bangladesh , India and more recently Myanmar - countries where wages are low and people need work . <p> Tarlo visited workshops and homes in Myanmar and India , where she saw dozens of women sitting on the floor untangling other people 's hairballs and then sorting them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painstaking work , and very labour intensive - 1.5kg ( 3.3lb ) of hair takes around 80 hours of labour to untangle " she says . <p> In Myanmar women were given 100g ( 3.5oz ) of hair in the morning and another 100g in the afternoon . Villagers would also come in to buy mounds of the comb waste to take home , untangle and then sell back to the hair brokers . <p> Next comes the processing . The outer layer of a hair - the cuticle - has scales , all of which point in the same direction , like the scales of a fish . But the problem with comb waste is that hair is mangled up - the scales point in different directions causing it to tangle and knot . In China the hair is typically put in a chemical bath to remove the cuticle completely , Tarlo explains . " This resolves the tangling but the lack of a cuticle results in somewhat lower quality hair , " she says . " Nonetheless , by the end of this process it can look fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a journey that hair has been on . " <h> The politics of hair <p> Throughout history , the international hair market has always had a political dimension , says Tarlo . <p> When the Manchu Qing dynasty was overthrown in China in 1912 , an order went out that men should cut off their plaits and some had their hair forcibly removed by the Revolutionary Guard . " Many of these plaits came on to the hair market but traders worried their source of long hair combings from men 's plaits would run out if men no longer had long hair . " <p> The Chinese hair industry hit problems again in the late 1960s , when the US imposed a ban on so-called " communist hair " . " It was at this point that Indian hair became important to the industry , " says Tarlo . <p> Millions travel to Hindu temples in southern India every year to get their hair shaved - or " tonsured " as it is known when it is done for religious reasons .

The barbers work quickly and the hair is promptly scooped up and sold every few months by the temple authorities via e-auction . <p> Hair from India was a staple supply for wig makers in Orthodox Jewish communities across Europe , the US and Israel - until 2004 , when a delegation of rabbis from Stamford Hill , North London went to investigate whether or not the hair could be considered kosher . <p> " The delegation was sent by an old Lithuanian rabbi in Israel , to work out whether the hair was a religious offering or could be considered religiously neutral , " explains Tarlo . <p> " Even though the ritual took place outside the temple they concluded it was too muddled up with idol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it caused a big crisis in the market because it cut that circuit of hair from India into the Jewish market .

No President Can Destool Chiefs -- Akufo-Addo " Modernghana.com 11/3/16 ) . <p> Maybe the " Ganger Boy " needs to carefully look at the man in the mirror , vis- ? -vis his unquestionably egregious treatment of chiefs and people of areas and municipalities and districts of the country widely known to ideologically tilt towards the New Patriotic Party .

Back then , Mr. Mahama also presumptuously claimed that so flagrantly ungrateful were Asantes that even if he were to pave all the streets and highways of the country 's most populous region with gold , Asantes would still not reciprocate such a magnanimous gesture by voting overwhelmingly to retain his National Democratic Congress ( NDC ) regime in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His Royal Majesty , The Okyenhene , Osagyefo Amoatia Ofori-Panyin , II , and callously taunted the indigenes and residents of Kyebi , the traditional capital of Okyeman , for being the headquarters of the criminally predatory and NDC-sponsored wantonly destructive activities of Galamsey , or illegal mining . <p> Not surprisingly , this National Democratic Congress ' government has yet to design and implement any comprehensive program aimed at reversing the Akan or non-northern equivalent of desertification . Where is our SADA ?

@@15264237 <h> Industries want subsidies ... residential power removed <p> The Association of Ghana Industries ( AGI ) has served notice that industries can no longer bear the payment of subsidies on residential power , and therefore want it scrapped in the next tariff review in order not to disadvantage industries . <p> The AGI President , Mr. James Asare-Adjei , said : " industry is no longer in the position to subsidise residential consumers in the payment of electricity tariffs . " He demanded that subsequent tariff adjustment should remove every subsidy on residential consumers being borne by industry . <p> He said while industries remain helpless in the current relatively stabilized energy situation with the hope of seeing further improvement , the accompanying electricity tariff is rendering businesses uncompetitive . <p> The AGI has therefore asked for a reduction of the tariff levels while pointing out that its silence on the matter should not be seen as acceptance of the charges . <p> The manufacturing sector , just like other sectors of the economy , has been faced with myriad of challenges leading to consistent decline in its contribution to GDP over the past years . <p> The development , the AGI President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly given that the sector has twice experienced negative growth rate in the past four years . <p> Industry contribution to GDP declined from 28 percent in 2012 to the current 25.3 percent , according to figures from the Ghana Statistical Service . <p> However , with the population growth rate pegged at about 2.4 percent and the teeming number of students coming from the universities yearly , the manufacturing sector is seen to hold the solution to the worsening unemployment situation . <p> But regrettably the implementation of the Industrial Policy , developed together with the private sector some five years ago , with the objective of resuscitating the manufacturing sector has been poor . <p> It is against this backdrop that the AGI said a review of the Ghana Industrial Policy and its implementation programme , the Industrial Sector Support Programme , should be immediately considered . <p> In addition to this it was also suggested that the necessary measures and resources for the full and effective implementation be put in place . <p> These pronouncements were made at the 56th Annual General Meeting of the AGI , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kumasi .

Court judgment on EC disqualifications <p> The Supreme Court has ordered the EC to take steps to allow 12 disqualified candidates to correct errors on their nomination forms that constituted the basis for their disqualification . <p> The highest court of the land made the pronouncement on Monday morning after the Electoral Commission deferred to it to contest a high court ruling ordering it ( EC ) to allow the Progressive Peoples ' candidate , Dr. Papa Kwesi Nduom make corrections to anomalies identified on his nomination forms . <p> The application before this Court invokes the supervisory jurisdiction of the Court against the High Court ( Commercial Division ) , Accra praying this Court for an order of certiorari to bring up into this Court for purposes of being quashed the ruling of His Lordship Justice Eric Kyei Baffour dated the 28th day of October , 2016 upon the facts deposed to in the accompanying affidavit . <p> The grounds for the application are as follows : <p> i . Error of law on the face of the record . <p> ii . Wrongful assumption of jurisdiction by the High Court ( Commercial Division ) , Accra . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts of the case are as follows : <p> The Applicant is the Electoral Commission constitutionally mandated to organize presidential and parliamentary elections including receiving nominations of candidates . Apart from the Constitution 1992 , there are other pieces of legislation such as the Representation of the Peoples Act ( PNDCL284 ) and the Public Elections Regulations , 2016 ( C.I 94 ) , which set up the legal regulatory framework for the conduct of general elections in Ghana . <p> The Interested Party is the Presidential Candidate for the Progressive Peoples Party ( PPP ) for the 2016 elections . <p> For the 2016 presidential and parliamentary elections , the Applicant opened nominations on 13th September 2016 and invited candidates to go for nomination forms . At an IPAC meeting held on the 8th day of September 2016 , the Applicant announced to the various Political Parties that the nomination days shall be the 29th and 30th of September 2016 , when all nomination papers would be received by returning officers for both the presidential and parliamentary candidates throughout Ghana . The dates were confirmed in a Press Release @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Public Elections Regulations , 2016 C.I 94 , regulation 9(1)-(3) imposed a duty on the Applicant , to ensure that Returning Officers having received the forms and found any anomalies to give the candidates opportunity to either amend or alter the anomaly within the stipulated nomination period as stated in regulation 9(2) of C I 94 . <p> In the case of the Interested Party , his nomination form was sent by the Chairman of the PPP to the Chairperson of the Applicant and was told that he would hear from the Applicant Commission . On the 10th day of October 2016 , when the Applicant n announced that certain presidential candidates including the Interested Party herein had been disqualified for several reasons . <p> It is the case of the Interested Party that the Applicant breached their own regulations 9(2)-(4) when they failed to give him and other disqualified candidates the opportunity to amend or alter whatever was found not to be proper with their forms , a conduct the Interested Party considered to be a breach of the rules of natural justice . And therefore for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the record as well as for the breach of the rules of natural justice , the Interested Party applied to the High Court for judicial review by way of Certiorari and Prohibition . <p> On the 28th day of October 2016 , the High Court presided over by his Lordship Mr. Justice Eric Kyei Baffour granted the said application in part , namely , breach of the rules of natural justice audi alteram partem and quashed the decision and made a further order directed against the Applicant and its Chairperson to afford opportunity to the Interested Party to make the necessary alteration or amendments to its nomination paper for it to receive same and then proceed to determine whether the Interested Party had met all the criteria laid down by the laws of the Republic in line with his duty laid down by C.I . 94 . Being dissatisfied with the ruling of the High Court , the Applicant has applied to the court for an order of certiorari to quash the said ruling . <p> Submissions by parties <p> Error on the Face of the record <p> Counsel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Applicant failed to afford opportunity to the Interested Party within the nomination period because it did not have such a period can not be correct in the light of Interested Party 's averment in paragraph 8 of his affidavit in support ( filed before the High Court on 14 October 2016 ) and exhibited and attached to her affidavit in support and marked ' ' CO1 ' ' by the Applicant as that " the E C opened nominations between the period of 8th and 30th September 2016 . " Counsel submits further that in view of the said averment , the nomination period was not in issue because it had fixed a nomination period so the Judge relied on facts which have not been recorded as evidence and this led him to come to the conclusion that the Applicant breached the rules of natural justice because it equally failed to set the nomination period . Counsel concludes that : <p> " Our submission is that having regard to the overwhelming evidence and which the parties are ad idem on regarding the fact that Applicant had fixed the nomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the High Court committed an error of law clearly on the face of the record when it held that Applicant did not fix a nomination period " <p> Counsel for the Interested Parties responds that in view of the duty cast on the EC to afford candidates the opportunity to effect amendments or alterations within the stipulated nomination period that duty can not be performed if the EC fails to set a clear nomination period , within which period there can be nomination day or days . <p> Consideration of the issue whether there was error on the face of the record <p> This court recalls our firm holding in the plethora of cases referred to by counsel for the Applicant that in order for the Supreme Court to exercise its supervisory jurisdiction against the decision of the High Court , the High court must have made an error patent on the face of the record which either goes to jurisdiction or are so plain as to make the impugned decision a nullity . In the case of Republic v Court of Appeal , ex-parte Tsatsu Tsikata 2005-2006 SCGLR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this court is that , our supervisory jurisdiction under article 132 of the 1992 constitution , should be exercised only in those manifestly plain and obvious cases , where there are patent errors of law on the face of the record , which errors either go to jurisdiction or are so plain as to make the impugned decision a complete nullity . " <p> In the ex-parte Tsatsu Tsikata case Wood JSC ( as she then was ) explained further that : <p> " ... It stands to reason then that the error(s) of law as alleged must be fundamental , substantial , material , grave or so serious as to go to the root of the matter . A minor , trifling , inconsequential or unimportant error which does not go to the core or root of the decision complained of ; or , stated differently , on which the decision does not turn would not attract the courts supervisory jurisdiction " We agree with Counsel for the Applicant that by the averments made by the Interested Party in his affidavit in opposition , ( which he now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake ) ; the nomination period was fixed from 8th September to 30 September 2016 . Even if the judge erred by his findings that the Applicant did not set a nomination period , in view of the averments , we do not think the error goes to the core or root of the decision complained of ; as the decision did not turn on the nomination period ; it rather turned on the failure by the Applicant to afford the Interested Party the right to be heard before being disqualified . <p> Counsel for the Applicant submitted that the nomination period played a crucial role in so far as the ruling of the court was concerned , as any anomaly that the Applicant detected on the Interested Party 's nomination paper was to be corrected within the nomination period . We do not see any error of law in that finding as it is reasonable to expect or contemplate that the nomination period would extend beyond the nomination day(s) in order for the Applicant to assess the nomination forms and to offer opportunity to the candidate to make any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination period , as prescribed in rule 9 ( 2 ) of C.I . 94 Indeed we find no error on the face of the record in so far as the decision quashing the disqualification of the interested party was made as a result of the finding by the learned judge of a breach of the rules of natural justice . <p> The application based on this ground fails . <p> Wrongful assumption of jurisdiction by the High Court <p> The second ground for the application as couched by the Applicant is that the High Court ( Commercial Division ) Accra wrongfully assumed jurisdiction . We will not spend much time on this ground as the Interested Party invoked the supervisory jurisdiction of the court by way of judicial review of a procedural impropriety and was not challenging the grounds of his disqualification which by virtue of rule 9.5 of C.I . 94 ought to be by an election petition and to be commenced after the election . This ground for the application is dismissed . <p> Excess of Jurisdiction <p> The last ground for this application is Excess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Applicant disqualifying the interested party as a candidate made the following consequential orders : " And order that the Applicant afford opportunity to the Interested Party to make the necessary alteration or amendment to its nomination paper for it to receive same and then proceed to determine whether the Interested Party had met all the criteria laid down by the laws of the Republic , in line with its duties laid down by C.I . 94 . EC has no basis to complain that nomination period has closed when they did not set one . They only set nomination date under regulation 7 but not nomination period under regulation 9(2) as I have already found . The time frame to afford the Interested Party is entirely within the discretion of the Applicant being mindful of the limited available time for the election of December 7 , 2016 .

That accordingly I have been advised by Applicant 's lawyers and verily believe same to be true that the High Court wrongly assumed jurisdiction over Applicant 's case and indeed exceeded its jurisdiction when it ordered that Applicant allow the interested party to make amendments to his nomination paper regardless of the nature of the non-compliance , the High Court unlike this Court having no powers under article 2 of the 1992 constitution . <p> 22 . That Applicant 's lawyers have advised me and I verily believe same to be true that the High Court exceeded its jurisdiction when it ordered Applicant to permit the interested party to make the alterations and amendments necessary to correct the duplicate subscription to his nomination paper when the nomination period had expired . <p> 23 . That Applicant 's lawyers further advise me and I verily believe same to be true that the High Court also exceeded its jurisdiction when it ordered Applicant to permit the interested party make the alterations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomination paper the reason being that the said ordered interfered with Applicant 's constitutional mandate in electoral matters . <p> Counsel stated further in his statement of case at 4.2 that : " The High Court 's decision effectively extending the period of nomination has very serious consequences for the electoral calendar . It has been held that public policy and national interest is a good reason to refuse an application for judicial review . " <p> Consideration of the issue of whether there was excess of jurisdiction <p> In as much as we agree with Counsel 's submission that the High Court 's decision effectively extending the period of nomination has very serious consequences for the electoral calendar , we do not think it is sufficient reason to hold that the High Court has exceeded its jurisdiction . <p> However , since the complaint of the Interested Party was that the Applicant failed to give him a hearing before being disqualified the most appropriate consequential order in the circumstances is to order the Applicant to give the Interested Party a hearing . In that respect we can say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit the Interested Party make the alterations and amendments necessary to correct the double subscription to his nomination paper . <p> We will therefore proceed to quash the consequential order and order the Applicant to give the Interested Party a hearing that he deserves . <p> Other Reliefs <p> Counsel for the Applicant in his concluding statement of case stated : " We accordingly pray the Court to grant whatever relief is appropriate in the present circumstances especially where there can be no doubt that the High Court committed an error apparent on the face of the record . " <p> Counsel for the Interested Party opposed this by stating : " ... Counsel for the Applicant appeared to be appealing to this Court to make any orders and give such directions as would ensure fairness or ensure that justice , equity and fairness prevail . I invite the Court to decline the invitation , since the conduct of the Applicant is rather not calculated to ensure fairness and equity and it is likely to rather endanger the electoral calendar .

In appropriate cases , to afford candidates , the opportunity to comply with regulation 9 ( 2 ) of the Public Elections Regulations , 2016 ( C.I.94 ) . <p> 4 . CONSEQUENT to the above directives , we find it necessary and expedient to make a further order to stay all court proceedings pending in the various High Courts against the Applicant by some of the disqualified presidential candidates on the same issue of having been denied a hearing to enable the EC to carry out its mandate in line with these orders . <p> WHEREFORE we accordingly stay all such proceedings in the High Courts .

@@15602234 <h> Lifestyle : How ... sexual rejection affect men ? <p> Picture this . You 're at home . You 're feeling relaxed . You 've had a great day . And you 're in the mood to have sex . You turn on some music and pour two glasses of wine . <p> Your partner comes home and you 're thinking -- let 's get it on . You give them a kiss and suggest going to the bedroom . But they pull away . You quickly notice your partner is cranky . They tell you that traffic was terrible . They had a long day and are exhausted . And they just want to sit on the couch , watch some TV . Thanks for the drink . Oh , and by the way , they are far too tired to even think about having sex . <p> Most women I talk to would describe feeling a bit ( and sometimes very ) hurt if they were the sexual initiator in this scenario . In contrast , we tend to think that sexual rejection does n't hurt so much for men which is based , at least in part , on two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which proposes that men should desire sex for physical and surface level reasons rather than for an emotional connection . So , if men initiate sex and their efforts are rejected , it ca n't hurt that much because all they lost out on was the physical act of sex or " getting off . " <p> And the second assumption , related to Sexual Script Theory3,4 , suggests that in heterosexual relationships , men should initiate sexual activity and women should act as the " gatekeeper " ( i.e. , the one who says yes or no to those advances ) . As a result of initiating sexual activity more often , it follows that men would also tend to experience more rejection . Which seems to lead us to conclude : Rejection ca n't hurt that much because men must expect it . <p> But just because the sexual rejection scenario I described earlier might be more likely to occur to a man , does n't mean it 's any easier to handle . In fact , it seems to be the opposite pattern . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really hurt a man 's confidence , his ego , and even decrease his own interest in sex . <p> In my research , I interviewed a community sample of men ( aged 30-65 ) in long-term heterosexual relationships ( 14 years duration in average ) about their experiences of sexual desire5 . I asked men about whether there were times where they felt less desire , or maybe even experienced no sexual desire at all . And what almost every man I interviewed told me was that their sexual desire ( and sometimes even their self-esteem ) decreased when their sexual advances were rejected . <p> For example , take a look at these quotes from men I talked with that describe the impact sexual rejection had on them : <p> " When you 're the guy and you 're always the one to make the moves all the time , and your partner 's always the one saying " no , no , no , no " you start getting very aware ... depressed , and wondering whether or not something is going on . Whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " If she does n't want me , she somehow is not interested in me ... it offends me somewhere inside ... I know she is not interested in me and she does n't like me . Does n't want me . It 's like forget it . I do n't feel it anymore . " - Kyle age 38 <p> And most of the men I talked to did n't describe rejection here and there that could be chalked up to bad timing . For example , you 're in " the mood " but your partner has a legitimate headache , is sick , in a bad mood , etc . That 's going to happen . It does happen . <p> In every relationship . Because the idea that we would feel sexual interest at the exact same time as our partner every time over multiple years is perhaps a nice , but a pretty far-fetched idea . There are going to be plenty of times where either partner says : " no , not tonight honey . " <p> But many of the men I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual advances that wore them down over time , that made them question themselves , their relationship , and ultimately negatively impacted their self-esteem . Men also indicated that having their sexual advances rejected over and over again actually decreased their own level of interest in sex . <p> " I 'm usually a very positive person , but when it comes to sex , it 's tough to stay positive or imagine sex when you 're always getting rejected . So it 's easier not to think about it . " - Ben , age 49 <p> This quote represents the sentiments I 've heard from more and more men during research and in therapy . That rejection is hard . That sexual rejection is really hard . And , as a result , men often strategize to behave in ways to avoid that rejection . Often by pulling back from sex by showing less of an interest and reducing the frequency and quality of their sexual advances . <p> A recent study by Dr. Amy Muise and her colleagues supports this finding . Over the first two phases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 128 couples were at reading signs their partner was interested in sex6 . Dr. Muise found that across her first two studies there was a similar pattern of men under-perceiving their female partner 's interest in sex . So Muise conducted a third part of that study to explore why this might be the case . And they focused on the potential role of rejection . <p> The third of her studies included 101 ( mostly ) heterosexual couples between the ages of 18 and 53 , in relationships that ranged from 6 months to 22 years . Over the course of three weeks the couples were asked to keep a diary of their sexual activity . One of the questions the researchers asked was : " I did not want my partner to reject me " ( with responses ranging from " 1 " indicting " not at all important " to " 7 " indicating " extremely important " ) . <p> The researchers concluded that on days when men were particularly motivated to avoid rejection , they were more likely to under-perceived their partner 's interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that they were more averse to the possibility of experiencing rejection ( for whatever reason , or reasons , that might be -- feeling insecure , having a bad day , previously receiving some less than stellar feedback from their boss ) they missed sexual cues from their partner . They did not initiate sex . They were less likely to even report thinking about sex . <p> Which appears to be an adaptive response . To consider , Hey , maybe my partner is n't in the mood and it would be too risky today to get it wrong . Too risky to think they did have an interest and then experience rejection again . I 'll just leave it alone . <p> What Can We Do With This Information ? <p> It 's understandable to not be in the mood to have sex with your partner if you feel they are just looking for a physical release and you 're the closest ( or only available ) option . But when I work with couples in therapy I regularly see the shift that can happen when men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't simply about sexual release , and that instead they want to connect and feel close with their partner and to receive validation of their desirability and their worth . <p> And when the other partner hears that their rejection hurts more deeply than they thought they sometimes reject less often , try to initiate a bit more , or something just as helpful , they are mindful of rejecting in kinder ways . A shift from a cold shrug or eye roll becomes " sorry , tonight I 'm really not feeling it " with a conciliation offering such as " but maybe we can find time tomorrow or this weekend ? " Or " maybe we could just sit and cuddle on the couch instead . " You might be surprised at what a shift like this can do in your relationship .

Beyond 2020 , Ghana will not be able to increase production for 5 years or more , even if new discoveries are made between 2017 and 2020 considering that it takes an average period of 7 years between discovery and production . " <p> " Also , the inactivity offshore which affects future production prospects can be attributed to the provisional ruling on the Ghana-Ivory Coast maritime dispute by the International Tribunal on the Law of the Seas ( ITLOS ) , which has frozen exploration works in the disputed areas .

The Kuffour administration went into office in 2000 and 2004 with a promise to the Ghanaian people that his administration would have Zero Tolerance for Corruption . <p> Many Ghanaians felt strongly that Kuffour failed on making good on this promise .

While I am not saying that he should adhere strictly to this distribution , large deviations from this distribution will smack of tribalism . <p> In a forty ( 40 ) member cabinet , for example , this distribution calls for about 5 to 6 Ewes , 19 Akans , 3 Gas , 6 to 7 Mole-Dagbons , etc . Of course , the actual distribution will be expected to be a little different from this but a make-up of , say , 1 Ewe , 36 Akans , 1 Ga , 1 Mole-Dagbon , and 1 Guan will be a complete tribal distortion in the same way that a make-up of , say , 25 Ewes , 5 Akans , and 10 Others will also cry foul . <p> I wish to call on President-elect Akufo-Addo to recognize the positive aspects of the Mahama administration and build upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are performing excellently at what they do , he should consider extending their tenure of office beyond the Mahama presidency .
