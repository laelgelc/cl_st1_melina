Well , since they do not have that many supporters , the merry stooges decided to incorporate Mungiki , a BANNED terrorist and criminal organisation of atavistic , bloodthirsty gangsters available to the highest bidder but loathed in Central Kenya . The highest bidder in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing -- Mungiki is BANNED , period ! That means it can not meet , demonstrate or gather in groups of more than 3 people . Now what is he mourning about ? He has himself broken the law through his opportunistic sycophants like Muite , Maina Njenga , Ngunjiri and Gitari and who have been meeting in his office to plan these amateurish shenanigans . Now he turns around to try and salvage his ramshackle reputation by purporting to order Saitoti to rectify his mistake ? Like i said , BURE KABISA ! ! <p> Francis <p> This is one time Hon.Saitoti should tell someone to go and do some " Un-christian things to themselves " . It is obvious who is behind the stupid stunts of the midiwos and the shameless imanyara.The script is now very clear.Why should Saitoti investigate that which imanyara could not report to police himself until after almost 24hrs ?

Alone on a Nairobi road where he can " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How many morons does imanyara think Kenya has ?

Any meeting by one maina njenga anywhere in Kenya today is a mockery of civilization.The blood of so many innocent central province people has been shed at the hands of the outfit though which njenga has made millions.I thought i saw in news the said youths HIGH-FIVING police at end of it all after they talked sense to them and i could not but be proud of the new policing tactics.Raila can ask for a refund for the cancelled meeting if it is him who had paid for the venue ! What might happen come next election ? MMM one thing is clear-KENYANS WILL NOT ELECT A CLOWN !

Does tribalist and political reject Paul Muite dance to pm 's tunes ? And do you incite people to attack the police and then scream police brutality ? Is attacking police not a serious criminal offence ? I think democracy arrived too early for people like this do-nothing pm . You have to respect institutions if at all you are democratic . When police detects impending crime and swings in to action , or are given orders to do the needful , you can only take issue with those who authorized the action . Pm , as a coward and master of escapism , has never tried to confront his boss on any issue . He simply plays a Kizza Bisigye by attacking the messengers . I thought he was a senior government official who could have the matter discussed at the highest level of the government ? ! !

Prime ministership is already reduntant position in the current situation . Raila should not therefore pretend to be master of human rights only when his paid goons defy orders . Bishop Gitari , famous tribalist and political reject Paul Muite are well known opportunistic supporters of Raila . Muite who the moment president Kibaki was elected , dropped all pretence of human rights activism and quickly became a Kikuyu protector , is now trying to mislead the public . He only became anti-Kibaki after he realised that he wasnt going to be appointed a minister . He was strongly aided by Koigi wa Wamwere who eventually landed assistant ministerial job . From then on , Muite has attempted with alot of failure to regain his balance . We cant therefore take such opportunistic fellows seriously . Raila should also realize that his time of fooling Kenyans is long gone and gone forever . <p> Goodboy30it <p> Anybody has powers to question police brutality and PM has his constitunal right to do so ...

You cant therefore expect them to hold their hands akimbo when they are being attacked by goons , seemingly sent by the same empty complaining righteous people.Their job is to maintain law and order . Thus , once they issue orders that you do nt agree with , if you are as democratic as you pretend , the least you can do is to go to court to challenge those orders . You CANT opt to confront them while pretending your rights are being violated . Thats criminal pal ! Brutality cant also be onesided it first comes from purported victims .

These are kicks of a dying horse . Imanyara , God is with you no harm will befall you . <p> mgharo <p> Kenyans should be very cautious on our leadership style . Oligarcy has roots in Kenya and leadership tends to revolve around certain individuals who have stolen money from tax payers and use it to ascend to power at all cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure will result to Rwanda style of genocide . Essentially these surrogates create a huge gap between the haves and the haves not thereby encouraging the mushrooming of criminal gangs made up angry youths who feel cheated and marginalised .

How much is an helcopter ? , even CEOS in Kenya do not have these copters , it takes years of saving for a CEO to acquire a helcopter ! now how do our politician get them. ? ? Kenyans should not attend political rallies when the Mheshima is fown in a flashy copters and the poor person in attendance will not afford sukuma wiki for his dinner back home ! Choose leaders who support equality . Remember the words of late Wangari Maathai , " equal distribution of weath " .

Its an empty song that purports an idiotic meaning of a song is in itself , an action ! Shouting reform on rooftops while you have failed or even stopped reform is actually the absurdity that Kenyans can do without . And need we add that some of these fake reformers have occupied extremely high offices in the land and miserably failed to institute any reform at all . Infact , majority of the people who self-proclaim themselves reformers in Kenya are mostly empty professional liars . They are the same same opportumists who claimed that they were kept naked in waterlogged rooms at Nyayo house .

However , every time we have had to be reminded that this or that opportunist " fought for us " and thus , need to walk slowly to reform ! And the people telling us so are supposedly the " reformers . " Who said that any genuine sacrifice for others must be revered and even treated as a reward item ? People have a right to choose what to revere and what not to . Secondly , demanding for recognition instead of allowing people to appreciate you is in itself very selfish sad opportunism . It can only mean your purported sacrifices were actually self-serving , otherwise why would a well meaning Kenyan demand to be honoured ? <p> Pratt <p> Surely , would any sane person seeking support do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance his dwidling political career . The so called UK dossier on ICC , Midiwo 's claim , false opinion polls , asking for more security for pm and now Imanyara 's claim are all related , if not intertwined . Kenyans have been misled for far too long and we need to expose the people behind all this endless mischief . Furthermore , are we being told that pm cant beef his security on his own ? To make it more simple for all to understand , are we being told that when 2 people are competing for 10 votes and one has lost 7 votes , he still remains the most popular ? Are we being told that a borrowed support whose collateral were Kalonzo , Ruto , Balala and Mudavadi still remains the same when that colleteral is withdrawn . Am talking of VP Kalonzo because at the time he parted ways with merchants of deceit , he had actually contributed somehow to that support . <p> Yahala <p> Do you expect someone whose hands are wet with blood of innocent Kenyans in Nakuru/Naivasha/Kiambaa win someone whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead and He will become the 4th president of this country Godwilling . The day Raila will be sworn in as President is the day you will go psycho together with your " Masters of crimes against humanity " . <p> Central Imenti <p> How convenient there were no witnesses and Imanyara escaped without a scratch ? What influence does Imanyara have in central Kenya to warrant such interesting attention ? Surely there must be better ways of getting attention and portraying your opponents in bad light . Lets style up please . <p> scanfish <p> There is no way Imanyara could have been detained on Statehouse road long enough for the alleged incident to take place without the police being aware . Why ? Because Statehouse road is a high security zone due to its proximity to Statehouse , and any car that stops or stalls along that road for even 2 minutes is immediately accosted by police permanently stationed on that road and asked to move . The police even help you change your tyre if it is a puncture . <p> Obviously , Imanyara was not aware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , why did he wait a whole 24 hours to report the incident and complain in parliament to the Minister in charge of the police , when he could have gone to the very same police directly immediately he was released by the ' thugs ' ? These people should be arrested and charged with incitement and creating unnecessary tension . <p> Mkenya Mzalendo <p> " Let Members of Parliament make use of their armed bodyguards " , ( Orwa Ojonde , Assistant Minister for internal security on the floor of the house . ) Yes , tax payers are funding their armed bodyguards and they should spare us these antics . Pray , why would Uhuru resort to such acts over a light weight politician ? He would just give him some millions to sort his financial troubles ? Yes , use your armed bodyguards Mheshimiwa . <p> Jimoragen <p> we need to sober up , the history of political assasination is very fresh in the minds of most kenyans , that none of them has bn conclusively dealt with is indeed a worrying trend.GITOBU IMANYARA has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he s an issue oriented leader who can not be involved in faking such stupid thing for any cheap publicity.That you can sit and write useless things against Gitobu and the prime minister of the Republic of kenya is aclear testimony of the democratic space they have so far expanded by their sacrifices some who even perished .

He holds a BSc degree in Information Sciences from Moi University and is currently undertaking a Master of Arts degree in Communication Studies at the University of Nairobi . <p> In a civilized society this kind of comedy/jokes would never be entertained.Look at it this way-Midiwo being the government chief whip makes him a member of the government-In fact Kenya has no official opposition and so all mps are members of the ruling coalition.Next by virtual of his office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministries-effectively the head of all operations including those of police.Even sad that he and all political class enjoy inordinate level of security at the expense of all Kenyans even as poor Kenyans foot the bill.Pray-now how does the pm with all the security controlled by him- A person who has access to all matters security officially/unofficially fall victim to assassination plot via a meeting attended by " a member of security forces " ? In other words how does the pm tell Kenyans with a straight face that his own members of the government are out to kill him ? So Midiwo knows what the pm does not ? that Midiwo did not even care enough to " SHARE THE SECRET " with the pm even as they sat together before he rose to speak ? WOW ! What security do ordinary Kenyans have if the pm is not guaranteed of his even with all the BEEFY MEN TAKING CARE OF HIM ?

Have you spared a thought/prayer for them and their families-NO ! FOR THAT YOU BELONG TO POLITICAL GARBAGE CAN.The reaction by the pm is as childish as they come-HE SHOULD HAVE TOLD MIDIWO OFF RIGHT THERE-HE SHOULD HAVE REPLACED HIM AS WHIP BY NOW.We do not need such BS.To tell Kenyans " HE DOES NOT FEAR DEATH " is not **28;104;TOOLONG die everyday.It is not a choice when it happens.We have watched the story of a young girl fighting cancer with grace and courage that none of the politician talking about courage would muster.These are the real heroes.I know the groundwork is being laid to take us back to 2007 but if anyone thinks Kenyans are that stupid they will be shocked.Right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenyan only-THE YOUNG PATRIOT AT THE HELM OF ELECTORAL BODY.What he will announce will shock most and they had better come alive to the fact losing the elections is a reality.I want the losers to taste the defeat at 12.00 noon.Crying will not do.CJ Dr. MUTUNGA WILL NOT HAVE A SKIRT FOR YOU TO HIND UNDER.Get real . <p> Moderator <p> Sorry I have to strike you down from the forum .

Instead Ask WATENGULA what he knew before he was transfered from Forein Affairs . Stop dragging Ongeri into such nonsense . In 2007 , the Abagusii voted for both Raila and kibaki half and half . Yet some Abagusii were killed both in Kisumu , and RV . The kisiis were displaced from Kisumu and Luo Environs . I remember how the kisiis were escotted by police into Kisii police station in Droves around January/February 2008 after the alleged " stollen " elections . I remember how they had their houses , and property burned in Kisumu and the larger Luo area . But NONE , NONE of the Luos living in Kisii Land was harrased , and/or their property destroyed .

But they are also politicians and partisans beside involving themselves in some funny activities like the drug issue and the murdered AP , The turkana Boy incidence and many others . Why do nt they tell us who bombed the uhuru park prayer group . The police should us Midiwos information and tell us the truth .

@@1811236 <p> As a key importer and packer of grapes for Tesco , Richard Hochfeld Group ( RHG ) has used Marco ? s innovative Trac-IT Yield Control Module for six years to improve its pack house profitability . Since moving its grape packing facility last year , RHG has further improved yield control management with Marco ? s system , over pack has been reduced to virtually zero and packing capability has almost doubled in speed . The company ? s managing director Alan Guindi explains how that has been achieved and outlines the value the system could add to packing grapes at source for the UK market . <p> How does RHG use Marco ? s yield control system ? <p> " The system monitors and controls every punnet packed through the course of a production run and automatically regulates the amount of fruit packed so that the average across the entire run is as close to the required target as practically possible . <p> " The individual packers stand at a bespoke workstation complete with intelligent weighing equipment , and are controlled by a simple , language-transparent , traffic light system . When the pack is within fractions of a gram of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the punnets are at a satisfactory weight . If the packer removes an out of spec punnet they are locked out of the system until a supervisor ? unlocks ? to allow them to resume . This means the system is an extremely efficient way of monitoring and controlling packer performance and eliminating human error , whilst virtually eradicating giveaway from the packing process . " <p> Could this system benefit others looking to pack at source ? <p> " There could be huge gains for the entire supply chain if we could get suppliers using Marco ? s yield control system at source . In the southern hemisphere , packers will , as a matter of course , over pack by as much as 12% . Although it is largely an accepted part of the business , it is very damaging to profitability , especially when this giveaway is spread across hundreds of thousands of punnets . " <p> Minimising pack giveaway is paramount , but how about reducing waste ? <p> " Wastage is a significant issue ? one packer told us that they are losing the equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the manual packing process and many of those ? lost ? berries would have been well within acceptable specification . Where Marco ? s system would come into its own would be through what they describe as ' first fill feedback ' , which manipulates the pre-fillers to ensure they accurately control levels of waste . <p> " Using our own example , since we moved to our new facility , the giveaway we have achieved in runs of more than 500 boxes has been one berry per pack either way , which in real terms is zero as you can ? t put half a grape in a punnet . Waste very much depends on the quality of the fruit we ? re working with , of course , but there has been a noticeable sustained reduction . " <p> Does the yield control management system have any other knock on effects ? <p> " We have found that there is greater efficiency throughout the packhouse as the Marco system has effectively allowed us to pack at twice the speed using the same lines . That doesn ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are able to pack using far fewer packhouse hours than before , driving value into the service we provide for both our suppliers and customers . Packhouse costs are generally the most expensive part of the process , so any efficiencies you can introduce into the packing process have to be more than worthwhile . " <p> Why isn ? t everyone using Marco ? <p> " As with all innovations , there remains a need to convince people of the need to make the initial investment . Marco provides a trial process , which first works with a packer to measure existing overpack at the end of a line , then uses a demo workstation with Marco ? s yield control software installed to monitor the packing of 100 punnets or so . This simple process will give a clear before and after picture and a precise measurement of the weight saved . When multiplied by real volume and put into financial context , every packer would see the potential ROI ? the results are extremely persuasive . <p> " I ? ve already been singing the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murray Hilborne , md of Marco Ltd to see some of the bigger producers amongst our supply base in Chile . We saw them too late for them to implement anything before this season , but I know that two or three of them will look to introduce Marco products into their packhouses before next season . " <p> " For suppliers packing at source , the Marco Trac-IT module includes software that would provide detailed reports by email to RHG , with the documentation and data required to verify that punnets have been packed to tight customer specifications . The fruit has to be on-spec and packed in the proper manner , of course , but there should be no reason why the weights are not controlled . " <p> How does Marco compare with its competition ? <p> " I have seen lots of different systems around the world that attempt to optimise packing performance , but nothing quite like the Marco system . It is the design and the innovation that makes Marco stand out from the competition , as what they have come up with is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The yield control management system integrates seamlessly into the packing process and its simplicity means that anybody can use it with minimal training . <p> " Dealing with Murray and his team is a delight .
