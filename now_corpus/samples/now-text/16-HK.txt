But Gai Wu 's defence never cracked as effective gang-tackling prevented Valley from scoring any long tries . <p> Coady made the immediate impact on the scoreboard in the second half , crossing over for the first of two tries in the Grand Final after capitalizing on a good shove by the Valley pack deep in Falcons territory to give Valley its first lead of the match , 7-3 , in the 45th minute , after Milo 's conversion from the corner was successful . <p> Almost immediately Gai Wu was back on the march with Poon once again wreaking havoc with some incisive running right at the heart of Valley 's midfield defence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line to come off the far wing and collect a lovely switch pass from centre Ho Hoi Lam to catch the Valley defence flat-footed .

Captain Jen Mackay lead the breakout as she conjured up a great solo run from deep in her half to put Valley into attacking territory . <p> From there Valley 's veterans stood up to be counted .

Coady was named Woman of the Match for her efforts . <p> Valley 's win extended their unbeaten streak to 29 matches and two full seasons as they doubly defended their double from last season .

@@7768235 <h> Will it be ... but CY Leung for the next HK chief executive ? <p> Chief Executive Leung Chun-ying must be feeling a lot of stress these days . <p> His bosses in Beijing and allies in Hong Kong appear to be distancing themselves from him , which he could interpret as signals about his chances of winning a second term in the chief executive election in March next year . <p> The latest bombshell was dropped by Starry Lee , chairwoman of the Democratic Alliance for the Betterment and Progress of Hong Kong , the city 's flagship pro-Beijing political party , who announced her resignation as a member of Executive Council , Leung 's cabinet . <p> He appointed Ip Kwok-him , a veteran DAB politician , to replace Lee with immediate effect . <p> Lee may have her own reasons from quitting the cabinet . It 's understandable , for example , that as DAB head , she would not want to bind the party to the administration 's controversial policies . <p> But her resignation has raised speculation that she may be preparing to throw her hat into the ring , although it could be a little bit too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether she was resigning to prepare to run in next year 's election , Lee shook her head and said : " I think you 're thinking too much " . <p> Lee expressed the hope that everyone in Hong Kong , including the chief executive , would show some wisdom to solve problems and find a way out of the current deadlock on the various issues confronting Hong Kong . <p> Lee may not yet have any concrete plans to run for the highest office next year . But her response , including her entreaty for the chief executive " to find a way out of the current deadlock " , somehow betrays her discontent over how CY Leung is running things in the city . <p> That 's also a signal that the DAB will not always stand behind the chief executive -- at least until Beijing anoints its candidate for next year 's election . <p> DAB ca n't break its ties with the chief executive due to pressure from Beijing , and that is most likely the reason why the party sent Ip to replace Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is a member of the Legislative Council for the District Council ( First ) functional constituency , will have to retire from Legco because he did not run during last year 's district council election . <p> Ip 's appointment to the Executive Council may not have any significant impact on the DAB . <p> In fact , DAB is facing pressure from its supporters . The party has refused to clarify whether or not it would support Leung for a second term . Hong Kong people know that the DAB is just waiting for Beijing 's order . <p> However , Beijing wo n't tell them its decision until the nominating period starts later this year . <p> DAB 's Holden Chow lost in the Legco by-election last month mainly because of his reserved remarks when asked about Leung 's run for a second term . <p> His weak performance in several debates during the election campaign gave people the impression that his party is no more than a blind and deaf loyalist that is incapable of making its own decisions . <p> That helped in swaying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to swing to the pro-democracy camp . <p> Against such a backdrop , DAB members recently told media that the party could nominate its own candidate for the chief executive election . <p> That 's a solution tailored for the Legco election as the pan-democratic camp will most likely raise the issue during the campaign . <p> If that happens , DAB candidates can simply say that their party respond will support its own nominated candidate so they wo n't appear so helpless in the face of such a controversial topic . <p> In fact , the DAB , as the city 's biggest pro-Beijing party , has the responsibility to join the chief executive election . <p> Leung 's personality and hostile approach to governing Hong Kong have been a setback for both the pan-democrats and the pro-establishment camp . <p> His aggressive way of pushing controversial government policies , as well as his tendency to blow out of proportion the issues concerning the pro-democracy camp ( e.g. , describing as " riots " the Mong Kok protests in early February ) , showed his wrong perception of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his low approval rating of under 40 percent , according to the latest poll conducted by University of Hong Kong , and prompted the so-called silent majority to distance themselves from the pro-Beijing camp . <p> The results of last month 's Legco by-election , which showed localist candidate Edward Leung securing more than 15 percent of the votes , should put pressure on Beijing and its loyalists to change their ways . <p> Top leaders in Beijing should understand the real public sentiment in Hong Kong , rather than just listen to Leung and his allies . <p> The Communist Party 's main focus now is to prevent Leung 's poor performance from affecting the coming Legco elections . <p> That could be the reason why top leaders like Premier Li Keqiang and National People 's Congress head Zhang Dejiang softened their tone on the " protest " in Mong Kok , and expressed their sympathy to the issues faced by Hong Kong youngsters , rather than just labeling them as " rioters " . <p> Beijing 's softer tone indicates that the central government does n't recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be seen as the first sign of the top leaders ' lack of confidence in Leung . <p> So it 's no surprise that the DAB is holding its endorsement of Leung for a second term .

To officially abolish the chief executive 's power to appoint members to the governing bodies of all of our universities . <p> 2 . To increase the proportion of elected members representing teaching staff , research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tertiary institutions . <p> At present about 30 percent of the members of governing bodies of our eight universities are appointed by the chief executive . <p> However , for the Lingnan University and the Hong Kong Institute of Education , it is well over 50 percent . For some universities appointed members even account for 80 percent of their governing board . <p> There is basically no public or legislative oversight of the chief executive 's appointees to the governing bodies of universities . <p> As a result , CY Leung has continued to appoint controversial or unpopular figures such as Arthur Li Kwok-cheung to university councils as a form of " political reward " for his allies and supporters . <p> Only by restricting the chief executive 's power to appoint his own people to university governing bodies can we ensure the autonomy of the higher education sector . <p> On the other hand , it is also a pressing task to address the issue of low representation of teaching staff and students in the governing bodies of our universities .

@@9531230 <h> Missing the Mark ... The Importance of Trademark Registration in China <p> Apple has recently been involved in a few IP infringement cases in China that it has lost . Earlier this month , there was a case where sales of all models in Apple 's iPhone 6 series were to be suspended by the Beijing Municipal Bureau of Intellectual Properties due to alleged infringement of appearance design patent of Shenzhen Baili 's 100C model mobile phone . Earlier this year , Apple lost a trademark case with a Beijing company , Xintong Tiandi , a leather goods firm which used the word ' IPHONE ' on leather wallets . Some foreign companies are still under the assumption that because they have registered their trademark in the country of origin , it will be protected in China . This is not the case . China 's State Administration for Industry and Commerce ( AIC ) does not recognize trademark registrations overseas . <p> These sorts of IP disputes would be unthinkable in the West , but happen in China because of its ' first to file ' system . This is a system whereby the rights to a trademark are awarded to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use it , even if the trademark is already registered in other countries . This gives rise to the common problem of ' trademark squatting ' , where companies in China look out for well-known trademarks and register them before companies come and claim them . Many of these trademark squatters wait for these companies to enter the China market and sell the trademark to them . This happened to Tesla Motors , the American electronic automotive company , when it decided to enter China . A Guangzhou-based man had acquired the rights to the Tesla trademark in China in 2009 . <p> With this in mind , it is obvious that China 's IP legal environment is perilous to even the largest of foreign investors , and registering a trademark within China is of upmost importance . <h> Registration Process <p> A company must first check that no similar or identical trademarks exist or have already be registered in order to start procedures .

However , unique to China , these 45 classes are divided into further sub-classes . <p> Eligibility and completeness of the application will be overseen by the China Trademark Office . If the application is accepted , the AIC will issue a preliminary approval , and publish the trademark in the China Trademark Gazette , where other companies have the period of three months in which to oppose the registration of the trademark .

Without the protection of trademark , products sold in China will be left open to abuse or squatting .

For years , the People 's Republic has been engaged in frenzied damming of rivers and unbridled exploitation of mineral wealth on the resource-rich Tibetan Plateau . Now it is ramping up efforts to spur its bottled-water industry -- the world 's largest and fastest-growing -- to siphon off glacier water in the region . <p> Nearly three-quarters of the 18,000 high-altitude glaciers in the Great Himalayas are in Tibet , with the rest in India and its immediate neighborhood . The Tibetan glaciers , along with numerous mountain springs and lakes , supply water to Asia 's great rivers , from the Mekong and the Yangtze to the Indus and the Yellow . In fact , the Tibetan Plateau is the starting point of almost all of Asia 's major river systems . <p> By annexing Tibet , China changed Asia 's water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it builds dams that redirect trans-boundary riparian flows , thereby acquiring significant leverage over downriver countries . <p> But China is not motivated purely by strategic considerations .

@@14009234 <h> ESG investing in ... still in its infancy , says Fidelity <p> Despite a number of Asian institutional investors leading the way in environmental , social and governance ( ESG ) investing , Fidelity International ( Fidelity ) believes that the lack of regulation remains a major hurdle for Asian institutions in the area of ESG investing . <p> ESG investing is growing in popularity among institutional investors worldwide . According to news site Value Walk , ESG-based investing had grown from close to zero about a decade ago to about US$21 trillion in total AUM globally by the end of 2015 . <p> However , Daisy Ho , head of institutional business , Asia ex-Japan and managing director , Northeast Asia at Fidelity , tells Asia Asset Management that the Asian region still lags behind a number of European countries in terms of uptake , even though ESG has been around since 2006 . She adds that regulation and government policy -- which has driven or supported ESG adoption in other regions -- is lacking in Asia . <p> " Adoption can also be slow as institutional investors are taking their time to build familiarity with ESG investing and consider the options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investing ( SRI ) sits among their other investment objectives and constraints .

In contrast , an integrated approach to ESG investing has the potential to protect and enhance investment returns , " she explains . <p> Ms. Ho adds that ESG investing is still at an early stage among Asian institutional investors . Some investors are looking at ESG as an investment opportunity , focussing on its ability to generate alpha or enhance returns . So far , this has taken on the form of specific ESG mandate outsourcing . " While we 've seen some institutions in other regions such as Europe applying an SRI approach across their entire portfolio , it remains to be seen if this trend will play out the same way in Asia , " she says . <p> Encouragingly , a handful of Asian pensions are now warming up to ESG investing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking to invite bids for its first ESG mandate this year , and Malaysia 's Kumpulan Wang Persaraan ( Diperbadankan ) recently outsourced its ESG equity mandate . <p> Ms. Ho opines that the significance of corporate social responsibility to organisations and their ESG investment objectives are the major yardsticks for institutional investors in selecting external managers . " These will influence a number of decisions -- perhaps most importantly , whether they are seeking for their ESG portfolio to outperform a traditional benchmark through an ESG investment approach , or tracking an ESG benchmark as defined by third-party index providers , " she remarks . <p> Ms. Ho adds : " The UN Principles of Responsible Investment is a global initiative to encourage integration of ESG issues into investment decision-making and ownership practices by investment managers , and may be a useful reference to external manager selection .

But market cycles by their nature turn , and a difficult period for emerging markets could have set the scene for a recovery . <p> Following the small rate hike last year , the Federal Reserve seems content to keep US rates low , while the International Monetary Fund in April issued a global economic growth forecast of 3.2% in 2016 and 3.5% in 2017 .

@@14644237 The public will see through CY 's 6-page legal threat against Apple Daily <p> Nice of Apple Daily to publish in full the letter it received from C.Y.Leung 's lawyers . Very interesting reading . If you have just come in , what is going on here is that Apple Daily , a racy Hong Kong tabloid with pro-democracy inclinations , published an editorial urging newly elected legislators to investigate a deal under which Mr Leung was paid a large sum of money by an Australian company called UGL . One of the reasons why this was a good idea , the newspaper thought , was because it might avoid the prospect , which many Hong Kong people find appalling , of Mr Leung running for another term in his present post . <p> As it happens I am something of a connoisseur of threatening letters from lawyers . Many years ago , when I was running an investigative team for the Hong Kong Standard , it was decided that I should deal with all legal matters which came up , on the ( as it turned out ) pessimistic assumption that our investigative work would be responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Leung 's lawyers ' letter . <p> The first one is that it comes from Messrs Sit , Fung , Kwok and Shum . I presume they are a respectable firm , though not perhaps very experienced in this line of work . But Mr Leung does not need to resort to private lawyers , respectable or otherwise . Senior government officials who wish to sue for libel have to ask for permission ( which in the case of Mr Leung I suppose he can give himself ) and having obtained permission get the free services of the Department of Justice . Well we know Mr Leung is not short of a bob or two . But one does wonder why this particular chore was outsourced . Was the DoJ consulted , and discouraging ? <p> Messrs Sit , Fung , Kwok and Shum . <p> The second unusual feature of the letter is that it runs to six pages . The law of libel is very clear on one point . It is not up to the person defamed to prove that the article complained of is wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is up to the author/publisher to prove that it was justified ( which means true in lawyerspeak ) , or an expression of opinion protected by freedom of speech . Consequently letters complaining of defamation are commonly quite short . They identify the item complained of , point out that it is defamatory , and ask for a correction , apology , and money according to taste . Now observe the letter re Leung , which masochists can find here . <p> Normally I would expect the writer , having identified the item complained of and the meaning to which he objects , which is taken care of by the bottom of page 1 , to proceed directly to the paragraph at the bottom of page 6 , which begins " Mr Leung requires you to take the following steps immediately ... " Instead we get four pages of argument , buttressed by quotes from newspapers and Carrie Lam , apparently intended to convince the reader of Mr Leung 's transcendent innocence . Admittedly quite a lot of space is accounted for by the need to provide translations of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Leung , as I pointed out above , does not have to prove his innocence . The law assumes that . And printing this much material brings other hazards . <p> It is , for example , far from surprising that the whole letter is now in the public domain . In the old print days a long letter might have been a deterrent to reproduction , because it would have taken space . But on the internet space is free . Moreover having instructed lawyers to send it on his behalf Mr Leung can hardly complain if the recipient shows it to other people . Unfortunately the way the general public look at these things is often not the way lawyers look at them . Mr Leung 's lawyers may feel they have established his innocence beyond any possible doubt . The lay person may wonder how so much smoke could be generated without a fire somewhere . He may recall Hamlet ( " Methinks the lady doth protest too much " ) or Mandy Rice Davis ( " He would say that , would n't he " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct conclusion that in the matter of corruption Mr Leung is as pure as the driven snow , his reading may leave him with misgivings about other aspects of Mr Leung 's ethics . <p> Consider the explanation quoted from Ms Carrie Lam . Ms Lam says that when Mr Leung resigned from the company ( then called DTZ ) in 2011 there was a " resignation agreement " . The gist of this was that UGL -- which was buying DTZ -- would pay Mr Leung large sums over two years in return for which Mr Leung " would not move to a competitor , set up or promote any business in competition with DTZ , or poach any people from DTZ. " and Ms Lam goes on to say that this was " standard business practice " . Really ? You sell someone a business , and then you expect them to pay you extra for a promise not to compete or poach their staff ? Well this may be perfectly legal . But is it nice ? <p> Carrie Lam . Photo : GovHK . <p> Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Leung 's resignation from DTZ and conclusion of the agreement with UGL took place before he was elected as the CE , and at the material time , he had already resigned from Exco , " says Ms Lam . So the full story , it seems , goes like this . Mr Leung resigns from Exco because he wants to run for CE . He then resigns from DTZ . He then extracts a large sum of money from the buyers of DTZ in return for a promise that he will not compete with them . And while this extraction is taking place he is doing his best to get a well-paid full-time job as CE , which will effectively preclude both competition and staff poaching . <p> Did Mr Leung mention , while he was negotiating his resignation agreement , that he was contemplating a full-time career in public administration ? Well we can perhaps allow some latitude at that stage . After all the result of the election was not certain . If Henry Tang 's basement had not surfaced I suppose Mr Leung might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But having been elected he was still receiving payments from the resignation deal , even though he was at this stage clearly in no position to either compete or poach . Does this count as honest in business circles ? <p> Photo : Tom Grundy , HKFP . <p> Then we come to the question of declaring an interest . Ms Lam 's take on this is that " Mr Leung has not provided any service to UGL since signing the resignation agreement . " Ms Lam did not say in so many words that Mr Leung had declared , or not declared an interest , but apparently intended her listeners to infer from the fact that Mr Leung had not performed any service that there was no interest to declare . But this clearly will not do . As the Prevention of Bribery Ordinance makes clear , one may be paid to do something or one may be paid not to do something . It appears that during the first two years of his term Mr Leung was receiving money in consideration of his not competing with UGL or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose there was any serious danger of this affecting the discharge of his duties . But it was clearly an interest and if the rules really did not require its disclosure then the rules should be changed . In the meantime one must have doubts about Mr Leung 's judgement in the matter . If he had explained the whole thing years ago , before it became journalism fodder , it would have saved us all a lot of trouble . <p> Finally Mr Leung 's lawyers complain that the intention of the article complained of is to deprive him of " his fundamental right ... to stand for the 2017 CE election " . This is an unfortunate inspiration . Mr Leung 's administration does not appear to believe in a fundamental right to stand for election , at least if you have views it disagrees with . Also this is based on a misunderstanding . The election is not an election . It is fixed . Consequently nothing that Apple Daily says about Mr Leung can affect his chances , which appear to be quite good , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his name . <h> Donate <h> Advertise with us <h> What is Hong Kong Free Press ? <p> Hong Kong Free Press is a non-profit English language news source seeking to unite critical voices .

Recently , Stand News reported that negotiations have reached an impasse , with workers pushing for an increase to $36 -- $41 , while employers have expressed opposition to anything more than a 50 cent rise . The current minimum wage is $32.50 per hour , a rate which took effect in May 2015 . <p> The fact that employers are " nickel-and-diming " ( quite literally so ! ) over a half dollar rise is not only ludicrous but also puts this city 's reputation to shame .

Even so , and despite its business-friendly reputation , Singapore still trumps Hong Kong in workers ' rights and benefits : 16 weeks of maternity leave compared to the HKSAR 's stingy 10 , and a pension scheme that actually works , with meaningful employers ' contributions and guaranteed rates of return . <p> For Hong Kong ( at 19.8% ) to match the average share of the minimum wage in GDP per capita among its Asian peers ( 38.8% ) , the minimum wage needs to be raised to $63.8 per hour . <p> One may object to that calculation on the grounds that developing countries such as Myanmar , Vietnam , Bhutan , and Mongolia were thrown into the mix , possibly skewing the results with dubious data . Let 's see how Hong Kong stacks up against a wider pool of affluent economies around the world in this second graph : <p> Photo : Frank Siu . <p> If Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage needs to be raised further to $67.8 per hour . The average ratio across these developed markets is 41.9% and appears to be quite consistent . ( Note that all the Scandinavian economies are absent ; they boast some of the most progressive labour laws but do not explicitly enforce a minimum wage . ) <p> Instead of playing catch-up , can Hong Kong do better ? Talk of a minimum wage is outdated ; a far more progressive concept debated these days is the " living wage " , broadly defined as the minimum income necessary for a worker to maintain a decent , respectable standard of living . In addition to basic requirements like food , shelter , and clothing , the living wage also takes into account costs from healthcare , basic leisure/recreation , continuing education , childcare , and so forth . Very few places around the world have a legally-mandated living wage . Compliance is almost always voluntary , but a growing number of socially-responsible businesses nonetheless pride themselves on paying a living wage , with numerous studies having shown that adoption leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall improved " employee engagement " , as the business-savvy types like to say . <p> File photo : HKFP . <p> Needless to say , estimating the living wage is a far more subjective and complicated calculation than determining an appropriate minimum wage , with a sufficiently rigorous analysis being far beyond the scope of this short text . As a very general rule of thumb , living wage activists often suggest using the local poverty line for a family of four as a proxy for the living wage for a single worker . In Hong Kong , that figure is $16,400 per month . Assuming a 40-hour work week , that would mean a living wage of $94.6 per hour . <p> Government-sponsored ads throughout the city tout Hong Kong as " Asia 's World City " . If Hong Kong is to live up to that slogan , it needs to keep up with the rest of the world and adopt labour laws befitting the city 's wealth . Doubling the minimum wage -- not squabbling over 50 cents -- would be a welcome and most laudable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competitiveness . 3 of the top 5 countries on the Index of Economic Freedom have some of the highest minimum wage rates in the world , alongside stringent legislation truly designed to protect the working class . <p> A firm commitment from GovHK to materially raise the minimum wage , implemented on a fixed and non-negotiable timetable with a gradual phase-in period , will enable the economy to equilibrate to this " new normal " . What 's more , the transition need not be marked by waves of lay-offs ; landlords are shrewd capitalists and will gradually reduce rents , understanding that the days of lining their pockets with astronomical rents are over . As for those who purchased commercial properties at hundreds of millions for shoebox-sized storefronts , blindly hoping that droves of Chinese tourists will continue to pump up rents , well , those were silly investments to begin with , so let them go bust .

@@14766240 <h> EU- Vietnam Free ... Agreement -- Market Access Opportunity . <h> Legal News &amp; Analysis - Asia Pacific - Vietnam - International Trade <p> 8 October , 2016 <p> On 02 December 2015 , after nearly 3 years with 14 rounds of negotiations , the Minister of Industry and Trade of Vietnam , H.E . Vu Huy Hoang and the European Commissioner for Trade , H.E . Cecilia Malmstr ? m have signed the Vietnam-EU Free Trade Agreement ( FTA ) . Both parties will finalize the ratification process as soon as possible for the FTA to take effect from the beginning of 2018 . <p> The FTA is considered one of the most comprehensive and ambitious trade and investment agreements that the EU has ever concluded with a developing country . It is the second agreement in the ASEAN region after Singapore and it will intensify the bilateral relations between Vietnam and the EU . Vietnam will have access to a potential market of 500 million people and a total GDP of USD15,000 billion ( accounting for 22% of the global GDP ) . The other way around , exporters and investors from EU have further opportunities to access one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ region . <p> The real wages of skilled laborers may increase by up to 12% while real salary of common workers may rise by 13% . The macro economy will be stable and inflation rate is controlled . Vietnam 's business activities will be booming in the next few years once the EU- Vietnam FTA officially comes into force and Government 's policies as well as institutional reforms start showing their positive effects . <p> Vietnam 's GDP is expected to increase by 0.5% annually ; increase in exports is 4-6% per year . If this trend continues until 2020 , Vietnam 's exports to EU will increase by USD 16 billion . Until 2025 , the FTA is estimated to generate an additional 7-8% of GDP above the trend growth rate . <p> Market access for goods <p> Nearly all customs duties -- over 99% of the tariff lines will be eliminated . The small remaining number is partially liberalized though tariff tare quotas . As Vietnam is a developing country , it will liberalize 65% of import duties on EU exports to Vietnam at entry into force and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . For some products , EU duties will be eliminated over a seven-year period such as motorcycles with engines larger than 150 cc , car parts , about half of EU pharmaceutical exports . The market will be opened for most of EU food products , i.e. wine , spirits and frozen pork meat after seven years and for dairy products after a maximum of five years . This is unprecedented far-reaching tariff elimination for a country like Vietnam , proving its targets of deeper integration and trading relations with the EU . <p> From the EU side , it agrees to eliminate duties for 85% of the tariff lines for goods imported from Vietnam immediately at the entry into force of the FTA . Within 7 years from the effective date of the FTA , there is more than 99% of the tariff lines being eliminated for Vietnam . The EU will eliminate duties for some sensitive products in the textile and footwear sector over a 5-7-year period , with a fabric-forward rule ( instead of a strict yarn-forward rule as in the TPP ) and allowing Vietnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offers access to some Vietnamese sensitive agricultural products via tariff rate quotas ( TRQs ) , in addition to a number of main Vietnamese exports such as mobile phones , computer accessories , and sport shoes . Vietnamese exports of textile , clothing and footwear to the EU are expected to more than double in 2020 as a result of the FTA . <p> We note that besides Vietnam in the region , Singapore also concluded an FTA with the EU in 2014 . However , this does not affect the competitiveness of Vietnam in trading with the EU . This is due to the fact that Vietnam mainly exports textiles , footwear , agricultural products , etc. while Singapore 's main exports are machines , chemical products and transport equipment . Moreover , while the EU is accelerating procedures to negotiate FTAs with different countries in the ASEAN region , Vietnam should take advantage of this golden time before FTAs with others in the region are concluded and become effective . <p> Market access for EU service providers <p> Although Vietnam 's WTO commitments are used as a basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vietnam has not only opened additional ( sub ) sectors for EU service providers but also commits deeper than in the WTO , offering its EU partners best possible access to Vietnam 's market . ( Sub ) sectors that are not committed under the WTO but under which Vietnam makes commitments are , for example : Interdisciplinary R&amp;D services ; Nursing services , physiotherapists and para-medical personnel ; Packaging services ; Trade fairs and exhibitions services ; Building-cleaning services . Moreover , it is noteworthy that the FTA contains a provision that allows one party to grant the other party the best treatment that the former is negotiating with other partners under other framework ( for example , TPP , Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership , Vietnam -- European Free Trade Association ) on 17 July 2015 . <p> We set out below certain Vietnam 's commitments in key sectors with reference to its commitment in the WTO . <p> Distribution sector <p> WTO requires an Economic Needs Test ( ENT ) for establishment of outlets for retail services ( beyond the first one ) . EVFTA requires the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abolishment . <p> Processed oil and crude oil by foreign investors are still prohibited . <p> WTO <p> EVFTA <p> The establishment of outlets for retail services ( beyond the first one ) shall be allowed on the basis of an Economic Needs Test ( ENT ) <p> In case of establishing an outlet less than 500m2within the area planned for trading activities and already completed construction of infrastructure , ENT is not required . <p> 5 years from the date of entry into force of the Agreement , the requirement of the ENT will be abolished . <p> Power/ Energy <p> WTO <p> EVFTA <p> N/A <p> Commitments are made in 3 sub-sectors : ( i ) Production of electricity ; transmission and distribution of electricity on own account ; ( ii ) Manufacture of gas ; distribution of gaseous fuels through mains on own account ; and ( iii ) Production of steam and hot water ; distribution of steam and hot water on own account . <p> Non facilities-based services : WTO/ AFAS : maximum 65% foreign ownership forever but in the EVFTA after 5 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Private Network ( VPN ) : maximum 70% foreign ownership forever but in the EVFTA after 5 years , this could be 75% . <p> Conclusion <p> Vietnam is a country of changes and currently offering increasing opportunities for foreign businesses .

It is now exactly time for foreign investors to start their business plans and grasp the upcoming clear opportunities .

@@16068238 <h> China 's toxic ... <p> Vast areas of China have been hit by the most severe air pollution of the year . The onset of winter , with a sharp rise in coal usage , poses a major health hazard to Chinese people especially in the northern half of the country . Over 60 cities , home to 460 million people , have been enveloped in dense smog in the past week . This has been dubbed ' airpocalypse ' by Western media . <p> Beijing and 23 other Chinese cities have declared ' red alerts ' in the past week , the highest state of alert on a 4-level warning system first introduced in 2014 . Under a ' red alert ' , city authorities close schools , traffic , and factories , and order the public to avoid going outdoors as much as possible . The smog levels in these areas are up to 20 times higher than the World Health Organisation 's ( WHO ) safety guidelines . <p> In the past week , readings of PM2.5 -- dangerous small dust particles -- exceeded 500 micrograms per cubic metre in some parts of Beijing . The WHO says the levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public safety . <p> The social and economic effects of such extreme pollution are huge . Hospitals have been inundated with patients suffering breathing problems , highways have been closed , and hundreds of flights have been cancelled . At Beijing airport , one in three flights have been cancelled due to the smog . There are reports of tens of thousands of " air refugees " fleeing the polluted cities for cleaner air in southern provinces like Hainan and Yunnan . Sales of facemasks , air purification filters and other anti-smog gadgets have boomed in the past week -- with supplies having sold out in some cities . <p> The massive smog cloud coincides with renewed health warnings from scientists . Air pollution may be the cause of one in three deaths in China , according to researchers at Nanjing University . This makes " everyday life about as deadly as smoking cigarettes in some parts of the country " says Time magazine . The study conducted in 74 Chinese cities found that 31.8 percent of deaths in 2013 could be linked to smog . <p> Smog in Harbin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dictatorship the smog crisis is a potential political crisis . When tens of millions of people and especially children , in a country where most families have only one child , are subjected to toxic air , which is the equivalent to smoking cigarettes , there is widespread scepticism towards the authorities and their ability to solve the problem . Statements from officialdom are widely distrusted . Many were outraged by the recent decision of the Beijing municipal government , as reported on its website , to classify the city 's smog problem as a " natural disaster " . This was seen as yet another official attempt to escape responsibility for the calamity . <p> In 2014 , the central government announced a " war on pollution " to little visible effect . New pollution records have been broken since then -- as is the case this week , with a record number of cities declaring ' red alerts ' . China spends more on renewable energy than any other country -- with 2.5 trillion yuan ( US$360 billion ) earmarked to be spent under the five year plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2011-15 period . The target is for 27 percent of electricity generation to come from renewables in 2020 . <p> But the lack of any coordination and democratic control over these investments -- resources and investment decisions are hijacked by regional bureaucracies in league with capitalist business interests -- means that China 's green investment is often self-defeating . Dense smog during winter knocks out production at many of China 's vast solar farms . Scientists warn that gigantic wind farms built in some northern regions are also exacerbating the smog disaster by reducing air circulation that disperses the smog . <p> New research has also shown that the government 's temporary measures to clean up pollution in advance of major events such as the 2008 Beijing Olympics or this year 's G20 summit in Hangzhou , actually cause greater long-term damage to air quality . <p> Smog protesters put facemasks on statues in Beijing zoo . <p> Back to coal <p> The biggest factor behind the latest smog outbreak seems to be the dramatic increase in coal usage this year : at power stations , heavy industry and during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is a result of government stimulus measures and a market pick-up following on the heels of the frenzied housing bubble in big cities . <p> " Unfortunately , over the past nine months , government economic policies shifted toward stimulating some of the heavy industry sectors that are responsible for the heavy pollution in Beijing , " said Greenpeace 's senior global coal campaigner , Lauri Myllyvirta . <p> In the first ten months of the year , coal production fell 10.7 percent from the 2015 level , but this has driven up coal prices by 80 percent , says a report by Goldman Sachs . The rebound in coal prices prompted the government to lift its production curbs , which in turn has led to a 9 percent increase in coal output in November over October . <p> Rather than fight pollution , the dictatorship is often more concerned about crushing protests against pollution .

This marked an " unusual coincidence of small-scale protests " noted the BBC 's reporter . Much larger protests -- numbers tens of thousands in some cases -- have broken out in cities across China against plans to construct high-polluting chemical plants . This was the case in Qianjiang city , in Hubei province , against a Russian-built pesticide factory in June .

The pollution crisis can only be ended through a genuinely democratic political system , and that 's not the case in the corporate-dictated ' democracies ' of the older capitalist states . The crisis is global , and can only be solved by global solidarity and action which capitalism is not capable of . <p> chinaworker.info fights for the freedom to organise and full democratic rights , but also for democratic control and public ownership of the big companies and financial institutions and a socialist plan to save the planet .
