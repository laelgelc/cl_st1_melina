I did a foundation course in fashion in Seneca College of Arts , Toronto , Canada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Merchandising in Central Saint Martins and did a few technical courses in London College of Fashion . Right now I retail out of my Studio on TTK Road but shortly I will be opening my own store in Hotel Park Sheraton . <p> What 's your forte ? <p> I design Bridal , Indian , western , club and cocktail wear plus Indo-western fusion pieces . My speciality is evening gowns and fusion pieces where I can combine my Indian and western sensibilities as well as customised bridal wear . My clothes are priced between Rs. 1000 and Rs. 50 000 . My clients range from 20 to 60 years of age . Soon I would like to do men 's wear and children 's wear as well ... I will be retailing accessories as well from my new store . <p> On Chennai as a fashion hub ... <p> Well , Chennai was chosen as the venue for India 's first International Fashion event . That explains it all . There are a lot of designers in the city today . Chennai is a growing fashion hub and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasingly fashion conscious . I think I have managed to carve a niche for myself . <p> How do you go about designing the clothes ? <p> I source my materials from all over India like Bangalore , Calcutta and Varanasi and if my clients want imported materials then I also source them from abroad . <p> The amount of time I take depends on the kind of outfits . It could take anything between three days for simple dresses to three months for exclusive bridal wear . <p> As a designer I do give suggestions to my customers . If I think something might not suit them then I suggest alternative patterns and designs for them . <p> What are you currently working on ? <p> I am working on my new line for Spring-Summer 2010 titled ' La Belle Epoch -- an art nouveau ' , an inspired collection which was showcased at the Chennai International Fashion Week . I am also currently designing for a Tamil film that 's due for release in April . <p> As a designer , how do you keep yourself updated ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following all the Fashion Weeks both Indian and international .

It is just a few days sail from major U.S. refining and transport hubs on the Gulf Coast . <p> The Caribbean is growing more important as an oil trading center with the emergence of a possible new sour crude benchmark in the Argus Sour Crude Index .

But with little of its own production in the region it may be some time until the PetroChina plays a bigger role in regional crude markets . <p> " Without equity crude it would not make business sense to use the terminal as a crude oil staging point ... the margins would be minimal , " said Sarah Emerson , director of Energy Security Analysis Inc in Boston . <p> However , PetroChina is among the companies interested in Venezuela 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crude oil production in the Caribbean basin toward the end of the decade . <p> The widening of the Panama Canal later this decade will also alter the dynamics of the Caribbean market , making it more responsive to market forces in the Pacific . <p> The $5.25 billion expansion of the Panama Canal will allow the waterway to handle Suezmax ships , which can carry up to 1 million barrels of crude , when completed in 2014 . It is expected to open up new trade flows for crude oil shipments from West Africa and bolster the role of Caribbean storage in the portfolio of global oil traders . <p> " With the canal expansion you 'll have options to deliver to a lot of places .

Tested against the closest to direct competitor that it will ever have , the Canon EOS 1D Mark IV and the last full-frame camera that Canon released , the EOS 5D mark II , the Nikon D3S left no one wondering who is the real Lord of the Darkness . <p> What 's interesting to note is that despite being more than a year old and considerably cheaper , the full-frame Canon 5D mark II still performs better than the APS-H 1D Mark IV at both higher and lower ISO . Of course it 's actually making the photo that matters to 1D Mark IV potential owners and things like sturdy weather-sealed body , continues rate shooting speed and focus accuracy are enough to justify its price tag . <p> Back to the original topic I have to say that the Nikon D3S once again shows that its photos , shot at ISO lower than 51200 are perfectly usable for virtually anything .

Ovi Maps has global coverage , with 74 countries covered by its navigation services . Maps for all regions will be available , for free , for loading over the air or pre-loading via a desktop computer . Traffic information and city guides , from Lonely Planet and Michelin , will also be made available at no extra cost . There 's an initial set of devices , in terms of availability , with more compatible devices to follow .

It will give its phones a significant differentiator on shop shelves and has long term strategic implications for the future of location services . Read on for further details and analysis . <p> The announcement should help Nokia sell more phones because it means every Nokia Symbian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Comes with Navigation ' , without adding any extra ( visible ) cost . Providing free , voice-guided , turn-by-turn navigation , traffic information and travel guide functionality with global coverage is a very significant consumer draw , which other manufacturers will find difficult to match . <p> Previously Nokia was charging around ? 50 per region for one year of car navigation , and a further ? 16 for traffic information . Regular travellers were able to take advantage of short term licenses ( typically ? 1.50 for a day or ? 6.00 for a week ) , but such costs could add up quickly , potentially costing several hundred pounds . <p> With ever increasing numbers of phone having integrated GPS , products from Tom Tom , Garmin and other stand-alone PND manufacturers were already in decline and this announcement is likely to hasten this trend .

It quotes figures from research firm Canalys that suggest there were approximately 27 million people using GPS navigation on their mobile phones . With today 's announcement , Nokia estimate that the potential size of this install user base grows ' overnight ' to almost 50 million people . Canalys figures suggest that in 2009 the install base of smartphones with integrated GPS was 163 million , of which Nokia accounted for 51% , having shipped a total of 83 million GPS-equipped devices .

Put the two together , make it free , make it global and you have something that is truly useful and can help you get round almost any city in the world whether you 're on foot or driving . " <p> " This is a game changing move . By leveraging our NAVTEQ acquisition we can now put a complete navigation system in the palm of your hand , wherever in the world you are , whenever you need it - and at no extra cost , " continued Anssi Vanjoki .

Pedestrian navigation is via on-screen prompts and a breadcrumb trail , which shows you where you have been and where you are going . <p> No hidden costs - all navigation , traffic information and travel guide information is free of charge for the lifetime of the smartphone . Although it should be noted that you may be charged for any data usage by your operator . <p> Hybrid technology - Maps and navigation routes can be downloaded over the air . However , maps can also be side-loaded via a PC and the navigation system still works even if there 's no online connection ( good for areas of low signal coverage o r when roaming ) . The maps are vector-based , which are less data intensive than bitmap-based maps typically used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functionality includes : maps for 180 countries with 2D and 3D maps , satellite and terrain maps , saving of favourites and routes , powerful postcode-level search and points of interest database , context sensitive weather and local event information , and editorial travel content for more than 1,000 destinations with listings for sights , restaurants , hotels and more from Lonely Planet and Michelin . <p> Social sharing - Nokia 's Lifecasting concept , which was previously available as a stand alone beta , has been added to the new version of Ovi Maps . It allows you share your current location , status and photos direct to Facebook . <p> Social sharing from the homescreen ( also available within Ovi Maps ) . <p> Status updates , with optional location information and attached photos , are sent directly to Facebook . <h> Download and compatible devices <p> The new version of Ovi Maps ( 3.3 ) is available to download from nokia.com/maps . <p> Further devices will follow over the next few weeks and months , following testing and customisation .

Additional maps can , of course , be side-loaded via Nokia Map Updater/Loader on both Windows and Mac desktops . <h> Strategic implications ( or Ovi Maps ecosystem is a ' chicken ' for LBS ) <p> Nokia 's decision to make Ovi Maps free for consumer usage it is also a major strategic move against Google 's ( and , to a lesser extent Microsoft 's ) mapping services and products .

However , the PC will likely be only a bit part player , the real action will be happening on mobile devices . <p> Google has developed a number of its own mobile services ( Latitude , Layers ) on top of its basic mapping product and more are likely to follow . Nokia is a step ahead of Google in building an open ecosystem around its mapping services . The flexible and technically sophisticated ' apps on maps ' platform ( Ovi Developer SDK ) , which is built on web technologies and allows third party developers ( e.g. Ground Guidance ) to build apps and services on top of Ovi Maps ( both inside and outside the Ovi Maps mobile application ) , has been under development for the last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next major Ovi Maps update . <p> In giving away navigation services to consumers , Nokia will be giving up substantial revenue potential .

This user base will make the Ovi Maps platform look very attractive to any developer looking to build contextual , location aware services or applications . Furthermore , consumer GPS navigation revenue looks very small next to located-based service revenue as a whole . Thus the announcement might be seen as the first move in the race to next generation of the location based service revenue . <p> Location-based services have been ' the next big thing ' in mobile for the last ten years .

@@1357236 <p> Bhopal : The diffusion of Indian literary wisdom through the Arabic monumental works , " Kalilah wa Dimnah " and " The Arabian Nights " was not confined to the Arab world alone .

In view of the great impact it has exerted on European writers , Prof. Louis Massignon ( July 25 , 1883 -- October 31 , 1962 ) , a French scholar of Islam and its history , has rightly observed that it quickened the mentality of Europe which the Greek and Roman fables had made dull and languid . <p> When modern writers of the East in general and those of Egypt and Syria in particular , started studying and borrowing new Western ideas and literary forms , it was to a great extent the old Indo-Perso-Arabian wine in new European bottles . <p> The above observations were made by Prof. Abdul Ali of Aligarh Muslim University while delivering his keynote address in the three-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which concluded here in Bhopal recently .

The original Sanskrit work , now lost , was a mixture of Sanskrit prose and stanzas of verse . It was written by a learned Brahmin named Vishnusarman in the 4th century in Kashmir . <p> Two hundred years later this book , he said , was first translated into Pahlavi ( old Persian ) by Burzoe at the instance of the Sassanid king Khusraw Anushirwan ( 531-579 AD ) , who is said to have taken keen interest in Indian literature and science .

" Dimnah " is depicted as cunning , shrewd , jealous and evil while " Kalilah " is portrayed goody-goody This Arabic version of the book has got a special significance in the sense that the Persian rendering of it was also lost , as was the Sanskrit original . <p> The Arabic version , therefore , became not only one of the earliest secular prose works in Arabic , but also the basis of existing translations into the major languages of the world including , besides European tongues , Hebrew , Turkish , Ethiopic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

The renowned French writer Jean de La Fontaine ( 1621-95 AD ) clearly admitted to having been greatly influenced by the stories of " Kalilah wa Dimnah " .

Taking into account the typical character of Maqamat literature , it must be accepted that no genuine historian would have preferred it for narrative purpose . Sir Denison Ross wrote " It is a fact that Nasrullah 's text abounds in Arabic quotations , but otherwise the style and language are exceedingly simple while Kashif 's text furnished an example of that rhetorical hyperbole and exaggerated metaphor which though giving much pleasure to those who enjoy linguistic gymnastics and furnishing an admirable text books for students of Persian language , is wearisome in the extreme for those who merely wish to read the stories for their own sake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " in Arabic and Persian are available and after an analytical study of these versions it can safely be said that the stories have been transferred from one book to another in such a manner that despite their uniformity in type they are different in style of presentation .

@@1361230 <h> Mumbai a Global City ? Not in this lifetime ! <p> I 've put to bed my absurd fantasy that Mumbai will become a ' Global City ' by the year 2020 . Maybe , hopefully , probably , one day . But not any time soon . <p> After three years of watching things improve incrementally , at a snail 's pace , only to be hampered by inevitable setbacks , my delusion has been replaced by disillusionment . <p> I recently spoke to a New Yorker friend , who had visited the city on business . In the weeks leading up to his trip , I responded to his requests for advice with a glowing testimonial . " Mumbai is a top ten global finance centre . It 's an international media and entertainment hub , more like New York than an Indian city . It 's Singapore with freedom . Paris of the East . Dare I say it , the next Hong Kong , " I had gushed . <p> After two days here , he shot me a strongly worded e-mail . " Dude , you said Mumbai was like New York . It 's not at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is laughably bad . I almost fell into an open man-hole today , in one of the nicest parts of town . " <p> He finished dramatically , with this send-off , " It 's less like New York and more like a bigger , dirtier Bangkok , without women in the windows . " <p> Ouch . <p> For the past two or three years , both the international and domestic media have repeated the following story ad nauseam , the crux of which goes : Indians living and working in the West are moving home in droves , because Mumbai , Delhi and Bengaluru now offer the same cushy lifestyle they enjoyed in San Francisco , New York and London . <p> But no matter how swanky the high-rises , or how expensive the boutique clothing stores , just outside is sure to be evidence of shocking poverty and glaring infrastructural deficiencies . Not to mention the unavoidable traffic . Oh , that traffic ? <p> I hate to keep harping on it , really . But today I traveled 60 miles -- from the northern suburb of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahim in central Mumbai , to Andheri ? in approximately five hours . Considering that I took the highway in the morning , along with the much ballyhooed Bandra Worli Sea Link ( the city 's newest coastal bridge ) , I can only call this paltry pace pathetic . To the best of my knowledge , there were no accidents blocking lanes of traffic . No VVIPs passing through the city . No extra nakabandis ( roadside vehicular security checks ) for beefed-up security . In short , no possible explanation , other than too many cars and too little road space . <p> It was n't exactly a pleasant or scenic trip , either . Innumerable buses and trucks belched gallons of bluish-black smog from their dubious exhaust systems , up into the hazy gray cloud that perpetually hangs over the city . <p> Two-wheelers squeezed into impossibly tight openings , with their big rig horns blaring and handle-bars intruding into my open taxi window . A wailing ambulance was hopelessly stuck at a single intersection for ten minutes , as others outmaneuvered the cumbersome vehicle , gaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passenger be damned . <p> People threw empty soda bottles and packets of chips from moving vehicles . Each and every road was uneven and riddled with pot-holes . Men relieved themselves in full view of hundreds of passersby . It was like one giant game of Tetris , played in hell . <p> Also , being a foreigner , every day I 'm confronted by the same set of squalid characters : Beggars thrusting babies into open windows , children singing Jingle Bells while grabbing at my shirt . Hijras clapping and carrying on . Hawkers pushing xeroxed copies of novels I 've read months ago . Some guy with children 's colouring books , though I 'm 25 and have no obvious need or want for what he 's selling . <p> So I refuse -- first politely , later sternly -- every single day .

Please have patience , ' and so on . No matter what time of day or night I pass this construction site , I 've yet to see actual work being done . My patience has worn thin . <p> And for nearly two years , JP Road , one of Andheri 's main arteries , has been completely clogged , owing to the Metro 's construction . As they 've progressively widened the construction site and narrowed the road , it 's now actually quicker to walk a half mile stretch than to drive . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Mumbai 's suburbs . I have my doubts . But to have restricted traffic by about 50 per cent for God-Knows-How-Long , it better be the greatest public transportation device since the wheel . <p> I can not imagine this sort of dilly-dallying being accepted by Americans . Heads would roll . But here it 's as if everyone is resigned to inefficient and corrupt governance . The contempt of authorities for the public at large is almost palpable . Everyone jokes how the municipal corporation is easily the world 's biggest wastrel . But no one seems prepared or capable to do anything about it . How did these guys get so autocratic ? Is n't India a representative republic ? Can nothing be done at the ballot box ? <p> Argh . <p> I love this city . And I love its people . But the complete lack of civic sense has me scaling down earlier projections for an ' International Mumbai ' . I recently saw a doting woman , almost cliched in her stereotypical Indian motherliness , carefully and delicately wipe her son 's cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately toss the napkin over her shoulder and onto the pavement . As she strode off , son wrapped protectively under her arm , the napkin fluttered into the street , eventually joining a heap of sopping wet refuse in the gutter . <p> Unfortunately , her behaviour is not the exception . This is the prevailing attitude of Mumbaikars . " Everyone else is out for themselves and for their family . Screw it . I 'll do the same . " And so the vicious cycle repeats . <p> Yet people believe this city will some day soon be another New York or London ? <p> Not in this lifetime . <p> Matthew Schneeberger is a feature writer at rediff.com and a native of Cleveland , Ohio .

@@1375238 <h> When mp3 Saved The Day <p> Last weekend , I did something that is totally at odds with what Download Central is supposed to do . Instead of sitting at my computer and scouring the Internet for downloads or streams of new music , I actually went out and watched a rock band performing live . The gig was at Delhi 's kitschy Hard Rock Caf ? ( but then are n't all HRCs meant to be kitschy ? ) and the band was Hurricane Bells who hail from Brooklyn , New York . <p> SOUND CHECK New York-based band Hurricane Bells played at The Hard Rock Cafe in Delhi last week <p> It was a big mistake going for the show . No , I do n't mean the band play bad music . They do n't . In fact , they 're quite good . Before going I 'd heard five tracks from their only album , Tonight Is The Ghost , and had particularly liked a couple of them , notably , The Cold Has Killed Us , and was looking forward to seeing them . As it happened , the band played several songs , including The Cold Has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his favourites . <p> Then why did I regret going for the show ? It was because the acoustics at the venue were abysmal . I do n't know who did the sound but standing there with a gaggle of people , the music sounded unsharp and muddy . Schiltz plays a mean guitar and switches quickly back and forth between songs from his electric one to an amped-up acoustic ; the band 's drummer is obviously talented ; and so is the bassist . Yet , their sound came through as blurred and underwhelming . <p> I left the concert and heard Tonight Is the Ghost on my iPod . The mp3s sounded many times better than the live sound at the Hard Rock Caf ? . Pity , because Hurricane Bells are a band that 's fun . It 's actually a new project from Steve Schiltz , frontman , guitarist and singer of the indie rock band , Longwave , a heavy guitar-based outfit that has been around for more than a decade . <p> Hurricane Bells have a much mellower , moody sound and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guitar on the album is more muted but live at the HRC , despite the disastrous acoustics , you could get a sense of his screaming potential . <p> The Hurricane Bells also played at another venue in Delhi . I 'm not sure how it went there as I could n't risk wasting another night listening to good music slaughtered by bad audio arrangement . Instead , I spent that evening listening to Longwave 's 2008 album , Secrets Are Sinister . I 'd read mixed reviews for this album . PopMatters had praised their robust sound but the ultra hip Pitchfork had called it a lame album , virtually saying that it aped super-rockers , U2 , and gave it a miserly 4.8 ( on 10 ) . After listening to the album , I have my own take on Longwave . I think they deliver an enticing brand of no-nonsense rock with solid bass-lines , screaming guitars and nice vocals . You can check them out at their website . Sure , the guitars are mixed a bit high and you can hear a bit of U2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences , but what 's bad about that ? <p> I do like experimenting with new music ( if you happen to have read this column before that is no secret ! ) but sometimes you need familiar stuff to ease you through certain activities such as exercising . Unlike many other fortunate people , I can not run without listening to music and , I 've noticed , my run is as good as the music I 'm listening to is . So getting the ideal playlist is often the key to a good run . <p> FAMILIAR TERRAIN Morrissey 's albums never fail to keep me going <p> I 've tried using the shuffle function on my iPod so that songs are delivered in random order while you run but it just does n't work for me . I 've had Pearl Jam followed by Cat Power followed by The Divine Comedy and my run has gone all awry . I mean I have nothing against any of these musicians but Eddie Vedder 's Gon na See My Friend , followed by Cat Power 's brilliant but ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' classic , closely pursued by The Divine Comedy 's Generation Sex can be great to listen to while doing nothing much more than sitting back and relaxing with a drink or three but running ? Sorry , it does n't work . <p> So I 've discovered a three-band formula for my running playlist : any album by The Kings of Leon , any album by The Hold Steady and/or anything by Morrissey or The Smiths . It never fails to keep me going . Does anyone else have favourite running playlists ? I 'd be glad to hear about them . THREE TO TANGO

@@1381236 <h> News , reviews , information and apps for Symbian and Nokia . <h> The Nokia X6 's v12 Firmware lets you trust it again <p> Following on from my review ( parts 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) of the Nokia X6 32GB Comes with Music , I have received the new v12 firmware with open arms and report back here on the transformation it makes to my intensive use of this music-focussed smartphone . There are still issues that need attention , but at least I can trust the X6 - for the first time . <p> And so onto the latest firmware on the X6 . For those of you following the story so far , I gave the X6 32GB ( Comes with Music ) version a serious workout over a four part review ( Hardware , Music , Multimedia and Applications ) , and the summary works like this : Given the price point , the construction was effective and had just enough stylish touches to make sure it would be considered by the fashion concious ; a finger light capacitive screen brought new joy to the S60 5th edition interface , even though nothing was fundamentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The big one , of course , was the atrocious memory handling . After light to medium use of certain apps , the smartphone would lock up . On top of that , the graphical transitions and moving between menu screens was slow , and the caching abilities in the Music Player added to the feeling of a phone trying to work through fifteen tonnes of strawberry jam . <p> And it did n't need to be that way -- the memory profile and app load out is similar to the N97 mini , and Nokia have managed to sort that out ( given time , via the N97 ) to be a decent device . How long would the X6 have to wait before we could recommend it ? <p> Not long as it turned out . Firmware v12 came out at the start of February ( 2010 ) , and while it has not made any major additions to the applications on the device , it contains enough bug fixes and tweaks in the installed applications to remove the major memory issues that plagued my device @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Just in time as well , because the 16GB version of the X6 is now shipping in some territories , and thankfully ( we checked this with Nokia ) this version , which does not have Comes with Music , will have no sign of the buggy v11 firmware , i.e. it 'll ship from day one with v12 or higher . <p> So I thought it only fair to return to the X6 that it is now loaded with the v12 software to see what difference it has made . The biggest difference is something very simple , but one that any personal device needs to have before it can succeed in the marketplace . <p> Trust . <p> With the X6v11 , while it sat on the desk beside me , and it had a 3G data sim in it , with review software loaded up -- the X6 did n't get my day to day SIM . It had that for all of 90 minutes after starting to review the unit initially . A phone , especially a smartphone , is a critical item , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be it incoming calls , sending texts , grabbing a web page of traffic reports or being asked to play a certain video when demoing to a client . I could never trust the X6 to do that before . <p> Now I can , and after four days with the X6v12 , I 'm happy to swap the SIMs around , out of the trusty E75 and into the music phone ( although when I start travelling in March I suspect I 'll reach for the E75 as the travel phone because it has a qwerty keyboard and also the benefit of being proven ' in battle ' ) . By simply having the X6 with me at all times , and not being afraid to experiment , I start to really use the phone . I do n't mind just picking up random applications from online stores ( like the Ovi Store ) , sitting around and calling up web pages and leaving Gravity running in the background for Twitter access , because I do n't have to worry about if one more thing will stop it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead of the curve . All this update provides is a stable environment , it does nothing to speed up the X6 . The music player , which I can now leave running in the background , still has the huge flaws previously discussed . The additional problems in the music player are still there . Not all the information in the ID3 tag is being read , the support for album art is inconsistent , and it 's slow to react to button presses . <p> And the biggest flaw , there is no speed when moving around my albums and music tracks , and there are long pauses when I go into a new folder ( be it to list album tracks or an artist 's discography ) . It 's barely acceptable in a modern phone , and while the X6 in the 16GB form is going to minimize the marketing of the music app , it 's still going to be something that a lot of people will be using . <p> At least it 's now at the " usable " level and not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the UI , give the X6 a speed boost so everything appears slick and fast ? No . Was the firmware something that Nokia needed to do sharpish so they could work on those areas ? Yes . <p> There 's still a fair amount of work that should be done to make the X6 as snappy as the hardware demands . Whether Nokia will do this is open to question , although I would like to think that there will be at least one more update to the X6 to take it to a v20 firmware . Assuming that 's more than a bug fix , the X6 could be on its way to becoming a competent replacement for the 5800 and to fly the flag in the mid-range for Nokia . <p> Whether Nokia would have been better to not release the X6 at all until this firmware was ready is an issue open to debate between academics , marketing and the tech support desk . I think I 'd lean towards not releasing a product which fails in its primary purpose , so the X6 16GB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's see how the rest of the world takes to this improved mid-range handset.

Three organizations -- Jamiat Ulema-e-Hind ( JUH ) , All India Milli Council and Mojaddidia Foundation organized conferences in Dharamtalla , the heart of the Kolkata city , one after another in the last week of Jan 2010 .

She is railway minister where almost 14 lakh people are employees ; of them Muslims are 70 thousands while they should be 1.40 lakh . So , first of all she should give Muslims their due share in railway then we will trust on her promise .

@@1383230 <h> LG Chocolate BL40 Reviewed <p> Gulp a pinch of salt as we are n't talking about Hershey 's dark chocolates or Amadei , but not less than that either . Remember how LG glimmered streets with the original Chocolate in 2006 and sold it by the bucket load ? Now , LG has gone all gung ho with its sleek Chocolate BL40 mobile device in its Black Label Portfolio . A sweetened treat for the true fashionistas and tech geeks , BL40 has for sure created a stir in the mobile market with its innovative entertainment features . Before you open up your question-box , we brought our desk in order and turned on our examining-eye to bring to users an in-depth review of the LG Chocolate BL40 phone . Packed in a myriad of cutting-edge attributes , the shell around the kernel of this eye-catchy nut broke its cover to give you a detailed view . Pulling us off the chair , the extremely bold piece comes dressed in pretty sultry red and black attire . Sure enough , a diamond in the rough is something that wo n't cross your mind when you look at this handset . Stepping in as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone looks incredibly slick , which is why it 's a member of the Black Label range . The moment we took it in our hands , the word ' beautiful ' surely came out . But the sleek BL40 probably gulped lots of nutritious food resulting in such a ' tall ' height ( just a tongue-in-cheek thought ) . The phone is ridiculously long , partly due to its 21:9 aspect ratio of the display . It 's about 2cm taller than the iPhone so may be users who want something smaller wo n't be puffed with a smile . Flaunting off engaging stylish overall looks , the red upper and lower edges of the body add some color to the austere , graceful design . At 10.9mm thick , the candy-bar shaped unit weighs around 129g and is a sturdy , well made phone to hold . While the intriguing lay-out may put some people off , when the BL40 's display strikes an opportunity to play videos/movies , hardly any voice will be heard with a word ' but ' on how well it performs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long design and will also fit in most pant pockets . It feels a premium product too , a hearty thanks to LG 's smart brains who suggested the use of metal and glass on its exterior frame . Well , the front of the handset is home to the huge 4-inch display with a resolution of 345 x 800 pixels , yes more of a WVGA resolution . Colors are really saturated and the only displays that caught our attention nerve to a great degree were AMOLED ones . Impressively , BL40 is a full touchscreen phone eschewing the need for any single button on the front side of the device . It smartly features a towering screen , earpiece , video call camera and proximity sensor . On either side you have microUSB port , button to fast start the audio player , 3.5mm jack , screen lock button , volume rocker and camera shutter . The topmost portion embraces a power on/off cum lock/unlock button . The left panel exhibits a USB port with an LED light that lights up ' red ' when the USB cable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ button that makes one halt before ' music library ' . The right panel on the top has an elongated volume up/down button which helps in adjusting the ring-tone and touchtone . Further , the lower part of the right panel includes dedicated camera button . Above it is a satiny elongated button to help one increase and decrease the volume when listening to peppy tunes . At the bottom of the screen , there 's a special minimize button that enables multitasking at the same time . Cracking a grin , the new handset tilts head high with its capability to function as a media player as well . You 'll find a standard 3.5mm audio jack , letting you use most headphones without those irksome expressions . <p> It is enriched with a wide capacitive touchscreen which is simply stunning . The display offers vivid colors and there is pretty satisfactory contrast if you are planning to wear your reading glasses under the sun . You can simply hold it horizontally to view every single option under categories like Communications , Entertainment , Utilities and Settings . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as falling off a log . In fact , its occasional freezing made us little agitated to turn it on and off every now then . And yes , both our hands were assigned to work on holding the phone . Using only thumb to control things made it a bit uncomfortable . Contrarily , a menu with 32 on-screen icons displaying at once is a noticeable aspect . But unfortunately , there 's no text description for each icon and trust us it will take you a while to recognize them all . One plus point is that users can place widgets , contacts and other media on a range of panels , and the large screen grabs higher number when placed on a comparison scale with other S-class models , like the Arena or Crystal . LG has adapted the S-class user interface and certain applications offer split-screen views for certain tasks , like messaging , allowing you to view threaded conversations and see contacts at the same time . Besides , the phone paves the way with travel adapter , USB cable , headphones and CD guide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LG Chocolate BL40 hugs an impressive 5 megapixel Schneider Kreuznach camera . We clicked a few pictures which turned out to be pretty limpid , but gladly , it did n't notice too many details . But , if you are planning to pose like a supermodel and do the job of a photographer as well , then face the studio of disappointment . Users will find it very inconvenient to take their own pictures since the touchscreen option at times leads to other options . There are five Scene Modes , Auto , Portrait , Landscape , Sport , and Night , all with normal , fine and super-fine quality options . The bold and glossy handset comes with improvement with the tiny LED flash now doing a surprisingly decent job . Our sneaking-eyes discovered a good color balance along with significantly ebbed noise in low-light situations . <p> Further , LG 's fun S-Class interface has been tweaked to clinch the handset 's Web prowess . Along with the stylish 3D main menu icons , the multimedia homescreen has been replaced with a browser panel that lets you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacitive touchscreen is also very versatile and responsive . But the multi-tasking dual screen feature is a little disappointing , as it only works in the calendar , music player , text messaging and email client . Scrolling on the menus was fluid too . The Chocolate has ten games/fun apps preinstalled , making you all entertained for sometime . As for GPS navigation , there 's Google Maps , or the more feature-packed Wisepilot . On the other hand , the handset has to be praised for the sheer number of features such as Bluetooth , Wi-Fi , GPS connectivity , 3G HSDPA 7.2MBPS networks . The interface category ' Entertainment ' brings lively music , Movie Maker , FM Radio and Games &amp; Apps . Yes , we played a few captivating games like Bubble Breeze , Hidden Catch Wide and Real Motion Fishing and also tracks like Forever and A day , Blue Night and Breaking My Heart . Simply rejoice the phone delivers an unprecedented sound quality with unrivaled clarity . <p> Moving on , the video camera features auto and night scene modes . Video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Basically , there are three recording modes , normal , MMS and DLNA . Apart from this , Internet browsing encompasses multi-windows option to let you open many windows concurrently . We found surfing and browsing simply seamless . Just touch , swipe fingers and toggle between windows . Additionally , many progressive aspects can also be experienced for easy browsing like adding bookmarks , multi-windows , history , re-setting zoom . You can facilely call up someone and browse without getting disconnected from the Internet . Coming to the most basic thing , battery thwarted us even in power saving mode . Long usage of the phone emitted a warm feeling from it while its multitasking function permitted only three apps at a time to be accessed . We were little taken back to realize that interface froze quite a few times and that too with only one application running . On positive front , users can personalize three homescreens . <p> Well , the LG Chocolate BL40 we would say topples as a great phone . If given a wide berth to its tall structure the scalding piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegantly attired device for sure stands out from the crowd . But as a wise man said , ' the proof of the pudding is in the eating ' . So , users on the prowl for a good touchscreen phone combined with snappy , dashing looks and amazing features can cudgel their brains to skid one in their pocket . The bold as brass phone will make one fork out around Rs. 25,000 . On our scorecard , we give the handset 8 out of 10.

" <p> Advertising potential <p> As the year hit straight into slowdown , kids broadcasters faced an ad slump . As a result , initially kids channels were stressed to move to quarterly deals with big advertisers , slash ad rates and see brands walk out . However , things began to improve from the second half of the year wherein the category grew by almost 20 per cent over 2008 . <p> Says Jaipuria , " In 2008 , the ad revenue size of the all-India kids sector accounted for about Rs 1.5 billion . And despite recession , the size has grown by about 20 per cent to end the year at about Rs 1.7-1.8 billion . " <p> Apart from traditional advertisers , broadcasters state that a lot of non-traditional advertisers across sectors like FMCG , investment banks and durable products are also eyeing the kids space . The rationale behind this , they feel , is an increase in the co-viewing pattern and also the mere pester power of kids who have the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , CN is looking at upping its non-traditional clientele in the New Year . <p> Says Tata , " We expect great growth from non traditional clients as over 30 per cent of advertisers on Cartoon Network are non-traditional advertisers , strongly reiterating that animation cuts across age-groups and compelling content has legs that travel across . " <p> Welcome 2010 <p> As localisation almost became a mantra for kids broadcasters in 2009 to drive viewership range , the year witnessed the increase of home grown content . Kids channels plan to remain aggressive in creating more localised products to improve viewership as a whole . <p> Says Tata , " Today , there is a marked increase and recognition within the industry on the merit and need for localised content . Cartoon Network and Pogo have led the way in both home grown animations as well as live action shows with Pogo 's Original Productions . As we see it , 2010 will have a stronger focus on localisation with more increased local collaborations . " <p> The year also intends to call for a further exploration of different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genres that include action , comedy , drama , movies and game shows . " 2010 will see exploration within these genres mining different proportions , " says Tata . <p> Meanwhile , kids channels believe that digital media will play a key role during the year and fast become a key growth avenue for broadcasters . <p> Says Tata , " The real and virtual world divides are getting blurred as is evident from Cartoon Network 's patented research study on kids ' lifestyle , New Generations 2009. 49 per cent of the kids aged 7-14 years have used a computer in the past one month , and 15 per cent of all kids 7-14 who surfed the internet in the past one month , two-thirds are at least weekly users . In 2008 , it was 10 per cent .

And now Nick , the only kids channel to stay out of this play zone , is also readying for a launch in the southern market later in the year . <p> Says Jaipuria , " South is an extremely challenging zone . This is because in this region , kids are used to watching general entertainment channels in their local language which exhibit regional relevance . Therefore , just syndicating HSM product and dubbing will not help in creating channel stickiness . It will be an extremely challenging task to dub and make relevant content . " <p> It is pertinent to note here that kids broadcasters are being propelled to speak in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the all India universe . In 2010 ( first 2 weeks only , Tam 's expanded Universe estimation ) , South comprised 27 per cent of All India kids Universe ( 42.7 million Kids All India ) . <p> " Thus , by the sheer size of the market , there is immense scope of expansion for revenue and viewership , " says Tata . <p> Elaborating on this , Madison Media Group CEO Punitha Arumugam notes that treading the South zone will help kids channels not just garner national but also attract regional revenues . <p> " The entry of new players in the South zone will actually help the genre to grow with each grabbing a share of its own pie . However , the share of revenues will not grow much but , instead , only get dispersed , " she opines.

@@1383240 <h> BioShock 2 Review : Recapturing Rapture <p> Ten years have passed since Andrew Ryan 's crumbling universe saw an unexpected visit from Jack and now Subject Delta , the first ever " Big Daddy " begins his first descent into the once utopian world of Rapture , which is now being controlled by a benefactor who goes by the name of Sofia Lamb . The sequel to one of the most poignant games of 2007 has finally hit shelves . Even though the sink to Rapture is far less exciting and storming as the original , BioShock 2 successfully manages to blend together a fresh story arc that seeks to construct a different flavor that is desperate to escape Ryan 's philosophy of objectivism . <p> As Big Daddy enters the world which is seemingly destroyed by Splicers and Sofia 's quest for creating a family that is to be headed by her own daughter Eleanor . She is also on a rampage on absorbing enough Adam to create a version of Eleanor that is destroyed of recognizing the concept of the Self and craft out a cohesive family that is bonded together for a common good . BioShock 2 's story is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subject Delta to bond with his Little Sister Eleanor . The only hurdle is posed by Sofia Lamb who is bent of crafting out an insidious " family " out of the deranged inhabitants of Rapture . Along the way you meet the regular bunch of colorful characters who are in pursuit of their set of pernicious designs and Delta through most parts acts as the pawn for fulfilling these . Fans of the original will be pleased to see that they can now use both plasmids and guns together instead of switching back and forth , which makes the gameplay a bit like Clive Barker 's " Undying , " which directly affects the combat mechanics of the game , making it faster and tighter than the original . <p> During the development cycle , many fans had scepticisms regarding the power that would unleashed given the fact that we would be stepping into the shoes of " Big Daddy " . However , all these fears can be relegated to the fact that the Splicer community has also evolved over the years . One of the additions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mash between the tank from Left 4 Dead and a chain bound hulking beast found in Condemned 2 : Bloodshot . The game also includes a version of Big Daddy which was originally canned from the original BioShock . This menacing metal head carries on its shoulder a grenade launcher which fires a massive armada of grenades onto the player . One of the biggest additions to the enemy lineup is the creation of the Big Sister who is a vile and tenacious version of Big Daddy . They are quintessentially those bunch of freaky Little Sisters incorporated into the armour of the Big Daddy . The result is a bizarre creature who is devoid of all the flab that protectors of little sisters carry and infused with ADAM abilities making them a formidable foe in the game . <p> Their appearance varies according to the moral choices in the game which have aloes been diversified to allow the player to explore the relationship between a Big Daddy and a Little Sister . This was only witnessed from a distance in the previous game . The structure is such that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adopt a little sister who will extract ADAM from corpses strewn across the city . Now during this process she will be attacked by those blemished lot splicers and the player just like a Big Daddy has to fend off these foes till she finishes extracting the juice that will craft powers for the player to explore . In a situation where the player decides to act out like a maniac and harvest all the ADAM from the Little sisters present in a level , the Big Sister shows up as a Mini Boss ( who is sometimes tougher than a regular boss ) and a fight ensures allowing the player to tread on the path that led to ultimate demise of Rapture . Morality has been further explored through the game in the form of having the choice to kill or spare certain NPCs through the game , which will have an effect on the penultimate ending . <p> All of the previous plasmids return in the game , Telekinesis , Incinerate , Freeze Blast , Insect Swan are a few favorites . Now the list has increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one they should pick and stick on with throughout the game . The most effect line-up of plasmids are the ones which were present in the previous game , most of the others are cosmetic extensions which may be ignored . Hacking has been simplified in the game , there is a specific hack tool ( Dues Ex anyone ? ) that Big Daddy can use in an up close and personal basis or remotely to plan out traps during a ongoing ADAM harvest or a sticky combat situation . Instead of buying out present in the previous game , players have an auto hack dart that instantly allies machines onto the side of the players . <p> One of really strong points in the game is depicting the world of Rapture , which was closed and alienated from the player 's purview in the last game . Delta explores all the nooks and crannies of Raptures history and the lineage of Andrew Ryan 's eccentric vision which is now interspersed with Sofia " family values " fleshing out the insanity that corrupts . The vast blue sea can also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traverses from one tank chamber to another passing through the clam environment beneath the sea contrasted with the craziness of Rapture . The visuals also portray this story , though the game might look similar to the original the art direction changes everything adds a fresh dimension to the entire experience . Being a Big Daddy there is a helmet option in the game which can be turned off/on to enjoy these striking visuals . Multiplayer is a option that has been included in the game and developed by the guys who brought us " Dark Sector " this generation . Though the game is primarily a story driven experience , this additional mode feels like any other multiplayer game spruced up with plasmids . There are numerous game types that incorporate the viciousness of objectivism in Rapture but it all is a matter of catching on with the public so as to speak of its success . <p> The Final Word : BioShock 2 improves on the base of its predecessor that crafted out this psychotic delusion of an eccentric man and takes it to a higher level . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a full fledged sequel of a madhouse , making it fall a few notches lower than the original . Even though the developers have tried their best to craft out a " different " experience , it falls into " more of the same " syndrome after a point , but an effort that is worth a few hundred applauses.

@@1390231 <p> Hello loyal SSP followers , I 'm back with those ever controversial predictions , this time for the Elimination Chamber . I shall be updating the SSP Top Ten and also the quote of the week and the latest " Good Idea ! Bad Idea ! " <p> To get things started I first want to get something off my chest . The WWE have for some bizarre reason started renaming certain PPV 's with match titles , " Hell in a Cell " , " TLC " and now the " Elimination Chamber " . In my opinion this is one of the worst things the WWE have done over the last year . I 'm not sure if there 's some sort of marketing genius behind this or not but I do n't see the point in renaming already established PPV 's and calling them after match types . Personally I think naming it after match types of all things totally takes away from the excitement you would normally get of having a match type announced that you did n't know you were going to see . Some of the Mickey Mouse PPV 's during the year is one thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the bridge between The Royal Rumble and Wrestlemania . Especially as the Elimination Chamber matches pretty much set the stage for WM , but that 's no reason to name it after them . <p> With my rant over I shall begin with my predictions . <p> It would have been the 12th annual No Way Out had the WWE kept its original title . <p> *** WWE Elimination Chamber 2010 *** <p> The 1st Annual from the Scottrade Center in St. Louis Missouri <p> Featured Theme Songs : Rise Up by Cypress Hill <p> Diva ChampionshipMaryse Vs Gail Kim <p> The final of the tournament for the WWE Diva 's Championship and to be honest there has n't been much hype for this match besides the odd bit of slagging from Maryse and for that reason I believe she 's going to win . Gail has had a fair few matches on Raw over the last few months but as a character the WWE have n't done anything with her . It 's possible for them to put the title on her , in which case she may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see it going anywhere , especially as a face . I can see Maryse reclaiming the title and continuing from where she left off before she had to drop it due to injury . <p> Winner : Maryse <p> Intercontinental ChampionshipDrew McIntyre(C) Vs Kane <p> I 'm a big fan of both participants but I 'm more of fan of the push Drew has been getting since debuting , it 's more than deserved . Drew in my opinion will be in the main event sooner rather than later and Kane and the IC Championship are only stepping-stones . Hopefully this will spark off some sort of storyline for Drew leading into Wrestlemania involving the IC title . It 's about time the title got some spotlight at the big one and Drew is more than capable of carrying it . I think it would be a shame for the IC Champion to be thrown into Money in the Bank when the potential is there for a great match and storyline involving the Championship . Last year the IC Championship match was between Rey and JBL , which had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person to bring this title forward before moving onto better things , if only the WWE will let him . <p> I know a lot of people are going to look at the result of this match and wonder " WTF " , but let me explain to you where I am coming from with this one . When I first seen this match and the line-up I thought , " ahh , Sheamus is going to drop " , but then I looked at the way all the storylines are forming and I thought differently . Let 's break them down .... <p> Randy Orton/Ted DiBiase : Rumoured to be fighting at WM and the current storylines would certainly point to this happening . I ca n't see them fighting for the title , but with Ted 's dad finally going into the Hall of Fame , this is an ideal chance for Ted to become a major face and really get himself over . <p> Kofi Kingston : Although Kofi does n't have any storyline 's currently going , I think the Money in the Bank match has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> John Cena : Too involved with Vince/Bret/Batista at present , I can see Batista screwing him somehow leading to an encounter between the two at WM without the WWE Championship . This will be the Summerslam rematch and the only match possible involving John Cena that would have me rooting for him . <p> Triple H : Now , I 'm not sure about this one , if anyone takes the title I think it 's going to be Trips , and possibly feud with Sheamus or Shawn going to WM , but I see Sheamus holding onto it to establish himself and then have Trips take it off him on the grandest stage of them all . To be honest though , as much as I like Sheamus , I would much rather he was n't involved in a main event WM match just yet . <p> Fans of the SSP are going to look at the result of this one and think that there 's no surprise there , being the Jericho fan that I am , but let me explain this one so you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break this down one by one as for me , John Morrison and R-Truth are never going to win the match . So I hear you saying " What about Rey and Punk " . Well I answer ; Rey and Punk are going to be involved in a match at WM and I do n't see it for the World Title . I 'm not sure if a Hair Vs Mask match is indeed on the cards like many say it is , but a storyline definitely seems to be forming and I reckon they could tear the house down . <p> Chris Jericho on the other hand , is rumoured to be feuding with both The Undertaker and Edge at WM . Jericho could easily win and defend against Taker at WM , but that could involve Taker yet again beating his opponent at WM and winning the title . It 's kinda been done to death , no pun intended , and would n't be taken very seriously and adding to that the fact that Edge is the holder of the Royal Rumble opportunity I have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Title , and if that goes a head , I will be over the moon . <p> Winner : Chris Jericho <p> " It 's time to play the game ... Time to play the game ! hahaha <p> It 's all about the game and how you play it . All about control and if you can take it . All about your debt and if you can pay it . It 's all about pain and who 's gon na make it .... " <p> A lot of things into consideration ; overness ( both as a heel and face ) , backstage goings on and general performances both in the ring and on the mic . <p> This is the break-down of how I see things at the moment . As I said in the previous blog , I am taking a lot of things into consideration ; overness ( both as a heel and face ) , backstage goings on and general performances both in the ring and on the mic . I have removed ECW from the list as not much has changed and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added NXT to the list once it 's up and running.Previous positions are in brackets ... <p> RAW <p> SMACKDOWN <p> DIVAS <p> 1 .

I 'd add that the Smackdown Chamber holds the setup for Shawn Michaels to get involved and cost Taker the title , since John Morrison re-injured his ankle on Smackdown . Seems to be leading in that sort of direction ... <p> Good top 10 lists also , except no Eve Torres on the divas 10 ? I think she at least outranks Layla , and maybe Kelly Kelly due to the fact she made the WWE Divas final four for the tournament ... not a huge deal though . <p> I thought ever since John Morrison started having injury problems Shawn might replace him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think Sheamus has the potential to go to Wrestlemania with the gold , so maybe Triple H is going to win it . It could be HHH(c) vs Sheamus vs Orton vs Dibiase for the WWE Championship , Edge vs Jericho(c) , Shawn vs Undertaker and Bret/Cena vs Vince/Batista at Wrestlemania . <p> I think Jerico will win and face Edge at Wrestlemania . I believe Cena will win and Batista will tell the world on Monday that his attack was for a Wrestlemaina championship match . So Cena and Batista at wrestlemania . That will open up the Undertaker vs Shawn Michaels for Wrestlemania . Maryse will win and face Beth Pheonix Mickie James will lose in the next couple weeks to Beth Pheonix.

@@1402231 <p> We owe Ralph Nader and Cynthia McKinney an apology . They were right about Barack Obama . They were right about the corporate state . They had the courage of their convictions and they stood fast despite wholesale defections and ridicule by liberals and progressives . <p> Obama lies as cravenly , if not as crudely , as George W. Bush . He promised us that the transfer of $12.8 trillion in taxpayer money to Wall Street would open up credit and lending to the average consumer . The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp . ( FDIC ) , however , admitted last week that banks have reduced lending at the sharpest pace since 1942 . As a senator , Obama promised he would filibuster amendments to the FISA Reform Act that retroactively made legal the wiretapping and monitoring of millions of American citizens without warrant ; instead he supported passage of the loathsome legislation . He told us he would withdraw American troops from Iraq , close the detention facility at Guant ? namo , end torture , restore civil liberties such as habeas corpus and create new jobs . None of this has happened . <p> He is shoving a health care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taxpayer dollars to the private health insurance industry in the form of subsidies , and force millions of uninsured Americans to buy insurers ' defective products . These policies would come with ever-rising co-pays , deductibles and premiums and see most of the seriously ill left bankrupt and unable to afford medical care . Obama did nothing to halt the collapse of the Copenhagen climate conference , after promising meaningful environmental reform , and has left us at the mercy of corporations such as ExxonMobil . He empowers Israel 's brutal apartheid state . He has expanded the war in Afghanistan and Pakistan , where hundreds of civilians , including entire families , have been slaughtered by sophisticated weapons systems such as the Hellfire missile , which sucks the air out of victims ' lungs . And he is delivering war and death to Yemen , Somalia and perhaps Iran . <p> The illegal wars and occupations , the largest transference of wealth upward in American history and the egregious assault on civil liberties , all begun under George W.

They articulate a legitimate rage . Yet liberals continue to speak in the bloodless language of issues and policies , and leave emotion and anger to the protofascists . Take a look at the 3,000-word suicide note left by Joe Stack , who flew his Piper Cherokee last month into an IRS office in Austin , Texas , murdering an IRS worker and injuring dozens . He was not alone in his rage . <p> " Why is it that a handful of thugs and plunderers can commit unthinkable atrocities ( and in the case of the GM executives , for scores of years ) and when it 's time for their gravy train to crash under the weight of their gluttony and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no difficulty coming to their aid within days if not hours ?

Yet , the political ' representatives ' ( thieves , liars , and self-serving scumbags is far more accurate ) have endless time to sit around for year after year and debate the state of the ' terrible health care problem ' . It 's clear they see no crisis as long as the dead people do n't get in the way of their corporate profits rolling in .

We are , even more than Glenn Beck or tea-party protesters , responsible for the gusts fanning the flames of right-wing revolt because we have failed to articulate a credible alternative . <p> A shift to the Green Party , McKinney and Nader , along with genuine grass-roots movements , will not be a quick fix .

We have historical precedents to fall back upon . <p> " Here in the United States , at the beginning of the twentieth century , before there was a Soviet Union to spoil it , you see , socialism had a good name , " the late historian and activist Howard Zinn said in a lecture a year ago at Binghamton University .

The longer socialism is identified with the corporatist policies of the Democratic Party , the longer we allow the right wing to tag Obama as a socialist , the more absurd and ineffectual we become . The right-wing mantra of " Obama the socialist , " repeated a few days ago to a room full of Georgia Republicans , by Newt Gingrich , the former U.S. speaker of the House , is discrediting socialism itself . Gingrich , who looks set to run for president , called Obama the " most radical president " the country had seen in decades .

We have already seen how the Manmohan Singh government myopically wasted the opportunities offered by the economic boom between 2004 and 2008 , when soaring tax revenue and a buoyant stock market should have put India 's public finances in better shape before the downturn came . India thus entered the downturn with very high levels of public debt and fiscal deficits , as a result of which it did not have the headroom to go in for a huge fiscal stimulus as China could . <p> How can politicians be disciplined ? India has tried to temper the usual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hard fiscal rules that commit the government to low deficits . The landmark Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act of 2003 ( FRBM ) is the best known example and emerged from a broad consensus that cut across party lines , no mean feat . It was quite another matter that the first Manmohan Singh government used some of the loopholes in the legislation to not account for oil and fertilizer subsidies in the deficit numbers , a sorry case of fudging . The FRBM rules were finally buried when the fiscal deficit shot up in the wake of the global downturn . <p> India needs a new and improved set of legislative rules to bind the government to its medium-term fiscal plan while at the same time providing enough discretion for the government to act quickly in times of trouble . But will FRBM 2.0 be enough ? Perhaps not . It is time some thought was given to other forms of restraint on government profligacy . <p> The financial markets may not have much role to play right now . We see in the case of countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act as independent watchdogs that bite when public finances go awry . India is unlikely to face the heat from bond vigilantes for the simple reason that most public debt is owned by domestic investors , especially banks controlled by the government . <p> A more useful option would be to set up autonomous fiscal authorities to either help the government design fiscal policy or provide independent analysis of the budget numbers and forecasts . In a fascinating paper , Independent Fiscal Agencies , Xavier Debrun , David Hauner and Manmohan Kumar of the International Monetary Fund provide an excellent overview of why and how such agencies can complement fiscal rules in disciplining governments . <p> The three economists identify two types of institutions in their research . One , fiscal authorities that conduct fiscal policy on behalf of the government just as independent central banks conduct monetary policy in some countries . Two , fiscal councils that make the budget more transparent and credible , by providing independent analysis of the budget numbers , assessing the consistency of budgetary policies with long-term objectives or advising governments on " specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> A country such as India that does not have an independent central bank is hardly likely to get an independent fiscal authority anytime in the near future . But a fiscal council of the sort that Debrun , Hauner and Kumar recommend is worth considering . <p> Many countries have such fiscal councils . One of the best known examples is the US Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , which analyses the federal budget , provides its own forecasts about how various economic variables will move in the years ahead and commissions several independent economic reports . Just take a look at its trenchant analysis of the Obama administration 's tax and spend policies . That is the sort of institution that India now needs . We depend too heavily on what the finance ministry tells us right now . <p> India is now perhaps a year away from a system of low and stable taxes that finance ministers will find difficult to fiddle with . The spending budget will be the only remaining ground for discretionary policies meant to buy votes and placate lobbies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be useful , but we also need an Indian version of CBO to keep the government on its toes . One can guess what an Indian CBO would have said about the fiscal fudging that was done in 2007 and 2008 , or about the fact that the so-called fiscal stimulus was less an economic recovery plan , and more a politically convenient attempt to buy votes ahead of the 2009 general election .

@@1402238 <h> Service tax on rent is dicey <p> After the Delhi HC struck down the govt 's contention that rent itself is taxable , budget 2010 amended the law to make it so -- retrospectively . <p> One of the more controversial provisions of budget 2010 , being made applicable retrospectively , is the explicit provision that the activity of renting is a taxable service . <p> Background Service tax on renting of immovable property was first mooted by budget 2007 . The tax was sought to be imposed on the service provided in relation to renting of immovable property for use in the course of furtherance of business or commerce . <p> If you read the above line carefully , you will notice that the tax is on service in relation to renting and not on the rent itself . <p> Consequently , some experts have the view that the rent income per se should not be subject to service tax , but only peripheral services that are rendered in relation to the renting . For example , if there is a composite lease agreement where the lease payments cover not only the rent but extra services such as maintenance , security , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be under the ambit of the service tax and not the rent per se . <p> So now there was this big confusion among the taxpaying population as to what exactly does the government intend to tax -- is it the rent itself or is it the service in relation to the rent ? Finally , on April 18 , 2009 , the Delhi High Court in the case of Home Solutions Retail India Ltd vs UOI 2009 20 STT 129 , held that while any service connected to renting of property would indeed fall within the ambit of service tax , the act of renting per se can not be seen as a taxable service . Extracts of the judgment are paraphrased below : <p> " Service tax is a value-added tax . It is a tax on value addition provided by a service provider . It is obvious that it must have connection with a service and , there must be some value addition by that service . If there is no value addition , then there is no service . <p> For example , take a service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' B ' in relation to ' C ' . Here , ' A ' is the recipient of the service , ' B ' is the service provider and ' C ' is the subject matter . The expression " in relation to " may be of widest amplitude , but it has been used in the said Act as per its context . Sometimes , " in relation to " would include the subject matter following it and on other occasions , it would not . <p> As in the case of the service of dry cleaning , the expression " in relation to dry cleaning " also has reference to the very service of dry cleaning . On the other hand , the service referred to in Section 65(105) ( v ) , which refers to a service provided by a real estate agent " in relation to real estate " , does not , obviously , include the subject matter as a service . <p> This is so because real estate by itself can not by any stretch of imagination be regarded as a service . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided or to be provided to ' A ' by ' B ' in relation to ' C ' , it is obvious that ' C ' can either be a service ( such as dry cleaning , hair dressing , etc ) or not a service by itself , such as real estate . The expression " in relation to " would , therefore , have different meanings depending on whether ' C ' is a service or is not a service . <p> If ' C ' is a service , then the expression " in relation to " means the service ' C ' as well as any other service having connection with the service ' C ' . Where ' C ' is not a service , the expression " in relation to " would have reference only to some service which has a connection with ' C ' . But , this would not imply that ' C ' itself is a service . <p> From this analysis , it is clear that we have to understand as to whether renting of immovable property for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by itself is a service . There is no dispute that any service connected with the renting of such immovable property would fall within the ambit of Section 65(105) ( zzzz ) and would be exigible to service tax . <p> The question is whether renting of such immovable property by itself constitutes a service and , thereby , a taxable service . We have already seen that service tax is a value-added tax . It is a tax on the value addition provided by some service provider . Insofar as renting of immovable property for use in the course or furtherance of business or commerce is concerned , we are unable to discern any value addition . <p> Consequently , the renting of immovable property for use in the course or furtherance of business of commerce by itself does not entail any value addition and , therefore , can not be regarded as a service . Of course , if there is some other service , such as air-conditioning service provided alongwith the renting of immovable property , then it would fall within Section 65(105) ( zzzz ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Section 65(105) ( zzzz ) does not in terms entail that the renting out of immovable property for use in the course or furtherance of business of commerce would by itself constitute a taxable service and be exigible to service tax under the said Act . " <p> The Centre had appealed against the Delhi high court judgment and this SLP is still pending . Now , what budget 2010 has done is to basically amend the Act and provided explicitly that the activity of ' renting ' is indeed a taxable service . What happens now will indeed be interesting . <p> Stoking already high inflation It must be realised that all indirect taxes are in fact , surrogate taxes . In the end , it is the consumer who bears them . Service tax is no exception . This tax is ostensibly payable by the service provider , but he recovers it from the availer of the service . <p> In the current context too , it is the owner or the landlord of the property who is meant to bear this tax , however , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most retailers including grocery stores and shopping malls do n't own the property themselves but instead take it on lease . If the cost of the lease increases , it follows that the burden will be passed on the end consumers , thereby pushing up prices . If inflation control is one of the priorities of the government , then perhaps they should desist from levying this tax . In any case , the landlord pays income-tax on the rent received . <p> The writer is director , Wonderland Consultants , a tax and financial planning firm . He may be contacted at **26;393;TOOLONG

@@1430230 <p> The article discusses the current education scenario in India , public expenditure on education , need of the hour to reform the system and the true role of education in nation building . <p> " TELL ME the books you read and I will tell your character " , goes the saying . However , education is not just about reading books or garnering knowledge . Books are a means to education , and education is a means to knowledge , neither implying an end in itself . Education is the pragmatic application of knowledge for the betterment of people , society , and self . <p> In Focus <p> Education sustains our present and insures our future . Unfortunately , the education scenario in India is very disturbing . The ' EFA Global Monitoring Report 2010 ' ( UNESCO ) , ranks India 105 among 128 countries , and it continues to figure alongside a cluster of African and a couple of Asian countries , such as Pakistan and Bangladesh , in the group of countries with a low educational development index ( EDI ) . In 2007 , India was ranked not only behind countries such as Norway , Japan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past several Latin American , African , and Asian developing countries . The pupil-teacher ratio , too , in primary schools in India is very low ( 1:40 ) compared with countries like UK ( 1:21.6 ) and Japan ( 1:19 ) , despite the fact that India allocates more expenditure as a percentage of GDP on education , i.e. 3% ( a popular research result reveals that public expenditure on education should account for at least 4.07% of GDP ) . The average pupil-teacher ratio in the developed countries is 13.7 . The global average is 24.6 pupils per teacher ( 1:24.6 ) in primary school . The dropout rates in India , at the high school level are also on the rise ( 50% ) in spite of increased educational expenditures by the states . Moreover , the infrastructure facilities in schools are pathetic . According to the latest statistics available from the Flash Statistics and Analytical Reports on Elementary Education in India , published by the National University of Educational Planning and Administration in 2009-10 , there are only three classrooms per primary school in India , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . About 14% of the schools have only one classroom each , and single-teacher schools constitute a similar proportion . While the standard national pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools is 1:40 ( one teacher for every 40 students ) , 30% of the schools have a ratio above this . In Bihar , while the standard ratio at the State level is 1:59 , there are 92 ( 1:92 ) students on an average per classroom . All this indicates a poorly organized system of education . Need of the HourThe implication of all the above arguments is that a pupil-teacher ratio of around 20 ( 1:20 ) may be taken up as a desirable ratio . We need good quality teachers in sufficient numbers . This is a basic prerequisite for quality primary education . Innovation is another aspect of the quality of education .

The choice of subjects will ' involve ' the students and equip them with skills befitting their interest , which could be harnessed for the benefit of self and the nation . For instance , let 's say that someone is interested in journalism and wants to pursue investigative journalism rather than mere reporting . The course has to offer various choices within journalism ( say , investigative journalism , reporting , business journalism , sports journalism , etc . ) . If the course does n't offer these choices , then one who is genuinely interested in something may not get the opportunity to pursue it and end up doing something that one does n't like , as there is Hobson 's choice . This may hamper one 's potential in giving one 's best , and may directly or indirectly scuttle the opportunity in contributing towards the country 's economic growth.The issue of innovation brings us to an important aspect of education -- choice -- that seems to be sufficiently lacking in our education system to enable better academic performance of students and to elevate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An Introspection The human being is a social animal whose needs and urges are originated and fulfilled within a given society and rarely in isolation .

Artificial barriers in the nature of knowledge were created . It was specified that knowledge could either be for its own sake or for the sake of its application . However , on reflection , it becomes clear that unless any form of knowledge is applied , it can not be improved or suitably channeled . A large proportion of people need knowledge that is of an applied character and that helps them simplify important activities of daily living .

@@1430239 <h> News , reviews , information and apps for Nokia and Symbian . <h> Review : Nokia 5230 <p> Score:74% <p> Following on from his tour of the USA with the Nokia 5230/Nuron , Ewan delivers his final verdict on Nokia 's newest and cheapest S60 5th Edition smartphone . <p> The Nokia 5230 breaks new ground for Nokia by being one of their first S60 handsets that has significant reach into the low-end of the market . Available to buy unlocked for under ? 100 ( if you shop around ) , and packaged up for T-Mobile in the US as a $70 contract or $180 pre-pay handset ( locked to the network , admittedly ) , the 5230 packs almost all the features you would expect to see in a smartphone but at a price point that is , frankly , bonkers .... in a good way . <p> The biggest omission , and one that smartphone purists will raise an eyebrow over , is the lack of WiFi for Internet connectivity . It 's not that long ago that the addition of Wi-fi was a bonus feature , but the modern ubiquity in handsets has meant it feels more like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? 300 or more for a smartphone , of course you 'd expect it to be in the handset . <p> But it 's not missed , and I do n't think the target market really expects it . The last two weeks have seen me tour round America with this handset for All About Symbian ( Ewan 's recent travels with the Nokia 5230 : part 1 , part 2 , part 3 , part 4 , part 5 and part 6 ) , and you 'll have seen that , thanks to the 3G connectivity , you can do everything you need from a handset . A 100MB data plan will cover the basics of web , email and social networks , while a 250MB plan is going to leave you buckets of bandwidth to experiment with . <p> Something has to give to get to this price point , and no matter what you might think from the specification sheet , in the real world you can live without the WiFi and live on 3G , assuming you have connectivity where you live and work . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nokia applications , so you have the Web-kit based browser , which continues to do a competent job in bringing as much of a web site to the handset as possible . It has not really changed over the last year or so , and handles the modern web with ease . Having a touchscreen device makes browsing much more intuitive , from scrolling around the screen with a flick of the finger ( the 5230 has kinetic scrolling in most menus and applications ) to selecting links . <p> With the myriad of colours available online , there is one problem in the 5230 that should be obvious to many -- in the event of a modicum of strong sunlight , the colours and definition become washed out as the screen turns into a highly reflective piece of real estate . <p> This is mostly down to the TFT technology used in the screen , and is of a similar quality to many other Nokia touchscreen phones ( the N97 classic is the only exception ) . There 's more than enough brightness when indoors or in the sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to find a shadow during the noon sun to see what 's going on . This is made doubly difficult by the themes Nokia have put in the 5230 . All of them are white text on a black background ( the only change between them is the background image on the main screen and the colour of the cursor highlights ) , which is the exact opposite of what you need in strong sunlight . Whoops . <p> ( changing from a default theme to a third party one ) <p> It 's not difficult to get a new theme on your phone , as the Ovi Store client is included ( as it is in every phone ) . You will need to be online for this , so again you will rely on that 3G connection . <p> If you have an existing microUSB cable , then you can use this to make a connection to your PC , but if this is your first peripheral with that connection , then you 'll either have to buy the cable separately or connect using Bluetooth - to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USB cable in the retail box . This is n't as crippling as it first appears , partly because of the number of USB cables in circulation ( either around your house or in the local electronics shop ) but also because Bluetooth and Ovi Suite work very well together if your computer is Bluetooth-enabled . <p> What is in the box is the by now standard eco-charger , which draws as little power as possible , a basic hands-free and headphones combination , and a guitar pick on a bit of string that 's the MacGyvered solution to the lack of any space in the 5230 's case to store a pointer . To be honest , this is more of a hassle to use , so after about ten minutes I ditched the pick and resorted to the nail on my finger . <p> And after another thirty minutes , I flipped the finger over and used a nice fat index finger . And the 5230 was sharp enough to work out where I was tapping my finger in the vast majority of cases . Unlike previous touchscreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much reduced on the 5230 . Partly down to the OS being smart enough to decide what is meant to be be pressed , but also because the 5230 screen to very responsive to a light press , so you can get away with a little bit of pressure . The level required is very comfortable , and over the first few days I was conscious of trying to use less and less pressure to activate the screen . <p> It 's not as light a touch as on a capacitive-screened device such as the Nokia X6 , but there 's not that much to choose between the thresholds . Does the 5230 lose points for being a resistive touchscreen ? Only between geeks who study spec sheets . In the real world , it 's a touchscreen that works , and arguably the fact a stylus and your finger works could be seen as a plus point in a crowded budget market . <p> What will let down the touchscreen is not the physical hardware -- in common with the Nokia brand , it 's solid and dependable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a fixed ( low ) budget to make the retail price so attractive , but the S60 interface . As much as can be accommodated , the 5th Edition implementation is ... workmanlike . Come in from other S60-based smartphones and the touch paradigm is understandable , but the out of the box experience for anyone new to S60 is going to be very confusing . <p> Let 's throw out some reasons why the new user is going be thinking " what have I bought ? " What does a tap do ? Depending on where you tap , it could activate an option or an icon , just highlight it , or pop up the scroll bar at the side of the screen . Where are all the settings hiding ? ( in this labyrinth-like system of icons that look like folders and folders that look like apps ) . Then there are some dialog boxes that let you use predictive text and some where you ca n't ; multiple keyboard options to enter text , but only in some screens and not others ... <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard load of applications there 's not that much cruft in here , and everything 's purpose is clear , but the UI could do with a spring clean . This is of course something that Nokia and Symbian are aware of , with Symbian3 due in the later half of 2010 , but that does n't address any of the concerns of the consumers buying phones now . <p> If you wanted to be vicious , you could argue that computers are hard to use and as such need this complex interface to ensure everything you want to do can be done on the small screen . S60 , for a new user , even on a phone like the 5230 with the basic software bundle from Nokia , needs some time and needs some dedication to learn . If you get over this hump , then S60 is one of the most powerful mobile OS/UI combinations around . Unfortunately , it takes time to get there and phones with simpler UIs ( cough ... the iPhone ) have a much shallower learning curve which rewards playing around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a German construction site in the 80s . <p> Watch out for the camera -- it has the same evidence of cost-conscious decisions . It 's a 2 megapixel camera , with a plastic lens . It 's not the first Nokia with this lens , and the lens is only one part of the equation in taking good pictures from your smartphone . The Nokia Camera software is some of the most polished of any smartphone , and that compensates to some degree for the lower priced components . The camera itself is a fixed focus camera , so you just point , press the button , and trust the software can work out what you 'd like to be in focus . You do have the same picture settings familiar to other S60 users , namely white balance , exposure and ISO speed . <p> You can get good results out of the camera , as long as you remember to make sure to use settings that give the best look and you take account of the lighting ( or so I 'm told ) . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a flash . Outdoor and well lit indoor pictures should not cause too much of a problem , but night time shots are going to be little more than grainy keepsakes . <p> All the familiar niggles you love with the regular S60 apps can be found here , especially the PIM suite of Calendar , Notes and Contacts . It goes without saying that the usual problems in the standard apps are going to be found here in the 5230 . While the Notes application is passable because of the low cost of the handset , Calendar is still clunking along with some design mistakes inherited from the 7650 , almost ten years ago . I suspect that syncing to Outlook and other Office-based solutions is not as important to the 5230 user as is one for the N97 , so the 5230 actually loses less points in a review because of the PIM suite than the aforementioned N97 . People are not going to be sitting around with a copy of Outlook and a million contacts that have multiple addresses and phone numbers , they 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely upgrading from a feature phone -- in which case contacts on the SIM card is going to be the way forward . <p> As an aside , one of the features of the phone that many people on my US trip thought was a nice touch was the Contacts bar on the home screen -- this is where you can add your favourite contacts , flip horizontally through them all with a quick finger flick , and then have quick access to the flow of messages , calls and emails you have made to that person . Alongside that are icons to quickly call or message the person ( be it text , MMS or e-mail ) or view an associated RSS feed . It 's smartly integrated into the phone , it provides a useful function , and this river of info from your close friends was appreciated by many . <p> I think that most users will take up many of Nokia 's Ovi services . Let 's start with Ovi Sync and Contacts , because this is one you spend a lot of time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many consider crucial -- the aforementioned names and addresses . Having an almost one touch ( go to Tools -- Settings -- Connectivity -- Data transfer -- Sync , it 's easy ! - see what I did there , that 's sarcasm in action ) answer to backing up your data remotely , but also available to other phones and yourself if you go online , is a practical service that should be an easy sell to someone new to the 5230 . <p> And once you 're through that door then the chances of you using the other Ovi Services are much increased . I 've already mentioned the Ovi Store for more applications and themes for the device , but the other two biggies are the Music Store and Ovi Maps . <p> While the flagship Comes with Music platform and its " download all you can listen to for a year " is not in the package , the 5230 still has access to the full regional content of the Nokia Music Store , and tracks for 79p and upwards , with countless albums and singles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ client you can use for the full browsing experience , or you can grab tracks from the mobile client with almost as much ease . <p> Nokia 's Music Store efforts never seem to get the press that they deserve - they 've pulled off negotiations with all the major labels and numerous smaller Indie labels to get the into the store . You can get albums or individual tracks at the same price as other online stores , and it 's available on the handset , or on your home computer , seamlessly . You want some music ? There 's a good chance you can get it through your phone or onto your phone in just a few steps . That it just works and sits there is a testament to how simple and effective an idea it is . <p> There 's only a mono speaker on the 5230 , so if you want to listen to music in a room , as opposed to using headphones ( via the 3.5 mm audio port ) , you 'll be transported back to the sixties . Being honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone you would n't get any stereo effect in any case , so this is one of those sacrifices that hits the spec sheet but not the practical use . <p> The other area of Ovi , Maps , might not be as sexy but is probably the greatest value in the 5230 package . As the handset has a GPS built in , and Nokia have released all the Ovi mapping services for free , including real time turn by turn navigation , what you have in the 5230 is a fully enabled " Satnav " with free maps for pretty much everywhere in the world . And if you want to keep your bandwidth usage down , then you can use your computer to ' side load ' the mapping data onto the handset beforehand . GPS performance is good , but for usable GPS ' lock ' times you will need the ' assisted ' part , which requires a data connection , albeit only a few tens of kilobytes per week . <p> Which brings up the last missing piece of the equation , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with 70MB or so of storage on the C : disk , and while there is space for a microSD card to be added , Nokia are n't shipping one as standard . Without this extra storage , music , maps , pictures and video will be fighting over an ever-decreasing amount of storage . To make best use of the 5230 , you will need to get a microSD card of some description . <p> Buy the handset from a network operator and I 'd expect to see one in the bundle , witness yesterday 's offer from T-Mobile that included six months of data and an 8GB microSD card . The addition of a decent sized card and a sensible data plan turns the 5230 into a highly competitive package . You can pick up 8GB microSD cards from around ? 15 online . <p> It 's not a package that is going to get a lot of friends among power users . The compromises , while not having a huge impact on use in the real world , are going to be picked over and compared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 5230 . If you go looking for those areas -- the mono speaker , the plastic camera lens , the lack of a decent stylus , the lack of Wi-Fi , etc. -- then you will find fault with the 5230 . <p> But this is n't a full priced flagship . It 's a bulk handset , designed to get Symbian into as many hands as possible . The price point is a killer . It 's a perfect entry phone for new users to Symbian -- not so high that you would be scared away but low enough that you 're happy to shell out to find out what the fuss is all about . It makes a perfect second phone to have to loan out to friends , have around as an emergency phone , or take away on trips , knowing that if something happens to it then you 've not lost a huge investment and the phone is easily replaceable . <p> Heck , it 's chap enough that you could buy it as a Sat-Nav for your car , ignore all the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a dedicated GPS unit . <p> Nokia 5530 , 5230 and 5800 <p> So the 5230 is currently an anomaly in Nokia 's line up . It 's missing some key features that have been on all the recent S60 phones , yet if you give it a fair chance , you 'll be rewarded with a nice nippy smartphone in your pocket . In the long term view , I think this is destined to be Nokia 's entry level touch-based smartphone . If you move up a little bit higher , models are available with Wifi substituted for the GPS ( Nokia 5530 ) , or even the 5800 that has WiFi , GPS , and the improved camera lens from Carl-Zeiss . So everything in a nice , stepped progression . <p> You need a good first step though , and there 's no doubt that the 5230 is exactly that . The power users may view it with disdain , but this is n't S60 with stabilisers , it 's a perfectly priced entry level smartphone. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

They observed that here , tigers and cattle lived in perfect harmony and the population of cows was so high that the place was named Gopalakshetra . <p> The confluence of three streams -- Chelyadka , Byladi and Bettampadi added to the religious significance . The disciples chose to live here and consecrated the temple of Vishnumurthy . People revered the place and the practice of bathing in the spring and paying obeisance at the temple was cultivated .

As a result , the spring has ceased to be one these days . All one can find here is a concrete tank with a shallow pool of murky water during summer . However , during the monsoon season , the water table gets replenished and springs back to life . ? Probably , the only solution to preserve this wonder is to stop drawing water through borewells .

@@1448239 <h> More Signposts from the CarWale Journey <h> By Mohit Dubey <p> Traffic in south Bangalore , India <p> In my first post yesterday I wrote about finding the right co-founders . Here are some more lessons from my CarWale ride so far . <p> Lesson #2 : Expect the unexpected <p> In my 5 years of building CarWale , one thing I 've come to understand and accept in a startup is that you are never going to know what 's coming next . We have seen many lows , and at least an equal number of highs , and we 've had a lot of fun through it all . We could wake up to a product disaster and an extremely dissatisfied customer in the morning , only to find ourselves signing a dream deal that we thought was already lost a few hours earlier . It 's an emotional roller coaster . <p> And the unexpected sneaks up on you in ways you can not imagine . In the first year , we saw our hypotheses about the auto market changing every week . We realized what a waste it was to make a 60 page business plan that is rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Lesson #3 : Everything takes longer <p> This one is probably the most important lesson that I have learnt in building a startup -- " Everything takes longer than you would expect- sometimes two or three times longer . " <p> While all entrepreneurs should be optimistic in their belief of creating a better future , it would be disastrous to be optimistic about specific deals , projects , hiring or fund raising . Startups have little control or power over these things and a lot can and does go wrong with specific deals . In just my personal experience alone , I have seen all of following : <p> A big client pulling out at the last minute , even though all key decision makers may have been completely convinced over several weeks of meetings . <p> Even when commercial , marketing and business approves your contract , your big client 's legal team decides to sit on the contract for a good 3 months . <p> So what if that Venture Capitalist told you that none of their investment deals has ever taken more than 3 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past 6 months . <p> Critical product launches get delayed -- sometimes even for personal reasons ( a spouse or kid fall sick and keeps a core team member away from work for weeks on end ) . To compound the problem , key employees leave without as much as a by-your-leave . <p> These things wo n't kill your start-up , primarily because as an entrepreneur you 'll have the persistence , optimism and belief in the ' big picture ' to look past all of this . But just do n't depend on a specific deal or project . That stuff goes wrong all the time . <p> Entrepreneurs tend to work faster and expect everyone to be like that . They are desperate and want to act fast- but that 's not how everyone works . And therefore things move slow and its much helpful to be psychologically prepared for all our plans to take twice or thrice the time . <p> Lesson #4 : A startup is greater than the sum of its parts <p> My fourth lesson is that a startup is about many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things that we do every day . It 's never about one big deal , one big idea . One big hire rarely makes a successful company . Though we expect these deals , contracts , fund raising to turn around the company or get it to escape velocity- that 's not what I find to be true . The fact is that the daily choices we make lead to the greatest change . So while I never lose sight of big deals , more critical are the meetings we do for product changes , the priorities we focus on every week and the metrics we follow religiously to measure our success . <p> Mohit Dubey is CEO and Co-Founder of Carwale.com , South Asia 's leading car portal .

According to Ernst &amp; Young report , bulk of private sector interest in power is currently in generation due to the possibility of selling power at high prices . The report enlists number factors responsible for encouraging MPPs in India . The biggest one is the huge demand-supply gap in power sector . " As per CEA , Ministry of Power , India 's peak demand as on March 2009 was 109.8GW whereas the supply was 96.6GW . This resulted in peak demand shortage of around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 40% from 9.5GW in FY04 to 13.1GW in FY09 , " the report said . Another attracting factor is the merchant price which is far higher than the price charged in the case of long term PPA . " Short term or merchant prices are almost 2.4-2.5 times the long term prices , " it said . However , to ensure reasonable prices of electricity in the period of present shortages for inter-state day head transactions , CERC had recently put in a price cap mechanism on short term power sale for a period of 45 days . The minimum tariff or bidding price , as the case may be , had been specified at Rs0.10/kWh and the maximum ceiling of tariff or bidding price , as the case may be , had been specified at Rs8/kWh . Also , MPPs are not liable to meet any performance related milestones .

" Regulatory interventions by way of capping power prices or by restricting power projects from freely supplying power to the entity of their choice are another risk to which MPPs are exposed to , " it added . The report said the MPPs being financed in India have around 60-70% of the power tied up through long term sale arrangements to distributing companies or trading companies or industrial consumers so as to ensure cash flows sufficient enough to cover the debt servicing requirements . " This is specified by lenders through Debt Service Coverage Ratio covenant which requires developers to tie-up through a PPA such proportion of capacity , which is sufficient to service 1.1 to 1.3 times the annual repayment and interest obligations , " it added .

For example , in the interiors of a state like Bihar where conversations with the cows are the highlight of the day , it 's hardly likely to be a dialogue in Spanish while coaxing more milk out of the bovines . <p> Audiences in Bihar were left scratching their heads mid-film while Hrithik and Barbara cooed to each other in Spanish and English .

I am just back from Mumbai where I met the CEO of Big Pictures ( co-producer ) Kamal Gyanchandani and Rakesh Roshan . I clearly told them that what they did is not right .

Each game ends after the time limit of 5-15 minute expires , or when a team 's flag is captured , or usually after the " death " or " surrender " of a team . <p> The professional version of the game is even simpler , explains Ulrich Sthar , president of the European Paintball Confederation and head referee for the Millennium Series . " Each team has to try and get into the opponent 's base and hit the buzzer to get points . After a certain number of points , they win the game .

Today , we conduct practically one each day , " says Soans . <p> Not to mention the number of people who line up in malls , recreational areas and sports arenas across cities , to play for fun . For about Rs250 , a participant gets to play a few games of paintball , complete with ammunition of gel pellets with bright paint , a gun , goggles , protective gear and a face mask . <p> The NPL , which was founded in 2008 , has set up international paintball zones in Bangalore , Chennai , Hyderabad and Shillong and plans to set up zones in cities such as Mumbai , Delhi and Pune by the end of the year . <p> Sthar quotes global industry estimates of approximately 15 million people playing paintball at least once a year .

Sriramulu Naidu decided to throw his lot with the motion picture business . He underwent training in Premier Cinetone Studio in Coimbatore and developed many movie land friendships and life-long contacts with the some of them . One of them was R.K.

Naidu 's new studio was a model of discipline , cleanliness and one never found a cigarette or a ' bidi ' butt thrown around the campus . <p> Central Studios launched production and their first effort , " Tukaram " ( 1938 ) , was made in two languages - Tamil , and Telugu .

He is in the vanguard of the renaissance of contemporary Indian art . <p> A childhood spent between spells of hospitalisation and bouts of medical emergencies , Bose gave up his dream of becoming a doctor . <p> Freedom mantra <p> A resurrection , as he terms his recovery , led him into a world of total freedom . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , as I was a sick child , " he recollects , saying that it may be the reason for his liberated mindset . Hence unconventionality and non-conformism and iconoclasm came easily to him , which later found ample expression in his work . And just as he never got to hear ' no ' as a child , it was only ' nos ' in his early days as an artist . His ongoing show , ' NO ' in Dubai deals with the several nays that he encountered in his struggle to reach this point of success . <p> Bose was expelled from Sir JJ School of Arts , Mumbai ( 1992 ) for voicing his criticism about the institution . Nevertheless , he says he owes much to the college . It was there that he found a platform to express himself freely and got his initial break , the college canteen was the perfect ground for unfettered interactions .

All art is illegal because if one follows the rules then you are doing commissioned work or plainly mimicking .

By communism I mean sharing . Only if I have wealth can I share it . What will I share if I am poor ? <p> Bose does his philanthropy quietly . His latest project LaVA ( Laboratory of Visual Arts ) is his tribute to art aficionados .

@@1536231 <h> Bharati Shivaji has played a significant role in reviving and redefining the performance , music and repertoire of Mohiniyattam . <p> With all its lyrical charm and sublimated sensuousness , Mohiniyattam , the female dance form of Kerala , was able to attain national acclaim and acceptance only in the latter half of the last century . In those days , only a few dancers succeeded in challenging absurd prejudices associated with this rich lasya tradition . Of them , Bharati Shivaji is an icon who blazed a trail with conviction and missionary zeal . <p> From the 1980 's till today , Bharati has singularly entranced rasikas all over the world with a unique idiom that is intrinsic to Kerala . Among the many honours she has received so far are the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award and the Padma Shri . <h> Initial steps <p> The Tanjavur-born Bharati spent her childhood in north India . She learnt Bharatanatyam from Lalita Shastri from Kalakshetra .

She learnt Odissi from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sang for recitals of Odissi danseuse Samjukta Paanigrahi . <p> During this period , Bharati happened to see a Mohiniyattam presentation of Indrani Rahman . " The emotional correlation between the body movements and the myriad bhavas of Mohiniyattam moved me beyond words . A call from deep within prompted me to choose this as my sacred means of self-expression , " recalls Bharati . She was initiated into the basics of Mohiniyattam by Kalamandalam Radha Marar . Once she mastered the adavus and items of its limited repertoire , Bharati felt the need for exploring the aesthetic and spiritual terrains of the sringara rasa embedded in Mohiniyattam . <p> The evolution of Odissi as a stylistically nuanced dance was enough inspiration for Bharati to deconstruct the received structure of Mohiniyattam . The late Kamaladevi Chatopadhyaya encouraged her urge to reinvent the tradition of Mohiniyattam based on the ritual , folk and classical dance-theatre traditions of Kerala . Acquaintance with Kavalam Narayana Paniker had a profound impact on the dancer who began thinking in terms of the indigenous performing arts , both visual and aural . Back in Delhi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation to Krishnanattam , Kaikottikkali , Theyyam , Padayani , Thayambaka and Sopana Sangeetham . <p> Movements and music of these time-tested art forms found a fresh meaning and expression in the items she choreographed such as ' Ganapatistuti , ' ' Thauryathrikam , ' Ashtapadi and the Jeeva . Bharati substituted the swara segment of the conventional varnams with the vaytharis ( pnemonics ) of the edakka kooru and the thayambaka . <p> " I have been misunderstood as one who made revolutionary changes in the structure and content of Mohiniyattam . While looking at Mohiniyattam , I found that it had been sandwiched between Kathakali and Bharatanatyam . I wondered why one of the most graceful of our dance traditions turned away from the variegated treasures of Kerala 's performing arts and became susceptible to alien influences . I therefore decided to re-align the dance-form with the resources it is privileged to be in possession of .

The voice of the edakka proved to have a symbiotic link with the rest of the musical instruments . The end result was spectacular . <p> Bharati 's recitals began brimming with an ambience that was native to Kerala . <p> " I strongly doubt whether Mohiniyattam provides any scope for nritta , the so called pure dance . One can not intercept the emotional continuity of Mohiniyattam by displaying his/her rhythmic brilliance unlike in Bharatanatyam or Kuchippudi . And to be frank , I hate the translation of Mohiniyattam as the ' dance of the enchantress . " ' <p> The textual and structural alterations introduced by Bharati received bouquets and brick-bats .

Research organizations are there to conduct surveys based on varied &amp; diversified concepts and theories . They excel in coming out on n-number of unique reports -- this is atleast not an unusual report from discussion perspective . Thanls for your valuable comment . <p> Hi Viral , Did the survey just gather info from IT , call centre people ? Do people in finance/ media/ medicine/ civil engineering change jobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs often ? Do women and men change jobs as often or men switch frequently ? We Indians are an impatient lot . IT field started the trend with the onset of Y2K to lure capable employees with higher pay and titles . 10-15% higher pay , promise of advancement and potentially onsite work opportunities were all the carrot needed back then . A decade on do we still bite the same carrot ? People in similar nature of work abroad stick to their jobs longer than Indians do , because we got the adrenaline to keep going higher and go places all the time . In India , I think the result has been good for individuals as they get a good compensation and title but probably not so much of work life balance . However collectively , the country has become an expensive option for MNC 's and they are considering , and in certain cases already set up base in countries where the salary hikes y-o-y is not as high as in India . Some of those destinations have been China , Taiwan , Indonesia , Singapore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being critical of fellow Indians but simply making an observation . <p> Hello Madhav , Excellent comment on your insightful observation about Indian job markets and also as to how India could gradually be losing its sheen as a ' low cost ' destination for its labour market . The above report points out that the study is corroborated by the findings of factual job change in past six months , where again the scores related to the maximum employee churn are highest in India ( 45% ) followed by China ( 33% ) . Also , you can compare these figures with the global weighted average of 60% . In fact , on your query regarding the sectors which are witnessing this employee churn , the report points out that employees are as confident of getting a different job in another sector ( lateral carrer opportunities -- 74% ) as getting a similar job with a different employer . This reflects employees ' confidence in venturing into allied sectors and roles . Madhav ... The report has some contrasting views from that mentioned by you . I am not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true or realistic , and as Arun says many-a-times , that we have to take the findings in most of such reports with a pinch of the salt . Take this ... The report says that a significant percentage of Indian employees ( 85% ) seem to be in control of their work-life balance as compared to the global weighted average of 75% . The survey further says that the mobility index has increased the maximum amongst those above 35 years of age . <p> ohh yes .. The reason being indians on top positions in most of the fortune 500 companies is that they are more hardworking then any other . Most of the people from other countries just working 8hrs a day and 5 days a week without taking any tensions . where as Indians are more alert and tensed related to work and once they take up a task they give 100% to make it a success .

@@1536240 <h> Guide for curious mini-adults <p> Last updated : 26 June , 2010 <p> Yamini Vijayan <p> Author Interview <p> As a curious 12-year-old , I ? ve often stolen books by Judy Blume and Paula Danziger from my sister ? s guarded collection ... <p> ? These books had all the things I was dying to know about , all the things I was kept away from -- spin-the-bottle games where American teenagers kissed awkwardly , mysterious bodily changes , school crushes , curfews , bras -- since I was " far too young for all this . " But I ca n't recall many interesting Indian books that fitted into this genre back then , which could have given satisfying answers to all my embarrassing concerns . So it is exciting to come across Anjali Wason 's book , Body Talk ( Harper , 2010 ) , in which she responds to questions from young Indian women on the ways of the female body , sexuality , love , family and other relationships . Excerpts from an interview with the author : <p> You 've urged young women to question and explore the complexities of their mind , body , sexuality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book needed to be written ? <p> Well , every young woman has questions about her body , sex and relationships . We are all already questioning and discovering the complexities of our minds and bodies , but we do so in a very private manner . As a result , we can sometimes believe that our feelings and questions about sex are ' wrong ' or ' weird ' . Talking about sex is so taboo -- these conversations make the most savvy men and women giggle and squirm -- so we feel isolated and lonely when it comes to our anxieties about sex . These feelings of alienation are totally avoidable . That 's what motivated me to write Body Talk . I wanted to put together a book that provides reliable , accurate , non-judgmental , non-moralistic information about sex and sexuality . Young Indian women deserve that . We have our own unique sensibilities , cultures and values here , so a British book on sexuality wo n't give us information that is truly relevant to our context and moment . <p> Has the media and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their appearances ? <p> Definitely . Women in Indian cities are inundated with images of other women , and many of these images set unrealistic standards and expectations of how women should look and behave . That 's why its essential that young women have access to information that facilitates them accepting and loving themselves as they are . <p> In urban India , young adults prefer to keep the curious details of their lives away from their parents . Should we be concerned about this growing gap ? <p> On the one hand , these generation gaps have always existed . But yes , younger people are more sexually active and are also engaging in some risky behaviour . It 's essential that parents open their eyes about what it means to be a young person in today 's India and also equip themselves with the information that will help them have healthy , relevant discussions about sex with their children . <p> Indian teenagers are now far more familiar with sex than they were a decade ago . Are they growing up too soon ? <p> Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it 's tempting to lament a bygone era in which children were ? just children . However , such thinking is totally irrelevant to a project like Body Talk . If teenagers know much more than their parents did at that age , they need to be equipped with information . Many of the girls I spoke to displayed a remarkably mature sense of self . However , most did n't have enough information about the implications of the sexual activity they were curious about or engaging in . Sex can be a very beautiful and healthy part of life . But sex without information can have serious consequences . <p> Indian parents often shy away from discussing love , sex and bodily changes with their children . How important are these discussions since children have their own ways of learning about these issues from others sources ? <p> I do n't know if it 's only Indian parents who shy away from talking to their children about sex and their bodies . I think this is something all parents -- no matter where they live -- struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make themselves accessible to their children . No matter how ' uncomfortable ' or ' awkward ' it is to have a conversation about sex with your son or daughter , it 's imperative that parents attempt to provide accurate information about sex to their children . The information in magazines , on the Internet or from friends can often be exaggerated , inaccurate or misleading . The media does n't have children 's best interests at heart -- its primary concern is selling products. ? <p> Tell us a bit about your days as a young adult . Did it have anything to do with your interest in this subject ? <p> I , like all teens , was naturally curious about my body , sex and sexuality . I , like all other teens , talked mostly to my friends about it . These conversations with other young people could sometimes be helpful , but very often were misguiding . Thankfully , my mother had a very non-judgmental approach to sex and would subtly put across that she was always there if I needed to talk . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone trustworthy , someone who had my best interests at heart to talk to , I knew where to go . <p> Pick one book that young adults should ? ? definitely check out . <p> American Born Chinese by Gene Luen Yang is one of the best graphic novels to come out for young adults in this decade .

After its initial screening on BBC 's Channel 4 in February , it has been screened more than seven times on national television .

@@1544232 <p> A love story that tries hard not to be stereotypical- Punit Malhotra 's ' I Hate Luv Storys ' subverts generic clich ? s and turns accepted tenets of romance on it 's head . It 's also a parody on the industry that seems obsessed with love stories . <p> The storyline though is pretty non-existent . The plot exists of smartly manufactured ' situations ' that are strung together by wispy threads constituting several subplots . It 's a romantic comedy for sure but the mechanics at play are different from the run-of-the-mill . <p> Jay ( Imran ) meets Simran ( Sonam ) in a cinema and they feel an attraction to each other . But Simran is more or less engaged to the perfect guy Raj ( Samir Dattani ) while Jay is too much of a ' love ' hater to make much out of a stray attraction . <p> Then Simran comes to work for Jay 's boss Veer Kapoor ( Samir Soni ) , the foremost romance director of the film industry and things start hotting up . First they are just friends , then Simran falls in love with Jay , gets rejected and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simran , she rejects him . <p> The script turns around conventionally accepted filmy truisms of romance . What hitherto had been a male preserve in a romance gets transferred to the female . So while Simran manages to get on with her life and make practical decisions despite being emotionally suckered by humiliation and rejection , Jay is shown as weeping copious tears , baring his heart to his mother and also gets ridiculed for behaving in girlie fashion when it 's his turn to get rejected . <p> The relationship between Simran and Raj is typically Ken and Barbie . <p> He is good-looking , has a solid well-paying job and follows the norm ( read clich ? ) where romance is concerned . They wear the same colours , love the same things and get so boring in their ' together ' choices that it takes Jay 's entry into their lives to force them to evaluate their own antiseptic relationship . <p> The discontent is verbalized but visually there appears to be a disconnect . We get to know all this mainly from the superbly written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not sharp enough it tends more towards ploddy . The so-called fights between Simran and Raj appear to be mere expressions of minor discontent and not supportive of a dramatic shift in affection towards Jay . <p> But the parallel plot lines bring in greater rewards . Veer 's attempt to make the mushiest romance of all-time titled ' Pyar Pyar Pyar ' with reigning matinee superstars shores up the humour nicely . Veer appears to be a cross between Sanjay Leela Bhansali and Yash Chopra with character traits of the former and directorial savoir faire of the latter . His antics thereof are consistently chuckle-worthy . <p> The second half turnaround where Jay starts to feel his loss appears to be similar to the one in ' Jaane Tu ... ' but it 's not as convincing . It appears manipulative . The run in towards the climax also appears rushed . So much time was spent in establishing the stereotypes that the development becomes haphazard and the runtime gets extended to almost unbearable limits . <p> Vishal-Shekar 's music also tends to be a drag . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their respective performances .

Therefore , it can go on hiking the prices at will and the Opposition can go on calling strikes over its decision . We , the poor and the marginalised can rot in hell . <p> " The babus working in government offices must be elated over the fact that the bandh quite conveniently falls on a Monday -- they will get an extended weekend .

It will indeed impact the poor and the marginalised -- those who toil hard to earn their livelihood . But why should the political parties think about them ? <p> " They would rather use the issue of price rise as an elction plank . Who knows , it might help them win the election next time .

They are sane individuals with a clear sense of logic . No political outfit can hoodwink them for long . Just as the Indians denounce the illogical and maddening inflation , so also they condemn strikes and bandhs our leaders are so adept in calling at the drop of a hat . <p> " If the Opposition were so sympathetic about the issue , why did not it do something constructive that would counter inflation to some extent ? Why do they need to call a bandh that just leads to waste of money , time and mandays . <p> " It 's time we commoners get united and cry ourselves hoarse at these double-faced monsters .

Only after the bias voltage has spectroscopically been tuned to the very C60 molecules ( right ) , they become visible beneath the graphene layer as the cause of the stripe pattern . <h> How soccer ball molecules push their way under surfaces <p> Berlin Posted on July 13th , 2010 <p> Fullerene and graphene , two forms of carbon only recently discovered , have been stimulating the imaginations of researchers ever since their discovery ( fullerene in 1970 , graphene in 2004 ) . With graphene especially , researchers see a chance for a new chapter in electronics , since this semiconductor material could one day replace the long-standing key element silicon . For this to happen , it would have to be possible to dope graphene - which is a single-atom layer of graphite - with foreign atoms . And in such a way that the important structural properties of graphene remain intact . In the online preprint of August issue of the journal Advanced Materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ f ? r Materialien und Energie ( HZB ) report on a new technique of microscopy . With it , they can show how individual fullerene molecules used for doping push their way under a graphene layer that has been previously deposited onto a nickel substrate . <p> Graphene is the first crystal known to be stable in two dimensions , because its carbon atoms arrange themselves into a honeycomb structure of hexagons . Fullerene has the addition of pentagons , allowing a spherical structure for which the 60-carbon-atom molecule has made its name as the soccer ball molecule . <p> Andrei Varykhalov and colleagues deposited a thin layer of graphene onto a nickel substrate using chemical vapour deposition starting with propylene . Next , they inserted individual fullerene molecules between the nickel surface and the graphene layer . They achieved this by rapidly heating the sample to 400 degrees Celsius , followed by brief annealing . The crucial technique that allowed them to observe the fullerene molecules as they squeezed their way in - a process called intercalation - was scanning tunnelling microscopy . <p> An electrically conductive stylus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also conductive . Yet , the tip and object surface never come into contact , so no current flows at first . When the microscope tip comes to within a few tenths of a nanometre of the sample surface , however , the tunnel-ling effect kicks in . That means an exchange of electrons from the sample sur-face and tip starts to take place . If a voltage is then applied , a tunnel current flows , which responds with utmost sensitivity to the tiniest changes in distance . <p> The HZB researchers set up their scanning tunnelling microscopy experiment such that a clear contrast shows up as soon as the tip of the microscope per-ceives the fullerene molecules beneath the graphene surface . To obtain crucial parameters for this , they first studied the sample using synchrotron radiation at the storage ring BESSY II . <p> " Using our imaging technique , we can visualize intercalation compounds quite universally , " Andrei Varykhalov emphasizes the importance of the experiments .

R. lays bare all those inconvenient ' truths ' , mostly pertaining to all things female . The exhibition , on at Durbar Hall Art Centre , concludes on July 18 . <p> Both the artists are alumnae of the R. L. V. College of Fine Arts , Tripunithura . Rejani completed her MFA from RLV College whereas Suja is pursuing her MFA at Bangalore University ( Jnanabharathi campus ) . They are as different as chalk and cheese . Rejani can not extricate herself from the circumstances of living in society and for Suja the personal is the universal and this universal , very personal . <p> Rejani 's works are serious ; there is no escaping the weight of thought that has gone into the execution of each painting . Each painting engages society and norms in all earnestness . And the female , most of the time anatomical , becomes the site of the process of engaging . " I can not withdraw into the subjective when I paint , it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I see around me , " says Rejani . <p> Therefore there are paintings such as ' Hiccup ' , with a picture of the intestine , and there are tiny images of things that are missing from the lives of the financially-not-so secure . ' Abortion ' , is the artist 's impression of a uterus with kids , toys , a swing or a slide etc. which are in the process of being aborted . Rejani says the painting was the result of her stint as a teacher . " I saw how kids ' desires were being stifled by the ambitions of parents , " she says . Or it can also be interpreted as unborn generations . <p> The paintings , straightforward as they may seem , are layered . Then there are paintings such as ' Stain ' installations such as the ' Pink Pocket ' which turn the spotlight on the female anatomy . Necessary ? Artistic license ! Interesting nevertheless . The works have a distinct touch of feminism , but was it intentional ? No , says Rejani . For her it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she is a woman engaging with society as a woman . One of Rejani 's installations have a certain old world charm . ' Purse ' is almost a dozen ' rowkkas ' worn by elderly women in olden days . <p> Suja 's works on the other hand are playful . ' The Revolution of Blindness ' for instance , is a kitsch medley of colours and ideas . It is a fantastical painting , where fishes with human heads belch gas cylinder balloons , where the sun is a yellow spider ... all borne out of her impressions of her life in Bengaluru . There are multi-storeyed buildings , helicopters with cows suspended from it besides other elements . ' Dancers with weeping Breasts ' is an interesting idea which has been executed in an even more interesting manner . Painted coconut shells with sad eyes are the breasts of wiggly shapes with twine heads on a gunny cloth . Eye-catching and fun . " I wanted to create a work that was interactive and that is what I have tried to do here , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious but with that light touch of fun . If with Rejani the preoccupation was the female then Suja experiments with the masculine and therefore there is ' Egg Seller ' . ' Immolating flies ' , ' Dancers on the Mount Meru ' etc have balloons and dragon flies telling the story . ' I 'm me with my spiral eyes and violin hair ' too falls in the fun category . There is an installation ' Today 's Supper ' which is Suja 's **28;218;TOOLONG of being a woman . " These works are an expression of my experiences and impressions , " she says . <p> Through the art works on display Suja and Rejani have tried to do things differently without deliberately setting out to do that . But they have put up an exhibition that is decidedly different . 
@@1559232 for universal life policies <p> Mumbai : After tightening the norms for unit-linked insurance plans , or Ulips , the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority ( Irda ) is set to shift its focus to universal life insurance policies , fearing that the products may create another industry-wide controversy . <p> Irda and capital market regulator Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) , bitterly fought over the regulation of Ulips -- a hybrid product that combines investment in equities and bonds along with an insurance component -- till an ordinance settled the issue by asking Sebi to keep off Ulips . <p> Universal life insurance policies , like Ulips , combine investment and insurance . One part of the premium for such policies goes to buy life insurance and another gets invested in bonds or equities . <p> The structure of these hugely complex products are somewhat similar to Ulips even though here both the premium and the benefits are variable . Here the investors also run the risk of the policy lapsing if they are not able to pay premiums that keep rising during the tenure of the policy . <p> A senior Irda official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ released in the next couple of months for such policies . <p> " Universal life policies can be dangerous without a separate set of regulations . The customers can be exposed to very high risks unless stringent regulations are imposed on these investment-cum-insurance products , " added this person , who did not want to be identified . <p> Typically , the product has two elements -- investment and insurance . The investment amount earns interest , but as the cost of insurance increases every year with the policyholder getting older , more money flows from the investment account to the insurance account of the policyholder . <p> As the policy holder gets older , more money is used for the insurance cover and less and less money gets invested . In such a situation , the premium goes up , and if the policyholder is not able to pay the higher premium to keep the policy alive , it lapses and the customer loses the money . <p> A few Indian life insurers launched universal life insurance policies in 2009 after Irda capped Ulip charges . <p> Two such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ InvestAssure Plan by Reliance Life Insurance Co .

Irda has recently capped the surrender charges on these , brought in a five-year lock-in period for investors , and restricted fund management charges .

" There 's such a strong cultural ethos in this city , " says Rakhi Sarkar , director and curator of The Centre of International Modern Art ( Cima ) , Kolkata . Sarkar is also a managing trustee of the Kolkata Museum of Modern Art , which is expected to open in 2013 . " People ask me why Kolkata should be the place for a museum of modern art and I tell them , it 's the only city in India that can sustain a cultural institution of this magnitude , " she says . Sarkar does admit , however , that the city 's art scene has suffered over the past decades . " There were a combination of factors , like the reticence of artists and the fact that Bengal went through an economic low since the 1960s , " says Sarkar . " It was n't that there were n't good artists but they were n't nurtured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Bengal art entered the spotlight in the early 20th century thanks to artists such as Abanindranath Tagore and Nandalal Bose of the Bengal School . By the 1920s , however , modernism was the new favourite . From the Calcutta Group of the 1940s to the pop modernism of Jamini Roy 's paintings and the communism-inspired idealism of Somnath Hore , Bengal Modernism spanned more than three decades and was a dynamic movement . The last of the golden years were in the 1960s . Artists such as Bikash Bhattacharya , Ganesh Pyne , Meera Mukherjee and K.G. Subramanyan had a lasting impact upon the next generation . <p> " The history of modernism in Bengal art is very strong , " says artist Paula Sengupta , who also teaches at Rabindra Bharati University and heads the Kolkata chapter of Khoj , the New-Delhi based collective that supports experimental art projects . " In fact , I 'd say it was too strong . That was such a dominant period that a whole generation of artists , from the 1970s onwards and particularly in the 1980s and 1990s , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning of the bleak chapter in Bengal art . " While the 1970s and 1980s saw artists elsewhere , such as Vivan Sundaram and Nalini Malani , experimenting with multidisciplinary practices , Bengal art , more so from the 1980s , curled into modernism and resolutely persevered with it , uncaring of becoming outdated . <p> With Indian art finding favour in the international market in the noughties , artists who had developed their styles in the couple of decades past rose to stratospheric heights . Established centres of art such as Mumbai and Vadodara attracted talent from all over the country and provided platforms for people with innovative practices such as Atul Dodiya , N.S. Harsha and Pushpamala N. Some emerged from places not known for modern art . Subodh Gupta , for example , studied at Patna University . When he decided to make a move , he chose Delhi over Kolkata . In 1997 , he became one of the founding members of Khoj and developed his now-famous style of sculpture . <p> Bengal , by contrast , suffered a creative drought in the last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was caught in its own vibe , " says art historian Tapati Guha Thakurta . " The art world in Calcutta became more impoverished , both financially and in terms of creativity . Bengal artists tended to fit into one of two moulds : that of Bikash Bhattacharya or Ganesh Pyne . " <p> Kolkata 's contribution in the past 20 years is limited to a handful of names , of which the most famous today are Chittrovanu Mazumdar , Jogen Chowdhury and Paresh Maity . None of Bengal 's younger artists have reached the international stature that the likes of Dodiya and Gupta have attained . Few have the reputation of being consistently innovative . " The modernist period was so dominant in Kolkata that those who were doing more contemporary practices found it difficult to find a voice , " says Sengupta . " What happened as a result was that these practices did n't see gallery spaces but went on in campuses and fostered an environment . " Artists such as Partha Pratim Deb , who found little support from commercial spaces for his art in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor in Rabindra Bharati University , Deb has been the mentor to some of the most exciting artists working in Bengal today , such as sculptor Adip Dutta and installation artist Sanchayan Ghosh . <p> The silver lining is that some of those who persevered in the silo of Kolkata 's art world have developed distinctive styles . While the rest of contemporary Indian art races towards new media , Bengal artists are more interested in reinventing and reinterpreting conventional artistic practices , such as sculpture and painting . Dutta 's fascinating fibreglass and steel wool sculptures or Debnath Basu 's curious paintings exploring the mechanics of the human body and language are heartening examples of a contemporary Bengal school . However , these artists are far more low profile than their peers from other parts of India . Ghosh , for example , believes he should be undercover and only his art should be in public . <p> " I 'd like to say there are exciting times ahead , " says Sengupta . " I think there are more of this younger generation doing contemporary work than there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scene is encouraging . While Kolkata is yet to shake off its modernist fascination , there are a few determined initiatives to introduce a contemporary flavour to the city by galleries such as Akar Prakar , Gandhara and Aakriti , along with the recently opened Harrington Street Arts Centre and Experimenter . Khoj 's Kolkata chapter was set up in 2005 , and provided a platform for experimental works . In 2008 , Cima began Studio 21 , a non-commercial space for workshops and multidisciplinary works . " Things are changing , " says Noni Khullar . She and her husband Deepak opened the Harrington Street Arts Centre last year . " The visual register of Kolkata was quintessentially modern , but recently there has been an attempt to reconsider this visual register , " she says . <p> All the gallerists are buoyed by the enthusiastic responses they get from viewers who often return to see the same exhibitions . " I may not have a good quality printer here and most of our artists and curators may be from outside but the quality of interaction you get from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raja , who started Experimenter in 2009 with her husband Prateek . <p> The biggest challenge for gallerists , however , remains finding the talent . " From what we 've seen , in Santiniketan , for example , they 're one generation behind , " says Raja . " The works done by the young artists mostly do n't compare with works done by similar age groups in the rest of the country and internationally , " she says . " Even if the practice is technically strong , there just is n't enough awareness of the ideas circulating in the world around them . I do n't think they 're thinking . " <p> The concerns in Kolkata 's art circles today are no different from those of contemporary Indian art in general : how to develop an Indian visual art tradition that is distinctive , current and not derivative .

Perhaps the city 's distance from international trends and commercial success will prove to be a blessing in disguise . Perhaps the enthusiastic viewing culture will goad artists .

Everything looked so glossy , just getting through written exam was what in my mind . <p> After getting through the written exam , next big thing ahead of me was clearing interviews and group discussions . Finally , all my efforts helped me get a seat in BIM , Trichy . <p> I had a month and a half before I had to join the institute . The happiness of achievement reigned over me and I wanted to enjoy that moment like anything completely unaware as to what is waiting for me . Being from North India , joining a college in South was in itself a good enough reason to be so excited . I was quite well prepared to meet any language barriers . <p> Finally , the day arrived when I had to bid bye to all my relatives and friends and start for a new journey of my life . I was feeling excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I get good placement with good pay . When I reached the hostel I was getting to know my classmates who came from varied backgrounds . Some did B.Com , some did engineering , some were doctors and many more . The first day in a B-school , was in itself a special feeling . Immediately after registration , I got the first shock of my life at B-School in the form of case on decision modeling even before any class , which had to be submitted by the next morning . At first , I thought a case even before any class is something impossible . But when I saw others putting in efforts to reach to a solution , I had to do something . We had to form a group of five on our own which was a Herculean as well as a learning task for all of us on the very first day . After forming the group , we could finally arrive at a solution only by 2:00 am . <p> The second shock came when we got the schedule of the week ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning to 9:00 pm in the night . It took me some time to digest this . And to add this we had continuous lectures of a single faculty for as much as four hours . Boy , I never had a lecture of any professor for more than an hour in my entire life . To top it all , the shift of my diet from north Indian dishes to south Indian dishes made me buy a pack of " Pudin Hara " . Thanks to the supporting seniors who helped us a lot from time to time whenever we needed them . <p> " Socha tha kya , kya ho gaya " was the only song I could remember of all through this period . Sleeping at 2:00am and getting up at 7:00am to attend class from 8:00am became a normal schedule for me . Our patience was tested to the extent when we had personality development course from 6:00pm to 3:00am . I cursed every morning , none other than myself , and my decision to join a B-School . Only then did I understand why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to do an MBA ? " <p> Dealing with presentations and assignments became a normal routine . And we slowly adjusted to the long four-hour lectures . Then came the MARWAR-2004 week which made us know the real picture of what lies ahead of us , not only in the coming two years , but later as well . The professors had all planned to load us with umpteen numbers of assignments , classes and tests in the week which showed us our real potential and taught us the ability to handle pressures . <p> Being an engineer , the accounting and economics classes were a nightmare for me . Till date I have not been able to balance even a single balance sheet . <p> But thankfully it was not the case with me only ; every engineer had a similar experience except a few who had a prior work experience . <p> But now when I look back after completing my first trimester as to what value addition I have , I see a clear difference in me than what I was three months back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full twenty-four hours in a day , which can be , used effectively what we had been wasting till now . Time management is one real asset that I developed in these three months . Joining BIM has given me with an opportunity to meet people with varied backgrounds , get a good network of intellectual people and give a chance to learn Tamil . Much software that I learnt for problem solving has given me an edge over any other MBA graduate of first year in the country . <p> But we still keep our fingers crossed coz we never know what is in bag for us the next morning .

" I am tired of paying rent , " he adds . <p> Four years after the initial deadline to complete the flats has passed , the doctor , who now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is yet to begin . <p> In reply to a letter written by Dr Shankar , Sahara claimed an alternate site has been identified and land acquisition is in progress , following " uncalled-for interference from various quarters " in buying the original piece of land . <p> " There is not even clarity on whether Sahara has land to develop the project , " Shankar rues . <p> Shankar 's experience is not an exception . Outlook Business spoke with nearly a dozen people in three cities who have experienced such delays in projects developed by Sahara Prime City , the Sahara Group company that has filed its draft red herring prospectus ( DRHP ) with the market regulator . <h> Sahara 's delayed housing projects : Why you MUST read this ! <p> Take the case of G Krishnamurthy , who , in 2004 , booked a two-bedroom flat in a housing project developed by Sahara in Chennai . <p> He even sold his relatively small flat located very close to T Nagar , one of the city 's busiest market areas , hoping to move into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Krishnamurthy has so far paid nearly Rs 6 lakh ( Rs 600,000 ) for the 1,249 sq ft flat and has been waiting for the last five years to occupy his own flat . At present , he lives in a rented house . <p> " We all believed in the popularity of the company , " says Krishnamurthy , who took voluntary retirement as legal officer from a state-run transport corporation . <p> The Sahara group is known for its high-profile sponsorship of the Indian cricket team , with its logo displayed prominently as well as its own Indian Premier League team , Sahara Pune Warriors . Such endorsements are one reason for high brand recall for Sahara . <p> If the cricket connection was enough to convince some people of the legitimacy of the group , for others it was Sahara 's para-banking operations and the wide network of field agents that was the clincher . <p> Dr Shankar , for instance , had been a depositor for nearly five years before he booked the flat in 2004 . " I used to keep deposits with them ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was at this time that the local area manager asked me to book a flat developed by Sahara , " he adds . <p> Both Shankar and Krishnamurthy are now in touch with each other , sharing their common plight and deciding on their future course of action to realise their dreams of owning a flat . <p> Indeed , Krishnamurthy has institutionalised his crusade . In March 2010 , he helped form the Sahara City Homes Chennai Members Association comprising home owners-in-waiting like him . In less than four months , membership has grown to over 200 . <h> Sahara 's delayed housing projects : Why you MUST read this ! <p> Among its grouses , the association claims Sahara has not disclosed key details regarding the Chennai project in the Initial Public Offer documents submitted to the Securities and Exchange Board of India nearly a year back . <p> Incorrect information in the IPO document ? <p> Companies that want to tap the market for funds are required to submit the DRHP with the market regulator . Only after Sebi gives its nod can companies raise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sahara Prime City , the real estate arm of the Sahara group , the DRHP was filed in September last year . With more than 10 months having passed , Sebi seems to be in no hurry to give its nod . <p> Although it 's common for the market regulator to take more time to clear an IPO document filed by real estate companies , as in the case of Emaar MGF and DLF , it is quite unusual to take nearly a year . <p> " Such a long delay is an indication that Sebi is raising concerns on disclosure level in the document , " says Prithvi Haldea , managing director of Prime Database , which maintains 20-year data on money raised by companies from the market and also a database on directors . <p> Krishnamurthy , who is also the president of Sahara City Homes Chennai Members Association , says Sebi should take action against Sahara for disclosing incorrect information about land reclassification regarding the Chennai project . <p> The DRHP says that Sahara Prime has filed an application and is waiting for approval for reclassification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case is the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority . <p> Krishnamurthy claims there was no file pending with CMDA when the association enquired about the status of the application with the urban authority . <p> " When we verified , we found CMDA has returned the file with some preliminary queries . Thereafter , Sahara has not yet filed another application , " he adds . <h> Sahara 's delayed housing projects : Why you MUST read this ! <p> " The IPO document says Sahara Prime has paid Rs 31 crore ( Rs 310 million ) for acquiring 117 acres of land for the Chennai project . Till now , we have not been taken by Sahara for a site visit to the land they have acquired , " says Ramesh Haritwal , secretary of the Chennai-based association . <p> CMDA officials could not be reached for comments . <p> Now , Sahara City Homes Chennai Members Association is planning to write to Sebi , claiming the DRHP did not fully disclose the facts about the company 's operations . <p> Rejecting there is any incorrect information , Abhijit Sarkar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written reply to Outlook Business , says , " The application for Reclassification ( Conversion ) of Land uses submitted to the CMDA ( in November 2007 ) came back with some queries in June 2009 . Therefore , the application was with CMDA at various levels and under examination . After that , most of the queries have been resolved and the application for CLU will be resubmitted very soon . " <p> Even in the case of the Bengaluru project , the information given in the DRHP varies from the information given to the allottees through written communication . <p> In a letter addressed to Shankar 's daughter and dated just two months before the prospectus was filed last year , Sahara Prime City wrote , " the land acquisition is under process . You would certainly appreciate that facilities required for the committed lifestyle demands a large area and , therefore , a total of 360 acres of land is required for the Bengaluru project . " <p> However , the prospectus paints a completely different picture when it comes to land details . Bengaluru is listed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IPO will be used . <p> Sahara claims it has 77.69 acres of land for the Bengaluru project and has paid the entire amount of Rs 70.83 crore ( Rs 708.3 million ) for the land . <p> Thus , in less than three months , Sahara Prime 's project size shrunk from 360 acres to 78 acres -- and buyers were not intimated of this . <h> Sahara 's delayed housing projects : Why you MUST read this ! <p> " The communique to the prospective buyers as well as the information given in the DRHP are both correct , " says Sarkar in the email reply . <p> " We had planned for 360-acre land acquisition in Bengaluru . The same information was provided in the communique . We have acquired 60 acre land Outlook Business 's initial email mentioned the size as 60 acres , not 78 acres so far and it is a known fact that the acquisition of land and its due readiness for construction is a lengthy legal process which runs parallel to acquisition . Therefore , there is no dichotomy in our communique @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But it is not just the level of disclosure that is under question . Experts also point to related party transactions between promoter group companies that will hurt the interests of outside shareholders . <p> At arm 's length ? <p> The entry of Sahara Prime into the real estate business coincided with closure of its non-banking finance company operations in 2007 . <p> The way it was done was not through building up the operations from the ground up but through a single multi-crore transaction . <p> Until two years ago , Sahara India Commercial Corporation held almost all the real estate assets of the group , with the promoters -- Sahara Group chairman Subrata Roy and his family -- holding 100% stake in this firm . <p> But in an agreement dated March 31 , 2008 -- the last day of the financial year -- SICCL transferred its real estate assets in 186 cities and towns to Sahara Prime for Rs 814 crore ( Rs 8.14 billion ) . <p> It did n't end there . Less than six months after this transaction , Sahara Prime sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SICCL for Rs 736 crore ( Rs 7.36 billion ) . <p> Under the terms of the agreement , SICCL paid Rs 473.3 crore ( Rs 4.733 billion ) as advance money , with the balance to be paid when the final agreement was signed . Further , a discount of 10-15% on the prices of the residential units was given to SICCL . <h> Sahara 's delayed housing projects : Why you MUST read this ! <p> The bare bones of this proposed transaction are given in the DRHP , but the IPO document is strangely silent on many pertinent questions : who did the valuation when a promoter company sold its real estate assets to Sahara Prime ? <p> What valuation method was used to arrive at the final value ? And why was the right to sell the residential units given to SICCL ? <p> If Sahara Prime has paid less than the market value of the assets it took over , then its shareholders would benefit . But if it has over paid , it would work otherwise . <p> " These appear to be pertinent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be only a few of the several issues that Sebi could be worried about , " says Haldea . <p> Typically , when an acquisition is made , companies undertake due diligence by employing third-party firms so as to estimate the fair value . If that procedure was followed with the Sahara Prime-SICCL deal , surely it would have been mentioned in the DRHP as an example of good corporate governance ? <p> The agreement to sell was revisited in August last year , just a month before Sahara Prime filed the IPO document with the market regulator . Unlike last time where it was only a letter of intent , this time around , a definitive agreement was reached to sell residential units . <p> However , there was one huge difference . In the second agreement dated August 2009 , the transaction value nearly doubled to Rs 1,419.72 crore ( Rs 14.197 billion ) . Again , no explanation was given why the transaction value doubled in less than one year when it is based on the selling price of residential units . <p> Has the company managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or has it sold more units to SICCL ? These questions remain unanswered . <p> According to the information given in the DRHP , out of the agreed transaction amount , only 33 per cent or Rs 473.29 crore ( Rs 4.733 billion ) has been received by Sahara Prime . The rest will be paid based on the progress of the construction activities and money realised from allottees . <h> Sahara 's delayed housing projects : Why you MUST read this ! <p> What is likely to impact the minority shareholders of Sahara Prime post-listing is the fact that nearly 80 per cent of the residential units developed are to be sold to SICCL , which is entirely held by promoters , at a fixed price of 10 per cent discount to the listed price . <p> The nature of this agreement means that SICCL will pocket any upside from the selling price , whereas Sahara Prime -- which is running on money raised from the public -- would end up with fixed earnings . <p> Typically , the value of a residential unit goes up when the pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often hold a percentage of residential units for sale at the last stage of the project , hoping to cash in on a higher selling price . <p> However , in the deal between Sahara Prime and SICCL , the former will not benefit from last stage price spikes . <p> The agreement says SICCL will sell 4,198 units out of the total 5,410 units sold to end users in the 10 ongoing projects executed by Sahara Prime . " This agreement is not friendly to the interests of the minority shareholders , " says Haldea . <p> When asked about these transactions , Sahara 's reply was , " The replies to your queries are available in the DRHP itself . Any further disclosures as may be legally required will be done at RHP ( red herring prospectus ) stage . " <p> If the unanswered questions regarding valuation on bulk sales of residential units are n't worrying enough , there are also concerns that Sahara Prime will not be the only entity within the group that will operate in the real estate business , leading to conflict of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the real estate assets from Sahara Commercial in 2008 , the intention was that the IPO-bound company would manage all realty activities of the group . But Aamby Valley , Sahara group 's most ambitious township project , has been kept outside of Sahara Prime . <p> Further , Sahara Prime 's DRHP says , " Although it is intended that we will exclusively hold and manage all of our promoters ' and group companies ' real estate development and construction activities , except for Aamby Valley City , there is no non-compete agreement in place between us ( Sahara Prime ) and any promoter of any group company . " <h> Sahara 's delayed housing projects : Why you MUST read this ! <p> " There can be no assurance that our promoters or group companies will not provide comparable services , expand their presence or acquire interests in competing venture in the locations in which we operate , " Sahara Prime 's DRHP adds . <p> Simply put , that means Sahara 's promoters are free to float another company that will compete against Sahara Prime 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in response to a questionnaire sent to them , now claims , " There has never been any statement to the effect that all kinds of real estate activity will be under the aegis of SPCL ( Sahara Prime City ) . " <p> " From the point of corporate governance , it 's always better not to have any conflict of interest . Shareholders of Sahara Prime would be better served if Aamby Valley is merged , " says an accounting expert , who did not wish to be identified . <p> " It is pertinent to note that the products of AVL &amp; SPCL are quite different from each other and cater to different market segments . <p> Moreover it is to be particularly noted that Aamby Valley is much beyond plain vanilla real estate activity as it constitutes an entire city development work , hence the decision to keep AVL outside the purview of SPCL , " says Sarkar 's email reply to Outlook Business . <p> Aamby Valley , near Lonavla , Maharashtra , is one of Sahara 's relatively successful projects , where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space ( including facilities ) . <p> The project potential is so high that serial investor C Sivasankaran took a 49 per cent stake in Aamby Valley in 2007 and 2008 . Further , his firm Siva Ventures has subscribed to preference share capital and debentures of Aamby Valley ( for an undisclosed amount ) . ( See : Sivasankaran 's Footprints In The Sand ) . <p> Sivasankaran 's footprints in the sand <p> Serial investor C Sivasankaran has invested in three Sahara group companies , either through Siva Ventures or in his individual capacity . Siva Ventures , the primary investment vehicle for the Sterling Infotech group , has a 49 per cent stake in Aamby Valley , one of Sahara 's biggest realty projects . The value of the investment is not known , but the investment was made in 2007 according to the IPO document filed by Sahara Prime . Sahara now says it has bought out SVL 's stake in Aamby Valley . <p> Sivasankaran in his individual capacity holds an 18.92 per cent stake in Sahara TV Mauritius , a company registered under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invested $27 million in Sahara One Media and Entertainment , 2007 , according to an information memorandum released by Siva Ventures in August 2009 . But this shareholding is not listed in the IPO document filed by Sahara Prime , except to say private corporate bodies hold more than 24 per cent of equity capital in Sahara One Media . <h> Sahara 's delayed housing projects : Why you MUST read this ! <p> At the time of filing the DRHP , Siva Ventures was the single-largest shareholder in Aamby Valley , the remaining shares held in the names of different promoters and their entities . <p> Now , Sarkar of Sahara group says , " The entire stake of SVL ( Siva Ventures ) in Aamby Valley has been re-acquired by Sahara . " <p> According to the IPO document , Aamby Valley received Rs 810 crore ( Rs 8.10 billion ) as advance from Sahara Prime in 2008-09 , but the same amount was taken back in the same fiscal . <p> The DRHP says the amount was " paid to acquire substantial assets of Aamby Valley Lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make it subsidiary of the company . Transaction as above could not be agreed at acceptable price between the parties , hence the money was refunded . " <p> It is not clear from whom Sahara Prime was trying to acquire the stake : Siva Ventures or from the promoters of the Sahara group . <p> Based on the advance amount given , the valuation for Aamby Valley alone would surpass the total amount paid by Sahara Prime to acquire real estate assets of SICCL in 186 cities . <p> " No disagreements per se . The transaction was not finalised , as the parties could not arrive at a mutually agreeable price , " explains Sarkar . <p> For Shankar and Haritwal , these issues are yet to resonate with them . They only complain of the frequent changes in the name of the entity they are dealing with . <p> Shankar booked his flat with a company called Sahara City Homes Marketing and Sales Corporation . Now he is dealing with Sahara Prime City . But when enquiries are made with civic authorities , it turns out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the application for permission from civil authorities to use the land for non-agricultural purposes . <h> Sahara 's delayed housing projects : Why you MUST read this ! <p> The multiplicity of companies has only added to the confusion , claims Krishnamurthy . <p> In fact , Sahara Prime has changed its name four times since its inception ( See : The Name Game ) . Initially starting as Sahara India Financial Corp in March 1993 , the company 's name was then changed to Sahara Prime in February 2008 . Prior to this , the company carried on its business as an NBFC that ran into rough weather . <p> The name game <p> Sahara Prime 's name changes over the years : <p> Sahara India Financial Corporation -------- March 1993 <p> Sahara India Corporation ------------------ October 1994 <p> Sahara India Investment Corporation ------- August 2005 <p> Sahara Prime City **26;454;TOOLONG February 2008 <p> The devil is in the DRHP details <p> Sahara Prime holds 8,484 acres of land .

So far , it has cost them Rs 1.05 lakh ( Rs 105,000 ) per acre . <p> The company says it has paid for 99.34 per cent of land reserves . But 13 per cent of land reserves are under litigation . " Approximately 3.32 per cent total land reserves are subject to litigation proceedings and 9.28 per cent of the total land reserves are under process of mutation in land records , " Sahara claims . <p> Of the total land reserves , the company holds the title in its name for 5,235 acres . It has development rights for another 2,058 acres , for which ownership is not with Sahara Prime . For the rest , the company has signed a memorandum of understanding with land owners . <h> Sahara 's delayed housing projects : Why you MUST read this ! <p> The Sahara group 's rise was on the back of its NBFC operations . Its gargantuan network of agents collected as little as Rs 50 and Rs 100 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15,000 crore ( Rs 150 billion ) , when the Reserve Bank of India clamped down on Sahara India Financial Corp in 2008 , citing various irregularities and violation of regulations . <p> In 2007 , Sahara group had two licences from the RBI . Sahara India Investment Corporation , which later changed its name to Sahara Prime , had the NBFC licence . <p> Another group company , Sahara India Financial Corporation , functioned as a residuary NBFC -- a company whose principal business is acceptance of deposits and investing in approved securities . <p> While Sahara India Investment voluntarily exited the non-banking finance business in September 2008 after the RBI cancelled its certificate of registration , SIFCL fought its case till the end before the RBI asked it not to accept new deposits beyond June 30 , 2011 . <p> It is also required to reduce its deposits to zero by June 30 , 2015 . <p> Earlier , in June 2008 , the RBI cited five violations of guidelines by SIFCL that forced the central bank to issue an order prohibiting the company from accepting new deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Know Your Customer ( KYC ) norms while opening the accounts , and lack of details of the agents employed for deposit mobilisation . Another one related to how the company 's investments violated RBI 's directions . <p> Until the time the RBI intervened , SIFCL 's operations were running profitably . For example , in fiscal 2007 , the company reported an income of Rs 1,289.74 crore ( Rs 12.897 billion ) and a profit after tax ( PAT ) of Rs 17.74 crore ( Rs 177.4 million ) . <p> In the next fiscal , the income rose to Rs 1,727 crore ( Rs 17.27 billion ) while PAT rose sharply to Rs 232.85 crore ( Rs 2.328 billion ) . But in fiscal 2009 -- that is , after the RBI intervened -- SIFCL reported a loss of Rs 38 crore ( Rs 380 million ) on an income of Rs 1,702 crore ( Rs 17.02 billion ) . <h> Sahara 's delayed housing projects : Why you MUST read this ! <p> " Given several concerns , including the company 's track record with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unlikely to approve this IPO ( Sahara Prime 's ) without proper scrutiny , " says Haldea of Prime Database . <p> But it will take more than just convincing the market regulator about the information supplied in the IPO prospectus for Sahara Prime to successfully tap money from the public . <p> " The Sahara group aspires to become a large real estate company in India and has launched a lot of projects . But consumers need to see completed projects to gain confidence in the builder , " Vineet Kumar Singh , business head of real estate portal 99acres.com . <p> Outlook Business 's enquiries enquired about the status of Sahara 's project in three other locations ( Aurangabad , Jaipur and Zirakpur ) apart from Chennai and Bengaluru do n't inspire confidence . <p> In all three places , the project has been delayed : either the construction is going slow or it has not started at all . <p> " People who have invested their money in Sahara 's projects have lost money because of continuous delay . The company has to move in fast to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consultant , who declined to be named . <p> As for Dr Shankar , his only hope is that the wait is not too long for him to own a flat in Bengaluru , a dream for which he has worked all his life . <p> Of course , after already waiting for half a decade , the pensioner is under no illusions .

Almost every government over the past two decades has said they would put a stop to tax dodging for the benefit of the country . <p> But there is reason for hope this time round , if only because the accumulation of failed promises in the past has helped fuel such a deep and dangerous crisis . <p> In April , Papandreou 's government passed a law that forces small businesses to use cash registers and requires all payroll and business transactions to be carried out through bank accounts . The new law empowers auditors to levy fines directly and confiscate assets for debt liabilities to the state . <p> The government has set up a hotline to report incidents of bribery or tax evasion and introduced rewards for information leading to arrests for those crimes . <p> It also re-launched the Financial and Economic Crimes Unit , which was effectively inert during five years of conservative rule . Reporting directly to the Finance Minister , the unit investigates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often refer cases . <p> It employs 1,300 staff nationwide , including 500 in Athens , and has a permanent public prosecutor on board . A computer system allowing it to cross-reference data is in a pilot stage and should be in full operation by 2011 . That should make enforcing controls much easier and more effective . <p> In a March speech , Papandreou , the son and grandson of former Greek leaders , made the tax system his number one priority . " To give you just one measure of the scope of that problem : Fewer than 5,000 Greeks declare incomes of EUR100,000 or more , " he said . " And that pattern must end , and it will end . " <p> As evidence that it is serious about enforcing change , Athens in May announced the names of 68 high-earning doctors found guilty of tax evasion . " We sent a message to society by announcing these names , " says the unit 's new chief Ioannis Kapeleris , a veteran taxman at the finance ministry . <p> " There is a clear political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ethos . Inertia in the past few years had not only led to poor revenues but to a climate of tax chaos in society . " <p> You only have to look out of Kapeleris 's window to see how serious the problems are . Along Piraeus Street , which links central Athens with the country 's main port , run-down industrial estates were gentrified in the run-up to the 2004 Olympics . In the heady days of 4 percent economic growth , the street became a fashionable night club spot . <p> Now the crisis has plunged the road back into its former decrepit state , with shops shut and beggars loitering at traffic lights . At tavernas and cafes , Greeks talk about how their prosperity was built on fragile foundations -- a boom based on cheap loans , grey money and state handouts . <p> " Greeks got fake money , credit card money , and they were spending it like there was no tomorrow , " says Sofia Fachidou , 52 , who owns a jewellery shop . " But it was n't only their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dodgers - made them believe in the economic development bubble . " <p> Further underlining the enormity of the problem , a 2009 study by U.S. academics Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff asserts that Greece easily leads the European field with its history of sovereign default . It has spent more than half the years since 1800 in default or restructuring , according to their book , " This Time is Different " . <p> THE CORRUPTORS AND THE CORRUPTED <p> Long dissatisfied with public services and angry at politicians amassing fortunes at the expense of the state , most Greeks see little wrong with cheating the taxman . Many Greeks understate their income -- particularly farmers , over half of whom were found to under-report in a study published by the London School of Economics ( LSE ) in January . It also found men living alone are bigger offenders than single women . <p> Shopkeepers regularly quote two prices when selling goods and services -- one with and one without Value Added Tax . Or take the roadside bookseller who on a sunny day in central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receipt . <p> " I 've never had a problem with the taxman , I always hand out receipts , " he declares . " Tax evasion is rife but it is the rich who are doing it . The state should go after them . But all they know how to do is pursue the poor -- it is always them who end up paying . " <p> It does n't help that close to 35 percent of Greek workers are self-employed , family workers or the owners of small or medium enterprises -- more than double the EU average . Almost a quarter of the self-employed under-report , according to the LSE study . " People who are not the payroll can understate their income , " says Dimitris Karantinos , director of research at Greece 's National Centre of Social Research . " We do not have a serious mechanism of checks . We have 800,000 SMEs , but if only 1,000 are inspected , we are not doing much . " <p> And all too often , tax inspectors themselves have been part of the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax offices among the top three public services asking for bribes . In terms of the size of the average bribe requested , tax offices topped the bill at 1,684 euros . <p> " Corruption among tax officials is widespread , " says Abraham Panidis , president of the Pahnellenic Federation of Self-Employed Tax Advisors ( POFEE ) . " It results in people evading tax -- but also in people who try to honestly do their books getting into trouble . " <p> Some of the new tax laws have come in for criticism as well . Panidis says they are obscure even for accountants , making it possible for even the well-intentioned taxpayer to fall foul of the law . " We have too many laws voted on by politicians that do not know what is in them . I do not believe there is a Greek today who can do their books on their own . " <p> Mary Psylla , head of PricewaterhouseCoopers ' tax team in Greece , believes tax inspectors have used the regular changes in legislation to their advantage . " Tax is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says . <p> " The tax system in Greece was unfavourable due to its vagueness and because it changes often , even once and twice a year , based on the demands of public finances . What is needed now is activation of the inspection mechanism at all levels . " <p> WHAT IS BRIBERY ? <p> That 's what the government says it is doing . In May , Athens replaced 20 tax office directors citing their poor performance . It rotates staff working on big corruption cases and has stepped up checks on taxmen themselves . <p> It seems to be working . " In the first six months of the year , we collected more taxes than the whole previous year , " Kapeleris told Reuters . <p> But not every inspector is happy . Dimitris Tsoukas , sitting at his long dark wooden desk with a gold-plated sign displaying his position as manager at a central Athens tax office , has been working for 30 years as a taxman , and now speaks fondly of the idea of returning to a sideline in teaching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet targets but we can not do everything , " says the greying official in an open-necked shirt . " We had 14 inspectors five years ago and now we have been left with six . " <p> Even the investigator on the pharmaceuticals scam gets frustrated . Cases that her unit works on for months can end up stuck in the court system for much longer . " We catch them , but they fight the system and stay unpunished for years , " she says , arguing for special courts to be set up to deal with the backlog . <p> Tsoukas says the downturn is n't helping . " When you have recession , tax revenues go down . Some orders come out that we just can not enforce . We can not do regular checks on 6 million people . We are 15,000 tax officials , and our numbers are constantly being reduced . " <p> Asked about corruption , Tsoukas is dismissive . " I do not think there is great corruption in the tax service . I consider the number to be between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But what about all the stories of tax officials taking bribes ? " I do not count the graft involving 1,000 and 2,000 euros , " he says . " The small amounts are hard to spot . I 'm talking about big sums . Besides , corruption exists everywhere in public services , both in our country and others . " <p> AN OLD PROBLEM <p> That 's true . But in Greece , evading taxes is so ingrained that changing attitudes does amount to Papandreou 's revolution . Back in ancient Greece , it was the collection of taxes that gave rise to democracy -- decisions on taxation were handed over to mass meetings of adult men . <p> Greeks were denied democracy for 400 years during the Ottoman occupation and many refused to pay their taxes : for this they were hailed by their countrymen as patriotic heroes , according to Peter Bratsis , lecturer in political theory at the University of Salford . <p> Those attitudes have stuck and many Greeks still prefer to cheat on their taxes , figuring that , after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office rather than through official channels . " Clientism was promoted by Greek politicians looking to expand their power , " says Bratsis . <p> " ' What can you do for me ? ' is fine to ask in contemporary politics . What is different in Greece is that this becomes personalised and affects relations with bureaucracy . " <p> If Greeks are to rekindle an ancient sense of civic responsibility , the government will have to convince people that it can deliver better services and has really changed itself . <p> So far , it 's off to a rocky start . In May , tourism minister Angela Gerekou stepped down after press reports that her husband Tolis Voskopoulos , a prominent singer , owed the government more than 5 million euros in taxes . Soon after , revelations about property deals carried out by a Socialist former deputy prime minister through offshore companies put the spotlight on loopholes that are still open to exploitation . <p> A scandal involving German company Siemens and officials from both of Greece 's main political parties also cast a cloud over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biggest corporate corruption investigations in history in 2008 , when it agreed to pay about 1 billion euros ( $1.23 billion ) in fines and penalties as a result of U.S. and German investigations into bribes it paid to win contracts globally , including Greece . High-ranking Greek party officials admitted to prosecutors that they had received funds . <p> " Greeks initially bought the line that they were to blame for the crisis , even public servants felt guilt , " says Bratsis . " They believe it less and less , as the financial pain kicks in and because of scandals like the bribes-for-contracts affair involving Siemens . " <p> Protesters angry at corrupt politicians and businessmen have repeatedly stormed parliament in recent months , demanding punishment for those they blame for the crisis . Analysts say social peace in the face of austerity will partly hinge on the government being able to prosecute some high-profile case of graft and tax dodging . <p> Tax official Tsoukas warns that Athens could lose the battle for hearts and minds if more scandals emerge . " The young had started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " They ask , if I pay , will my money go to some politician 's villa ? " <p> Not if it 's up to the tax inspector dressed in pink and her team . " They really could never pay us enough for what we do , the hours we put in , the pressure we are under , " she said , still at her computer . " But it 's all worth it when I see a case go to prosecutors . "

While in the rest of the world the A-Star replaced the existing Alto , here the two have continued to co-exist , in part due to the continued demand for the previous generation Alto . <p> With the Indian car buyer maturing and expecting more performance and style even in the lower end of the A2 segment , it created a void , which manufacturers such as GM tried to fill with cars like the Chevrolet Spark . <p> Recognising the need for offering an option to buyers looking for an upgraded experience in the economy hatch segment , Maruti designers and engineers went back to their research and development bench with the Alto , to give it a new face and to endow it with more power and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Alto K10 , a visibly younger looking , more plush and easier to drive Alto that is bound to attract the eye-balls of the buyer in the 20-30 years age category . Three measures of the new Alto 's dimensions have n't changed -- width , height and wheelbase , yet , the new model looks squatter and visually more appealing than the previous one . <p> The one dimension that has changed , of course , is the length . Maruti engineers had to work on lengthening the existing chassis of the Alto to accommodate the new engine . The idea was to pick out the all-aluminium K10 engine that is already buzzing in the A-Star 's bonnet and shoe-horn it into the Alto K10 . Since the new engine is bigger than the existing 796cc , 3-cylinder engine in the Alto , the bonnet area had to be lengthened . <p> A total of 125mm in additional length has been added to the bonnet member and all the extra space obtained has been utilised to accommodate the K10 engine . The minor changes to the body panels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engine together have contributed to an increase in overall weight of about 50 kgs . Yet , thanks to the refined and frugal K10 engine , the rated fuel efficiency of this new model is higher than the previous Alto . <p> Exteriors <p> From the outside , the new Alto K10 's parentage is evident , though the changes are all substantial . The most prominent change is the headlamp design which now features a kink on the edges , giving it ' eagle-eye ' looks like Maruti designers call it . The bonnet ridge is now slightly more prominent and the redesigned bumpers are now body-coloured . The bonnet grille cuts deeper into the bumper and features three slats ( instead of the previous two ) with the Suzuki ' S ' logo in chrome at the middle . <p> The other feature of the new Alto K10 that looks familiar is the door mounted rear view mirrors , which looks very much like the original Zen 's mirrors . They are internally adjustable and these mirrors in the VXi variant of the Alto K10 also get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard . From the side , the additional length is immediately visible and much of it has translated into an increase in overhang at the front . <p> At the rear , the tail-lamps and hatch door have been changed . The new design of the tail-lamp features circular elements unlike the pyramid-shaped version of the previous Alto . The hatch door has been redesigned to accommodate the new tail-lamp design and the rear garnish has been repositioned to a slightly higher position . The other doors have been left unchanged . <p> Interiors <p> A wave of familiarity also swept over me when I stepped into the Alto K10 . Though there are changes that are very evident the moment I got behind the wheel , retention of the original dashboard design has meant that it still looks much like the current version . <p> The significant additions inside the Alto K10 are the new three-spoke steering wheel , the new chunky gear knob , the new design of the front seats with integrated headrests , three-ring instrument cluster with chrome-lipping , power-windows for the front doors , rear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cluster and the matching two-tone theme to the seat fabric . <p> Two other additions that will be appreciated are the increase in knee-room for the rear benchers thanks to the scooped out rear of the driver 's and front passenger 's seats and the fabric inserts that help break the monotony on the plastic door panels . <p> Performance <p> The change that really makes the new Alto K10 worthwhile is , of course , the 998cc K10B engine and the new cable-shifter five-speed gearbox . This one-litre engine also available in the A-Star , is part of Suzuki 's new series of fuel-efficient and low emission engines . Despite being a three-cylinder engine , features and technologies such as its chain-driven dual-overhead camshafts , low friction pistons and Iridium-tipped spark plugs enable this unit to deliver on its promise of better efficiency and refinement . In terms of performance numbers , the Alto K10 generates a peak power of 68PS at 6,200 rpm and maximum torque of 90Nm at 3,500 rpm . <p> I test drove the new Alto K10 primarily in the city , getting a feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners in this category would be doing for most of their ownership tenure . This is a free-revving engine and though it does n't quite match it in the same way , it reminded me of the old Zen . <p> Unlike the existing Alto 's 800cc mill , the K10 has a lot more room in each gear . Going with ease all the way up to 85 kmph on second gear , before the engine rpm hits the redline , this is a peppier engine that the average young buyer will like . Compared to the rubbery shift feel of the existing Alto 's five speed gearbox stick , the new cable-shifter in the Alto K10 feels progressive and firm and is a big step forward in quality . There is a clear improvement in driveability , though the shift gates for the gear stick seem to have been set too close to each other . <p> Maruti engineers have also The ride quality in the new Alto K10 has also got a boost thanks to a set of new features . It now sports 13-inch wheels instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the additional weight has not affected the weight-to-power ratio of the Alto K10 compared to competition , it has possibly also contributed to a slightly more planted feel . However , the overall driving dynamics of the new Alto K10 seems to be very similar to the current Alto . In the K10 , braking power has also been increased with the help of 8-inch brake boosters . <p> Verdict <p> The new Alto K10 is a classic Maruti move to fill a void and close-in on competition , even more so because the company will continue to offer three trim levels of the existing Alto ( Std , LX and LXi ) . The VXi variant of the existing Alto was dropped a few years ago and has nicely made room for the new Alto K10 . <p> Both for first time buyers and existing Maruti 800 and Alto buyers , this will be an attractive option to consider .

@@1595237 <p> In Hindi cinema , what 's ugly -- physically or behaviourally -- is profane . Even sacrilegious . There is almost no place for nuts and mavericks here . If at all , the maverick has to be virtuous , someone who protects or enlightens people . You remember Rancho , the pop philosopher , exceptionally bright engineer , loyal friend and midwife , all rolled into one impossible human being in 3 Idiots . The woman , if not motherly or modest , either has to have a change of heart or is doomed to loneliness in the end . Remember Simran , the alcoholic , impetuous girlfriend of a gangster in the 2006 film Gangster ? <p> There are many examples . Adulthood in 90% of the films released widely in India is a strangely sterilized state of being . Directors who make these films are obviously full-fledged adults with , I presume , tragic flaws of their own . Creation , therefore , is a process outside of themselves , dictated by the need for acceptance of their characters , conforming to " Bollywood tradition " and tailor-made formulas . Recently , I met a former regional officer , Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss a new draft proposal with Parliament that could alter the black and white structure of film ratings in India . He said , not entirely to my surprise , that in his five years at the CBFC , he had met few film-makers who really protested cuts . The consensus is : Cut as many scenes as you want , but do n't slap an " A " rating because that would n't work with " family audiences " . The producer decides that and the director parrots the line . <p> So while censorship laws have always been an impediment to radical themes and styles in cinema reaching people , the need for conforming to the tried-and-tested , and hence self-censorship or auto-censorship , is an affliction with our film-makers . More so with cinema than other forms of art because it is all-encompassing , mass and economically lucrative -- the temple of stars who can do no wrong and who can muster crowd hysteria like no other public figure can . Actor and producer are often one big self-serving mechanism . <p> Exceptions to this rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has seen an invigorated scriptwriter . Directors such as Dibakar Banerjee , Anurag Kashyap and many others in Mumbai and in regional-language films , are free thinkers and stylists -- films such as Dev.D , Manorama Six Feet Under , Love Sex aur Dhokha , and Udaan recently , among many others , have altered the " Bollywood " template . <p> But look at the norm : morality is secondary to imagination ; it appears most directors and writers do n't look within or what 's around them when they make films . The visible change in mainstream commercial cinema , compared with a decade ago , is largely cosmetic -- the technology , the unmistakable stamp of brand-saturated gloss or , sadly , of late , official remakes of lame Hollywood films . Audacious imagination is an oddity . <p> In this scenario , censorship laws and the CBFC act as unnecessary gags . The CBFC can rate a film either " A " or " U/A " ( which allows children to watch everything as long it 's under parental guidance ) . The certification process is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examining committee that has an equal number of men and women . They need not be related to films or be educated in films to be members ; most of them are " political posts " -- for people known to politicians of the party in power . <p> After watching a film , the motley group arrives at a consensus about cuts and the rating . The director meets the committee , presents his case in favour of the scenes chosen for censorship if he wants to . If the director is not happy with the decision , he can appeal to the revision committee , which comprises many members from the film industry , for a verdict . The only Indian film which did not get a certificate from either of these committees and was allowed a theatrical release by the Supreme Court with cuts is Shekhar Kapur 's Bandit Queen . <p> Verdicts are based on the provisions of the Cinematograph Act , 1952 ( amended only once since then , in 1983 ) . The fuzziness of the provisions makes them malleable to the examiner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selection of members is a foolproof , rigorous or discerning process . The sweeping guidelines : Frontal nudity should be allowed with great caution ; vulgarity should not be shown ; human sensibility should not be violated . Go judge a film ! <p> Documentaries go through the same process and the same guidelines apply to them . It 's an archaic way of judging non-fiction on film , which film-makers such as Anand Patwardhan and Rakesh Sharma have been protesting . <p> If the new Bill is passed , two new ratings , 12+ and 15+ , will be introduced . This will make things easier not only for censors , but will also give film-makers more freedom -- every kind of film will have a certified audience . <p> Even so , the biggest threats for film-makers , as for authors , are society 's belief or ideological groups . Undoubtedly , the most tragic and embarrassing moment for Indian films was on 30 January 2000 . An angry crowd of Sangh Parivar and Hindu fundamentalist group supporters attacked the sets of director Deepa Mehta 's film Water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about a young widow in Varanasi , had been cleared by the information and broadcasting ministry before filming began . Eventually , the film was shot in another country . <p> As a piece of cinema , Water was not groundbreaking ; it was a mediocre film with a subject that offended some Hindu zealots . Recently , Karan Johar 's My Name is Khan attracted the ire of the Shiv Sena for reasons that lay beyond the film 's content . The film 's actor , Shah Rukh Khan , had commented on the unjustness of not bidding for Pakistani cricketers in Indian Premier League auctions . They wanted to teach Khan a lesson . My Name is Khan , again , was not a great film with radical content , but the reasons for attacking it were shamefully undemocratic . <p> Here 's the only solution to such bigotry : Make more films which are bound to be scrutinized . Make original thought and imagination the benchmarks . Make more " Adult " films .

@@1604231 <h> Bewakoof eateries of Giridih <p> Giridih , a smal town in Jharkhand , has become famous for its several eateries that have ' bewakoof ' as part of their names . Hoteliers here believe that naming their establishments after the Hindi equivalent of idiot means better business . <p> TOI Crest Aug 21 , 2010 , 01.08 PM IST <p> Time was when Giridih 's main claim to fame was the ancient Parasnath temple atop the green hills surrounding it . For the last decade , however , this small town in Jharkhand has acquired a more unique distinction : it has around a dozen hotels that take pride in proclaiming their idiocy to the world . <p> Walk down Giridih 's choked , bumpy road near the district court and government hospital , and you 'll see a string of eateries named ' Bewakoof ' screaming out their gimmicky appellation from large , colourful signboards : Bewakoof , Bewakoof No1 , Maha Bewakoof , Shri Bewakoof , Om Bewakoof , Bewakoof Badshah , Sabse Bada Bewakoof . Interestingly the name , rather than putting off customers , seems to attract them - every bewakoof hotel does brisk business , spurring other hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bewakoof tag . <p> " Nothing sells like the name ' bewakoof ' in the hotel industry here , " says Kiran Bhalani , 45 , proprietor of Shri Bewakoof Hotel . Bhalani , like owners of other bewakoof hotels , claims that many politicians , including Shibu Soren , Lalu Prasad Yadav , and Babulal Marandi , have dined at his eatery and " immensely liked the food " . And no , he does n't make any associations between the two . <p> Stories about the inception of Giridih 's bewakoof mania abound , but Kumar , the current proprietor of the first bewakoof hotel , claims his version is the right one . Way back in 1971 , he says , his uncle Gopi Ram , a school dropout , began a tiny eating joint outside the civil hospital . One day , a customer ate at the hotel and left without paying . " Tumko bewakoof banaya re ( he fooled you ) , " commented another customer . The next day , Ram put up a signboard that read ' Bewakoof Hotel ' outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of humour , " chuckles Kumar , adding that the hotel moved to six rented places before it finally acquired a permanent address in 1993 . <p> Prem Kishore Singh , an attendant at the surgical ward of the civil hospital , was one of the witnesses to the little drama Ram enacted to advertise his bewakoof hotel , then an object of curiosity for many . " Ram hired a cycle rickshaw and moved around the town announcing the opening of Bewakoof Hotel on a loudspeaker . Out of curiosity , customers streamed into it , " says Singh . And the trend caught on . Bhalani admits that the bewakoof tag is a USP . " The title sells . The best thing is that our customers do n't mind it , " says the hotelier , who opened Shri Bewakoof in 1974 . <p> As they cater mostly to the middle and lower income groups - clerks at the court , local revenue offices , banks and villagers who visit the town for sarkari work - the food in the bewakoof hotels is very reasonably priced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vegetables , costs no more than 24 rupees . Perhaps that 's the bait for the customers who eat here . K N Singh , who retired as a clerk from the local block development office recently , says he has eaten lunch only at the Bewakoof Hotel for the last 35 years . " Their food is non-oily and very cheap . I also liked the name , and have never gone to other bewakoofs , which are just clones , " says Singh even as a bearer pours piping hot dal into a steel bowl . <p> What Gopi Ram began in 1971 gradually swelled into a flood of me-toos . The bewakoof hotel brand became such a money-spinner that several people who tried to establish other businesses abandoned them and opted for it . Take Sunil Agarwal , 45 , who 'd opened a medicine shop last year . Customers , he says , were few and far between , leading to losses . Then someone suggested he open a hotel . Agarwal turned the medicine shop into an eatery and called it Bewakoof Badshah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up , " he says . <p> One thing common to all the eateries , apart from their name , is the television sets fixed on their smoke-stained walls . Playing at high volumes , amid the clanking of plates in the smoky , hot halls crammed with tables and chairs , they beam B-grade Bollywood action flicks , a staple of small-town India . " The movies are an added attraction , " says Jaya Prakash Singh , co-owner of Maha Bewakoof Hotel . Singh adds that TV also serves as a source of entertainment for the cooks and bearers who otherwise have no weekly off . <p> All the bewakoof eateries in Giridih stop serving non-vegetarian food during the month of Shravan , and liquor is completely banned . The army of kanwarias ( worshippers of Shiva ) , chanting Bol Bum , fill their pots with gangajal at Sultanganj in Bihar and walk down to Deoghar in Jharkhand to worship at one of the 12 jyotir lingas of Shiva .

Reliability of customized solutions which are not integrated with enterprise solutions like SAP , Oracle etc. poses a potential IT risk .

And despite the mine 's history of rock falls in earthquake -- prone Chile , the geology also bodes well for their survival in the weeks ahead . <p> The August 5 collapse of the mine 's main access shaft happened about 1,300 feet ( 400 meters ) below the surface , well above where the miners were working , leaving vast stretches of passageways with air to breathe . <p> The gallery where the miners took refuge more than 2,200 feet ( 688 meters ) below ground is at least 1.2 miles ( 2 kilometers ) long , with easily enough air to last 17 days or more , said Gustavo Lagos , a professor at the Catholic University of Chile 's Centre for Mining . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " agreed Wolfgang Griem , director of the geology department at the University of Atacama . <p> The Atacama Desert that surrounds Copiapo is considered the driest place on Earth . Some parts have not seen a single drop of rain since recordkeeping began . <p> Yet inside the mine , the igneous rock walls are seamed with clay that contains lots of water , which Lagos said he could see beading up and dripping down the walls behind the miners in video images from their emergency chamber . <p> The moist environment enabled the miners to carve water from the mine floor with a bulldozer to supplement stored industrial water . The internal runoff also means there is an essentially unlimited drinking supply , though Lagos said it could be acidic and cause minor health problems . <p> " It would probably contain some metals which would make it taste not so good , " he said . " If it contained copper it could cause vomiting , diarrhoea , stomach pains . ... But it would not kill them . " <p> The dampness combined with warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment so stuffy that video images showed some miners stripped to the waist to beat the heat . But they 're not at risk for exposure as they would be in shallower coal mines , which can be quite chilly . <p> Copper sulfite can generate smelly sulfur dioxide during mining operations , but they 've stopped that . And with copper levels in the mine 's vein at less than 1 percent and gold even scarcer , the minerals " will not generate sulfur dioxide in great quantities , " Prof. Lagos said . <p> Equally improbable is the possibility of a " rock burst , " an extremely dangerous phenomenon that occurs when settling layers of earth bear down on the walls of a mine and result in a sudden , catastrophic release of stored energy . Exploding pillars can turn chunks of rock or coal into deadly missiles , and the shock wave alone can kill . <p> In 2007 at Crandall Canyon in Utah , a mountain " bump " , the coal mine equivalent of a rock burst , killed six workers and registered as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Days later , a second bump killed three rescuers . <p> But this mine 's structure is likely to be stable after the initial collapse released the stress , Prof. Grayson said . " It 's probably in a state of equilibrium , at least for a while . As long as there 's no new mine activity , that equilibrium would not be disturbed . " <p> Geology also will determine how quickly the miners can be pulled up to the surface . Chile 's state -- owned Codelco mining company is setting up an enormous perforation drill capable of carving a hole 26 inches ( 66 centimeters ) wide through solid rock at a rate of 15 to 30 yards ( meters ) a day . <p> The terrain at the San Jose mine is mostly diorite , an igneous rock formed from cooled magma that is considered to be only medium -- hard , Prof. Lagos said . <p> The rescue operation 's leader , Andres Sougarret , estimated it would take three to four months to get the men out . <p> But Davitt McAteer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Administration , called that " perhaps the most conservative model . " <p> " We ought to be able to get them out in a period of weeks , not months , " he said . <p> Prof. Grayson predicted it could take just 25 to 30 days to reach the miners , while Prof. Lagos said it would likely be somewhere between 60 if all goes well and 120 if the effort bogs down . <p> The miners were lucky to be working far below where the tunnel collapsed . But the mountain itself helped provide the essentials for life . <p> " It was surprising for everyone in the country to find the 33 of them alive .

@@1612230 <h> What came first -- maths or written language ? <p> Alex Bellos , author of Alex 's Adventures in Numberland -- Dispatches from the Wonderful World of Mathematics , speaks to DNA on the world of numbers . <p> For those who hate numbers , maths is an acronym for Mentally Agitated Teachers Harassing Students . <p> But that 's of course not the whole story . " I think we grow up thinking that maths is very dry and all about passing exams , when really maths is one of the proudest achievements of our cultural heritage . When you learn the context of mathematical discoveries and can learn its charms without fear of failing an exam , a whole world opens up , " says Alex Bellos , author of Alex 's Adventures in Numberland -- Dispatches from the Wonderful World of Mathematics . In this interview , he speaks to DNA on the world of numbers . <p> How old are numbers ? Well , it depends on what we mean by numbers . If we mean the ability to realise that two things are different from one thing , this is as old as humans are . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then this is only about 8,000 years old and originated in Sumer -- present day Iraq . <p> How did numbers emerge ? Numbers emerged as a way to count objects , say sheep . Originally objects would have been counted by tallying -- so , if you have 50 sheep , you might need to make 50 marks ; or have 50 pebbles , so you know how many sheep you have when you are not with the sheep . But the Sumerians then started to make clay marks , where symbols referred to particular numbers . This was much more convenient . <p> What I find amusing is that these number symbols were the first examples in western culture of a script . So it is perfectly fair to say that written language , and therefore literature , was a consequence of numbers . Books are here because of maths ! <p> In the first chapter of your book , you talk about some Amazonian tribes who can count only till five . Can you elaborate ? In my book I wanted to explain ' where numbers come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this ' number instinct ' that we have ? Some of the most interesting research comes from studies of Amazon tribes who have only a few numbers in their languages . I looked at one tribe in particular -- the Munduruku , who only have words for one , two , three , four and five . In fact , the word for five is the same as the word for ' handful ' . <p> The studies try to see how good the Munduruku are at certain tests to do with numbers and amounts . The results show that while the Munduruku are unable to use exact numbers , they have an ability to estimate rough amounts , which is as good as the westerners ' . This would appear to show that you can have this ' number sense ' even if you do n't have numbers . <p> How did the decimal number system evolve ? When you come up with a number system , one of the first things you need to do is choose a ' base ' . This is the term used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ base of 10 , or decimal system , because we group our numbers in ( groups of ) 10 . <p> While this seems obvious , there are lots of other cultures in history -- and some still in existence -- who use bases other than 10 . There seems to be a very obvious reason why we use base 10 -- and that is because we have 10 fingers ( including thumbs ) . So , when we learn to count using our fingers , it is natural to group numbers in 10s . ( Or fives , or 20s . And 5 , 10 and 20 are the most common bases used by humans ) . If we had only four fingers per hand , we would undoubtedly have had eight as base . And if we have only three , we would have had six as base ! <p> Why is time counted in base 60 and not 10 ? This is a legacy of the Babylonians , who had a base 60 system . No one knows why they had that base , because it seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having 60 seconds in a minute and 60 minutes in an hour is advantageous than if we had 100 seconds in a minute and 100 minutes in an hour . This is to do with the divisibility of 60 . It is possible to divide 60 into 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 . And it is very convenient to split the hour into halves , thirds , quarters , fifths and sixths . On the other hand , you can only divide 100 by 2 , 4 and 5 . <p> You write that in ancient India " coining words for large numbers was a scientific and a religious preoccupation . " What did you mean ? I write about the ancient Indian approach to numbers in comparison to the Greek approach of roughly the same time . <p> The Greeks never went beyond a ' myriad ' , or 10,000 . Sanskrit , however , had the word koti , which means a crore , or 1,00,00,000 . In the Lalitavistara Sutra , Buddha lists a word that means 10 followed 421 zeros , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire universe . <p> The ancient Indians used these big numbers to do their astronomical and astrological calculations . With higher numbers , they could do better astronomy and Indian astronomy was indeed ahead of its time . The other aspect of higher and higher numbers is religious . It is a way of getting closer to the gods , or eternity ... <p> How did the concept of zero evolve ? My interest in this is the link between the invention of zero -- made in India , probably around 400CE -- and the Buddhist/Hindu mystical idea of ' nothingness ' . <p> In the West , we did n't invent zero . We thought of nothing as , literally , nothing . But in India the idea that nothing was something was already a religious conviction , which helped bring about the mathematical idea . <p> Sudoku , it seems , was originally invented in the US . The Japanese saw it and ran with it . Can you take us through the entire Sudoku story ? Sudoku was originally called Number Place , and was invented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . It was hardly noticed . Then a Japanese puzzle magazine editor , Maki Kaji , revamped the puzzle , called it Sudoku , placed the given numbers in a symmetrical pattern , and in the early 80s put it in his Japanese magazine . <p> Some more people noticed but not that many , and only in Japan . Then , about a decade ago a retired Hong Kong judge , Wayne Gould , who was holidaying in Japan , saw it and after spending several years working out a programme to generate Sudokus , told The Times in London about it . Within months , it was an international phenomenon . <p> Was the success of Sudoku partly due to its exotic sounding name ? Absolutely ! Sudoku sounds much more exciting than Number Place .

@@1612236 <p> Israel has been subject to some bad publicity recently . In 2008-09 , it launched a brutal military campaign in the Gaza Strip that killed more than 400 Palestinian children . In May 2010 , bumbling Israeli commandos murdered nine nonviolence activists on the Gaza Freedom Flotilla 's Mavi Marmara . It only got worse for Israel when it was revealed that soldiers stole and sold personal items such as laptops from the ship . Last week , former Israeli soldier Eden Abergil posted photos onto Facebook showing her preening in front of blindfolded and despondent Palestinian prisoners , in some instances mocking those prisoners with sexual undertones . The photos were part of an album entitled " IDF Israeli army -- the best time of my life . " <p> While Abergil 's pictures may not seem as abhorrent as the Gaza and Mavi Marmara brutality -- Abergil , for her part , described her behavior as nonviolent and free of contempt -- all three actions are intimately connected . First of all , we must dispel the notion that Abergil 's photos are nonviolent . As with the Abu Ghraib debacle , a sexualized and coercive humiliation is being visited on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which by any reasonable principle is a basal form of violence . There is also the obvious physical violence of Palestinians being bound and blindfolded , presumably in or on their way to prisons nobody will confuse with the Ritz Carlton . <p> More important , these recent episodes merely extend an age-old list of Israeli crimes and indignities that illuminate a depravity in the Zionist enterprise itself . What is noteworthy about Israel 's three recent escapades is that more and more people are starting to pay attention to its crimes and indignities . In so doing , more and more people are questioning the origin and meaning of Zionism -- that is , the very idea of a legally ethnocentric Israel . <p> I would like to address this piece to those who have undertaken such questioning or to those who are prepared to initiate it . I would urge you not to limit your critique of Israel only to its errors of judgment or its perceived excesses ; it is more productive to challenge the ideology and practice of Zionism itself . There is no noble origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return ; such yearnings are often duplicitous mythmaking or romanticized nostalgia . Zionists always intended to ethnically cleanse Palestinians , a strategy they carried out and continue to pursue with horrifying efficiency . <p> Likewise , Zionism was always a colonialist movement , one that relied on the notions of divine entitlement and civilizational superiority that justified previous settlement projects in South Africa , Algeria and North America . Zionism , by virtue of its exclusionary outlook and ethnocentric model of citizenship , is on its own a purveyor of fundamental violence . The bad PR to which Israel sometimes is subject today is a reflection of changed media dynamics , not a worsening of Israel 's behavior . <p> The 2008-09 Gaza invasion , the attack on the Mavi Marmara and Abergil 's Facebook photos are n't anomalous or extraordinary . They are the invariable result of a Zionist ideology that can not help but view Palestinian Muslims and Christians as subhuman , no matter how ardently its liberal champions assert that Zionism is a liberation movement . Zionism has the unfortunate effect of proclaiming that one group of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of people is excluded . There is nothing defensible in this proposition . <p> Here , then , are four reasons why Americans ( and all other humans regardless of race or religion ) should oppose Zionism : <p> 1 . Zionism is unethical and immoral : Because Zionists claim access to land and legal rights that directly obviate the same access to an indigenous community , it operates from within an idea of belonging that is cruel and archaic . Israel bases its primary criterion for citizenship on religious identity . Imagine having your religion on your driver 's license . And imagine having limited access to freeways , farmland , family , education , employment and foreign travel because the religion by which the state has chosen to identify you is legally marginalized . Such is the daily reality of the Palestinian people . <p> 2 . Zionism is racist : This claim is n't the same as saying that all Zionists are racist . I would make a distinction between the categories of " Zionist " and " Zionism . " However , inherent in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can fully participate in the benefits and practices of a national community . Many Zionists view themselves merely as supporting freedom and safety for Jewish people . I would suggest that people who identify themselves as Zionist look more closely at the ideology they support . Such freedom and safety , both of which are in fact mythologies , come at the direct expense of people confined to Bantustans and refugee camps . <p> 3 . Zionism contravenes the geopolitical interests of the United States : Many Americans have heard former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert boast that he once pulled George W. Bush off the dais while Bush was giving a speech , or more recently current Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announcing that " America is something that can be easily moved . " Israel costs the United States billions of dollars in direct aid and in bribe money to Jordan and Egypt for their docility . Israel also is the main reason for disgruntlement about American foreign policy in the Arab and Muslim Worlds . I raise this point with some hesitation because I believe all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American geopolitical interests . I would also point out that Zionism 's narrative of salvation and redemption resonates deeply among Americans because of the US ' origin and continued presence as a nation of settler colonists . In the end , America itself needs to be decolonized and the vast sums of money that support the imperial projects Israel so brazenly exemplifies need to be directed toward the well-being of those who pay the government its taxes . <p> 4 . Zionism is fundamentally incompatible with democracy : Israel , as a result , is undemocratic and will be as long as it uses religious identity as the operating criterion of citizenship . We hear much in the US about Islam being incompatible with democracy , a belief that is historically untrue and that elides the massive military and monetary support the US provides to the assortment of dictators and plutocrats that rule much of the Arab World . Neoconservative and mainstream commentators both evoke Israel in opposition to Islam as a symbol of democratic achievement . In reality Israel performs one of the most barbaric forms of oppression today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the Palestinian citizens of Israel who constitute approximately twenty percent of the citizenry . <p> The alternative media engendered by new technology have allowed more people to witness the unremitting violence that has been Israel 's stock in trade for decades . Many consumers of this information and these images believe that Israel is guilty of excess when a simpler explanation exists : Israel is acting out the requisites of an exclusionary and inherently violent ideology . <p> These days all it takes is a little braggadocio from an ex-soldier such as Eden Abergil to so perfectly symbolize the callousness of Zionist colonization . Ten years ago , the Israeli government 's lies about the killings aboard the Mavi Marmara would have been unchallenged by gruesome footage distributed through alternative news networks and social media . Nobody these days could have stopped the images of white phosphorous exploding and spreading over the Gaza Strip from being aired ; Israelis themselves were foolish enough to capture Jewish children writing messages on soon-to-be-launched missiles . <p> Americans now have all the evidence they need for a reasonable and morally-sound conclusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their taxes and legitimize with either silence or consent . As a result , I am not arguing that Americans should reassess their level of support for Israel . I am arguing that Americans should oppose Zionism altogether . Perhaps in this way we might begin the long and difficult process of redeeming our own nation of its imperial sins .

How strange , then , to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minds . <p> Left-handed effort : Garry Sobers ' pure swing of the bat was a symbol of his natural ability -- he was also the first to score six sixes in an over . Allsport UK/Getty Images <p> Till only four or five years ago , one 's blind dates with the past were as illicit as they are now : pirated video cassettes and discs , rather than online clips . But it took considerably more effort . Visiting Karachi 's Rainbow Centre in 2004 , one of the shrines of global piracy , I could not help but return home with half a suitcase of VHS contraband . Now , in a few seconds of YouTubing one can summon up highlights of Imran Khan 's legendary sea-breeze-inflected 11 wickets against India at Karachi from the 1982-83 series . <p> Sometimes there was providence . My first task when I joined Wisden in 2001 was to go into the small , musty darkened projector room of Mumbai 's Films Division of India office to shortlist classic video excerpts for the website ( a project eventually abandoned ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spin , on the superb 1974-75 West Indies tour of India . Keith Boyce 's swinging , curving lefty run-up , Lance Gibbs ' high prance , Andy Roberts ' young menace , the debutants Viv Richards and Gordon Greenidge , the otherworldly rhythms of the Indian spin quartet , Vishy 's cuts , the voice of the narrator taking one through the journey from 0-2 to 2-2 to 2-3 , the long shots of the black and white ground and the always packed grounds -- it felt like time travel because it was a shock to emerge into the light and honking horns of Peddar Road . <p> This , of course , was the rarest of rare cases . For the most part one had to rely on the imagination . The written word was a great help . My most cherished cricket book for a long time was a slim , obscure volume ( cover price , Rs9.50 ) called Cricket Conversations , Peter Walker Talks With . There are 13 cricketers , the good and the great from the 1960s and 1970s . Each conversation was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The very names were magic : Sobers , Fredericks , Procter , Bedi , Majid , Chappell G. , Richards B. When I first encountered the book ( in the days of dial-up connections on stolen accounts ) I had seen no footage whatsoever of any of the 13 . Yet , reading and rereading , one received a sharp sense of the cricketer and the man . <p> All-round champ : The 1982-83 series against India in Pakistan was one of Imran Khan 's best . Bob Thomas / Getty Images <p> From Bishan Bedi , for instance , one learnt that he had little interest in the game till , at 12 , he heard on radio that Subhash Gupte had spun out the West Indians at Kanpur , and " suddenly , just like a revelation , I knew that was what I wanted to do " ; that the first Test match he played in was also the first Test match he watched ; and that he liked to spend his spare time writing letters ( he received , when captain , about 40-50 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But , of course , Bedi was his action . We knew that . It featured in Jim Laker 's vision of paradise . And to Peter Walker it was like Tennyson 's eternal brook . Bedi made several technical points that help us decode this silky motion . To encourage flight over spin , he gripped the ball near the fingertips ; it was why his fingers were uncalloused , unlike other spinners , and I suppose it imparted a visual ease to his delivery . He kept a strict watch on his left side swinging past the axis of the front hip , and he tried to keep his bowling arm as high as possible . <p> Because the Films Division reels used primarily long shots , I only closely saw Bedi 's action on BBC 's Empire of Cricket series , which can be found on YouTube . Some of the early footage is glorious : Bedi is wearing not a patka , but a full pagdi , and his shirt is unbuttoned till his solar plexus . The pristine delivery is almost precisely as imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is as though the tape has lurched into double speed ; it has the feel of a silent movie comedy . <p> With somebody like Garry Sobers there are no surprises . The pure swing of the bat , like a boy with a slingshot , the pantherish athleticism , the joy and vitality sparkling through every natural movement ( the only thing , he says , he made a point to practise at the nets , was wrist-spin ) . On YouTube one can call up the original six sixes in an over ( " And he 's done it ! And , my goodness , that 's gone way down to Swansea ! " ) ; 150 at Lord 's , and an electric reconstruction of his 254 at Melbourne ( see accompanying piece ) ; but the essence of this extraordinary sportsman is most succinctly captured in a clip of Gibbs ' bowling . Search for Lance Gibbs : It is the first result . Sobers is at backward short-leg , a position now rarely used . The two catches are genius , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second of reflex , the ease of movement , the fun . He made life light . <p> The two cricketers about whom I was curious in the Walker book were both opening batsmen , Majid Khan and Barry Richards . With Majid the curiosity was piqued by a single anecdote . It was a " windswept , icy " day in Derby , Walker wrote . During a long delay for a wet outfield , there raged a discussion on footwork in batting . At last , Majid , a man of few words , spoke up . " You do n't need any footwork in batting , just hands and eye . " <p> The bowlers challenged him for proof . Out they went into the nets . " For twenty minutes , on a rough , unprepared and **26;267;TOOLONG wicket where the ball flew , shot , seamed and turned , Majid Khan stood absolutely motionless , parrying the ball as it lifted , cutting or hooking unerringly if it were wide , driving with frightening power if overpitched and swaying out of harm 's way when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet by our own critical reckoning afterwards that twenty-minute session must have yielded the young Pakistani around 75 runs ! " So Sehwag does have antecedents after all . <p> On YouTube there are highlights of a century against England , but the great clip is of a face-off with Kapil Dev set to soft Pakistani pop . It is from the Lahore Test of the 1978 series ( Kapil 's first ) , and the Pakistanis are hunting down 126 for victory on the fifth evening . Majid is in a white floppy hat ( how close batsmen 's feet were in stance those days ) . Kapil is bowling it far outside leg to pry out a draw . Majid is increasingly frustrated . He signals a wide . He plucks a stump from the ground and , stepping to his left , makes as if to plant it at the margin of the crease . One can picture Viru doing just the same . The short clip finishes with a swivelling hook , and there can be no finer closing image than a swivelling hook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ averaged 72.5 but was restricted by isolation to four Tests . Don Bradman picked him in his all-time XI team , and he once famously played an over in a club match holding his bat edgeways . He was thought of as casual , admits that he sometimes did n't care about losing his wicket ; yet the big occasion could rouse him . I remember a Frank Keating article where Tony Greig talks of Richards ' preparation before a Packer Supertest . He wanted to practise playing straight . Every time the ball went behind square on either side , he pumped out 50 press-ups . He must have done about 600 , Greig estimated . <p> Watching Barry Richards bat , finally , was disorienting . He is far bigger at the crease than I had thought . He is hunched in stance . That was a shock . In my head he had a very clearly upright stance . His driving is terribly handsome , yet one expected a gentler player . There was no good reason for this , of course , except that this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing profession , you get to interview the giants without ever having watched them .

Due to circumstances too tedious to detail , I sent a flustered SMS to my editor beginning with the words , " Barry giving me the shits " ( this Aussie expression had become popular in our office after Ian Chappell was heard employing it for his laptop ) . <p> Afterwards , at night , I was n't sure if it was indeed my editor who 'd been sent the SMS .

Your cliam of ballot process is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the hacking video and Hari Prasad lecture in IIT allimini . Please search in youtube . Democracy can not be run on the anybodies mere assumption that its a full proof . Then why developed countries like Germany , Ireland , Netherland , Usa .. etc have not gone towards EVM . Simple in the Europe election it was simply rigged it . 2004 california banned evm . Counties first take EVM as choice and they have left it . So its good to know the history of EVM first . I can not believe that congress owned Maharastra and central govt can not do anything to the machine . The chips are manufactured from hitachi and software is fused into the chip . So not even Election commission can verfiy the software . So if somebody changed the software with a trogen then nobody can detect it . <p> Also Hari Prasad shows way to temprorary and permanent changing of votes with Eprom and dual memory chips . He basically hacked in 30secs with LED display . Please take a look at those videos . <p> So in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be run on trust . There needs to be verifiablility and Paper trail proof . The common people should be able to understand that there was some kind of hacking " when it was tampered " . Here chips can not be detected by common man . If balot paper were looted then there is a proof and here there is nothing . Also it takes effort to fraud a paper trail and here it would take BEL and ECIL employees or chips that is been generally carried from USA by an ordinary man to be tamper it . <p> So now that people have got a doubt , things can not run through as usual . Also its baseless arugment and sentiment that its been produced by India . The main thing is DEMOCRACY and VOTING not the Patent of machines . <p> Also when EC calls people to prove that its tamperable then its not allowing to even touch the machine . Well if you argue that machines are kept in safe site I can not believe the maharastra Commissioner who is guarding 1.3 million machines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history shows that IPS/IAS people have been bought for money . <p> So there are so many many ways of tampering things ...... <p> Shivakumar - Hariprasad went to EC office for showing the proof and when they were given the mahcine mister Chawla from election commission got panic as they recognized the architecture of machine . They were easily tamperable and so they sent them to home . Also sent them a criminal notice for intimidation . Basically everything is there in manual it seems which is available to study . So forget about IIT even Harward/MIT or any others have not come up with tamper proof machines . If you want your vote to go at a right place then you choose which method you want . <p> Also people must have choice whether they want to vote with Paper or EVM . My way would be through PAPER . You guys can choose your method and put the vote . So both choice must be given to citizens . <p> I think you have missed out my point . The issue is every political party complains only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ election , but does not say a word against the EVMs if it wins the election . <p> What is to be proved is not just that a machine can be hacked ( almost every machine can be hacked ) , but in a given election hacking / rigging of EVMs has indeed taken place to the advantage of a particular party . <p> My point is , if a particular party is indulging in the rigging of EVMs thru hacking , then that party should win every election , which is not the case . <p> At the same time , EC should address all legitimate doubts and fears of independent Indian experts not connected with any political party . <p> The western nations do not require EVMs as the size of the electorate is managable and the ballot process is reasonably foolproof . The same can not be said about Indian system . <p> Having said that , it does not hurt to subject EVMs to scrutiny . However , I am a little concerned about the process adopted and what is being claimed , which in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically refers to breaking into a system from outside - something like using random key sequeces or altering the voltages to change the recorded votes . <p> BTW , the EC claims that they did give them access to machine after the SC directive , but the teams could not conclusively prove their claims . <p> The truth is that we Indians ca n't give credit for any achievment to our fellow men unless some foreign University guy gives a nod . Just because US or UK are not using EVMs due to their own incompetence , should be we doubt our own system . Recall the mess the US system created during Bush 's election . <p> I believe most of the machines can be hacked , but in the context of EVM , the issue is little different . <p> When certain parties loose elections then they immediately blame the EVMs and this applies to all the political parties without exception . <p> Otherwise how is it that BJP continues winning in Gujarat , MP and Raipur and sometime back evenadded Karnataka to its kitty . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Saffron votes due to division in Sena . <p> Now we are witnessing the changing scenario in West Bengal . In the next elections if Left is thrown out , which looks very likely , then they will grumble that EVMs are to blame . <p> We Indians are argumentative , that is fine but let us not be willing to damage the credibility of our own Institutions without some solid grounds . <p> If Hari Prasad still believes that he has a solid case , he can file a PIL in the court and present his case .

@@1626233 <p> Reverse-engineering has been one of the greatest boons to the Indian pharmaceutical industry and is a form of innovation that Indian pharma has mastered . But the story of Indian pharma does n't end at developing and manufacturing generic versions of branded or patented drugs . In fact , that is where it starts . Its strength in generic manufacturing also gave India the confidence to challenge patents of some of the world 's largest pharmaceutical companies . To add to that , India has fast become the hub of research and development outsourcing . It has emerged a leader in novel drug delivery systems , custom synthesis of new molecules , and much of the work done by Indian contract research and manufacturing firms is being patented by MNC ( multinational corporation ) pharmas . <p> Until 1998 , India had no medicine exports to regulated markets . Today , over 40% of its $8 billion ( Rs 37,360 crore ) exports is to North America and western Europe alone . <p> According to government statistics , pharma exports were worth Rs 39,538 crore in 2008-09 , growing at a combined annual growth rate of 21.25% . It also accounts for 1,735 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food and drug administration ( FDA ) data , as against 1,054 from US domestic companies and more than the combined total of European and Japanese companies . In 1998 , India filed only three abbreviated new drug applications ( ANDAs ) . In 2009 , it filed 181 ANDAs . <p> " The understanding of market dynamics and adapting to them quickly is a huge strength that India has . This is illustrated in the number of DMF filings alone that Indian pharma has with the US drugs regulator , " says Satish Reddy , managing director and chief operating officer , Dr Reddy 's Laboratories Ltd . <p> As per to the investment and technology promotion division of the ministry of external affairs , during 2009-10 , pharma was among the few sectors that managed to expand revenue despite the global slump . " The Indian pharmaceutical industry 's strengths in the global market are the safe , effective and quality medicines ( it provides ) at affordable prices , " says D.G. Shah , secretary general of the Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance . He adds that the pharma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than any other industry in India . <p> According to the consultancy KPMG , from practically non-existent indigenous drug production before the 1950s , the domestic pharma market now ranks fourth in volume terms globally . The market is currently valued at approximately $21.4 billion and is expected to grow at a CAGR ( compound annual growth rate ) of about 18% till 2013-2014 . " The Indian pharma industry has emerged as one of the most attractive markets as its growth continues to outperform that of the global industry and particularly developed markets such as the US and the EU , " says Hitesh Gajaria , executive director , KPMG . A major turning point came in 2005 , when India adopted the product patent regime , opening up the market for foreign firms . The move spurred growth in the domestic industry and paved the way for greater regulatory compliance as well as battle for intellectual property within the country . Today , with the pharmaceutical world inching closer to the dreaded patent cliff , Indian pharma has been the saviour for Big Pharma . Sixty-one drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US between 2011 and 2013 . That is the value of money that Indian generic manufacturers stand to gain . <p> " With large drug makers facing the approaching patent cliff as major products lose patent protection and face competition from generic versions , many are forging alliances with Indian generic drug makers to capture market share in developed and emerging markets , " said Anantharaman Kavassery Viswanathan , principal analyst , healthcare , Datamonitor . In the last two years , India has witnessed strategic alliances between GSK and Dr. Reddy 's Laboratories Ltd , Pfizer Inc. and Aurobindo Pharma Ltd , Strides Arcolab Ltd and Claris Lifesciences Ltd , AstraZeneca Plc. and Torrent Pharmaceuticals Ltd and Aurobindo Pharma Ltd and Abbott Laboratories and Cadila Healthcare Ltd , to name a few . <p> " Generic manufacturing is an area where India has been able to establish a firm foothold . With a market share of 31% in the total ANDA approvals and estimated 50% in the total DMF filings in 2009 , India is likely to continue holding a dominant position here , " explains Gajaria . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market through innovation , as well as emerging as a strong hub for contract research and manufacturing , Indian pharma has not had much luck in commercializing a new chemical entity ( NCE ) . Till date there has been no drug discovered by an Indian company that has hit the markets . <p> Indian companies began investing in NCE research in 1998 . Industry watchers believe that a span of 12 years is too short to judge success or failure . " It takes seasoned players 10 to 12 years to get a molecule from lab to market . Give them ( Indian pharma ) at least 20 years and required funding support before sitting in judgement , " says Shah . <p> The industry 's R&amp;D spend increased 17-fold in 11 years -- from Rs 140 crore in 1995 to Rs 2,380 crore in 2006 . However , this amount pales in comparison with the billion-dollar investment needed to complete studies and reach commercialization for a single molecule . Indian pharma does n't have the financial muscle to develop such drugs , which is why companies such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their research pipeline . " This is a long-term story in terms of value creation . There have been capabilities built in this space but for it to translate into a revenue model will take time . The challenge is not discovery , it is about the number of products that move to phase 3 and finally make it to the market , " says Reddy . He admits that while the good thing is that there are candidates coming in , the risk in research is a hurdle . <p> " New drug discovery and development has not reached its full potential in India . However , the number of compounds in the Indian pipeline and in the advanced stages of development is also increasing . It is therefore not appropriate to say that India has failed in NCE innovation , " says Gajaria.

@@1626235 <h> Career Journal : Why HR Makes Hiring Mistakes <p> Companies often complain about not being able to find exceptional employees who can meet the challenges of their business . <p> AFP/Getty Images <p> In many companies the human resources department is responsible for filling all vacancies . <p> This is partly because there is a shortage of skilled people in India , but sometimes it 's also because the right talent has not been spotted . <p> Advertisement <p> In many companies , the human resources department is the primary source for recruitment and is responsible to fill all vacancies . The department manager who has a vacancy gives the HR department a job description and a list of basic qualifications and experience needed for it . <p> This is a good plan in theory -- the HR department concentrates on its expertise of recruitment , while department managers concentrate on their expertise of running departments and meeting business targets . <p> In reality , however , this plan does n't always work . HR is great for mass recruitment or for hiring people at junior levels where the job profile is standardized , such as software programmers or sales people . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position to find the right candidate for the job , thus creating a bigger problem for the organization . <p> In India , typically senior HR executives spend their time on compensation and performance appraisal-related issues , leaving the task of recruitment to junior and middle-level HR personnel . Herein lies the crux of the problem . <p> The relatively young HR executives often do n't have enough knowledge of their company 's business or industry that is needed to find appropriate candidates for senior-level jobs . <p> Suppose there is a job opening for an investment banker . The head of investment banking may tell the HR department to find a candidate who has exposure to the " buy-side " and is from a private-equity firm . If the recruiting HR person is not well-versed with the investment banking world and the financial industry , he or she might not understand what these terms mean . A junior HR person might feel awkward or scared to go back to the investment banking head to get more details about the job role and qualifications . The result could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager should keep up with changes in job profiles and the business , as the company grows . But given the fast-changing nature of business today , department managers are not always able to update HR quickly , says Vishal Trehan , country head , broking and distribution at Fortune Financial Services India Ltd . <p> Assume that a brokerage firm which has traditionally dealt in stocks decides to expand into bond-trading during an economic downturn , when people do n't want to invest stocks . The company might need to make this shift very quickly , to keep up with competition . But it could take a long time to explain the intricacies of the bond-world to the HR department , so that they can source the right candidates . <p> There are other reasons why relatively inexperienced HR professionals make hiring mistakes . <p> In one recent example , a middle-level HR manager rejected a senior candidate ( with more than 15 years of experience ) shortlisted for the position of stock research head . The HR manager felt that this candidate was " throwing names " because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ India 's largest financial services firms . This shows the ignorance of the HR manager because in reality , senior stock research analysts often interact with top officials of the Indian corporate world . <p> Mayank Chandra <p> One way organizations can tackle these issues , Mr. Trehan suggests , is by having different recruiters dedicated to different units of the business . In a financial services company , it could mean having an HR person who only focuses on investment banking jobs , another one who looks at stock research , and so on . These specialists then would be clued in to the trends in that business and better meet the hiring needs of each unit . <p> However , this is a costly proposition and might not be possible for all companies . The next best solution is to involve the department manager , who is , after all , best-suited to understand the job requirements thus find the ideal person . <p> When assessing a candidate , a department manager would typically concentrate on finding the best person to meet the department 's goals . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about other things like cost , and the candidate 's " soft skills " . They get caught up in what Dr. Sanika Kerkar , head of talent acquisition at RPG Life Sciences , calls " intent hiring " . In other words , HR cares more about whether the candidate will fit into the company 's culture , or the specific team , and so on . While this is very important , it can delay the hiring process because measuring these intangible aspects can take a long time . This could be a problem in the current fast-growing economy when companies need high-quality employees quickly . <p> For all these reasons , when it comes to hiring employees at mid to senior-level jobs , it 's imperative that department managers be involved throughout the process . The HR department can prepare a basic shortlist based on the resumes , but the department manager should be part of a panel which interviews the candidates from the initial phase itself . <p> Ultimately , the department manager has to get work out of these employees . <p> Mayank Chandra is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive search firm headquartered in London .

@@1629233 <h> Drohi : Stuck in the shadow of Mani Ratnam <p> September 10 , 2010 19:10 IST <p> Pavithra Srinivasan reviews Drohi <p> It is rather difficult to categorise a movie like Indira Innovations ' Drohi ( Betrayer ) , directed by Sudha K Prasad into a convenient slot . <p> But first , kudos to Mani Ratnam 's assistant for actually choosing a fairly difficult terrain for her debut movie : blood , lust , and betrayal among rival goons and their henchmen in the belly of Chennai , aka Royapuram et al , is no easy task . <p> She has managed to pull it off , courtesy a very capable technical team : Alphonse Roy ( of Aamir fame ) handling the camera and doing all manner of acrobatics ; Sreekar Prasad who tightens the reigns appropriately and Rajeevan , whose art-work is nothing to sneeze at ; he brings the distinct underworld feel to the movie . And yet -- there are the inevitable hiccups . <p> But first , the principal players : You have got a fair , tousle-haired Sami ( Shrikkanth ) lying trussed up like a fowl on railway tracks , shuddering every time a train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass by during the night , and one of them will run right over him . He does not know which , though , leading to his dying a thousand deaths every time a train screeches . <p> A horrible way to die , especially at the hands of your best friend . <p> Cue to a flashback , and these are the heaviest sections of the film : in the seedier section of Chennai grow up two boys -- Sami and Karuna ; one a rather timid Brahmin youngster , the other the obvious smart-aleck . <p> Karuna , slightly older , is the leader , dominating everything from conversations , to his first shot at kanja . The two go to school , where it does n't seem like they study much , but much fun is had , rollicking with friends and defying every teacher . Until a young , pretty lady , Roja ( Pooja , in a cameo ) arrives to class . <p> In the best Mani Ratnam style , she quickly gains their hearts and through them , the area 's as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the beach , solving their water-crisis , et al . Just as you wonder how much more of the syrupy sweetness you can take , she 's cut down in cold blood -- and Sami and Karuna are the only witnesses . <p> In a fit of revenge-taking spree , Karuna commits his first crime ; he slashes the throat of Roja 's assassin , but fate has other plans ; he 's caught . <p> And here , he gets his first taste of betrayal : Sami blurts the truth about him to the police . <p> From here on , it 's a mad cat-and-mouse game : neither the grown-up Sami , nor Karuna ( Vishnu ) can stand the sight of each other . Sami grows up to be the right-hand man of local bad-man Narayanan ( Thyagarajan ) , while Karuna , in a weird twist of fate , is working hard for his IPS exams . <p> The two snipe at each other whenever they can , finding ways to outwit each at every opportunity . There are quite a few Agni Natchathiram-like confrontations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and romance follows suit . <p> Sami is wooed in earnest by a remarkably bold girl Malar ( Poorna ) who wears cholis and skirts reminiscent of Heera 's costumes in Thiruda Thiruda , practically pounces on him at every opportunity and actually does have her own way with him . Meanwhile , Karuna , who has been in love with Sruthi ( Poonam Bajwa ) " even before she was born , " to quote himself , romances her in what looks like a throwback to Ayudha Ezhuthu . <p> Emotions escalate on both sides , bullets pop like popcorn , baddies fall by the wayside , men frown , or stand undecided , mouthing clipped dialogues until the past merges into the present , until , after a certain point , only one of them can live . <p> On paper , Drohi has the perfect script and cast : for Shrikkanth , this is clearly the chance of a lifetime and he 's done his best to perform . He certainly has undergone a makeover , getting rid of his moustache and assuming a morose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . It 's his dialogue delivery that does n't match up to what he 's trying to do , on-screen . <p> Vishnu , by contrast , has proven that he 's capable of performing roles such as these with ? lan . He 's bulked up and looks convincing as a cop -- but it 's the mischievous sparkle in his eyes when he 's putting one over his nemesis that shows his real potential . As Karuna , once-betrayed , still hurting , and then devastated , he 's impressive . <p> Both Poorna and Poonam have miniscule roles ( which is disappointing ) but of the two , Poorna walks away with honours . <p> After a long time , Thyagarajan looks composed and collected on-screen . S P Charan manages to look funny . The rest of the cast , comprising largely of bad guys , look the part . Selvaganesh 's background score is adequate ; among the songs , Konjam Konjam Vendum stays with you . <p> Despite all these plusses , the film stumbles at certain points . The dialogues , undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dialect is present , and so are plenty of cuss-words , appropriately bleeped out , but the impact is missing . Many scenes remind you of this or that confrontation in some Mani Ratnam movie ; some twists do make you sit up , but the impact is lost . <p> There 's little life in the proceedings ; they do n't draw you in , except in the last 10 minutes . <p> As a debut film , Drohi has its strengths . If it had managed to move from the shadow of Mani Ratnam , it would have been even better . 
@@1629234 <p> Mobilising on the basis of their caste identities , Dalits and Other Backward Castes ( OBCs ) have been able to wrest substantial rights for themselves over the decades . Although the less numerous and less powerful castes among the OBCs and the Dalits remain heavily marginalized in terms of all developmental indices , it can not be denied that reservations in public sector employment and educational institutions and other positive discrimination measures undertaken by the state for these communities has played a central role in their overall development and empowerment . In this process , of course , the role of caste-based movements of reform and protest remains central , in the absence of which the state might never have been forced to concede to affirmative measures to address their concerns in the first place . <p> The vast majority -- some estimates put the figure at more than eighty per cent -- of the Indian Muslims belong to various caste groups that were , and still are , considered ' low ' in the caste hierarchy . These groups are of indigenous origin that , over time , underwent a process of Islamisation , a process that is still under way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are , or claim to be , of ' foreign ' extraction , in which , typically , they take great pride . These are the Syeds and Shaikhs , who claim Arab origin , and the Mughals and Pathans , who claim Turkic and Afghan descent respectively . In the centuries of ' Muslim ' rule in India , these Muslims of ' foreign extraction ' , who also claim to be ashraf or ' noble ' ( as distinct from the majority Indian Muslims of indigenous , ' low ' caste extraction whom they looked down upon ) occupied key positions in society as rulers , landlords , and religious scholars ( ' ulema ) . This pattern continues till today , with most top Muslim politicians and ulema belonging to the same ashraf class . <p> One of the reasons for the overall ' backwardness ' of the Indian Muslims is undoubtedly the fact that the vast majority of the community are of ' low ' caste origin , having remained deprived and marginalized precisely because of their caste origins and background and despite their conversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Dalits , who have won crucial gains by mobilizing on the basis of caste , the Muslim ' low ' castes have witnessed no such substantial caste-based mobilization for their rights despite the fact that their social , economic , and educational conditions are at par , or perhaps even more dismal , than the former . <p> That such caste-based mobilization for rights and for making demands on the state have been relatively absent in the ' lower ' caste Muslim case owes principally to the continuing hegemony of the ashraf Muslims , who project themselves as the natural leaders and spokesmen of all Muslims and , as maulvis , as the authoritative spokesmen of Islam . While , in general , the ashraf continue to strictly practice endogamy ( thus perpetuating their castes ) and many ashraf maulvis continue to seek to sanction caste hierarchy in the name of kufu ( social , including caste , parity while choosing marital partners ) , in the face of demands by ' low ' caste Muslim groups for reservations for them in public sector employment and educational institutions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried foul , claiming that such demands are ' un-Islamic ' because caste itself , they argue , is an un-Islamic or Hindu institution or notion . <p> Typically , they have angrily decried demands for affirmative action for ' low ' caste Muslims as ' divisive ' , and even as a ' conspiracy to destroy Muslim unity ' or even to ' Hinduise the Indian Muslims ' at the same time as they make no effort to promote meaningful Muslim unity by , for instance , denouncing caste endogamy among the ashraf , making Muslim organizations more socially inclusive by incorporating more non-ashraf in decision making positions , or critiquing the divisive sectarianism of the mullahs , which takes the form of angry polemics between rival Islamic sects , each of which claims to alone represent Islamic authenticity . Behind such appeals of ashraf leaders to promote ' Muslim unity ' in the face of ' low ' caste demands for state-sponsored affirmative action , which they denounce as ' divisive ' and ' un-Islamic ' , one can detect a distinct nervousness at the prospect of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and representing the entire Muslim community . <p> In the face of growing demands on the part of ' low ' caste Muslims for reservations , ashraf leaders have typically responded by arguing , against obvious empirical reality , that Muslims have no caste at all , this being a ' Hindu ' institution , and that their identity is , or should be , defined simply by Islam alone . If pressed to reluctantly recognize the existence of caste among the Indian Muslims , an undeniable social reality , they would argue that the state should consider all of India 's Muslims , as an entire community , as socially and economically ' backward ' for purposes of reservation , rather than limiting this category only to the ' low ' castes among them .

The Imarat-e Shariah is a body of Deobandi clerics who claim to represent the Muslims of three eastern Indian states and to be authoritative interpreters of Islam . <p> In his letter , Maulvi Qasmi congratulated the Bihar Chief Minister for having included the Malik caste of Muslims as OBCs ( although the Maliks claim to be ' high ' in the social hierarchy ) and appealed to him to include what he termed ' the remaining three Muslim castes ( jatiyan ) ' in the state that were not already categorized as such in the OBC list , a reference to the socially dominant Syeds , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provoked a storm of protest from ' low ' caste Muslim leaders in Bihar , as well as non-Muslim OBC organizations , who saw it as a conspiracy to grab the limited gains that the OBCs , including the Muslim OBCs , had been able to wrest from the state . They pointed out the anomaly , or hypocrisy , as some put it , of Maulvi Qasmi recognizing the existence of caste among Muslims ( by pleading the case for reservations to be extended to the three ashraf castes ) while at the same time ashraf mullahs and other leaders of Maulvi Qasmi 's kind are quick to deny the existence of caste among Muslims when demands for affirmative action for ' low ' caste Muslims are made , whether on the state or on ashraf-led Muslim organizations . <p> Maulvi Qasmi is , of course , no exception , and he merely exemplifies the muddled , contradictory and self-serving stances of most ashraf leaders with regard to the issue of affirmative action for Muslims . It is clear that , generally speaking , these leaders remain vehemently opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if for the purposes of making demands on the state . That opposition continues to pose a major hurdle on the ability of ' low ' caste Muslims to mobilize for their rights and to work for their own empowerment and a cause , among many , for their continued marginalization.

@@1635234 1962 war with China <p> In this extract from Hinduism and its Military Ethos , Air Marshal ( retd ) R K Nehra , contends that among other reasons , one of the primary causes for the Indian humiliation in 1962 was due to the ' failure of the troops to do what they are trained and expected to do , i.e. ' stand up and fight ' . <p> The first majortest of the Indian armed forces came in 1962 when India was involved in a border conflict with China . In 1914 , an Englishman , Sir Arthur Haney McMahon tried to define the border between India and Tibet ( China ) on the highest watershed principle . The effort was only partially successful , as the central Chinese government of that time did not ratify the agreement . In the late 1950s , the border dispute between India and China ( who had incorporated Tibet ) started simmering . Some border posts were set up by the Chinese ; India considered it as incursions in Indian territory . <p> Around October 1962 , Jawaharlal Nehru gave a public statement that he had asked the armed forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it appears that China took the initiative .

There were unconfirmed reports of battalions and even perhaps a brigade , giving up their positions ( hard facts are difficult to come by ) . The Chinese forces advanced with extra-ordinary ease . It was not the defeat , but the manner of defeat which was most humiliating . Matters were made worst by the Chinese declaring a unilateral ceasefire on 21 November 1962 ; the Chinese withdrew to their original develop .

Over the centuries , Indian ( read Hindu ) commanders never learnt the basic lesson that ' victory ' speaks for itself and does not have to rely on ' ifs ' and ' buts ' . <p> Every type and manner of imaginary and untenable excuses were trotted out for the defeat and the humiliation , e.g. : <p> *Lack of Intelligence*Lack of acclimatization*Shortage of equipment ; proper ( winter ) clothing and boots were stressed*Inadequacy of all types and manner of resources <p> The ( trusting ) Indian public was led to believe that the troops could not fight due to inadequacy of equipment ; till date ( 2009 ) , most Indians believe that that was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the Indian troops fought well on the Western front , where the winter was much more severe . <p> At this stage , it would be relevant to record some views of Napoleon Bonaparte , the great French general .

Napoleon was asked to conquer Northern Italy , which France had been trying to occupy unsuccessfully , for a century or so . There were some two hundred thousand Italian and Austrian troops in Northern Italy at that time . Napoleon addressed his troops with words somewhat on the following lines - ' I know you have neither food nor clothing , nor boots ; but , we are going to win in any case ' .

It should have called in question everything connected with the armed forces . There was a requirement for a change in the very mindset of the armed forces and its controlling establishment .

This controversy enlivened the 2nd International Conference Green Telecom India 2010-India 's only event on Green Telecom over the allegedly high level of radiation and pollution from telecom towers and equipment including handsets . Highlighting the lack of regulations on radiation and other pollutants from telecom towers and equipment , Rajiv Mehrotra , president of Telecom Equipment Manufacturers Association ( TEMA ) , asked why it was the same foreign manufacturers who were implementing extremely low levels of radiation for their equipment in their countries were not using these technologies in the items they were selling in this country . banner According to international data he read , out of global pollution of 3.8 million tonnes , as much as 2.8 million tonnes was generated from India even though India had less number of cell phone subscribers . Mr. Mehrotra alleged " double standards " in the case of foreign manufacturers .

" One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Mehrotra , who is also founder chairman and CEO of VNL pointed out . " In the West they do not radiate at such high power in the tower " he added .

More cells , more noise and more radiation " he remarked recalling that cell phones and towers would reach out to 6 lakh villages soon . His remark that sparrows die from radiation from these towers raised a stir in the audience of telecom operators and executives . " There is no law to regulate these " he regretted . He called for immediate government action to enforce international standards here .

As telecom industry forms less than half a per cent of the ICT total , the pollution from it alone could not be alarming , he contended . Mobility being the major driver of communication in the country with wire lines very much limited , the cell phones were seen as having a disproportionate impact on pollution , Mr. Mathew contended . Another major reason was the extremely limited availability of spectrum in India as against the wider range allotted in the developed countries . This forced the Indian operators to install more cell sites to reach out to larger populations with lower allocation of spectrum . page-break Another cause was license requirements for a certain level of roll out of the service . " The operators have no choice but to make the best use of the lower spectrum resources " the COAI DG pointed out . However , the operators were now moving from passive infrastructure sharing to active infrastructure sharing . To reduce pollution , operators were using base stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substituted with hybrid ones . " We are aware of our responsibility " he stressed . Several telecom executives emphasized the need for greater availability of grid power in rural areas to obviate the need for setting up diesel gensets . " Government must give power to towers and base stations to reduce use of diesel " BSNL CMD Gopal Das said . Government support was also needed to offset the high cost of using alternative sources of energy like solar panels . BSNL was experimenting with pilot projects in the use of solar panels in Bihar , Maharashtra and other places and wind power in Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan among other pilot projects . banner The PSU had already achieved savings of Rest 45 crores in energy use in 2008-09 and Rs. 26 crores in 09-10 Mr. Das revealed .

And the industry is rife with talk that Bajaj Auto too is working on a small truck . <p> Such vehicles do n't require any rocket science ; so technology is not an entry barrier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from scratch for as little as Rs 25 crore . <p> While small trucks have displaced three-wheelers in the goods category with a market share of 80 per cent , the unfinished agenda in the passenger category remains huge . <p> The three-wheeler market there is alive and kicking with almost 80 per cent of the market . And companies have fortified their portfolios . Bajaj Auto has nine three-wheelers , Piaggio and Mahindra &amp; Mahindra have two each and Atul Auto has seven . <p> And this market is growing at a fast clip . Ernst &amp; Young Partner Rakesh Batra reckons the market for passenger ultra-light commercial vehicles will grow at 12 to 14 per cent per year over the next five years . <p> As a result , Tata Motors ' share in the one-tonne and below category of goods carriers fell from 61 per cent in January-July 2009 to 54 per cent in January-July 2010 . Clearly , it has a challenge on its hands . <p> Market approach <p> Only too aware of it , Tata Motors has unleashed a slew of initiatives . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Zip , which could be priced between Rs 160,000 and Rs 190,000 . <p> But is n't it a bit late in the day ? Mahindra &amp; Mahindra created this sub-category with its Gio last year , which was geared to hasten upgrades from three-wheeler load-carriers to four-wheelers . <p> However , Tata Motors is hopeful that its 0.5-tonne passenger-carrier , the Iris , will be the first such four-wheeler in India . The vehicle is being tested in Rajasthan and will be rolled out by October . <p> But passenger carrier is a different market . " For passenger carriers , the operator economics is not as clear as it is with an Ace . Unlike better load carrying and ride quality , less wear and tear and turnaround times , for passenger carriers it boils down to carrying eight to ten people , " says Tata Motors President ( commercial vehicles ) Ravi Pisharody . <p> " Most operators are unwilling to shell out a premium of Rs 100,000 or more over the existing options for a four-wheeler in this segment . " Thus , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- very close to three-wheelers . <p> The Magic will continue to cater to the deluxe segment , while the Iris will try to take it deeper into small-town and rural India , places where the three-wheeler passenger share-taxis ( as opposed to auto-rickshaws ) ply over 20 to 30 km . <p> Tata Motors has no intention to leave its rural plans to chance . <p> " We have set up a rural marketing vertical within our sales and marketing departments . Earlier , individual marketing teams would strategise for the rural markets they reached . But now , with a larger portfolio of vehicles priced below Rs 200,000 , it is worthwhile to look at it as a separate market rather than have every brand manager figure it out . The new team will analyse and implement what is needed , " says Pisharody . <p> But how deep is the company willing to go ? While Tata Motors will not go the fast-moving consumer goods way to towns with a population of 20,000 and below , it will have to assess the potential of towns that have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers towns with a population of 80,000 and more . ) <p> To help people with lower incomes , whom the Iris and Zip will address , Tata Motors has set up groups at dealer outlets to help them with sorting out their PAN card , driver 's licence and financing . " They ( the new customers ) usually do n't have a track-record of borrowing with the banks . We can help them with Tata Motors Finance , " says Pisharody . <p> To expand the market , the company has been increasingly tapping quasi-public banks such as rural and cooperative banks which now contribute over 20 per cent of the loan funds . Eighteen months ago , these contributed less than 5 per cent of the loan corpus . <p> " They already have a good reach and afford us the same with financing options , " says Pisharody . Purvanchal Gramin Bank with around 100 branches in the area around Gorakhpur in east Uttar Pradesh is one such example . <p> Expanding reach <p> Meanwhile , Tata Motors is also fortifying its warhorse , the Ace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to begin with . <p> " When we had launched in 2005 , the concept of dealership branches was not there in a big way . We had about 50 dealerships , which had another 50 to 75 branches . Since the launch of the Magic and the Ace variants , we realised that we need to get into smaller towns , " says Pisharody . <p> Tata Motors has thus encouraged its dealers to set up 1 S ( sales only ) outlets as opposed to the full-fledged 3 S ( sales , stocking and service ) outlets . The dealer branches have to just set up a three-bay showroom with an attached sales office . This reduces the investment that a dealer is required to make . <p> Small commercial vehicles like the Ace do not have complex technology ; as a result , independent workshops too can fix these . <p> Tata Motors though has also decreed to maintain not more than 50 km distance between two service stations , made possible by the Tata Authorised Service Centres . If there are 400 dealer workshops , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise the number of touch points from 1,100 now to 3,000 in five years ' time . <p> Some time back , Tata Motors also realised that the Ace and Magic can be shipped directly to dealers , rather than route them through warehouses , because they are small and can be ferried in road and rail carriages . <p> At the moment , 75 to 80 per cent of the vehicles are sent straight to the dealers , up from 40 per cent a year ago . This has resulted in faster dispatches , quicker replenishments and real-time direct billing . <p> But this is a game others too can play . Bajaj Auto , the largest maker of three-wheelers in the country , has extended its rural reach in the last few years and added new features to its products keeping the demands from such markets in mind . <p> Mahindra &amp; Mahindra has 550 touch points for its Gio and Maximo , and can leverage the huge brand equity of its tractors to sell small trucks in the rural markets . <p> To bolster the Maxximo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year 's service free of cost . Mahindra Automotive Chief Operating Officer Rajesh Jejurikar says : <p> " It might be a challenge to initiate new buyers in the segment , but with Maxximo we seem to have overcome that . It now has 23 per cent in the regions where it has been launched . " <p> Rivals also point out that Tata Motors faces a shortage of manufacturing capacity . Sharing the Pantnagar ( Uttarakhand ) plant with the Nano has indeed meant that the production of the Ace and its family could not be cranked up to full capacity . <p> The projected growth for this category , according to Ernst &amp; Young , is 25-30 per cent over the next two-three years . Hence , ramping up has to be done soon . With Nano production shifting to Sanand in Gujarat , Pisharody reckons production of the Ace family will shoot up to 21,000 per month , up from 15,000 to 17,000 now . The Iris will have a separate line of 8,000 per month . <p> Component shortage that had been a problem will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already setting up shop near Pantnagar and the rest also planning to move in . Meanwhile , it is also looking at expanding the capacity of its plant at Dharwad in Karnataka . <p> One advantage that Tata Motors will have over its rivals is the resale market of its small vehicles . Its pre-owned programme has allowed it to consolidate the resale market of the Ace variants and given the company a chance to upgrade the customer to larger vehicles . <p> The life-cycle for the 500,000 Aces on the road is around three to four years . Since commercial vehicles make for more rational purchases than passenger cars , companies ca n't afford to ignore the vehicle 's return on initial investment when being sold off . <p> Tata Motors hopes this will be good enough for it to stay the leader in the small truck and carrier market .

@@1662238 <h> Minister for Human Resources Development and lawyer , Kapil Sibal , talks to Karan Thapar on how he views the issues arising out of the Ayodhya judgment and how the judgment has been received . The interview was broadcast over CNBC TV 18 on October 5 . The following full transcript has been made available exclusively to The Hindu : <p> Let 's start with the way India has received the Ayodhya judgment . There was a certain amount of apprehension and concern in the run-up to it , but it seems that the judgment has been accepted and the nation has taken it in its stride . Were you surprised by this ? <p> I 'm enormously gratified by the fact that peace and tranquillity have prevailed and there is , by and large , a very mature response of the lay public ... and I think partly because people want to move on , especially the young generation of India wants to move on . <p> So , is this response proof of the fact that India in 2010 is really a significantly different country to what it was in 1992 ? <p> Oh absolutely , without a doubt . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realise that issues of this nature will not find support among the lay public . <p> How much of that difference between 2010 and 1992 is because young Indians -- and perhaps I should say young Muslim Indians in particular -- have turned a chapter and decided that they want to go forward ? <p> Most of India has turned a chapter . I do n't think we can talk about Muslims and Hindus . Most of India has turned a chapter because the young generation wants education . The young generation wants opportunities . The young generation wants to be part of the nation moving forward in the 21st century , and therefore these issues , according to the young , are not so relevant in that dream of being part of the new story . <p> In which case , was the apprehension and concern in the run-up to the delivery of the judgment mistaken ? <p> Well it 's not a question of being mistaken . We do n't know what forces can actually ... ultimately fuel a crisis . <p> So this was necessary caution ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was wisely dealt with by the government . <p> Meanwhile , although everyone agrees that there are no winners and losers , and this is a continuing process that will culminate in the Supreme Court eventually ... there have been certain Muslim voices of concern . Some have publicly expressed disappointment , others have expressed despondency . What would you say to them ? <p> Quite frankly , I 'm a little amused by this for the simple reason that I believe that in a judicial process you 'll have verdicts of this nature , and ultimately , unless the verdict attains finality , I do n't think one party should feel triumphant and the other party should feel despondent . Remember , many a time the trial court verdict is affirmed , or completely set aside . So we do n't know what the Supreme Court is going to do . So for one party or the other to feel sad or despondent or feel triumphant I feel is completely inopportune and shows a lack of maturity . <p> You 're suggesting that when this goes to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could also be completely set aside ? <p> Absolutely , absolutely . That 's the judicial process . So what 's happening today is that some political parties are taking this to be the final verdict and therefore making public statements about things that they should not be saying -- because we do n't know what the final verdict is going to be . <p> So even when Muslim voices express disappointment and despondency , you 're saying , " do n't be disappointed , this is not the final position , things could change dramatically " ? <p> I 'm saying do n't triumph or do n't be disappointed because we do n't know what the final position is going to be . <p> Meanwhile , L.K. Advani has told PTI that this is in his eyes vindication of his Rath Yatra of 1992 . <p> Well , this is the exact point that I was making . Is it L.K. Advani 's belief , and does he know that the Supreme Court will affirm this verdict in its entirety ? And if L.K. Advani believes that , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that years of experience have stood him in good stead ... because many a time in the past the BJP has been thinking that the Supreme Court will do this and that and it has gone against what the BJP wanted . <p> So L.K. Advani is jumping the gun ! <p> He 's not only jumping the gun , I think he shows a sense of short-sightedness for a leader who is ascribed maturity . <p> L.K. Advani has gone farther : on the day the judgment was announced he said this had cleared the way for a grand temple to be built in Ayodhya . Do you share that sentiment ? <p> Again , as I said , when you talk about ' grand temple ' and you talk about ' clearing the way ' it 's premature . And L.K. Advani knows it . And perhaps they 're probably doing it because they believe in the oncoming elections they might find some advantage in saying it . <p> So you 're saying that in a sense he 's trying to exploit a sentiment and a mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the most , what should I say . If I 've to attribute a statement which has emerged from wisdom , I 'd have said that Advani would never have made this statement . So I assume Advani is wise , so he has made this statement for a political motive . <p> Or he 's being very unwise and inflammatory ... <p> No , I think there 's a political motivation behind it and he 's trying to justify to himself that what he did in the Rath Yatra was right . <p> Could this also turn out to be an inflammatory sort of thing to say ? <p> I do n't know . I can not comment on that . <p> Now , the judgment itself has been widely discussed and widely written about . As you see it , what are the important issues that are thrown up that will go to the Supreme Court ? <p> Quite frankly , I do n't want at this point to comment on the correctness of the judgment . I do n't think it is appropriate for us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really say " the judgment is right " or " the judgment is wrong . " <p> Absolutely . <p> The judgment does throw up enormous issues of ... <p> Let me clarify . Without commenting on the veracity of those issues and the manner in which the High Court has handled them , talk to me about the issues the judgment throws up . <p> There is , for example , the fundamental issue that will arise in the Supreme Court , that " can faith be the basis of a fact ? " <p> You 're talking about the Ramjanmabhoomi janmasthan issue ? <p> Right . And the majority in the judgment has held that there is a general perception amongst the Hindus that this is the janmasthan of Ram , and therefore the Ramjanmabhoomi ... and the conclusion of the judgment is that a Ram temple should be built there . That issue will certainly arise in the Supreme Court . <p> This was something that you 'd have seen in the papers has most worried the Muslims who have spoken out -- that they believe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so , the judgment has gone beyond the bounds of jurisprudence . <p> As I said , I do n't want to comment on the quality of the judgment . I do n't want to comment on the correctness of the judgment . I want to comment on the issue that will arise in the ... <p> How easy would it be for the Supreme Court to handle this issue ? <p> I do n't know how the Supreme Court will handle it . I am sure the Supreme Court will handle it according to the law . <p> But I take it this is a tricky and awkward issue to handle ? It 's not a straightforward one . <p> Every issue that arises from this case is a complex issue , right ? So because it is a complex issue , leaders of political parties should not be making simplistic statements . <p> A second issue that arises is that all three judges have accepted that under the mosque is a Hindu temple . Two of the judges have in fact accepted that that temple was specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and controversial Archaeological Survey of India report . How easy would it be for the Supreme Court to ... ? <p> First of all , many of us have not read the judgment , not analysed the evidence . For us therefore to say that the ASI report is right or wrong would not be appropriate . Historians can make that comment ... <p> ... and they are doing so ... <p> Historians have made those statements , but in the ultimate analysis , the Supreme Court will definitely look ... remember , this is the first appeal . In normal circumstances , these matters are not decided by the High Court . But there was a special dispensation . The High Court was charged with the responsibility of doing so . So when it comes up in appeal , the Supreme Court is going to look at each issue of fact and law meticulously -- especially of fact . Because if the facts like whether there was a temple underneath -- one judge has said there was a non-Islamic structure , that is , a Hindu temple -- what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple or is it a Hindu temple ? Whether it is a non-Islamic structure or not ? But these are factual issues again on which I have no expertise at this point in time . But this is a fundamental issue that arise on facts . <p> You see , the question about this sort of fact is that it is subject initially to interpretation . Because it is based upon a report which as you know is disputed by different historians . How do the judges of the Supreme Court decide which interpretation of the ASI to go with ? There are those who believe that the ASI proves it is a temple , and others who say it does n't . <p> Judges are charged with that responsibility , rightly or wrongly . <p> But they are n't experts themselves ! <p> Does n't matter . Judges decide upon copyright law , they decide upon trademark law , they decide upon scientific issues , they decide upon very complex technical issues on a daily basis . So you must have confidence in the Supreme Court , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a decision consistent with the Constitution . <p> Although I should point out that when they apply their mind they will be relying on the advice of some experts and those experts may be committed to a view and so the Supreme Court will end up taking that view . <p> That 's exactly what the judicial mind is actually meant to sift . Sift the bias from reality , and absorb the reality , and integrate in the judgment . <p> But given how controversial this point has already become in just the last four days , are you a bit concerned that it might be very difficult for the Supreme Court to handle ? <p> ( Chuckles ) The Supreme Court will have to do it whether it likes it or not . <p> No option ? <p> No option . Because they are charged with that responsibility . <p> Is there a possibility that when both these issues -- the Ramjanmabhoomi janmasthan issue of faith , and this issue of whether there is a temple underneath based upon a disputed ASI report -- that in both these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issues the court will go into " and actually say " we refuse to adjudicate on them " ? <p> No , again , why should I speculate on ... <p> It 's a possibility , I 'm saying ... <p> Anything is a possibility . The Supreme Court may affirm the judgment , the Supreme Court may completely set aside the judgment , the Supreme Court may do something else . I do n't know . <p> One other thing : I noticed that at least two of the judges in the judgment have actually accepted the Ramjanmabhoomi itself as a deity . How do you respond to that ? To a simple mind like mine , it seems like an illogical thing to do , or at least linguistically flawed . <p> Again , that 's a very , very complex legal issue . Because remember , the Ram lalla was placed in 1949 in the sanctum sanctorum . Whether that act by itself translates this into a deity or not I do n't know .

Soli Sorabjee ... as the Ayodhya judgment was announced by the Allahabad High Court , went on to say that it could all be over possibly in 16 months . <p> It could be all over in 16 months , it may not be over in 16 months . <p> It could drag on for years ... <p> Remember , the roster position and the significance of the matter and its complexity may require the Supreme Court to take time ... but that 's not something that I can comment upon . <p> The Supreme Court will be under no pressure to rush the issue ? <p> The Supreme Court decides on its own calendar , so the Supreme Court is not pressurised by any entity in the government or otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so believe that when the appeals are filed , there will be a status quo order and the Supreme Court will think carefully as to when it should take up the matter and how it should decide . <p> Let 's come to the solution proposed by the Allahabad High Court : a three-way split . Many believe that this reveals a strong strain of reconciliation and compromise inherent in the judgment . <p> Karan , in the ultimate analysis , reconciliation and compromise is the way forward . But that reconciliation and compromise should be left to the parties concerned . <p> But is it right for the court to actually show a way towards reconciliation ? <p> Again , whether it is right or wrong is something for the Supreme Court to comment on . It 's not really for me to say . But the fact of the matter is that reconciliation and compromise is the way forward -- the parties should get together -- and that 's the best way forward . In the absence of a compromise and reconciliation there is no choice left but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And the court may take any decision . I do n't know what the court will say . <p> Now in fact the High Court itself has said that the status quo will continue for the next three months , giving time for the three parties to find a method amongst themselves amicably to divide the land . Many people feel that at this point the government should step in and help them . <p> No , no , no , no ... the government has no role to play in this . The government can only state publicly that the government would like the matter to be resolved by the parties concerned . But I do n't think it should involve the government in forcing a decision of this very complex issue . <p> Explain to me why that would be an improper or a wrong thing for the government to do ? <p> Because what will the government do ? The government will be asked by the parties concerned " what do you think should be the decision ? " <p> And so the government will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a party to this . And then it 's a no-win situation for the government . And why should the government get involved in a private dispute ? <p> But is there no way that the government can say " the High Court has suggested that an amicable three-way division between the three of you , let me bring you together and ... " <p> Again you are assuming that the High Court decision is the final decision . <p> This is very interesting . The problem with the solution proposed by the High Court is because the High Court decision is not the final decision , none of the parties will want to accept the High Court advice at this stage . They will all want to go to the Supreme Court in the hope they could do better ? <p> I do n't know . That 's again prognosticating as to what the parties will do . But I would imagine that the parties aggrieved will go to the Supreme Court , the matters re-agitated in the Supreme Court and a decision taken . And remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> What are those ? Give me a hint . <p> For instance , the issue of possession . Who has possession of the site ? And what date of possession are you talking about ? What is the concept of possession in 17th century India or 16th century India when it all happened ? <p> Compared to today ? <p> Compared to today . What are the prescriptive rights under the law of ownership in the 21st century ? Do those prescriptive rights apply to 16th century India ? What is the concept of ownership in the context of a place of worship ? <p> These are fundamental issues ... <p> These are fundamental issues . <p> That the Supreme Court will have to go into ? <p> I hope so . I hope these are issues the Supreme Court will look at . <p> It 's very interesting you should raise this whole issue of ' what is possession ? ' because one of the grounds , if not the primary ground , which the High Court has come up with for this three-way split is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had possession . Now the question I want to ask you is this : as a lawyer , does someone get possession just because you worship at a site ? <p> Well , this is the issue . Supposing -- and I know of many instances where people worship ... go to a peepal tree and worship underneath . Right ? And some sadhu sits there under the peepal tree and thousands of people come and walk around it and worship . So who is in possession ? <p> OK , so that sadhu can not say " I possess the peepal tree because I worship under it . " <p> Oh yeah , who is in possession at that point ? And what does possession mean ? The essential element of possession is a right to egress and ingress -- a right to enter , and not let someone to enter . <p> Is that not inherent when you worship at a particular site ? <p> No , under the Indian Constitution you can not prevent ... I can go to a gurdwara and pray in front of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> So even though you have the right to enter and leave , you do not have possession there just because you worship there . <p> I do n't have possession . The gurdwara may actually own the land , in which case they possess it and they have ownership over it . But when you talk about the Babri Masjid or you talk about a temple or prayers in the 19th century , or the 15th-16th-17th century , what is the concept ? <p> You said something fundamental , and forgive me , just for the sake of the audience I want to make clear what is inherent in your argument ... what you 're saying is that just because Party A or Party B happens to worship -- perhaps for decades -- at a particular site does not give that party possession of that site . <p> Right . Because these are two suits for title . Remember , title is based on two things : one , ownership which is a prescriptive right established under the law , and two , possession . Now you can say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But you ca n't say the opposite -- that the fact that I have prayed here gives me possession ? <p> Right . That 's another issue . That 'll be decided by the court . That applies to both communities . If there is a mosque there or there was a mosque there for a long period of time , somebody can say that till 1949 or till 1992 there was a mosque . Right ? So I 've prayed there for a period of time , why should I not be entitled to pray there ? Right ? That 's another issue that the Supreme Court will have to decide . And the Hindu community will say " No , but way back in the 19th century we were also praying here . So there is an established practice of our prayers . " So therefore , these are issues that the Supreme Court will have to decide on . <p> Absolutely . And the fundamental , key thing that you have just made clear for us is that the fact that you prayed somewhere for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It may give you the right to continue to pray there , but not possession . Maybe , maybe not . That 's what the Supreme Court ... <p> That 's what the Supreme Court will go into , and in going into that , the Supreme Court may either validate the three-way split or negate the three-way split because it is critical -- that three-way split depends upon belief in possession . <p> No , no , the court may say a number of things . The court may say " none of you have established your title " ; the court may say " one of you has established your title " , as the court has said now . The court may say " two of you have established title . " I do n't know what the court will say , but remember , these are title suits , which means you are claiming ownership . Ownership is a very complex judicial concept . And what principles will be applied of ownership in the context of the fact that the mosque was built way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it so fiendishly complicated and fiendishly difficult . <p> For political parties to say that " my march has been vindicated , my Rath Yatra has been vindicated , and therefore a grand temple will be built " is , I think , jumping the gun . It shows an element of a lack of -- I would not say wisdom -- but perspicacity of the legal ... <p> The two are virtually the same . <p> Yeah , and therefore I do not expect mature leaders to make some statements , especially when they know that the issues are exceptionally complex , and the Supreme Court will deal with them .

@@1675231 <h> The Few Blacks That I Like <p> Now that the headline above has managed to offend some readers who 've turned their noses up in disgust and gone over to the next page , I can start my bigoted rant . Only , it 's neither bigoted nor is it a rant . It 's a rave actually , about bands that have the word " Black " in their names . How many of them have you come across ? Countless , right ? I sure have . Beginning with Black Sabbath ( sorry , I promise that I shall not mention their name again ; okay , maybe once more towards the end and that 's all ) and moving to The Black Keys , Black Mountain , Black Crowes , Black Angels , Black Eyed Peas , Black Lips , or even simply Black . I did a search for bands with Black in their names and came up with a list that could possibly fill up several pages of tightly printed text . What is it , really , with bands and the word Black ? <p> I recently put five albums of The Black Keys , an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a recent obsession with The Black Keys , an American blues-rock duo , whose music I love so much that I put all of the five albums of theirs that I have ( they 've released three more ) on a loop and when that marathon listening session ended , I was ready to repeat the process . Here 's a confession : I did do that . But then I realised that my obsession with The Black Keys -- although they are a great band ( think raw guitar , great drums and an overall gritty sound ) -- was turning unhealthy . So I turned to my music collection and , on a whim , started looking at all of the bands that I like with ' Black ' in their names . <p> Out popped The Black Angels , a psychedelic rock band from Austin , Texas , who play rock with a tinge of metal ( throbbing bass , drone machines , big drums ) and deadpan vocals . They make music that seems to say , " Hey , all of you wimps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rock . " The Black Angels have three albums out but I 'd recommend giving this year 's Phosphene Dream a spin . There 's a hint of Velvet Underground in their sound and their music is not exactly joyous but what I liked about their sound is the tightness that is often lacking from bands that are labeled " psychedelic " . <p> I recommend giving Phosphene Dream by The Black Angels a spin <p> It probably is n't surprising that most of the bands that I have with Black in their names make music that is no-nonsense noir rock . Black Mountain , formed in Canada , serves up rock that draws on vintage , classic sounds and Led Zeppelin-like falsetto vocals , backed by harmonies . They can sound a bit derivative -- and count on their influences , besides Led Zep , bands such as Deep Purple , Pink Floyd and even the Rolling Stones -- but then how many bands do n't ? <p> Well , one that certainly does n't and never did was called Black Flag . Far from being derivative , Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneers in what is often labeled as hardcore punk . Some bands define a turning point in rock . Black Flag is certainly one of them . Their unique music -- with its raw sound and non-conformist , angry lyrics -- has influenced legions of punk and post-punk bands . The band was formed by Greg Ginn in 1977 and in 1981 , Henry Rollins , an American spoken word artist , singer , actor and a man with various other talents , signed up as vocalist . Black Flag were short-lived . The band broke up before the 1980s ended but their influence is still strong on any hardcore band worth its salt . If you do n't have a Black Flag album in your collection , I 'd suggest getting one or two or maybe all of their six studio albums . <p> Not all the " Black " bands that I like serve up hard , angry rock . Neither are they indie and obscure . The Black Crowes have sold more than 30 million records and make music that is as mainstream as it gets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can pop into your car stereo and not be left unsatisfied . Incredibly , I discovered the band 's first studio album , Shake Your Money Maker ( 1990 ) , in a discount bin in a Mumbai record store and the album grew on me . I 've heard quite a few of their later albums , including the more recent ones , Lions ( 2001 ) and Warpaint ( 2008 ) , and I think a new album has just dropped from the band , but those have all been underwhelming . <p> Henry Rollins was the vocalist in the hardcore punk band , Black Flag <p> There are a few other bands with " black " in their names that occasionally feature on my playlists . Black Lips , rockers from Atlanta , have a southern tinge to their mostly garage-y sound ; and there 's a new , meaty band called Black Pyramid , some of whose tracks I have downloaded and am beginning to enjoy but I 'm still not clear about their provenance . Oh , yes , there 's a solo project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'm really sorry , if this offends you ) , Kiss the Anus of a Black Cat , that plays music inspired by shamanistic rituals . <p> And , as promised , here 's the mention of Black Sabbath , the most influential ( and , probably , pioneering ) heavy metal band from Britain : I do n't like them . Unless , that is , you play for me the version of Psycho Man , remixed by Danny Saber .

It is important that you check that the gold coin / bar / ring etc has a 24 karat seal on it . The cases of fraud amongst jewelers are common ; hence it is best to buy gold only from jewelers that you trust and that have a good reputation . It is a good idea to verify the purity of gold from another jeweler . <p> The advantage of buying gold from jewelers is that it is one of the cheapest sources plus it blends with consumer mindsets of buying gold from jewelry shops .

So , if your jeweler sells 1 gram of gold for Rs. 1853/- ( as of June 06 , 2010 ) , you can get the same from a bank for an additional amount of Rs. 278/- . So , for 10 grams of gold , you will pay Rs. 2 , 780/- more at the current rates . This is a direct hit in your profits when you sell the gold .

We have moved away from dull walls to more vibrant environments . <p> The office sector in India is on the recovery path , with the Bangalore market continuing to stabilise although landlords were forced to remain flexible when negotiating with tenants as demand still lagged behind prevailing robust levels of availability , according to a CB Richard Ellis report . <p> Speaking about rentals across India , Anshuman Magazine , Chairman &amp; MD , CB Richard Ellis South Asia Pvt . Ltd. said , " Since the beginning of 2010 we have seen movement in the real estate sector , including the office segment . Demand levels have improved across most metros and the markets are more rational now . There is an improvement in transaction velocity as well , especially in places like Mumbai and Bangalore where financial institutions and the IT sector have regained some confidence and this has led to improved take up of space in these cities .

Everest Industries , for instance , is among the early adopters of green-building practices in the country . In an effort to provide energy-efficient solutions to lower costs , Everest Industries has customised solutions to provide aesthetic office spaces which are energy-efficient too . ' Green solutions ' makes use of Everest 's expertise in building and construction and combines popular products like light gauge steel systems which are strong , re-locatable and can withstand adverse weather conditions. ? Everest 's commitment for greener practices in building and construction can be gauged from the fact that one of its products , Everest Fibre Cement Boards , is made from 40% recycled content and is considered the best substitute to natural wood and wood based products . ? <p> The company 's acoustic ceilings offer a number of advantages over the conventional false ceilings or other similar products . <p> For one , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with superior acoustic performance and improved resistance to humidity .

@@1685234 <p> While renewable energy was always considered more desirable from the point of view of environment protection , its importance has increased several times in these times of climate change . Solar energy is particularly seen as a very promising source in energy planning for the future in tropical countries like India . Interest in realising the potential of solar energy is fast increasing and organisations which have been pioneers in solar energy are attracting a lot of well-deserved attention . <p> In this context the experience of the Barefoot College ( also known as the Social Work and Research Centre ) is of great relevance as it has been a pioneer in several aspects of solar energy . <p> The Barefoot College 's main campus is in Tilonia ( Ajmer district , Rajasthan ) but it has sub-centres and affiliated organisations in several parts of the State and country . However , its solar energy work has spread much beyond this to three continents . <p> One important aspect of the Barefoot College 's work is the wide range of applications for which solar energy has been used . Another , perhaps even more important , aspect is the remarkable success in using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even illiterate ) villagers so that after about six months of training they emerge as barefoot solar engineers and technicians . On the job learning , of course , continues . It is these barefoot engineers trained at the Barefoot College who have lighted up villages using solar energy not only in the remote villages of Ladakh , Barmer and Sikkim in India but also in Bhutan , Afghanistan and about 20 countries of Africa . <p> At the Tilonia campus 45 kilowatt of solar modules with five battery banks provide power for 500 lights , several fans , a photocopying machine , more than 30 computers and printers , a pump set , a small telephone exchange and a milk booth with freezers . The installation of all these modules and applications were carried out by ' barefoot solar engineers ' with a maximum school education of class ten . According to data available with the Barefoot College , nearly 200,000 people were provided with clean energy and light in 16 States of India and 17 other developing countries . It has been estimated that in the process over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Installing solar energy systems in villages of Ladakh was a particularly challenging but equally rewarding task . The extremely remote and cold villages needed electricity badly but in reality had only kerosene lamps to light their homes . The SWRC took up the challenging task of taking solar energy to these villages with the help of local youths who were to be selected by local communities and then trained by the SWRC as barefoot solar engineers . This effort started in 1989 . Today several barefoot engineers take responsibilities for extremely remote villages . Twentyeight-year old Tse Wang Norbu , for example , has installed over 59 units . Thondup Dorze cares for 50 units he helped to install in 1992 . Today there is a demand from more and more village communities for solar electricity . They are even willing to raise funds for providing modest salaries to barefoot solar engineers and for the purchase of some spare parts and batteries . <p> A joint project of the SWRC and UNDP took solar electricity to more inaccessible villages in six States -- Himachal Pradesh , Sikkim , Assam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat similar pattern . This project was linked to saving fuel wood and other environmental benefits , specially by encouraging the production and use of solar heaters . <p> A special effort has been to provide solar lanterns to night schools . All the night schools run by the SWRC have been provided these solar lanterns . <p> The piped water supply system established in village Panwa in Ajmer district was also activated by solar energised pumpset . This pumpset draws water from a well ( more than 150 feet deep ) and fills up a water tank having a capacity of 80,000 litres . This solar energised pumpset has the capacity to provide 70,000 litres of drinking water . Such efforts open up the doors for experimenting with new applications of solar energy . <p> The Women Barefoot Solar Cooker Engineers ' Society based in Tilonia is a registered association of rural women who complete the full fabrication and production of parabolic solar cookers . This cooker can do the most environmental-friendly , cost-effective , daytime cooking on sunny days The in-built spring and clock system is accurately set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn rotates the cooker to track the sun automatically , making the sunlight fall on all the 300 ( 9cm x 12cm ) reflectors throughout the day . So once the cooker has been adjusted in the morning , uninterrupted cooking can be carried out the rest of the day . At Tilonia workshops , cookers are fabricated using precise measurements by bending , welding and cutting . Parabolic solar cookers of 2.5 sq.m. have been installed in nine villages and some institutions . <p> Recently I met some of the barefoot engineers of this society , including Seeta , Shahnaz , Shyama and Kamla , in Tilonia . They explained the working of the solar parabolic cooker installed in Tilonia in detail , including the working of the clock and the precise measurments needed to ensure that the cooker is able to track the sun . It is indeed remarkable that rural women with little formal education have not only learnt this work but also travelled to other places to install the system successfully . They are determined to make a success of it and are keenly looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to women trainees from six African countries including Chad , Sierre Leone , Zambia , Nambia , Kenya and Tanzania . Most of them were grandmothers who are committed to lighting up their remote villages using solar energy . They have come to Tilonia under the Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme of the External Affairs Ministry . Training of several previous batches has been completed and they have returned to their countries with the necessary equipments to install the solar lighting system and maintain them . <p> When I spoke to some of the trainees ( only very few spoke English ) like Susana ( from Nambia ) and Monica ( from Tanzania ) , I was pleasantly surprised at the progress they made in a few months and the confidence which their training had given them , despite problems like the language barrier . <p> Trainers from Tilonia , like Leela and Magan Kanwar , had obviously found innovative ways of overcoming the language problem . With little formal education , they themselves had been scared initially when they first took up solar training . But after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of solar systems , they were probably the most appropriate teachers as they could understand and overcome the initial difficulties and fears of the trainees . <p> With the help of such training , the solar energy programe of the Barefoot College/SWRC has travelled far and wide . In several States of India and in 20 other countries spread over three continents ( the most heavy concentration is in Africa ) , during the last 24 years , over 16,000 fixed units , 9500 solar lanterns , 70 water heaters and 60 parabolic cookers have been fabricated and installed in 770 villages , while 480 barefoot solar engineers have been trained , almost half of them women . <p> In the various villages where solar energy systems are installed , Village Environment Energy Committees are formed ; these prepare the comm-unity to take responsibility and ownership of solar units . Special emphasis is given to selecting the poorest women ( generally in the 35-60 age group ) with leadership qualities and a commitment to work for their villages , for training as barefoot solar engineers . Villages are selected on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the village committee discussions are held for assuming responsibilities and for the establishment/management of a fee collection system to cover management , maintenance and repairs of units . The village generally donates a building for a rural electronic workshop to be set up there . <p> In their villages they are paid through a stipend consisting of 60 per cent of the community 's contribution for the solar system . <p> As Susana from Nambia says , " I 'll go back to my village , light up my village and maintain the system . This will help my fellow-villagers and give me great satisfaction . " A few doors away , packers are quietly packing the equipments that will be sent by ship to the villages of Susana and other trainees and will probably reach their villages even before they return . <p> The author is currently a Fellow at the Institute of Social Sciences , New Delhi .

The Act was passed by the Indian Parliament on September 11 , 1958 conferring the armed forces with " special powers " in Arunachal Pradesh , Assam , Manipur , Meghalaya , Mizoram , Nagaland and Tripura . It was extended to Jammu &amp; Kashmir in July 1990 . In areas , proclaimed as " disturbed , " an officer of armed forces has powers to " fire upon , " " use force , even to the causing of death , " against any person " acting in contravention of any law , " " assembly of five or more persons " and/or " possession of deadly weapons . " The act also allows arrest without a warrant , with use of force against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected of the same . The act authorizes the officers to enter and search any premise to make arrests . <p> Paradoxically , the AFSPA gives army officers legal immunity for their actions . It may be , however , noted that legal immunity prevails for taking action as per the AFSPA . In keeping with this , there can be prosecution , suit or any other legal proceeding against those not acting in keeping with the norms prescribed by AFSPA . Even the government 's judgment on reasons responsible for declaring an area as " disturbed " is not subject to judicial review . Against the backdrop of the crisis in Kashmir and different opinions voiced on the relevance of AFSPA for the state , it is pertinent to probe a little more into this . <p> Elementarily speaking , the present Kashmir crisis is not between militants and the forces , but has escalated to the present stage because of unarmed civilians being hit by state-controlled bullets . The state police have also been engaged in these moves , which has led the death toll in the Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objection to AFSPA , granted that it is adhered to strictly , is not abused and is not used by those not linked with army to target civilians needlessly . Here , it may be pointed out that the army and police fall under two different departments . So it needs to be scrutinized carefully , whether some communication error has also led the J&amp;K police assume that they also have the authority under AFSPA to shoot as and when they sense a risk . Are they also guaranteed legal immunity ? Besides , one may draw attention to it be clearly laid out that the army officers are granted legal immunity if and when they take action in keeping with the AFSPA dictates . In other words , they are not above legal immunity if they abuse and/or violate AFSPA by taking action not permitted by it . <p> Going further , one has no objection to AFSPA being strictly adhered to during encounters with militants , any person or group being engaged in any action that is considered as contravention of law and/or dangerous to the security of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recall the instance of Tufail Mattoo , the young student who was killed on June 11 . He was killed by a bullet from police . What was his fault ? Now , would it be fair to assume that police responsible for his death should be guaranteed legal immunity ? Even if his death had occurred from an army officer 's fire , from what angle would the army officer have been allowed legal immunity for this action ? Tufail was not engaged in any activity that may be considered as violation of the national law . Neither any army officer nor police officer can be given legal immunity in case of Tufail 's death strictly in keeping with dictates laid out by AFSPA . Tufail is not the only Kashmiri civilian who has fallen victim to state-controlled bullets in recent weeks for no fault of his and for reasons that do not suggest violation of the national law . Should this be allowed to continue ? <p> Against this backdrop , Kashmiris ' anger seems fairly justified .

Should they have stayed back and not performed the funeral services ? Risking bullets and their lives , they were only playing a socially responsible role . Perhaps , it is essential for the concerned authorities to clarify whether such funeral services are viewed as violation of law and can army/police officers shoot at the mourners in keeping with AFSPA . <p> Rather than debate and deliberate over whether AFSPA should be withdrawn from J&amp;K , it is imperative to examine carefully whether the act has been strictly adhered to by the army officers and whether police too are sheltering under AFSPA for their crimes .

@@1752235 <h> TESTDRIVE The best thing about the refreshing and well-equipped Skoda Yeti is the way it combines everyday and everywhere driving with ease <p> Skoda has done it again . It has created a whole new segment in the market with its Yeti . As a crossover , it has the SUV-like robustness and ability , while the exterior makes it the size of an overgrown hatch . As expected , it comes with a premium image and solidly built parts inside and out . <p> The Yeti gets its squarish profile thanks to a roofline that does n't slope backwards . That , along with the upright A-pillars and D-pillars , ensures that the Yeti does n't take on an MPV look . Sure , the Yeti might seem like a derivative of the Fabia , but under the skin it is actually related to the much bigger Laura . Both are based on the PQ35 platform of the VW family . However with a 4.22-metre length , the Yeti is n't much bigger than a hatch and that will prove to be a boon in the city . The Yeti shares the Laura 's 2-litre common-rail diesel and unsurprisingly the 2578mm wheelbase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versatile all-independent suspension setup . <p> The Laura DNA is more apparent when you get inside the Yeti . The centre console , the instruments , the door pads and the gear lever are bits we have seen in the Laura . If there 's a difference , that 's in the quality of the plastics and the finish . The Yeti 's interiors feel a couple of notches up . The damping on the stowage bin on top of the dash and the sunglass holder is brilliant . <p> The dash also comes with a smart faux wood insert running the entire width of the dash and swooping down to wrap around the centre console . The Ambiente version of the Yeti makes do with a soft metal finish instead . The huge range in the seat-height adjust along with the tilt and reach adjustable steering allows you to find the right seating position . <p> The front seats are superbly comfortable with lots of travel and the rear row will also keep passengers happy , thanks to an adjustable back rest and decent legroom . Headroom is superb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the rear suffer the most as the high belt line and the big front seats give a stifling feeling and it 's not the most relaxing place to be in . Even though the Yeti has more knee room , cabin space is at a premium . <p> The Yeti 's luggage space is n't exceptional at 415 litres and at best you can squeeze in a couple of big bags . Though the wheel arches are tucked away nicely to give a square floor , the spare wheel under the floor hogs up a lot of space , and that 's despite it being a space saver . To liberate a bit more boot space , you could easily slide the rear bench forward . If that 's not enough , the seats can be folded down and , if even that is n't enough for you , then the second row of seats can be removed entirely to liberate a much more significant 1665-litre boot . <h> List of features <p> In terms of equipment , the Ambiente version will make do without lots of kit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes special off-road settings , automatic dimming driver side mirror , Parktronic sensors at front , hill descent control , hill-hold assist , side and curtain airbags , cornering headlights , audio controls on the steering wheel and the touch screen music system . So the Elegance variant is quite loaded . <p> The Yeti 's 2.0-litre CRDI 140bhp motor is impressive . It offers great flexibility , allowing the Yeti to do duty in the cut and thrust of the city traffic and effortlessly switch over to mile-munching mode out on the highway . <p> However , the highway is not the only place where the Yeti excels . Take it off the beaten path to give yourself , and the car , a treat . <p> The Yeti uses MacPherson-strut suspension with triangulated links in front , while the rear uses a multi-link setup . The suspension is pretty stiff at low speeds and sharp edges can be felt . However , as speed builds up , the ride becomes supple and comfortable . The Yeti displays a flat and consistent ride to take bumps and dips comfortably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite remarkable with the suspension providing excellent control on the rebound . <p> The Yeti turns into corners with an agility that begs you to drive faster . Push too hard and understeer will set in again but it 's very predictable and safe . The 215/60 R16 tyres start to protest , but there is enough and more grip on offer and everything is nicely reined in with a rather heavy handed ESP system . <p> In our fuel efficiency tests the Yeti returned a healthy 11.3kpl in the choked city streets . Good gear ratios and power delivery combined allowed the Yeti to use higher gears for better fuel efficiency . Out on the highway , cruising at over 100kph , the Yeti returned 16.3kpl . The Yeti 's 4x4 system was n't called to duty in either of these runs and hence sapped little efficiency . <p> However , keeping in mind the extra weight of the 4x4 system , the fuel efficiency is satisfactory . Factor in the 60-litre fuel tank and you get a massive range of 830km before needing to stop for fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very refreshing . However , the traditional idea of an SUV is questioned here as the Yeti is too small and leaves the buyer wanting for more passenger and boot space . The flip side though is that its compact dimensions will serve as a huge advantage for city driving . On weekend trips , the sophisticated 4x4 system and gritty proportions will help it go where bulkier SUVs struggle to go . <p> The Yeti is fantastic to drive and it is well-equipped too . <p> With the Rs. 16.62 lakh price tag for the top-end model , Elegance , with all the sophisticated hardware , the Yeti is good value too . <p> The icing on the cake though , is the way it combines everyday and everywhere driving with ease .
