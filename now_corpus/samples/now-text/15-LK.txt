I would like to pen a few words in his memory . <p> Words can not do justice to a man who passed through this world with such grace and finesse , in his kind , calm and quiet way . I thank you for the honour bestowed on me to write my memories of him ; memories that stem from genuine love and fondness . <p> As a teacher , he bore the responsibilities of six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despite being unremunerated for most of it . As a husband and father he was far ahead of his time . He showed that kindness and love were of paramount importance for the stability and unity of a happy family life . These fine qualities definitely made him a genuine person who , as he was sagacious , did not need to show that one needed to be sanctimonious in his beliefs , to be good . <p> The famous song , To Sir with Love , was written for teachers like Mr. Abeynaike . No wonder that a man of such exemplary qualities and dedication in both the classroom and sportsfield , remains synonymous with our Alma Mater . <p> Mr. Abeynaike was a father figure to many and certainly to me . He was uncommonly approachable , soft-spoken , kind and ever willing to listen to a student who needed his counsel .

It was apparent that some students , especially from affluent homes , were disinterested in their curriculum and their attendance in the classroom was more of a distraction and disturbance to other students but Mr. Abeynaike never considered his vocation to be a waste of time . He seemed to believe what Plato said , that " Those having torches will pass them onto others " and persevered to inculcate the importance of a solid education as a prerequisite to stardom , even though it probably fell on deaf ears . The nobleness that was intrinsic to teaching was definitely epitomized by him . <p> A Husband and family <p> As husband to his wonderful wife Daphne , he belonged to the class of men a lady could dream of .

I remember attending the meeting at Warden David Ponniah 's residence and being a part of the team that coaxed Ranil into taking on the mantel of first eleven cricket coach and Master-in-Charge . Despite his many commitments , Ranil accepted the post and like his father , did a great job .

Wasala <p> Courtesy The Island <p> Tenzin Gyatso , better known as His Holiness Dalai Lama XIV , is arguably the most popular spiritual leader of the world today . Though he does n't radiate ' spirituality ' , he demonstrates it by his practice and his precept ; he is the most relaxed looking ' holy man ' that people of all faiths are inspired to look on and listen to ; his smiling face looks hardly saintly ; by his own account , he is ' a simple monk ' ; he is the Buddhist ' missionary ' who advises potential converts from other than Buddhist backgrounds to stick to their original religions if they feel comfortable in them , saying that he believes ' that all the major world religions have the potential to serve humanity and develop good human beings ' ; by ' good ' human beings , he says he means those who ' have a good and more compassionate heart ' . ( In the same context he also said : ' This is why I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional religion , because by changing religion you may eventually find emotional or intellectual difficulties ' . But he adds that for those who think their traditional religions are not effective for them and for those who have no religious beliefs , the Buddhist way of explaining things may have some attraction ' . Source : a talk given in London , contained in " The Heart of the Buddha 's Path " , 1995 ) What better healing advice can a spiritual and ethical teacher give to humanity that is living today , as it is , in a world riven by brands of hate driven religious fanaticism ? The extremely politicized Nobel Peace Prize may have accidentally recovered some of its lost prestige by being awarded to the Dalai Lama in 1989 . But all the adulation that he inspires leaves him unaffected . He is an example , if not an epitome , of egolessness ; his relative freedom from ' the illusion of the self ' is the essence of his magnetic personality . This does not , however , stop him from being identified as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is the other side of his public image , for he is also a man of the world , a consummate politician , as he ought to be , as both the spiritual and temporal leader of his unique tradition governed community , the Tibetans . Tenzin Gyatso may be called a willing philosopher-king who is not being allowed to rule his kingdom . Historically speaking though , he is the deposed or self-exiled 14th ruler in a line of God-Kings that ruled the country from the mid-17th to the mid-20th century . <p> The Dalai Lama that we know has come to us through the media , which is as good as if he came to us in person . However , behind the affably smiling , lovable , somewhat clownish , yellow clad Yeatsian figure of ' a comfortable kind of old scarecrow ' is the sage who exemplifies in his conduct and speech the two cardinal virtues of wisdom and compassion taught in Buddhism . He easily reminds us of the Laughing Buddha , who is basically a part of Chinese Buddhist and Japanese Shinto culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Laughing Buddha was later admitted into its pantheon as one of the seven gods of good luck . Actually , the Laughing Buddha is believed to have originated in a mix of Buddhist and Shinto religions during the latter part of the Liang dynasty in China . Pu Tai or Bu Dai ( so called because of the trademark cloth sack he carried ) was a Ch'an ( Zen ) Buddhist monk who lived in that period ( 907-923 CE ) . Though a beggar ( a Buddhist bhikkhu is by definition a beggar ) , he was contented and happy in the way a Buddhist monk had to be . His never failing smile ( which expressed his loving-kindness , friendliness , metta/maitri ) made people happy wherever he went , and this earned him another nickname , the ' Loving/Friendly One ' . He came to be honoured as a bodhisattva ( a buddha-to-be ) . The Laughing Buddha is venerated as the Maitreya Buddha-to-be , the future Buddha according to the belief of Buddhists belonging to different sects . The Dalai Lama is regarded as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that embodies boundless compassion . Just as the Laughing Buddha tradition is claimed to have brought Chinese , Indian , Japanese , and later , even Western cultures closer together , so can the Dalai Lama phenomenon be regarded as a force for easing East-West tension and for dowsing sectarian passions engulfing the world at present . <p> There is no monolithic version of Buddhism that is followed across the world . Seeds of the Buddhist teaching which were planted by ancient missionary monks in different parts of the world have given rise to a bewildering mass of sects , movements , and divisions of Buddhism coloured by local cultures . However , the basic teaching of the Buddha , the Four Noble Truths , is common to all these versions . Scholars of Buddhism recognize three main schools : Theravada ( the Teaching of the Elders ) , the traditional Mahayana ( the Great Vehicle ) , and its split Vajrayana ( the Diamond Vehicle ) . Tibetan Buddhism , of which the Dalai Lama is the best known exponent , consists of elements from all three branches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sakya , Kegyu , and Gelug , the Dalai Lama represents the last . <p> Recently , it was reported that though he was invited to visit Sri Lanka by some Buddhist monks , he was denied a visa by the government . The government 's denial of a visa is not something difficult to understand . In this regard , the Sri Lankan government has been caught up in a Catch 22 situation in that Sri Lankans can not extend their eager hospitality to His Holiness without antagonizing China , Sri Lanka 's indispensable friend-in-need . The reason for this dilemma is that the Dalai Lama is being used by the West as a bludgeon against the emerging superpower , for the Tibet problem provides the West with an ideal opportunity to rock on its liberal hobby horse . The refusal of a visa to His Holiness by the government , while confirming our friendly relations with China , will not lessen the Lama 's compassionate goodwill towards the Sri Lankans , nor will such refusal unnecessarily disappoint them in spite of it effectively denying them a chance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are already able to see him well through his words and actions . <p> Dalai Lama XIV has been of interest to the West and to China in contrary ways from the very beginning . When the young Dalai Lama ( then only 24 ) fled Tibet and reached the Indian border after a two week trek across the mountains disguised as a common soldier in 1959 , it made world news , as Lynn M. Hamilton says in her short biography of the Tibetan leader ' The Dalai Lama : A Life Inspired ' ( Oct. 2014 ) ; according to her , the then US president Dwight Eisenhower put a trail of pins in a map tracing the Lama 's escape route ! Hamilton says that CIA operative John Greaney cabled to India asking on behalf of the US that the Dalai Lama be given asylum there . She is unable to say whether or not this US directive influenced the Indian response to the problem . But the Indian premier of the time , Jawaharlal Nehru , of his own accord , gave the Lama political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refugees in Dharamsala where he is based to this day . <p> China acts as if the Dalai Lama is a threat to it . He may or may not be , for different reasons . But one thing is clear : It is that he has become a pawn in the chessboard of geopolitics where the two major players America and China try to move him as their interests dictate . Unfortunate though that is , it does n't concern those of us who are only interested in the moral or spiritual message he has to communicate to the world . We remember that there were anti-Chinese protests in Tibet in the lead up to the Olympics in Beijing in 2008 , sometimes involving violence , which the Chinese blamed the Dalai Lama for . They said he was a political stooge in the pay of American intelligence . Chinese supporters maintained that there was no ' national liberation struggle ' as such in Tibet , but that ' secessionists ' backed by America were causing disruption . Zhang Qingli , the secretary of the Communist Party in Tibet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( in translation ) " The Dalai Lama is a wolf wrapped in a habit , a monster with human face and an animal 's heart " . This characterization is not accepted by many including both pro-China and anti-China commentators . In 2008 , Randeep Ramesh , a journalist attached to The Guardian , London ( UK ) , ridiculed the Chinese concern as a case of " a Chinese dragon ( being ) scared by a mouse that prayed " . <p> As far as that conflict ( that involving the Lama being wooed by the West and rejected by China ) goes , it is hardly likely that Tibet will eventually be able to assert itself as an entity independent of the latter , despite or because of the fact that it is wedged between three nuclear powers , while being located in a watershed that plays an important part in the world 's water supply . On the other hand , Tibet 's cultural deracination as a cross product of these forces is inevitable , but that will not be the end of the 14th Dalai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . The institution of the Dalai Lama as the political and spiritual leader of Tibet may have already lapsed into obsolescence . Probably , no one knows this better than the present Dalai Lama himself . According to Donald Lopez , professor of Buddhist and Tibetan Studies at the University of Michigan , ' the Dalai Lama has been one of the harshest critics of " old Tibet " ... ' . He adds that the Lama would have introduced political reforms without the Chinese intervention . Professor Robert Barnett , Director of Modern Tibetan Studies at Columbia University believes that ' as a political leader , he asks for very little -- he seems quite happy to accept a merely symbolic gesture like a cup of tea and a photo ' . That may be to put too low a value on his actual political significance . In any case , he has tried to come to an agreement with the Chinese authorities by opting for a degree of autonomy for Tibet while remaining a territory of China , provided it is allowed to enjoy a status @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large measure of self-government with its own political and legal systems . He has even indicated his readiness to let Tibet have a communist government , with " meaningful " autonomy , but China will not agree to such a settlement . It may be that with the death of the Dalai Lama ( 80 this year ) the world may forget Tibet as it was with him living ; it will be the end of history for Tibet under its god-king . The Dalai Lama 's lasting legacy for the world will be what he stands for today as a spiritual leader . <p> Professor Barnett points out that the Dalai Lama declared in 2011 , in an " Important Proclamation " , that he will make a decision on the problem of succession after consulting with other high lamas and the Tibetan public , and that this will be in 2024 . He has also hinted at the possibility of there being no 15th Dalai Lama . But if there is , the Lama has explained , there will be a child identified as his reincarnation after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " chosen by him while he is still alive , and he will leave clear written instructions . In another source which I ca n't now remember , he was reported to have confirmed that he will not return to Tibet . This was probably meant to send the Chinese a signal indicating that the time for a peaceful settlement was running out . He was also said to have suggested that his successor could be a woman . But it is generally the case that news hungry journalists misreport their own speculations as assertions allegedly made by the Dalai Lama . His promise to leave written instructions about his succession , Professor Barnett says , was " presumably ( intended ) to help journalists and others get the story right " . All this goes to prove that the Dalai Lama is no less a politician than a monk . <p> He set up the Tibetan Central Authority ( CTA ) , aka Tibetan Government in exile , for the Tibetan exiles in Daramsala who number about 100,000 . But he has relinquished political control of the government in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elected prime minister and parliament . Its constitution is based on Buddhist principles and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . So , the Dalai Lama seems to have divested himself of serious political responsibility as far as the Tibetan government in exile is concerned . While remaining the head of Tibetan Buddhism , however , he has assumed the role of an ambassador of Buddhism at large to the world . The Dalai Lama remains a symbol of wisdom , peace , and compassion in a world threatened by violence born out of religious fundamentalism and hegemonic politics . <p> The diminishing political stature of the Dalai Lama is being compensated for by his increasing spiritual significance for the world . As a teacher of Buddhism should do , he provides guidance for spirituality without religion ( though he does not describe it as such ) , an urgent need for the world today . Incidentally , I must make it clear that I am aware of the risk I am taking of annoying my readers who accept religions as well as those who reject them or have nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear with me , for I do n't mean to hurt their feelings . I am expressing some opinions ( relevant to the subject of this essay ) that are open to constructive criticism . It is necessary to distinguish between spirituality and religion in trying to explain in what sense the Dalai Lama is important as a spiritual teacher or leader , who is , strictly speaking , not ' religious ' in the normal sense , that is roughly in a theistic sense . <p> In Buddhism , there is no belief in a creator god who supervises our lives unseen from above and rewards or punishes us eternally according as we obey or transgress his moral law . The Buddha Gautama taught the karma principle , that is , the principle of causality which says that the good intents and actions of an individual bring about good karmic results , and bad intents and actions bad results ; no outside power is involved in that , so there is no need to praise , pray to , or otherwise propitiate such an agency . This is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Buddha , in fact , did not found a religion , a system of prayer and worship , but explained a non-religious ethical system based on self-realization , on seeing things as they really are , i.e. , on enlightenment . The whole of the Buddhist teaching can be briefly summarized as the Four Noble Truths : that life is suffering , that the suffering is due to a cause , that an end to suffering is available , and that there is a path leading to that end . The principle of causality known as karma underlies this four-term formula of the Buddhist teaching . <p> So while the concept of spirituality in religions involves a divine dimension , in Buddhism it does n't . What is considered spiritual in Buddhism is not tantamount to making contact with the so-called ' divine ' ; instead , it consists in attaining heightened mental states through the extinction of the sense of self . A basic teaching of Buddhism is that there is no enduring entity that can be called self ( soul ) ; the idea of self is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ states such as self-transcending love , inner light , ecstasy , bliss which have been found to be common to people of different religions as well as to people who have no religion . Since religions are ideologically different , these phenomena can not be explained in terms of their unchallengeable dogmas which contradict each other ; so there must be a non-religious principle involved , which means that spirituality must be separated from religion .

Sahabandu PC ( Member Central Committee ) Courtesy The Daily News <p> For a party that had its origins in the early fifties , at its second attempt at a general election , the party captured power under an umbrella called the MEP . The road to 1956 is intertwined with the 25 years of the political life of S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike , which he completed shortly before the victory of 1956 . <p> President Mahinda Rajapaksa <p> The relentless march to 1956 has its origins in the struggle for independence , the Buddhist Revivalist Movement , the Temperance Movement and the struggle of the rural intelligentsia of the country to come forward as against the English speaking upper classes that had governed the country during the reforms introduced by the British Colonial rulers . <p> It was the end of one phase in the history of the country and the beginning of the next phase .

They included the Sinhala intelligentsia , such as , the teachers , bhikkus , ayurvedic physicians and the vast majority of the peasants and working people . The result of 1956 baffled even the architects of the victory . <p> The Eksath Bhikku Peramuna led by dynamic Buddhist monks presented a programme of action shortly before 1956 to the MEP coalition . Among the important measures that they advocated were to : <p> *implement the Buddhist Commission Report ; *take steps to make Sinhala the official language of the country ; *promote the revival of our arts and crafts ; *promote Ayurveda and all other aspects of our national heritage and the return to a simpler way of life ; *bring about a fair distribution of wealth ; *refuse government assistance to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equality among the people . <p> Perhaps of all the stakeholders that participated to bring about the political tsunami of 1956 , the Buddhist monks were the most prominent . <h> Bhikku Peramuna <p> Ven .

Baddegama Wimalawansa Thera and Ven . Henpitigedera Gnanasiha Thera of Ratnapura . The late Buddharakitha Thera of Kelaniya was a leader of the Bhikku Peramuna . Howard Wriggins , the late US ambassador who predicted 1956 , commented that , " although the language agitation had little impact on the peasantry , the question of Buddhism had deep political importance for them and for many other groups as well . " <p> The storm which was gathering for sometime , suddenly manifested itself when all stakeholders united against the UNP government in 1956 .

There was a drastic change in foreign policy sporting closer ties with India and the opening of embassies in USSR and China . <p> These changes and events are now part of history to be assessed by historians and political writers who review this period .

So if we can find common ground between the two religions as opposed to diversities it would be useful . Of course the Tamil question never involved the religious aspect . <p> Qn : This is also your first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sworn in , and you have been appointed the envoy for reconciliation . How do you see India-Sri Lanka ties at present ? <p> Chandrika Kumaratunga : Historically all Sri Lankan governments have had excellent relations with India . Except one government before Rajapaksa had various problems , which exacerbated the war in Sri Lanka . And the Rajapaksa regime did not have easy relations with India . But for our ( Sirisena ) government it was n't difficult to pick up from where my Presidency left off ( in 2005 ) . We saw the bad consequences of Rajapaksa 's policies towards India . <p> Qn : Did India have any role in Mr. Rajapaksa 's electoral defeat ? In an interview to The Hindu he had blamed Indian intelligency agency R&amp;AW and Western countries of a conspiracy against him . <p> Chandrika Kumaratunga:That 's not true . No outside force had anything to do with . Except that right through Rajapaksa 's regime , international community lamented his policies , and asked me why I was n't returning to politics . But apart from that they had nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs .... Because he expected to win the election , he was in shock when he lost , and tried to look for scapegoats . <p> Qn : You had a pivotal role in bringing together the opposition in defeating him . How did that happen ? <p> Chandrika Kumaratunga : It just happened . Because everyone in the country starting from about two years into President Rajapaksa 's regime began to turn away from him . Even people from the opposition who normally would not have accepted my leadership , civil society in a big way came and asked me to return to politics . I said no , because I was very clear I would n't return to electoral politics , not to hold positions . After the end of the war when President Rajapaksa won the elections in 2010 I thought he would improve . But that was n't the case , he was getting worse . You cant force the hand of history . So we could n't force a coup , it is the people who must want a change . So when people started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was evident people wanted the change . People called me and said , I had brought the President in , I had to do something about him . I did feel I had done enough , my family had done enough , but I was ready to help . The real problem was that the opposition did n't have someone who could win the election against Rajapaksa . So I had to start looking around , under great difficulties . Mr. Rajapaksa had forbidden every single person of our party the SLFP from talking to me . MPs used to run when they saw me . Otherwise they would get a call from the President . Amidst such circumstances , I identified Maithripala Sirisena . There were n't many more to identify as it was to difficult to find anyone in the SLFP who was n't known to be corrupt or a murderer ( laughs ) . It was very difficult to find someone from my party at a leadership level like that . I had worked with Maithripala and I knew he fitted the bill , atleast somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ messages through people to him . Sometimes I used messengers . The same messenger could n't go often , because it would be reported . It was a police state . <p> Qn : Is there any truth to the story India provided communication devices , DRDO made satellite phones ? <p> Chandrika Kumaratunga : No .. completely false . We were using Viber . And the government did n't know how to tap Viber . Apparently it is difficult for any intelligence agency anywhere to tap into Viber , although some can identify out who is calling whom . But Sri Lanka did n't have that technology , otherwise we would have all been dead . I could n't afford a big office , I could only hire 2 people as Rajapaksa had closed down my office . But we managed somehow , and I can say that the main reason we were successful is that civil society really rose up . They were allies along with the UNP . Ranil Wickremshinghe was n't afraid to meet . I realised that we would need an alliance , because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a hand in bringing them all together , and that was it . Eventually the common enemy brought us together . <p> Qn : Given that , how much were you worried about Mr. Rajapaksa 's return to power in the recent elections that were won by the UNP ? Especially given the strain within the party over the SLFP party ticket given by President Sirisena to Mr. Rajapaksa ... <p> Chandrika Kumaratunga : Yes there was a strain between all of us , not only between the President and the PM . But that has since been resolved . And President Sirisena has redeemed himself during the campaign by his actions and statements during the campaign . I know that he was determined not to let the " baddies " come back . But the President was trying to keep the party together , and was misled by the two secretaries of the party who deceived him because they were for Rajapaksa . Finally he did sack them , but we felt he should have sacked them much earlier . <h> 4 Comments <p> This lady can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guilty of criminal misappropriation of land by the Courts .

@@3665234 <h> Main menu <h> Ending traffic snarls <p> Over the weekend , the police conducted two traffic experiments with the aim of minimizing the traffic in Colombo and the suburbs . One was in the Rajagiriya area while the other was in Maharagama . The aim of the new uniflow plan in Rajagiriya is streamlining the traffic flow towards Colombo during the morning rush hour while the new plan for Maharagama is aimed at ending the suburban city 's perpetual gridlock . Only time will tell whether these plans are effective enough . <p> The Police , to their credit , try various methods to control the traffic in Colombo and its environs from time to time but not always with success . The problem lies in the massive number of vehicles entering the city every day , including Saturdays . With most of the 60,000 vehicles registered every month entering the roads in Western Province , the traffic crunch gets worse day by day . The roads leading to Colombo can not be widened anymore , so the authorities will have to look for other alternatives . <p> First , the Police should study whether some of the uniflow systems in Colombo imposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VIPs serve any purpose in a climate of peace . Instead of solving traffic snarls , some of these have actually aggravated them . The additional fuel consumption is another important factor . They also severely inconvenience bus passengers who sometimes have to walk a long way to the bus halt depending on the direction of travel . A scientific study should be carried out on the traffic flow efficiency on one way roads such as Galle Road , Reid Avenue , Slave Island , Havelock Road-Kirulapone ( 1630-2000 ) etc. and appropriate actions taken . <p> Second , the Police must not meddle with the traffic lights unless in an emergency . The Traffic Police are in the habit of turning off the traffic signals at key junctions in the morning and evening rush hours and controlling traffic manually , which generally leads to utter chaos with bumper to bumper traffic that is sometimes one kilometre long in any given direction . The traffic lights are designed and operated with the multi-directional traffic flow in mind and are far more efficient than a human could ever be , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just leave the lights alone and the traffic will generally take care of itself -- the Police can book any offenders who run the red light . <p> Third , lane discipline is a must . Here 's where the Police should actually do something , like they have already done on the normal Katunayake Road . Buses , trucks , three wheelers and motor cycles must not be allowed to hog the faster outer ( right ) lane . This will allow other traffic to go faster . And on the part of motorists , they should know exactly where they are going , so that the correct lane can be used . If you have to turn right in 500 metres , it does not do you and other motorists any good if you are still in the left lane . <p> Fourth , the authorities should explore the possibility of levying a London style congestion charge ( exempted for electric cars ) or a road fund from motorists entering Colombo and also popularizing the concept of carpooling . Some cities in various countries already do not allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District . Moreover , cars with two people or more are given priority in traffic lanes . Some countries also give duty concessions for cars which can only be used on public holidays and on weekends . There are countries which allow anyone with a valid driving licence to ride a 125 CC or less automatic scooter without applying for a separate licence , to encourage the use of scooters that have a much smaller footprint . <p> Fifth , and the most important of all , is persuading motorists to leave their cars at home and use public transport . One bus can take at least 40 cars off the road and one train can take around 1,000 cars off the road . Apart from saving time , one can imagine the quantity of fuel that can be saved if more people opt to use public transport . However , this is easier said than done , because our public transport system is woefully inadequate and most motorists would not even contemplate the idea .

We also need a reliable fleet of car-based taxis which can be hailed on the street and a gradual phasing out of three wheelers at least from the major cities is desirable . <p> With Colombo poised to achieve megapolis status in the next few years , traffic management must be essentially incorporated in those plans .

@@3670231 <h> Main menu <h> Why Angus Deaton deserved the Nobel Prize in Economics <p> Every year , there 's a Monday in October when the world wakes up to the latest Nobel Prize winner in economics and collectively wonders : " Who ? " <p> Even economists like me often have to scramble to figure out who the winners are and what they did , knowing my mom or a neighbour will expect me to have an intelligent answer at some point this week . For me , at least , this year is different than most , since the winner , Angus Deaton of Princeton University , is such a towering figure in my field of international development . This is a prize for advances in our understanding of poverty and inequality . It could n't be better deserved . <p> I 'd never met Deaton in person until a couple of weeks ago , when he presented a paper at a small development economics seminar at Columbia University , where I work . ( In retrospect , that might well have been his last normal , intimate academic talk . Ever . ) But like many development economists , I can point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thinking had great influence . Speaking from personal experience , three times stand out , and all help to illustrate the work that got him the Nobel . <p> The first was almost 15 years ago . I was a master 's student at Harvard , more interested in economic history than anything else , when my econometrics professor , Rob Jensen , hired me to spend the summer in India to run a household survey -- a questionnaire on every family member 's work activities , earnings , health , education , and what food and items they consumed . I did n't know the first thing about household surveys , and so I bought a couple of books to bring with me . <p> One was Deaton 's Analysis of Household Surveys , a technical manual on analyzing poverty data . <p> The other was Deaton 's hefty 3-volume manual on Designing Household Surveys , written with Margaret Grosh , which weighed probably 20 pounds in reality ( and 50 in my memory ) . I needed a separate suitcase to bring them all to India . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 held a CD on the back page with the full text of the books . Even so , I could n't bring myself to give away these paper treasures , and carted the heavy bastards around the country for four months . <p> Deaton 's books contained the models for every measure of economic well-being the profession possessed . At the time , I took for granted they existed , and it never once occurred how hard they were to invent and get people to use . <p> As we walked to the office today , my colleague Suresh Naidu put it nicely . Before there were evaluations of anti-poverty programs , or analysis of inequality trends , or really most of empirical development economics , there had to be something more fundamental : measurement . <p> We had to know how to assess poverty , and we needed to have large-scale data to do so , to challenge our assumptions , and provide new answers . And Deaton as much or more than anyone else made this happen . Deaton helped bring about this data and measurement revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consumption as the best of a bunch of bad measures of poverty . Annual income works fine in a country like the United States where most people earn a regular salary from one source , but it 's meaningless when a household has dozens of small activities , varying day to day , most of which produce things the family consumes themselves . The other contributions were to show just how much we could pull out of these simple data , and ( as impressively ) to actually measure it in huge household surveys -- in countries that had never had that kind of data before . <p> We take for granted today that there are repeated health surveys of Uganda , or consumption data going back dozens of years in Cote d'Ivoire . But there was a time not that long ago when all of this had to be conceived and invented . Dozens of important people and organizations pushed this ahead . Deaton was one of the leading lights . <p> Most of us also know Deaton for some other big contribution . In my case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluctuations tormented developing country economies in the 1970s and 1980s . This was my second intellectual encounter with Deaton , when as a first-year Ph.D . student I started asking whether sudden shocks to oil or coffee or other commodity prices could send a country into political chaos as well . Of course , Deaton had beaten me to it . <p> Sudden falls in coffee and oil prices destroyed poor countries in the 1970s and 1980s , especially in Africa . Deaton had done some of the best work , both on the behavior of commodity prices , their effects on growth , and also on the reasons they caused macroeconomic chaos . <p> He also peeked into what the effect was on coups and political instability . In later years , hundreds upon hundreds of scholars would start using data from many countries to analyze why wars and coups happen . Deaton was one of the very first . <p> Deaton did n't win the Nobel for this commodity or political instability research . But it 's a nice example of why the Nobel committee chose him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so wide and his contributions so influential , in so many big questions of development . <p> His idle afterthoughts helped start huge literatures , like the cross-country study of coups and wars , often years before others caught on . Twenty years after his first paper on commodity prices and political stability , I wrote what I think is a much more comprehensive and definitive paper . But it 's much easier to try to finish a debate than ignite and inspire one . <p> The third influence Deaton has had on me is much more recent : his critiques of randomized trials in development . In developed countries , scientists and governments often test the effectiveness of new pills or new employment programs by comparing a treatment group to a control group , where the people who get the treatment are drawn randomly by lottery . <p> Until recently , these randomized trials were almost unknown in poor countries . Billions of aid dollars were going into untested programs with untested assumptions . Proponents of randomized program evaluation -- the so-called randomistas -- argued more field experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . <p> If you 're a below the age of 30 in the world of international development and have heard of Deaton , it 's probably for this controversy . Today , about half my work has used some kind of field experiment -- such as what happens to poverty when the poorest people get cold , hard cash instead of food or skills training -- so obviously I paid attention when an intellectual hero took aim at the method . <p> I think the early arguments between Deaton and the randomistas involved more bluster than substance , on all sides . Randomistas called their trials the " gold standard " of evidence . Deaton called this misleading . But what seemed like an attack on randomized trials was more subtle -- it was Deaton 's plea for modesty in what randomized trials can tell us . <p> Two weeks ago , he came to Columbia and presented a new paper on the use and misuse of randomized trials . It 's a more balanced and evolved piece after , I presume , many years of debate . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hope with the Nobel he will still have time to get it public soon ( though I fear not ) . <p> The basic idea is this : as development agencies and scholars have rushed to do more randomized trials , they 've overstated what those trials can tell us . The smartest randomistas of the movement know the limitations of experiments , but are happy to let the policy world 's enthusiasm get feverish , since good evidence is long overdue . But Deaton fears the average policymaker might take the results too seriously . <p> Sitting in my office a couple of weeks ago , he told me a story about the day he and his fellow economists started running regressions for the first time . It seemed like a magic tool to give all answers . And indeed it vastly increased our knowledge . <p> But many decades later , we recognize that most regressions are misleading , and know what to look for in good analysis . We teach regressions like a disease , one where we must find the cures for all its ailments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same way : better than what we had before , but still profoundly diseased and in need of a lot of care and attention before we believe any of the analysis it produces . I will not preempt his paper with his unpublished arguments and prescriptions , but ( as usual ) I think he 's right . <p> All in all , this is a great decision from the committee from the perspective of caring about poverty , inequality , and getting the evidence right . - www.foreignpolicy.com

At least a small step forward on a very very long road is better than not moving at all . Complacency is a very dangerous thing . <p> Q : What kind of books do you like to read most ? <p> A : Serious stuff , I guess . Something that teaches me something about life , about people , about another way of looking at things . We are very limited in our personal lives - there is only a particular range of feelings and emotions that we can go through - though admittedly that can get pretty broad sometimes too ! But books give access to an unlimited number of emotions . Then you become bigger , greater .

It is actually very hard to read what you have written some time back .

There is nothing objective about what we say . <p> Q : Out of the award-winning books and popular books , which category appeals to you most ? <p> A : Award winning , I guess . It depends very much on who the judges are - and what the award is . When I choose books at the British Council for example , when I do n't know the author , I check in the cover to see if it has got any award . That is how I discover great writers I had n't heard of , like Pat Baker for example . But then the genres such as Fantasy like Harry Potter and Detective like Agatha Christie are very appealing to me too . Those belong to the popular , I guess . Goes to show that really good writing is simply really good writing : award winning books are popular as well and vice versa . <p> Q : Have you got any special reading habit like reading while eating ? <p> A : I read mostly when I wait for something to happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their activities , I get a lot of that - possibly my vociferous reading is thanks to this fact .

The main technique is the " chicken leg " maneuver : As the wave nears you , lying on the board and with your head up , you bend your weaker leg until its heel touches your other knee . Then , as the wave picks up speed , you jump up onto both feet with your stronger leg ( or , as the instructors explain , your right leg if you are " regular " and your left if you are " goofy " ) to the back of the board .

My knees were scraped raw as I struggled just to get my balance on the board . But , by the end of my first lesson , I was able to spend at least a few seconds on my feet before falling back into the waves . <p> Besides beginners , who can learn while surfing waves that break easily on the beach itself , Sri Lanka draws long boarders and surfers who hang five , take waves while doing handstands and enjoy very long rides .
