We actually expected Jamba Juice to be our winner , but those looking for an exclusive blend of strawberries and bananas might be a little caught off guard by the slight apple taste .

That 's the question a lot of Arsenal fans have found themselves asking in the stands , on Twitter and in their own heads when Unai Emery 's starting XI has been revealed in recent weeks . <p> And it 's a legitimate question . <p> The dictionary definition of ' false dawn ' provides a decent summary of Ozil 's situation . " Something that seems to show that a successful period is beginning or that a situation is improving when it is not . " <p> On the subject of false dawns , Arsenal are pretty familiar with them . Particularly when it comes to Leicester City . <p> Their 2-1 home win against the Foxes in 2016 was supposed to be the springboard for Arsene Wenger 's fourth league title , but the Foxes recovered and ultimately went on to claim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the Gunners ' 3-1 victory against Leicester in October this season and what seemed to be Ozil 's breakthrough moment under Emery . The German playmaker captained the side , scored Arsenal 's equaliser , pre-assisted the second goal and assisted the third , the latter destined to be the best team goal of the season . <p> And yet here we are , three months on and Ozil seems further away from featuring in the starting XI than ever before . <p> Indeed , Ozil , the fastest player in Premier League history to 50 assists , has barely featured since Emery replaced Wenger . Since that impressive showing against Leicester , he has created just one more goal , in the twilight zone that is a home match against Qarabag . <p> But , his record and reputation aside , why should Ozil be playing ? Well , just look at Paul Pogba 's rebirth at Manchester United . <p> Since Ole Gunnar Solskjaer 's appointment , no player has been involved in more Premier League goals than Pogba . There was a time last year when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was ineffective and lacking in confidence . Nowhere near an ? 80 million ( $105m ) footballer . But now look at him . His revival is as good a demonstration as any that a player 's ' form ' is hugely dependent on the system and the demands of the manager within that . <p> Ever since Mourinho left and Solskjaer came in , Pogba 's been given the freedom to get forward and play his own game . His touches in the opposition box per 90 minutes have risen significantly from 3.1 under Mourinho , to 4.4 now . Conversely , Ozil 's figures under Emery ( 2.8 ) have declined by about the same amount , when compared to the role he had under Wenger in 2017-18 ( 4.0 ) . No one is suggesting the Spaniard is curtailing an entire team , but his chosen approach is almost certainly hampering the highest paid player in the club 's history . <p> The signing of that hefty new contract , back in February 2018 , was an extremely unusual move for a club who used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 a new deal . Their German playmaker turns 31 in October this year . The departure of Alexis Sanchez to Manchester United a week earlier was probably one of the factors behind Ozil 's bumper deal and is certainly one of the reasons why Aaron Ramsey will be leaving the club in 2019 . <p> Incidentally , all three feature in the top six of the most creative Premier League players this season who have played less than 1000 minutes , with Ramsey , Ozil and Alexis in first , second and sixth respectively for chances created in open play . <p> Player <p> Open play chances created <p> Mins played ( 2018-19 ) <p> Ramsey <p> 19 <p> 885 <p> Ozil <p> 18 <p> 980 <p> Vietto <p> 18 <p> 766 <p> Armstrong <p> 17 <p> 966 <p> Success <p> 17 <p> 858 <p> Alexis <p> 17 <p> 505 <p> Arsenal fans can argue about which of the three would have been the best to retain at the club but the reality is that only Ozil is signed up , and his relationship with Emery seems challenging to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emery 's stuck with Ozil , at least until the summer . They may as well make it worth their while . <p> The sad fate of the creative midfielder who plays with team-mates who squander the opportunities he creates is that he 'll be criticised for ' not doing enough ' . The assists are n't there so he 's not either .

@@30491233 <p> The Premier League champions have secured a number of top players using their strict policy but have also missed out on several priority signings <p> Manchester City 's team would look very different now if they had got all of their priority transfers over the line : Alexis Sanchez on the left , Jorginho in midfield and Dani Alves at right-back . <p> You could argue that City have dodged a few bullets there , although that does not account for the possibility that they would be performing much better for Pep Guardiola , who is getting the best out of the vast majority of his squad . <p> It also misses the point slightly , as these are players that City wanted to sign , and were very close to doing so . <p> Guardiola was asked about De Jong recently and while he was at pains to point out that he was not talking specifically about the 21-year-old , he said his club need to be smarter when it comes to fending off rival interest from the biggest clubs in world football . <p> " Normally , when you are involved with Real Madrid and Barcelona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he conceded . " You have to be quicker and more efficient . " <p> That has been City 's approach and it was no different with De Jong ; at the end of 2018 Barca sources were pessimistic on their chances of concluding a deal because the Premier League champions had put in so much groundwork , and were willing to pay Ajax 's transfer fee and De Jong 's wage demands . <p> In the end , it was good old-fashioned financial muscle that proved decisive and it has left some City fans and plenty of outsiders wondering if the wealthy champions could have splashed more of the cash that they obviously have . <p> City 's transfer approach is broadly this : they try to reach agreements with the players as soon as possible , and use their desire to play for Guardiola as leverage against the selling club . It is about City 's idea of value . <p> This has worked well in many cases . Bernardo Silva , Kyle Walker , Benjamin Mendy and Riyad Mahrez , among others , were signed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those players but they have regarded them all as good value . <p> The approach does not always work out , though , and it has led to some high-profile misses in the past two years . There is a lot of risk involved . <p> For example , they were unlucky with Jorginho because they had struck agreement with both the midfielder and Napoli , only for the Italian club to flat-out refuse to sell to City , so they could get a higher fee -- and compensation for Maurizio Sarri -- from Chelsea . <p> That was an unforeseen turn of events but it could be argued that had City met Napoli 's demands much earlier instead of haggling they would have eliminated the possibility of Chelsea making their move . <p> City held out for what they saw as a fair price and that is what they did for Alexis Sanchez a year earlier . <p> They were always confident that the Chilean would sign for them that summer ; despite interest from PSG and Bayern Munich , he had his heart set on playing for Guardiola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic rival but City 's approach left them with no choice . On transfer deadline day , Arsenal finally agreed to a ? 60m sale and Alexis even signed a City contract , but the deal fell through because the Gunners did not have time to find a replacement . <p> Each club pointed the finger at the other but City took the risk in running down the clock in a bid to force Arsenal not only into selling to an English club , but for the kind of figure City wanted to pay . Had they made their move sooner , they may have got their man . <p> Then there was Dani Alves ' remarkable 11th hour U-turn which left Guardiola and City furious . <p> It is hard to criticise the club too much for missing out on the Brazilian , given he had met Guardiola , agreed personal terms and engineered a cut-price exit from Juventus on the sole basis that he wanted to work with the Catalan again . <p> He eventually joined PSG because his wife wanted to live in Paris , but again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more efficient " -- for one thing , they let him go on holiday to Brazil before putting pen to paper . Could they not have eliminated any room for PSG 's overtures by acting quicker ? <p> The other side to this is that City want their prospective new players to be 100 per cent committed to playing for City and Guardiola , but if City expect loyalty from their transfer targets , could they not show a bit back when it comes to the crunch ? <p> Their approach is a two-way street and if a player has given them his word , could City not go above their valuation of that player if the selling club holds out for a few extra million ? <p> Not in all cases , of course ; Jorginho could have been signed earlier for not much more than the eventual agreement , but City showed the merits of their approach by refusing to pay ? 90m for Mahrez a year ago and then signing him for ? 60m in the summer instead . <p> And while they certainly could just pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of responsible spending that so many rival clubs demand of them . More importantly , it would do nothing to change the perception that they can be taken for a ride by clubs and agents . <p> Article continues below <p> City are still big spenders but by refusing to pay over the odds for players , they are trying to show the world that they will not be held to ransom . As Guardiola recently said , " A month ago , I started reading ' Ruben Neves , ? 100m . ' That is not going to happen . We are not going to pay ? 100m for a holding midfielder . " <p> That is an admirable and sensible business stance , and it has often been successful . <p> But while other clubs remain willing to dig deep into their pockets for top players , it does mean City will continue to miss out on important targets . Barca 's push for De Jong is further proof of that .

@@30491235 <h> Premier League teams rarely use all their substitutes . Why do n't they take advantage of such fresh legs ? <p> English football is bad for your health . According to a study in the British Journal of Sports Medicine , teams that play in leagues without a winter break lose players to , on average , 303 more days of injuries than their contemporaries in competitions that take time off around Christmas and New Year 's . This weekend also sees the fourth round of the FA Cup , another competition for England 's top clubs to worry about when it comes to their squads . <p> Given the shortened World Cup summer and the newly added strain of competitive matches in the UEFA Nations League , you might think that Premier League managers were doing everything possible to keep their players fresh this season . You , however , would be wrong . <p> Through 23 games , there have been a total of 91 unused substitutes in the Premier League . While both Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp and his Manchester City counterpart Pep Guardiola have both complained about the fixture-bloat in the English game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season . <p> The premier practitioners of juego de posicion and gegenpressing might have revolutionized the way the British game is played , but like most of the other managers in the Premier League , they 've shown little desire to innovate against the idea of traditional substitution patterns . <p> Think of how the average Premier League game plays out . Depending on the manager , the first sub comes somewhere around the 60th minute . Then maybe there 's another sub somewhere around the 70-80 minute mark , and then potentially a third move in the dying moments of the match . Rarely does the strategy seem pre-planned , and most subs come on as an injury replacement , as a like-for-like swap for a player who 's performing poorly , or as a defense-for-offense or offense-for-defense exchange to either close a deficit or shut down a game . <p> It 's almost always reactive , rather than proactive . <p> " If they have a good sports science team , managers should know whether a player can go 60 minutes or 90 on the day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yard Analytics . " Optimally , managers make substitutions punctually , so that they never have a severely fatigued player on the field . <p> Editors ' Picks <p> Watch on ESPN networks in the U.S. <p> ESPN+ is America 's home for a host of professional soccer leagues from around the world , highlighted by Italy 's Serie A , Major League Soccer , UEFA Nations League and English FA Cup . ESPN+ schedule <p> Welcome to the 2018 FC 100 <p> ESPN FC 's experts ranked the best men 's players and managers in world football . Check out the list . <p> How Mourinho unravelled at Man United <p> Fear , paranoia , difficult behaviour and constant battling with club officials and players led to the inevitable , writes Rob Dawson . <p> The greatest game never played <p> When Boca Juniors and River Plate were set to meet in Argentina 's most important match , Buenos Aires lost its mind , writes Wright Thompson . <p> " It 's like in baseball ; even if a pitcher throws six good innings , that does n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's usually good to be the first mover with tactical changes : challenge the other manager and make him react rather than vice versa . " <p> Among the top six teams in the league , only Arsenal 's Unai Emery has emptied his substitution holster in every match . ( Jose Mourinho also used all of his subs , but that seemed more like it was out of some combination of displeasure and desperation rather than any kind of strategic foresight . ) <p> Meanwhile , the stingiest substitutor of the Big Six is Tottenham 's Mauricio Pochettino , who has made just 62 out of a possible 69 changes . Of the Premier League managers who have been on the sideline for all 23 matches this season , only Crystal Palace 's Roy Hodgson , Burnley 's Sean Dyche and Newcastle 's Rafael Benitez have given less playing time to substitutes than Pochettino . <p> The big difference , of course , is that none of those teams has played more than 31 games this season . With the Champions League and an extended League Cup run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dele Alli recently both went down with long-term injuries , while squad players like Victor Wanyama , Moussa Sissoko , and Lucas Moura are all on the shelf , too . Did Pochettino substitution stinginess lead to the club 's current injury crisis ? Well , it certainly has n't made the team any better . <p> NCAA soccer is n't necessarily a breeding ground for innovation . I played four years of relatively unspectacular Division I collegiate soccer at Holy Cross in the United States , and most coaches are worried about job security , so they trot out the most conservative tactics imaginable . The best American kids do n't typically go to college , so the skill level is n't as high as it could be . And even though pretty much everyone is between 18 and 21 years old , the average program is n't too concerned about talent development . <p> But there was one specific game that , though meaningless at the time , feels important in hindsight . <p> In my senior year , we played against the Naval Academy on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The military academies never had particularly good teams and we expected to win ... until about midway through the first half , when Navy 's coach subbed off nearly the entire starting XI at once . <p> NCAA rules essentially allow an unlimited number of substitutions -- the official rulebook says " Either team may substitute up to 11 players at a time ... " -- and the only restrictions are that if you 're subbed out in the first half , you ca n't come back until the second half , and if you 're subbed out in the second half , you can only re-enter the game once . All in all , Navy used 21 different players over the course of the game . <p> At the time , it felt like they were cheating , using some bush-league gimmick to twist the rules just enough to eke out a win . But really , they were just making up for a lack of talent , and my disgruntled sentiment echoes the responses of coaches in other sports to the development of newer , more optimal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules prohibit professional soccer managers from ever replicating that kind of full-squad turnover , why should n't they try something similar when it comes to their substitutions ? <p> Unai Emery is one of the most proactive managers when it comes to substitutions , but it 's curious that many do n't follow his lead . <p> A couple of years ago , analyst Colin Trainor conducted a study for Statsbomb on the goal-scoring rates of all players who scored at least six goals in Europe 's big five leagues . Trainor 's findings provide a neat snapshot of the effects of fatigue : Players who were subbed on scored at the highest rate ( 0.65 goals per 90 minutes ) , players who were subbed off scored at the second-highest rate ( 0.42 ) and players who played the whole match scored at the lowest rate ( 0.38 ) . The players who came on against tired legs were most effective , while the players who did n't have to cope with their own depleting energy supplies were more effective than those who did . <p> Players will either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their energy knowing that they have to play 90 minutes . If a player goes into a match knowing he 's going to play only an hour , he can max out his effort over that stretch before being replaced by a player with fresh legs who gets to run around against a bunch of tired opponents . <p> By not using all three subs earlier in a match , managers are taking a hit in two directions : They lose out on the upside of the effect of three high-energy players and they get hit by the deteriorating performances of the players they 're not subbing out sooner . <p> " When managers think a match is going well , they 're afraid to change the team , " Altman said . " Unless they have no one fit on the bench , this just means that the opposition will have fresher legs for the later stages of the game ; it 's like going into the final round of a boxing match with one hand tied behind your back . " <p> Ole Gunnar Solskjaer has been extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to using his full bench during matches . <p> If the logic behind it is clear , why do n't managers make more aggressive use of their subs ? <p> " I would guess the reason is that doing this will result in them sometimes being left short if a player gets injured , " Trainor said . " If that did happen , I would imagine the manager would take serious flack for having the temerity to buck the trend and go against common conventional thinking . So by being prudent , as managers currently are , it means that rarely do teams end up with less than a full complement of players . It 's kinda like not going for it on fourth down in the NFL . " <p> On top of that , managers will have to convince their players that a place in the starting lineup does n't mean what it used to , or that being subbed out early does n't mean you 've failed . Right now , getting replaced at half-time is perceived as a fate worse than death , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some progress happening this season . <p> In four consecutive Premier League games from Dec. 2-16 , Emery made at least one sub at half-time . According to Statsbomb data , through 16 games , Emery was the most aggressive manager in the league , with his average substitution coming in the 63rd minute . ( The least aggressive personnel handler in England ? Hodgson , whose average sub occurs all the way in minute 76 . ) Emery has given more playing time to substitutes than any manager in the league , most notably finding success with soon-to-be-departing Aaron Ramsey , who has two goals and four assists in 235 substitute minutes . <p> Elsewhere this season , Chelsea 's Eden Hazard briefly terrorized teams as a sub in the first few games of the season . Wolverhampton 's Adama Traore , who 's played more substitute minutes than anyone in the league , has been a dribbling menace off the bench : He 's fifth in the Premier League in completed take-ons despite playing only 670 minutes , while everyone else in the top five has played at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Xherdan Shaqiri has an assist and three goals , including an off-the-bench brace in the 3-1 mid-December win against Manchester United . Meanwhile , Borussia Dortmund 's Paco Alcacer is second in the Bundesliga in goals ( 12 ) despite starting just five matches . <p> As analytical thinking continues to seep slowly into the game , perhaps those average substitution times will start to creep even closer to half-time . A study from Villanova professor Bret Myers suggests that the first sub should come before the 58th minute , the second before the 73rd minute and the third before the 79th . Trainor has even floated the radical-seeming idea of subbing a player in the 30th , at half-time , and in the 60th minute . Altman also thinks managers should consider subbing multiple players at once . <p> " Alex Ferguson used to do this by replacing Andy Cole and Dwight Yorke with Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer , " Altman said . " Two strikers off , two completely different strikers on . " <p> His example might provide a sliver of hope for Manchester United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If a Patriot League coach and Sir Alex Ferguson can both do it , then why not him ? Solskjaer already knows it works . Six league games in , he has n't just won all 18 points . He 's used all 18 subs , too .

" But he runs and he runs , he wins the ball , plays it simple , he makes some good runs into the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linking him with a return to Athletic Bilbao either . Herrera is thriving an attacking system where United 's players are encouraged to get forward and let their opponents do the worrying rather than the other way around . He 's been able to show some of the touches which saw him labelled a fantasia player in Spain , one with unique creative attributes . United fans saw that when he played for Athletic Bilbao , beating United home and away in 2012 , but have only seen it in flashes at Old Trafford . <p> Herrera ( and Mata ) recently met his former Athletic manager Marcelo Bielsa , the one who always insisted that attack was the best form of defence , for lunch in England . He 'd love to play against his former boss as much as most Manchester United would like to see games return against Leeds United . <p> Herrera is popular with United fans too .

Herrera loves being at United . Is n't it better to have players like that ? <p> And he 's decent . Would he be in a list for the top five midfielders in football ? No . Would Darren Fletcher have been ? No . Both are selfless team players who bring balance and bite . <p> Ander Herrera was reportedly linked to a move back to Spain or to Italy , but has greatly improved under Ole Gunnar Solksjaer . <p> He 's not Scholes ' class , although he was superb in the FA Cup semifinal against Spurs last season . He only wants to play regular football . His two starts for Spain three years ago came after he 'd played well for his club , but like others he suffered from the managerial revolving door and the ever-changing tactics and line ups at Old Trafford . Herrera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis van Gaal , then had to adapt again for Jose Mourinho , although in all that time , he 's never played for anyone quite as crazy as Bielsa . <p> Herrera is unflashy off the pitch where he leads a quiet life -- except when he watches his beloved Zaragoza with mates from the stands rather than the VIP areas . On the pitch , he 's busy in a midfield three with Pogba and Matic at the base . That three beat Juventus away , yet Mourinho did n't play them together again in midfield . <p> Herrera likes and is benefitting from Solskjaer 's insistence that the full-backs attack and push wide . This opens up the pitch . Herrera 's job is to look up and get the ball forward or , in the words of Belgium manager Roberto Martinez , " look at wherever he 's been , he 's always made himself useful . " <p> Herrera has now played more games at United than for all his previous clubs put together . He 's fit , feisty and full of energy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Solskajer 's pressing game and he knows that the Norwegian wants him to take risks and not be scared of the consequences . He wo n't be dropped for five games if he makes a bad pass . He 's also versatile , can play in four positions and -- in his mind at least -- can score . He 's managed two goals this season , <p> Like the other players , Herrera is once again enjoying training . He likes the big game buzz and the cultures of away days . He 's got a huge match at Arsenal on Friday night . Herrera was one of the better players when the two teams met at Old Trafford last month in a spirited , entertaining , error-strewn 2-2 draw . Herrera set up a goal but United are in a much better place now , he 's effective enough to help set up a win .

The east African country , one of the biggest beer consumers in the world , always has an excuse to party and bars are open 24/7 . In fact , there is a four-day dance festival that attracts people from all over the world . Overwhelmed by all the heat and partying ? Take a trip to any of the 36 nature reserves , trek to see the chimpanzees , or just wander and marvel at the scenery . <p> Uganda will do anything to keep its admirers interested . In 2017 , the country , with support from World Bank , paid $1.5m to PR firms in Europe and America to bolster its tourism trade . In 2018 , it spent a further $1.2m on similar initiatives in China , Japan and the Gulf states . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new way of selling the country abroad : a beauty pageant that will have Uganda 's curvaceous women " showcase their beautiful curves and intellect " . <p> Kiwanda believes the pageant will attract visitors who will not only come to see nature and wildlife , but beautiful " real African " women . " Those curves , there is a story behind them . This is a story we want to tell , " he said at a press conference where examples of said curvaceous women were paraded . <p> Obviously , Kiwanda has never been a curvaceous woman , or any other kind of woman , in Uganda . Otherwise he would have known what Ugandan women endure , and his Miss Curvy campaign would not have been so tasteless . <p> He would have been more empathetic towards those bodies , which are grabbed on the street and preyed on by men under the watch of the police . Perhaps his campaign would have been about making the streets safe for female tourists , who are particular targets for heckling . In one case a German @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( motorcycle taxi ) . <p> If Kiwanda and the government he works for really cared about women 's stories , another woman would not have been murdered last month . Police would not have failed to investigate the murders of the dozens of women kidnapped last year -- resulting in the release of suspects for lack of evidence . It would be clear to them that the evil spirit behind laws that seek to punish women deemed indecently dressed in government offices or on the streets is the same spirit that fuels rapes and killings . And they certainly would not be trying to trade women 's bodies -- which they have long considered too sexy , provocative or deserving of abuse -- for foreign currency . <p> At first Yoweri Museveni , the president of Uganda , said he understood the concept of Miss Curvy , insisting that it was no different from any other beauty pageant . Later , however , he distanced himself from it . " This was not a cabinet decision . People should not come here to see women . I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tourism .

Uganda is a moral country . We have so many things we can use instead of women 's bodies , " he said . <p> When your enemies start to fight on your side , you must watch them very closely . The women 's rights movement should not be so quick to embrace Lokodo , Museveni and the religious leaders who find Miss Curvy despicable but stay silent when a woman is undressed on the street while men cheer . It is confusing to see the leader of a government where women are stopped from entering ministries and parliament if they are deemed too " sexy " now say that he is against the objectification of women . <p> A closer look at the reasons why government and religious leaders are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angry that the moral fabric of the country is being assaulted than concerned about the women exposed to harassment and abuse . <p> Tourism brings in about $1.4bn to Uganda annually -- nearly 10% of GDP .

Attracting revenue at the expense of women 's dignity is perhaps part of the plan . <p> The women who turned up for Miss Curvy say they are happy to be tourist attractions and make money at the same time . What they do not realise is that the system will be designed so that they receive only crumbs . <p> And , once again , the only winners will be the men who think a woman 's body is a source of vulgarity and distraction -- unless , of course , that body is being used for the benefit of a man , whether it be the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , or the abusive man in her home .

You might think you have an intolerance of gluten . Heck , you might just want to try a beer without gluten . No matter what your scenario , breweries out there are making gluten-free beer for you.6 Gluten-Free Beers That You 'll Actually Love <p> The good news is that big and small breweries alike are churning out gluten-free brews that actually taste pretty great . That said , you should know before you sip that some gluten-free beers do taste different if youre used to the traditional stuff . Not bad , per se , just different . But first , some important background information . <p> What Is Gluten-Free Beer ? <p> Though styles differ , typically brewers make beer using four basic ingredients : water , hops , yeast , and malt . That last ingredient , malt , is what gives most beer its gluten . Malt basically means a grain-often gluten-containing barley , wheat , or rye-thats been dried in a certain way . <p> 6 Gluten-Free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways brewers make gluten-free beer . The first is to replace the malts that contain gluten with those that do nt . These include sorghum , rice , buckwheat , millet , or even quinoa . <p> The second method is to use an enzyme to break down the gluten protein chains , though that results in gluten-reduced beer , rather than something thats truly gluten-free . <p> A ( slightly geeky , but important ) note about gluten-reduced beers : Most gluten-reduced beers come in at under 20 parts per million of gluten , which is generally accepted as the threshold for upsetting a person with Celiac disease . That said , there may be a slight risk associated with drinking gluten-reduced beer if you are Celiac , according to a 2017 study . Double-check the label . <p> Who Makes Gluten-Friendly Beer ? <p> There are probably around two dozen breweries producing gluten-free or gluten-reduced beer , said Doug Foster , co-founder of the entirely gluten-free Aurochs Brewing Company in Pittsburgh , PA . The number can be distilled down even more when you differentiate beers brewed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facility . <p> As recently as a few years ago , brewers pretended that gluten-free beer tasted like the real thing , but as a beer writer and someone who once thought he had Celiac disease himself , I can assure you that wasnt the case . At best , these beers tasted like thin , watered-down versions of their traditional style . At their worst , they tasted like alcoholic prune juice . <p> However , as craft beer has evolved , so too have gluten-free beer recipes . It wasnt that GF or gluten-reduced beers never had the capacity to taste good-rather , their poor quality was more a reflection on the early stages of any process , when revolutionaries are experimenting , getting feedback , and dialing in their recipes . <p> 6 Gluten-Free Beers That You 'll Actually Love <p> Today , youd be hard pressed to tell a well-made gluten-free or gluten-reduced beer from their more traditional counterparts .

Delicious IPA <p> This gluten-reduced beer from one of Americas best producers of hoppy India Pale Ales is made with Lemondrop and El Dorado hops , which give the beer a powerful citrus bite .

The Government of Ghana as a matter of Policy and practice does not bug the offices or homes of political parties and their leadership . Indeed it is not the Policy or practice of Government to illegally interfere with the privacy or communication of persons or organizations in Ghana . <p> To do so will be an infringement on the constitutional provisions of privacy .

The alleged conspiracy , if true , puts at risk politically exposed persons , families and associates of the ruling party , women and children in Ghana.It also puts at risk state organizations such as National Peace Council and the Electoral commission . The necessary steps therefore to ensure the security of such persons and institutions is being examined . <p> 5 .

And the Akufo-Addo administration will not renege on its responsibility in this field . <p> The government urges all stakeholders of our democracy to seriously take a dim view of acts that have the potential to undermine the nation 's democracy . Leadership from across the Political and civil society landscape should as a matter of urgency take a keen interest in complimenting the efforts of the state in further deepening our democracy and security . <p> Government will continue to act in accordance with law and best practice in preserving the security and the sense of security and will deal resolutely with any persons found culpable in an effort to undermine the sense of the security in the state .

In which the world of Fiorentina and Italian football lost a man who put the love of living before anything else . A love he has transmitted to those who knew him , and to those who have discovered him since that tragic day . <p> The impact he made since his death is even larger than what he had achieved in life , influencing the Fiorentina fans , team and club . Here 's how the world of Fiorentina has changed since the March 4 , 2018 . <p> Before the passing of Astori , the Fiorentina fans were disillusioned by the club 's lack of ambition , and protested against the owners , Diego and Andrea Della Valle , on a weekly basis . The Curva Fiesole did not accept the decision of the owners to stop investing in the club , especially from January 2016 onwards . <p> The Della Valle brothers had decided to only spend the money received from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike ; refusing to chant , or spending entire chunks of matches shouting vitriol towards the owners . <p> That all changed . And not because everything should lose importance after someone 's death . <p> Astori 's passing did n't shift the focus away from Fiorentina 's problems . It changed the focus . The owners seemed to have stopped caring . They stopped investing and seemed to lack the ambition to even get into Europe . And the fans ' only focus was to make it clear they wanted a change in ownership . <p> The tragedy of Astori reignited the belief that something bigger and better is possible . That Fiorentina have something to play for . The club directors have reignited talk of European football , restarted by building a young team that could grow together to be competitive again . <p> The fans have returned , filling up the Stadio Artemio Franchi on a weekly basis in the belief that results will come . Reaching the Coppa Italia semi-final after a 7-1 demolition of Roma is quite an achievement . Having over 33,000 fans at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Atalanta showed just what it meant for the fans to believe a trophy can be won . <p> And it 's not just on the pitch , but also off the pitch . A message , an example , a belief beyond football , life is amazing and should be lived and loved . This is Astori 's message -- football is not the only thing in life . <p> Astori loved life , and had an approach to it that should be taught and transmitted to all . Yes , there are important things , but take a relaxed approach , take a more moderate approach , and life will be easier , happier . <p> The fans have now a more relaxed approach towards results and towards team performances . They see that the players try as hard as they can , something that in the past decade was n't always true at Fiorentina -- For example when the Viola almost got relegated in 2011 , or in Paulo Sousa 's second season at the club , when the team more or less stopped playing in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the club , always honour the memory of Astori by never giving up , by fighting until the very end on the pitch , no matter the opponent . <p> The players have banded together since that tragic day . The minute 's silence in the first home game since the tragedy was literally the most silent minute 's silence ever . Unreal . The game that followed was incredible , with the Fiorentina players on their knees after the final minute are the emblem of how difficult it was for them to play . <p> Milan Badelj crumbling to his knees is an image that is simply unforgettable . He is the only player who left the club in the summer transfer window , and considering Fiorentina had sold 12 players the previous year , it shows how this group of players have bonded . <p> Stefano Pioli was perfect as a coach as he kept the group together , and transformed the tragedy in a positive message for the players , in making Astori as symbol to follow forever . Astori was a captain everyone recognised as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a psychologist and enter the minds of his players to keep them focussed on playing football , on getting results , on trying to get Fiorentina to the Europa League last season -- Fiorentina won the six games following their captain 's death , almost managing a European spot . <p> This current group always fights until the very end , always believes in better , never gives up . It might be easy to say it , easy to do it . But look at how Fiorentina played before the March 4 , 2018 . The last minute draw against Inter , a 3-3 draw against Atalanta after going 2-0 down in the first 18 minutes , they got a last minute draw against Sampdoria , and the same against Sassuolo . Time ends when Astori says it ends . <p> After losing all their best players the previous summer -- Federico Bernardeschi , Matias Vecino , Gonzalo Rodriguez and Borja Valero among others -- the team , club and fans had all lost faith . Astori 's passing has reminded everyone what football is about , and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most supported in Italy , that has tradition in terms of results , having won two Scudetti , having come second on more than one occasion and having history rooted in the Calcio Storico Fiorentino , one of the precursors of the modern Beautiful Game . <p> The club reacted in a magnificent way , towards the media and outside world , and especially towards the family . Respect , beyond everything . They have helped his girlfriend and his daughter , and have shown the world how to honour the passing of a great man in the best possible way . Respecting privacy , bur neither overexposing it , nor forgetting it . <p> The owners have helped financially -- the club guaranteed Astori 's daughter will have the chance to continue her education -- and also psychologically , always being close to the family and making themselves useful when needed . <p> After seeing the reaction of Florence to the passing of Astori and the funeral , the owners understood what it meant for everyone . Despite still lacking the financial investment the fans would want , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to regular European football . Fiorentina have to be ambitious , Astori would likely have wanted it this way . <p> The Coppa Italia semi-final remains a big achievement , and Fiorentina have a talented young side that could look at aiming for a European spot if the squad is completed with perhaps the midfielders needed . <p> Having signed Luis Muriel on loan in January -- with the intention of making the deal permanent -- and having already bought two young midfielders for next season -- Hamed Junior Traor ? from Empoli for ? 12 million , and Szymon Zurkowski from G ? rnik Zabrze for ? 3,7m -- the club have shown they want the results to improve . <p> Fiorentina lost a unique man , but gained an angel that overlooks this world , and has made everyone at Fiorentina different during this year , and from that tragic day onwards . The fans are back to supporting in its purest form , and the club have a reignited willingness to invest and take Fiorentina to Europe once again .

Here 's how to cut to save up for what matters most to you . <p> 1 . Guest List <p> The easiest way to cut costs is to trim your guest list .

Rent a less expensive place or better still just have a small gathering at your church where there usually is space . The church might not charge you for that . <p> 5 . Food <p> Reduce the number of overall dinner courses . Two or three delicious courses is far less expensive , and arguably even better , than seven pretty good courses .

It 's too late for Swansea but there is little point in having a system designed to increase fairness , when it is not implemented fairly . <p> Well-timed break of the weekend <p> The international break has arrived at a good time for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and Manchester United . The fortnight until their next game will allow Solskjaer to reset and reconsider things after two defeats that could stall their previous positive momentum , and hopefully get most of his players fit again . <p> But the performance in Man United 's 2-1 FA Cup quarterfinal loss to Wolves , described by Solskjaer himself as the poorest of his tenure so far , should still be concerning . <p> " I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We know that we played well against Arsenal last week and did n't get what we deserved , but we got what we deserved today . " <p> Before these games , essentially everything that Solskjaer did went right .

Of course that 's true to a point , but that does a disservice to the management of Nuno Espirito Santo . <p> Throughout Wolves ' promotion campaign he was devoted to a 3-4-3 system that was clearly a huge success , but its deficiencies in the Premier League were exposed and a run in the autumn that saw just one point collected from six games threatened to derail their season after a good start . <p> When a way of playing has been so successful previously it must be difficult to alter it , but that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 3-5-2 in December , switching to it full-time in January .

" <p> The most troubling thing about Sunday 's trip to Everton for Chelsea should , of course , be the result , a 2-0 defeat in what was effectively their game in hand , an advantage they have wasted . But not far behind is Maurizio Sarri 's response to it , simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If there is a running theme in this season under Sarri , it 's him emerging after adverse results and complaining that his team were good for a certain period of time , before dropping off a cliff and handing the initiative to their opponents . Sometimes they have escaped , sometimes they have n't , but the complaint is always the same . <p> Sarri has always professed he is not really sure why this keeps happening , but it does keep happening , and surely that 's his biggest problem : If he does n't know why it 's happening he does n't have much chance of stopping it , and if he ca n't stop it then he will have a problem staying in his job for much longer . <p> Conclusion of the weekend <p> It 's always sensible to be cautious about applying wider context to FA Cup games , but Watford 's win over Crystal Palace on Saturday perhaps provided more evidence of their status under Javi Gracia . <p> They ca n't realistically hope to be anything other than the best of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Saturday was the third time this season they 've beaten Palace , a club of similar size with similar aims , 2-1 , an indication if nothing else that they have got the best of a direct competitor . And with an FA Cup semifinal place thrown in too . <p> Misfortune of the weekend <p> This has n't been a good season for Millwall , lying one point and two places outside the Championship relegation zone . <p> The FA Cup run has provided some succour , so with that in mind the nature of their elimination was perhaps even more heart-breaking , goalkeeper David Martin somehow letting a Solly March free kick float into his goal in the 94th minute . From there , it felt inevitable that Brighton would win on penalties . <p> It 's the sort of goal that makes you question the existence of a kind and benevolent deity : After such a miserable campaign , you would think such an entity would let them have just this one thing , spare them this one indignity . Not so , as it turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not been a great few months for Marko Arnautovic , after he failed to get the move he wanted to China . <p> Since then , he 's been out of the West Ham starting XI through a combination of injuries and Manuel Pellegrini 's prudence . Then when he did get his start , in West Ham 's 4-3 comeback win against Huddersfield on Saturday , he was ineffectual , booed when substituted and watched his immediate competition for the centre-forward role , Javier Hernandez , change the game . <p> It will be astonishing , and probably counter-productive for all concerned , if he 's still at the club next season .

@@30694235 <p> Alex Iwobi has only five goals and six assists in 38 appearances , but his value is about more than goals and assists . <p> Football is very good at comparing young footballers to previous greats -- there 's a desperation to look for the next Diego Maradona , the next Thierry Henry , the next Cristiano Ronaldo . <p> But what happens when a footballer comes along who does n't quite fit an obvious template ? Well , the simple answer is that such players ' talents are n't always appreciated . <p> Step up Alex Iwobi , Arsenal 's Nigeria international who is n't really a winger , a central midfielder or a No. 10 and is n't particularly prolific in terms of goals , assists or dribbles , and probably ca n't be likened to anyone before him . Nevertheless , Iwobi has carved out a useful role for himself at the Emirates , and has been one of the major beneficiaries of Unai Emery 's first season in charge . <p> Editors ' Picks <p> ESPN FC 's experts ranked the best men 's players and managers in world football . Check it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this season under Emery , who has regularly chopped and changed in terms of system and personnel , but arguably the crucial feature has been the importance of an overlapping full-back . In the first half of the season this was Hector Bellerin , whose overlapping runs were n't simply an added bonus of Arsenal 's attacking play , but often the entire purpose of it . More recently , in Bellerin 's absence , the key man has been left-sided Sead Kolasinac . Again , the Bosnian has often been Arsenal 's chief creative threat , with well-timed storming runs and balls across the face of goal . <p> The crucial component in this attacking threat down the left has been Iwobi . On paper , Arsenal have often called upon Iwobi because he 's more direct than Arsenal 's other attacking options , capable of holding width and dribbling with the ball . His substitute appearance in a nervy 2-0 victory over Watford at the start of the campaign , for example , completely transformed Arsenal 's attack . <p> He 's been so important because he combines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and -- particularly crucially -- clever body positioning . <p> That final quality has become particularly revered in recent times . At the recent Opta Pro Conference in London -- a meeting of those working in football analytics from across Europe -- one of the key presentations was given by Carlos Rodriguez , an analyst at Barcelona . He explained how Barcelona are placing increasing emphasis upon using technology to track the body position of players during matches , and measuring this in quantitative terms for the first time . <p> " Incorporating the orientation of each player during the match would generate multiple benefits to improve current space-time analyses such as space control , pass probability and defensive pressure , " Rodriguez explained last year on the " Barca Innovation Hub " website . <p> " Play the way you 're facing " was the old clich ? d advice . Really , it 's about facing the way you should be playing the ball , and this is where Iwobi excels . He boasts a great ability , whether natural or learned , to receive the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next pass , usually to the overlapping Kolasinac or the alternative left-back , Nacho Monreal . Consider , for example , the way he linked with Monreal for Alexandre Lacazette 's opener in a 5-1 thrashing of Fulham early in the season . Or the way he slipped in Kolasinac to cross for Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang 's winner at Bournemouth . Or with Monreal again for Henrikh Mkhitaryan 's header at Southampton , or with Kolasinac again to win a penalty against Cardiff . <p> Alex Iwobi is a player who rates well in analytic circles due to his movement and link play . <p> Iwobi has n't recorded an assist , let alone a goal , for any of these contributions . Some of the passes have been relatively simple . But that 's nevertheless what Iwobi excels at : the simple , unfussy stuff , the bringing the best out of others . It 's not quite what you expect from a 22-year-old nephew of Jay-Jay Okocha , arguably the most extravagant , pure entertainer the Premier League has seen , but this is Iwobi 's role : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit the templates of established systems -- traditionally 4-4-2 in England , although No. 10s who suit a 4-2-3-1 and wide forwards who can play in a 4-3-3 have also become appreciated . But the rise of the 3-4-3 system over the past couple of seasons , popularized by Antonio Conte 's Chelsea , means a slightly new role : the position that does n't have a name , somewhere between forward , winger and No. 10 . Inside-forward , if you like . <p> Eden Hazard remains the master of that position , and his link play with the overlapping Marcos Alonso was particularly useful for Chelsea . But then Hazard excels wherever : out wide , as a No. 10 , sometimes up front . He 's not necessarily built for the role . Iwobi seems more of a specialist ; albeit a specialist for a position that does n't actually have a name . <p> It 's not like opening up space for a full-back is a new concept , of course . It 's a fundamental part of football , and one of the many qualities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his time at Manchester City drifting inside from a wide starting position . But then Silva offers several other obvious qualities : most obviously his prolific assisting . The fact he combines well with a full-back is something of an afterthought . For Iwobi , it 's his main quality . He does n't offer an incisive final ball regularly , but he 's worth using because he maximizes the contribution of the player behind him . <p> " When I ask Nacho Monreal and Sead Kolasinac who is the player who you feel better on the pitch when he is playing , they say to us : ' Iwobi , ' " Emery outlined last month . " It is because Iwobi can open space on the overlap for them . So I think Iwobi is giving a lot for us . " <p> Players often appreciate a different type of player than supporters and pundits . The fact Emery actively asks players on their preferences for playing alongside teammates is intriguing , but the answer provided by Kolasinac and Monreal is unsurprising . Both have thrived when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supporters . <p> To maintain a regular position in the side , Iwobi probably still needs to contribute more in the final third , as he recalls being told by Thierry Henry a few years ago . " He would always say that a lot of people play well , but if you have n't impacted the game or done something that people recognise , then you really go unnoticed , " he told Arsenal 's website . " Basically for an attacking player , you have to get that goal or you have to get that assist . " <p> A manager as obsessively analytical as Emery , though , will look past the raw end product , and be looking at stats involving passing combinations , xG chain and -- perhaps even -- body orientation . Modern stats , for a modern type of player . One day , perhaps we 'll be on the lookout for the next Alex Iwobi.

Adam forgot to include the best possible answer , however : the ideal thing the German record champions could have done with ? 80m would have been to buy another 10 Serge Gnabrys . <p> Yes , Bayern paid the almost obscenely low figure of ? 8m to Werder Bremen for the young forward in 2017 .

In the summer of 2016 , after four years at Arsenal and a disastrous loan move to Tony Pulis ' West Bromwich Albion , Gnabry had reluctantly come to the conclusion that playing regular football was more important than persisting with his dream to make it in North London . <p> " In my heart , I wanted to stay , " the Stuttgart-born player told ESPN . " I always believed that I had what it takes to play for Arsenal , but these things are not always down to you . " <p> Arsene Wenger had been an early believer , giving Gnabry his professional debut at the age of 17 . But after a series of injuries and indifferent performances , the son of a Ghanaian father and Swabian mother , had fallen out of favour . He went into the 2016-17 season with one year left on his contract and no indication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his first season at Bayern Munich , Serge Gnabry has proven to be a revelation for the defending Bundesliga champions . <p> " I realised that I had to work as hard possible , harder than before , " he recalled . His Arsenal teammate Per Mertesacker advised him to do extra sessions with physios to make his fragile body stronger ; assistant coach Steve Bould told him to be much more aggressive on the pitch . Gnabry took their suggestions to heart and was pleased with his form in preseason . <p> But he still needed a big , very lucky break to make some headway . It came courtesy of an injury to his German U21 teammate Leon Goretzka ( then at Schalke ) , which freed up a late place in the 2016 Olympic squad . In Brazil , Gnabry was a revelation in a more advanced role . He scored six goals to win a silver medal . <p> Then the phone started ringing : Arsenal wanted to extend his contract , but Wenger was too late . Bayern had decided to take a punt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the Bundesliga . Werder paid ? 5m to the Gunners and then sold him on to Munich for an extra million euros or so a year later , when his improvement had continued at a steady pace . <p> " It was a tough decision ( to return to Germany ) but it was a logical one , " he said . " I needed to play to get ahead . " <p> The same consideration saw him agree to immediately go out on loan , to TSG Hoffenheim .

I see football differently now , in a more analytical way . " <p> Last summer , he at last arrived in Munich , physically and mentally ready to rise to the challenge . He took a bit of time to get going at the Allianz Arena , but he 's evolved into Bayern 's most reliable performer on the flanks and their joint-second best scorer , with seven goals . His fabulous strike against the Netherlands in Germany 's 3-2 win last Sunday -- a " reverse Robben , " Suddeutsche Zeitung called it -- underlined his superb progress . <p> " I enjoy the opportunities given to me by Niko Kovac and the responsibilities that come with it , " he says , humbly .

His overall output is even slightly better than that of his Germany strike partner . <p> By any objective measure , Bayern have bought themselves an elite player for the fraction of his real value . And there is much more to come , still , he said . <p> " I have learned a simple formula : you get as much out as you put into your job , on a daily basis , " Gnabry said .

" <p> We believe this is a sign that the government is feeling the push-back from the Ghanaian public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been intensifying their pro-GMO campaign activities involving local scientists , media personnel and some farmers . The Ghanaian public has clearly seen through such efforts , and are asking the right questions . Dr Afriyie can not extricate himself from the GMO debacle without clarifying the official position of his own ministry on the matter . <p> We , therefore , take notice that after vigorously defending GMOs to the extent of earning the acronym " GMO Minister " , the Minister of Food and Agriculture , Dr Owusu Afriyie Akoto , has been compelled to again insist on a change of his position . Whilst FSG welcomes the minister 's new appreciation of the reality as a progressive development , it must be clear to all that this is not enough . <p> Reactions across the board among our membership as well as colleagues in the civil society and agroecology advocacy movements overwhelmingly see this as a step in the right direction from a key policymaker . However , most are quick to add that there is still a lack of clarity on what the position of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our food chain , despite the fact that scientific uncertainties persist , and consumers right to know is currently being undermined by the lack of laws requiring even the labelling of the so-called " approved " GMOs ! <p> What we find most worrying here is the fact that Dr Afriyie 's position appears to be an attempt to camouflage the official government policy , possibly with an eye on the 2020 elections . Clearly aware of the unpopularity of the plans of the GMO lobby , the government has clearly been very timid in promoting its official policy on GMOs . The only rare occasion we came across an official from the Ministry of Food and Agriculture , publicly declaring the stand of the government was during a " Question and Answer Session On Genetically Modified Foods And Its Implications For Ghana " , at the Obed Asamoah Conference Room of Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Tuesday , 16th January , 2018 , Dr. Solomon Gyan-Ansah , Deputy Director for Crop Services , Ministry of Food and Agriculture declared the stand of the government as being for the introduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Professor Kwabena Frimpong-Boateng , Minister of Environment , Science , Technology and Innovation urged the National Biosafety Authority ( NBA ) Board to educate the public on biotechnology and biosafety issues . He said it will help the public understand and embrace biotechnology as a better alternative to socio-economic advancement . <p> He said " Biotechnology is so important and we ca n't develop without it " , adding that countries like China in 1986 embraced biotechnology and did extensive research in various biotechnology systems which resulted in its fast advancement globally . <p> The government can not be speaking about GMOs from both sides of the mouth , where one side says " Yes " , and the other side says " No " . We find it disingenuous to tergiversate over an issue as serious as this just for electoral reasons . GMO 's are engineered to tolerate high doses of dangerous chemicals like glyphosate , which is now a proven carcinogen . <p> We live in a world of dangerous chemicals and fraudulent corporations . The government , therefore , needs to be as proactive as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which has announced its intention to suspend the import permit for Monsanto 's Roundup into the country . Should not our own government be doing this for the safety of Ghanaians ? There is already a third trial of Monsanto 's Roundup on the way . The first two all went against Monsanto , with their Roundup cited as being the causative agent of the non-Hodgkin lymphoma . We need to be grateful for the precedents set in law by the recent court findings in San Francisco and payments of damages and compensations to , first , Dewayne Johnson , a 46-year-old former groundskeeper , and to Edwin Hardeman , 70 , who used Roundup to control weeds and poison oak on his property for 26 years . <p> " We were finally able to show the jury the secret , internal Monsanto documents proving that Monsanto has known for decades that ... Roundup could cause cancer , " Johnson 's lawyer Brent Wisner said in a statement . The verdict , he added , sent a " message to Monsanto that its years of deception regarding Roundup is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profits " . The game is almost over . Monsanto is facing more than 4,000 similar cases across the US . We call on the government to put Ghana first and protect the health and environment of Ghanaians . <p> We repeat our call on the government for an indefinite moratorium on the introduction of GM food and feed into our food chain . At the same time , at the very minimum , we call for the labelling of all food and feed that contains GMO to afford consumers the right to know the contents of the products they purchase with their often scarce resources ! https : //t.co/M9drgNv9r6 <p> We also call for strict liability regarding the possible harm that the consumption and cultivation of GMOs can have on Ghanaians and the environment . We believe the language used in article 6 of Tanzania 's " Environmental Management ( Biosafety ) Regulations 2009 ? : " All approvals for the introduction of GMO or their products shall be subject to a condition that the applicant is strictly liable for any damage caused to any person or entity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations require food products derived wholly or partially from GMOs to be labelled in accordance with guidelines ; failure to comply with regulations attracts a penalty which is usually very hefty . On the other hand , voluntary regulations provide guidelines for labelling foods derived from GMOs , however , the decision to label is taken by the food product manufacturer or distributor . " A voluntary labelling is thus out of the question and not in the interest of public safety in Ghana . <p> These are issues that call for urgent government attention since Ghanaians take their food personally and very seriously .

The nature of one refutes the other . But a picture of a black hole has arrived nonetheless -- two pictures of two black holes , actually , on April 10 , in simultaneous press conferences held April 10 in six different locations around the world . <p> At those events -- planned for Washington , Brussels , Santiago , Shanghai , Taipei and Tokyo -- astronomers gave humanity its first look at the black hole at the heart of the Messier 87 ( M87 ) galaxy , nearly 54 million light years from Earth . With that , astrophysics has opened one more tiny crack in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ True to the nature of the science , the picture does not show the black hole itself . The defining feature of all black holes is that they are so dense , generating a gravity field so powerful , that nothing , not even electromagnetic energy -- which , of course , includes visible light -- can escape their pull . What the pictures reveal instead is the black holes ' so-called event horizons , the swirl of gas and dust and stars and light itself , circling the black hole drain , before they 're sucked inside never , ever to reemerge . <p> In April of 2017 , a global web of eight radio telescopes located in six places -- Chile , Mexico , Spain , Hawaii , Arizona and the Antarctic -- collectively known as the Event Horizon Telescope ( EHT ) , began surveying the Messier 87 black hole , as well as the black hole at the center of our own Milky Way galaxy , and likely gathered very different data from each . <p> The black hole at the center of our galaxy goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent to about 4.1 million of our suns . While that earns it the sobriquet " supermassive black hole " ( more common black holes can be as small as five solar masses ) , it 's actually something of a pipsqueak as these things go . It measures perhaps 24 million miles across , or about a 50 billionth the size of the galaxy . Trying to take an image of that from the 26,000 light year distance at which the Earth sits from the center of the Milky Way is like trying to spot an orange on the surface of the moon -- with the naked eye . The black hole at the center of M87 , by contrast , has a mass equivalent to perhaps 7 billion suns , or 1,700 times bigger than our own black hole . But at 2,700 times the distance , it was even harder to make an image of . <p> One thing that made the work possible was not just the number of telescopes collaborating in the search , but their geographic distribution . The distance among the detectors -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively means a collection dish nearly as big as the Earth itself . That allows for an enormous amount of data to be gathered and collated -- and over the course of the past two years , it was the collation more than the collection that was the more complicated part . The teams worked independently , sharing no information among themselves about preliminary results , lest they influence or contaminate one another 's data . Only when they were done did they regroup and prepare for the April 10 announcement . <p> There is scientific serendipity in the fact that two black holes of such radically different scales were within the reach of the EHT detectors , since they provide a much richer mix of data studied together rather than apart . Sagittarius A* is a relatively quiet black hole , with an accretion disk -- the ring of matter and energy that orbits the event horizon -- that is relatively dim . The black hole still has the power to swallow stars , it 's just not swallowing many . <p> The black hole at the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter and blowing out jets of supercharged particles that approach light speed and extend for 5,000 light years . " It 's a little bit counterintuitive to think a black hole spills out something , " astrophysicist Thomas Kirchbaum of the Max Planck Institute in Germany told Science News in the run-up to the announcement . " Usually people think it only swallows something . " <p> In truth , the particles that make up the jets are not being spilled by the black hole at all , since they never fell in to begin with .

On the contrary , Saturday 's triumph has only served to amplify the rumblings of discontent behind the scenes . The difference of opinion about manager Niko Kovac , a debate that 's raged " backstage " at the boardroom level , is now out on the open , a noisy distraction destined to dominate the final weeks of the season . <p> Karl-Heinz Rummenigge must have known what he was doing . Bayern 's Executive Chairman pointedly refused to issue a job guarantee for Kovac during an appearance on a Sky Germany talk show on Sunday morning and explained that the 47-year-old had been told to stop his extreme rotation policy before Christmas . <p> " Everyone has to perform and whoever ca n't deal with the pressure is at the wrong club , " Rummenigge added . That same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interview Kicker and chided Rummenigge for his implied criticism . " You ca n't work with someone you constantly undermine , " the 67-year-old warned . <p> Rummenigge and Hoeness , former Bayern teammates in the mid-to-late 1970s , have often not seen eye to eye since the former became a leading member of the board in 1991 . They have just as often made up again , finding common ground or at least settling upon a form of job-sharing . <p> It 's no secret in Munich that some players and coaches get chosen by one of them , while others get hired due to the wishes of the second alpha male at the club . For example , appointing Kovac was very much Hoeness ' idea after Rummenigge had brought Carlo Ancelotti to Munich and sought to get Thomas Tuchel in as the Italian 's replacement . Hoeness ' futile attempts to convince Jupp Heynckes to continue in the job saw Bayern lose out Tuchel a year ago , which prompted them to turn their attentions to former midfielder Kovac as a back-up choice . <p> Kovac has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bundesliga after being more than 10 points back before Christmas but it 's not enough for him to feel confident in keeping the job . <p> Rummenigge made it clear on Sunday that he 's still not 100 percent sold on the Croatian as the long-term option and Kovac , an inexperienced coach , has become a pawn in the the power struggle and the clash of egos above him . But the nature of the disagreement is n't purely a personal one . <p> In addition to their disagreements over personnel , Hoeness and Rummenigge also possess very different visions of football , and of the best course for Bayern Munich in particular . <p> Hoeness sees the club as an extended family and encourages the players to pour their hearts out in private meetings at his house outside overlooking Lake Tegernsee .

He 's less inclined to be patient with former or current Bayern heroes who do n't perform to his exacting standards as players or managers . According to a source in Spain , Rummenigge would like to see James Rodriguez stay in Munich -- he appreciates the Colombian 's technique and elegance -- while Hoeness is said to be unconvinced that the attacking midfielder 's quality outweighs his reluctance to be a team player . <p> Rummenigge 's stated intention to step down from his position at Bayern in 2021 has given his dream of winning another European Cup an element of urgency . The German champions ' elimination by Liverpool last month has done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Kovac is the best possible manager to oversee the squad 's transition . <p> Results in the league and the German cup will provide the ammunition for and against the coach in this personal and philosophical battle but worryingly for Kovac , there 's a chance that even winning might not be enough as the discontent with his work is not just restricted to board level . From within the dressing room , complaints from players about a lack of ideas and tactical sophistication continue to fester .

This scheme to conserve resources by eliminating half of all life makes no sense.In fact , it would n't save the planet . It would doom it . Let 's start with his decision to wipe out half of humanity.Now at first , you can see his reasoning.After all , there are 7.7 billion humans on the planet today.That 's nearly 7% of all the people who have ever lived in the history of our species . Which makes for a pretty crowded planet.So if half of us suddenly vanished ... would n't that be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we 'd still be left with almost 3.9 billion people . About the same world population in 1972 ! So if history repeats itself , it would buy us less than 50 years before we reached current levels again.And the same is true for many animal species , like deer , who 's healthy populations would help them rebound quickly . But unfortunately , the same ca n't be said for endangered species , who have the opposite problem . <p> Take gray wolves , for example.The US government eradicated them from Yellowstone in the 20th century.With the wolves gone , the elk population exploded and devoured the local vegetation , which disrupted the population of beavers , birds , and other species that relied on those plants to survive.And it gets even worse once you consider that half of every plant species on Earth is gone , too . <p> Because just like with animals , there are thousands of endangered plant species , many of which are too vulnerable to survive Thanos ' plot .

Many of which are already in trouble.For example , 50% of bee species in the Midwest have vanished in the past century.And the l esser long-nosed bat , a key pollinator in the Sonoran Desert is also disappearing . <p> So they would probably die off completely.And if enough pollinators go poof . We 're looking at a possible total ecological collapse.So , while Thanos ' plan would n't directly devastate thriving species , the chain reaction that could come from eliminating endangered species could really mess things up for everyone else left alive . <p> Nice going , Thanos .

@@30834232 <p> Government of Ghana has set 15th May , 2019 to 15th June , 2019 as a period in which Canoe and Inshore fishermen are prohibited from trawling on the country 's coast for fish . Under the agreed Closed Season Policy , Industrial Trawlers are expected to observe their ban from 1st August , 2019 to September 30th 2019 and , the Tuna Fleets are expected to observe the ban from 1st January , 2020 to 28th February , 2020 . <p> The Ministry of Fisheries and Aquaculture Development has settled on the above dates to arrest what they describe as , the depletion of the country 's fish stock . The Ministry , however , explains that it was forced to accept the said dates from the fisher-folks after they vehemently refused to accept the 1st to 30th August , 2019 proposed date especially for the Canoe and Inshore fishers , this time the ministry believes will give the fishes that have eggs the opportunity to lay their eggs and bring forth new fish in the sea to ensure that we 're replenishing the stocks and , to also deal with the issue of post-harvest losses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the market . <p> Scientifically , the Sadinella stocks are often pregnant around August so it was for achieving a maximum results of preventing the fishermen from catching the pregnant ones . The idea is to allow August to pass so that they will lay their eggs for the juveniles to go into the wild . The adults will then be available for capture . <p> You need every fish to spawn at least once to keep the cycle going . If we want to restock our fisheries , we need not disturb the spawning process . Within the same period , spawning takes place ; so as to achieve a maximum results . In other not to disturb the spawning process , the August date was proposed but , the fishermen rejected the said date and , decided to observe the closure of the sea from May to June 2019 , which will not yield much results . <p> So the question then is , what might have compelled the Ministry to accept the date as proposed by the fisher folks and not to go by what has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the necessary attention and enforcement will be fruitful if the said dates as proposed by the experts for the closure is adhered to by the fishermen . The Ministry as a regulatory body must not be seen succumbing to pressures from the fishermen to go by their date so as to , save the country 's waters and the depletion of our fish stocks . This when done , will also go a long way to curb the importation of fish into the country on large scales which affects the national purse . <p> The sector ministry 's decision to go by the proposed date by the fishermen is believed by some members of the general public and the opposition political parties to be shielding government from losing votes from the coastal areas after the fishermen threatened a voter apathy or voting against the current regime in the next elections when plans to close the seas was announced last year . This is also believed to have informed the decision by the sector Ministry for a postponement for further stakeholder consultation . <p> I paid a visit to two major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Chorkor ) to have an interaction with some of the fisher folks and , according to them , going by the acceptable and legal way of fishing denies them the anticipated harvest hence the decision to engage in illegal means of trawling such as , light fishing or chemical trawling . <p> Have you wondered why Ghana has not been able to follow the steps of Tanzania , Kenya among others with a ban on the importation of fish from China and even other countries ? The demand for fish is increasing whiles supply is shuttering so we depend on fish from neighbouring countries such as Benin , Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast to augment supply as a coastal country . <p> This is saddening and a threat to the future of this country . As a student of Development , I see the lack of Political Will on the part of Governments over the period to enact or enforce what will save the over 25 million people including the fishermen themselves for sustainable fishing to be profitable and also , reduce the level of destruction to the marine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to accept the closed season date as it has announced and go by what the experts had proposed . <p> Efforts to save our marine wealth must not be negotiated for the benefit of any group of people to the detriment of the country 's future . The argument that the Fishermen will loose their jobs and livelihoods within the period should be one of the reasons why they must be entreated to adhere to the decision by government to close the sea for the said period , so as to secure their fishing business for the future and save the country 's waters and fish stocks . While at this , let me draw your attention to what has brought the country to this status . <p> The illegal , unreported and unregulated fishing practices on the country 's coast are considered as some of the major causes of the menace . Fishermen in Ghana indulge in all sorts of illegal fishing practices in other to make bumper catch thereby destroying or catching fingerlings to win their profits oriented interest . <p> The country according to experts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rapid depletion of the fish stock or face stern food insecurity in the very near future .

Ghana in 2016 imported $135 million worth of fish because of the reduction in the country 's fish stock . <p> Some of the illegal fishing practiced by fishermen in Ghana includes the use of light , dynamite , carbide and prohibited fishing nets . One other dangerous form of illegal fishing practice is , the poisoning of the fish . These practices however do not only destroy the aquatic world but also serves as sources of diseases and premature deaths . When the poisoned fish for instance is being consumed by humans , it could cause cancer and these fishermen knowing that these practices are unacceptable , continue to practice it with the believe that , it 's the only way that can sustain their fishing business . <p> The lack of political will by Governments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be considered as a major contributing factor of the large importation of fish into the country today . Can we boldly say as a country that illegal fishing practices do not exist in our dear nation , and that we have been able to curb the depletion of our fish stock ? <p> The Chinese are all over the sea engaging in saiko fishing and selling them right on the sea . This in actual sense should not be happening since it will influence the Ghanaian fishermen to also engage in such acts which , will eventually have some negative effects on our fish stock as a country . <p> It is therefore important to bring to the notice of citizens of this country that , the rate at which Ghana 's fish stock is depleting is very alarming and needs an immediate attention ; which when not taken with some sense of urgency , will leave the country with the worst situation ever and , that is , not having enough fish or no fish in our waters . <p> Closing the seas within the stipulated period for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yields and , also enhance the country 's fish stock conservation .

Progesterone levels spike in the second half of your cycle , leading to water retention , breast tenderness , and sometimes water weight , she says . <p> But it 's not all bad news : Some women notice their breasts increase by a full size on their periods-again , thanks to progesterone which causes your body to pull fluid from the blood vessels to the tissues , making them appear fuller , perhaps to get ready for a potential pregnancy , she says .

According to M. Kathleen Borchardt , MD , an ob-gyn at Houston Methodist , the progesterone hormone builds up in your body before your cycle starts and acts as a smooth muscle relaxant-and that slows down spasms in your gastrointestinal tract , which might jam up your digestive tract . <p> The progesterone can slow down your normal gut motility and result in constipation , Borchardt explains , adding that you can take a probiotic if youre constantly battling the GI bulge during your period .

And if you can , stick to your exercise routine in spite of your cramps and fatigue . " At least 30 minutes of exercise daily leading up to and during your cycle , with a good mix between weights and cardio , can help release endorphins and combat the hormonal effects of your period , she explains . <p> Lastly , Borchardt says you can combat your hormones-and their side effects on your mood , hydration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Other vital observations from Tables 5 and 6 , relating to 2016 and 2017 , include : <p> the 2017 Budget reverted to " conventional " mode , with a higher overall balance ( cash ) than overall balance ( commitment ) but changed to include " offsets " in the Debt Report as well as 2018 and 2019 Budgets ; <p> the fiscal " identities " show in the original 2017 Budget ( Table 4 , lines e and f as well as lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes the reversal of legitimate FY2017 transactions to 2016 , thus violating the " cut-off " , " holiday " , and " next working day " rules . <p> Taking into account the sharp fall in crude oil prices in 2015 and 2016 ( election year ) and consequent fall in revenues that drove some SSA countries into recession , the fiscal deficits of 6.3 percent ( commitment ) and 6.9 ( cash ) are reasonable ( lines o and p . <p> Without the " offsets " the GH ? 7 billion " arrears " would have increased the fiscal targets for FY2017 and made the performance less impressive . <p> Conclusion <p> We must reclassify the 2016 " explicit offsets " that reduced GH ? 7 billion " arrears " by GH ? 5 billion in 2016 to give a better view of the fiscal balance .

It gives an artificially good account of the fiscal and primary balances but is inconsistent with , and postpones , the fiscal pain that comes with liability and debt management . The sudden shift to low and zero ( 0 ) MTEF arrears provision from 2020 to 2022 will worsen the fiscal situation and likely lead to more efforts at manipulation , as we move forward with our " Ghana-exit IMF " and the era of " Beyond Aid " agenda . <p> In reversing course , we must follow the PFM reform approach of putting the arrears that have been put below radar in the multi-year GIFMIS " Contract Database " and Accounts Payable Module . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Public Accounts in line with " semi-accrual " rules under IPSAS standards . <p> The practice of " offsetting " arrears explicitly or subtly may win short-term applause but will ultimately force us into a painful " arrears " clearance or liquidation plan , as was the case with the subsidies and wage overruns under the Single Spine Pay Policy ( SSPP ) . <p> The probable alternative to handling " hidden " arrears is to engage in " off-balance sheet " methods with third parties such as the recent hints about " factoring " -- involving discounting or loss to suppliers and contractors . <p> The management of hidden arrears is made worse by high public expenditures based on unfunded political promises that have diverted the use of oil revenues from development projects into consumption . <p> The combination of high debt levels , also from the banking sector bailout , and depreciating currency , is not consistent with the fiscal consolidation . <p> The sharp reduction in budget and primary balances should have led to less borrowing and panic among non-resident investors that exited Ghanaian bonds late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation described in the article is a pity , given the significant buffers that inform the true state of the end-2016 fiscal year . <p> These included oil and gas investments that guaranteed increased crude oil output from about 73,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) to about 180,000 bpd instantly upon take over in 2017 ; beefing up revenue as crude oil prices rose from sub-US$40 pbl to average US$65 pbl ; ESLA revenues of about GH ? 3 billion annually ; Sinking Fund balances and three year inflows that should reduce the level of debt -- including the US$500 million that was used to redeem a substantial part of the US$750 million debt on Ghana 's first sovereign bond ; and budget buffers in the Stabilization , Heritage and Budget Funds . <p> The mandatory 2019 Mid-Year Review under the Public Financial Management Act ( PFMA ) must be used to make the necessary adjustments and plan for liquidating the arrears that keep accumulating under the yoke of explicit and subtle " offsets " . 
@@30962240 <p> A new team of executives was assembled in January to lead the brand 's comeback .

The main components of the smoothie are almond milk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of those sounded perfectly palatable together . <p> The smoothie was fairly watery , unlike the thick and creamy Jamba classics .

@@31020238 <p> The introduction of Call Centre by the new management of Bulk Oil Storage and Transportation ( BOST ) company limited led by the Managing Director Mr. George Mensah Okley has received applause from its stakeholders Bulk Oil Distribution Companies ( BDCs ) . <p> In a stakeholder meeting organized by Mr. George Mensah Okley on Tuesday June 25 , 2019 at Airport West Hotel in Accra to discuss issues confronting the industry , the Managing Director of BOST revealed that his engagement with the stakeholders is to put an end to the tension which existed between BOST and BDCs in the past . <p> Speaking to Peacefmonline.com in an interview , Mr. George Mensah Okley again mentioned that his desire to engage the stakeholders in constant meetings is to restore confidence of their stakeholders and also carve a good image before the Bulk Oil Distribution Companies as they remain key industry players . <p> " The BDCs are our main clients and key stakeholders we offer our services to them . Before I took office , there was a whole lot tension between BOST and the BDCs . Any issue that come out from BOST into the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can come for all of us to discuss issues so that by so doing we will brand our image , we will have a new image before the BDCs , then they will have confidence in us and clear any tension which existed between us so that they will feel free and if we want to implement something that is not in their interest , they will know that it is to the advantage of the industry at large but not for our selfish gain and that is what we have achieved so far " , he averred . <p> The Managing Director of BOST together with other stakeholders at the meeting discussed overstay products , fees , how they can collaborate as industry , challenges that they are having with the porter , socialization and one system rule , upgrading and lost claim that the BDCs brought to BOST . <p> He added that the meeting with the stakeholders will not be a nine-day wonder as the Tuesday June 25 , 2019 meeting marked the third time , they have met ; reiterating that they have met twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " This meeting is the third time but this is the second time for this year ; so it is every quarter that we have decided to meet to discuss issues regarding the industry and we are not only meeting BDCs , we have been doing one to with the transporters quarterly " , he disclosed . <p> Explaining the one system rule which has been agreed to , Mr. George Mensah Okley said that the one system rule is that we have depots in Tema , Akosombo , Maame Water , Kumasi , Bolga and Buipe . So normally if you want put your product , all the receiving point is at Tema ; when they put their products at APD , before they can take them at Kumasi , the products have to move physically to Kumasi because if you have not move your products there , you can not take them and sell but what the one system rule does is that , it is like the way the banking system work ; if you put your money in a bank at one branch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branch of the bank without physically transferring your money to the branch where you are redrawing the money and that is the one system rule . The moment you put your products at APD , the receiving depot , they can pick them anywhere " . <p> Even though the one system rule is not operational yet , the MD for BOST said system has taken effect as they have all agreed in principle as there is a challenge with the platform which does not give room for the products to be accounted for due to the software design , explaining why the meeting was held to deliberate on it . <p> " We have therefore concluded to have a meeting with the software company to make that space on the platform . We have not started running the one system rule but all the stakeholders have agreed in principle to go by the new system and in our deliberations , we have realized this challenge and so we are going to meet with the software company and NPA " , he said . <p> Interacting with one stakeholder member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name as Emmanuel urged most other government companies to emulate the meeting between BOST and its BDCs stakeholders as it is not a common practice with government companies to involve their stakeholders in decision making . <p> " ... because we have a situation where government companies do n't involve their stakeholders in their discussions . They come up with plans and decisions that are not known to us ; then there will be this back and forth , going back to work on things but in a case where BOST is involving us in their operations now , we have an input into whatever they do . So when issues come up , we accept them because we were part of decision making process and I think the other government agencies should all employ this ; the GRA , NPA and other ones who are also in the line of the petroleum industry , they should involve us the industry players and stakeholders into their decision making , so that whenever they come up with any decision , it will be applauded by all and I think that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry " , he recommended . <p> Talking about BOST Call Centre , Emmanuel explained that the Call Centre will enable stakeholders to have quick response to issues regarding their stock balance as such vital information in past can take 3 months before they know the stock they have at a particular location . <p> " One key thing is that BOST has now created a Call Centre and when we have issues , we can just call the call center and we have people who will give quick response to issues ... for instance , now whenever I want to check my stock balance , somebody will be pick the call and quickly check it for me on online and give me information but formerly , we do n't get such vital information rapidly as sometimes it will take 3 months before you know what stock you have at a particular location and so I will give credit to the new management system in place because this is working perfectly for us now " , he narrated . <p> Disclaimer : Opinions expressed here are those of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepts no responsibility legal or otherwise for their accuracy of content .

@@31270232 <p> To get to the top of the international pecking order , the Three Lions must resist the urge to become a Red Devils-style counter-punching team <p> Too good for the bad teams , too bad for the good teams . That has long been England 's status in the international pecking order . The game on Saturday night against Bulgaria might well be another opportunity for Gareth Southgate 's team to rack up five or more goals but , in reality , it will do very little to prepare them for the bigger challenges coming down the line . <p> England over the past two or three years have not been the kind of team to slip up . They win , and win handsomely , against teams they are expected to beat , especially at home . At Wembley back in the spring they had far too much for the Czech Republic with Raheem Sterling scoring a hat-trick in a 5-0 win . A few days later they went to Podgorica and took Montenegro apart . <p> Bulgaria have played a match against each of those two countries in this phase of Euro 2020 qualification and won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winless matches against Kosovo , including a home defeat in June .

They can of course play a certain way against the Bulgarias , the Montenegros and the Czech Republics of this world but it 's another thing altogether when the bigger teams have to be faced . It 's there that England revert to type , struggle to retain the ball and struggle too to eradicate the individual errors that blighted their UEFA Nations League semi-final against The Netherlands in Guimaraes . <p> There is now a prevalent football identity across the England national teams -- from youths to seniors -- and it 's implemented to good effect most of the time .

The ball comes back time and again until such an occasion that England concede cheaply or else are otherwise undone . <p> When push comes to shove England ca n't dominate the ball against the likes of Croatia and The Netherlands .

With Sterling and Rashford , not to mention Jadon Sancho , they are well equipped for counter-attack football . United 's opening-day defeat of Chelsea at Old Trafford was earned in similar circumstances . The difference is that the smaller teams are quite happy to give the ball to United in the knowledge that they wo n't do anything with it . England on the other hand will cut you to ribbons . <p> But they are going to have to learn if these bigger challenges are going to be surmounted .

For now , they should enjoy fixtures like the one upcoming . It 's a chance to boost confidence and to score goals . This group wo n't trouble England at all , but they will need to already have one eye on the finals next summer when tougher challenges are in store .

I am not sure I should mention her name , so , let 's say she was a First Lady in an African country . A week after the inauguration ceremony at which she became First Lady , she went to her village to have a meeting with the group of women she had been helping for much of her life . <p> To cut a long story short , when she got to the meeting , she was surprised to find that her friends had levied themselves and put together an amount that was the equivalent of $2,000 ( two thousand US dollars ) , and was mortified when they told her why they had done this . <p> The women said they had seen her on television at the inauguration ceremony , and were horrified to see that she had not dressed as grandly as they had expected . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give her some money to forcibly and indelibly drive the point home to her that she should now dress grandly to suit her new status . That is one side of the story . <p> It appears members of the public want and expect their public officials to " look the part " . <p> I was once accosted at a funeral by a group of very concerned friends who asked me if I was aware that I had now worn the same black cloth three times to funerals . I am told the phenomenon is called " TAMKLO " , which translates loosely as " one cloth " . I am notorious for carrying the same handbag until it starts to fall apart . I tend to forget to change my earrings very much to the chagrin of my friends . <p> The story about my friend the First Lady is repeated in differing forms . Another friend of mine was called to a family meeting six months into her appointment as a Minister of State and presented with a suitcase of six-yard pieces of cloth and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clothes she had been wearing . <p> I discover that the women who appear on television are scrutinised minutely for what they wear and it is noted and commented upon when they " repeat " . <p> The second part of the story is the expectations we have of , and the demands we make on people in public office . <p> Once you are a public officer , especially if you have a political position , you are expected to have money and lots of it . I refer to Members of Parliament , and all the people that go under the generic name of " appointees " . <p> You are asked to " make show " for anyone you meet . You are asked to give money to pay medical bills , school bills , to buy food , drinks , clothes or simply because it is Friday and people must have money in their pockets . <p> If you are some such public official , you are not allowed to say you do not have money .

If you are a public official , the donations you make at funerals , weddings , outdoorings and harvests must match a certain expected status . <p> Many of the requests sound genuine and deserving , someone wants money to pay for hostel fees or Academic User Fee or his mother 's eye drops . Someone in Level 300 at Technical University wants GH ? 2,300 to pay bills and she needs a laptop and there is someone who needs ONLY ( her word , not mine ) GH ? 600 to add to her business venture to make it take off and someone needs GH ? 7,200 for rent advance , otherwise he will be out on the streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect these officials to find the money from , unless they steal from their positions ? I wonder if by making these demands on public officials or accepting such largesse from them , we are all tacitly agreeing and encouraging them to indulge in underhand practices . For example , when journalists accept fat envelopes from appointees , where do they think the money comes from ? <p> Then there is the third part of the story , which is related to the first part . If you are a public official and you drive or are driven in a V8 vehicle , it arouses a lot of indignation among the public , it is evidence of profligacy and insensitivity when the rest of the people are suffering . <p> When you show up in a Hyundai i10 , the word soon goes around you have fallen on hard times .

Ltd , one of the companies alleged to have brokered the Al Koot deal for PDS . <p> That the only instances in which Al Koot had purportedly issued demand guarantees involving Donewell and two other companies were fraudulent . These deals were written by Yahaya Al-Nouri with Jo Australia as the broker . <p> Incidentally , the PDS matters , the claims , and counter-claims prompted Al Koot to review @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraudulent activities with Al-Nouri as the central man . <p> The assessment also revealed that Donewell had a number of purported placements with Al Koot through Jo Australia as the broker that was all worthless . <p> These transactions were only related to property insurance and one demand guarantee for the supply of petroleum products and gas in a contract valued at US$25 million in which Al Koot was purportedly offered 14% as the premium . <p> This contract was also invalid because it did not comply with the essentials for a valid guarantee . <p> Government action <p> The government itself has established in its findings from the team 's visit to Doha that there is no valid or enforceable demand guarantee issued by Al Koot in support of the LAA and the BSA to PDS.

@@31356239 <h> Michael Essien 's New Year blog on the Africa Cup of Nations <p> It ? ? ? s the start of another year and I am sure you have made a resolution or two . Mine is to stay fit and healthy throughout the year and I hope you can stick to yours however tempted you may be to ditch it . <p> It ? ? ? s also that time of year when the African Cup of Nations kicks off in earnest and although I can not be there with Ghana due to my injury , my friends Didier Drogba and Salomon Kalou from Chelsea will be representing Ivory Coast . As such I thought it will be good to preview the tournament before it begins in the middle of this month . <p> Many commentators have argued the tournament should be moved to the summer but CAF have resisted moving it for years and this year the tournament will be co-hosted by Gabon and Equatorial Guinea from January 21 to February 12 . It is a straightforward format with four groups of four teams each and the top two in each group will advance to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing teams than the ones that qualified . For the first time in a while Nigeria , Cameroon , South Africa and Egypt all failed to qualify . They have been replaced by surprise entrants like Libya , Niger &amp; Botswana . I am not for one saying these teams are not good enough , it ? ? ? s just that we are not used to seeing them at major tournaments . <p> Without some of these ? ? ? big teams ? ? ? will the tournament be as good as it has been in the past ? <p> I definitely think so because there are still some good football nations left fighting for the top prize . The favourites will no doubt be Ivory Coast and Ghana , in my opinion , and possibly the surprise packages will be Mali or Senegal . <p> Ivory Coast probably have the best squad at the tournament and they don ? ? ? t need any introduction . They have some of the top players in African football and will be a match for any team . The spine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers , Didier Zokora and Kalou . And let ? ? ? s not forget Gervinho who is doing very well at Arsenal and will be a handful for any defence . <p> They always look strong on paper and although they have not won a tournament for a while and in actual fact haven ? ? ? t made the final in any recent tournament , it is difficult to see past them . If they can get their squad to click and play as they do in the various European Leagues for their clubs , then I can see them at least making the final . <p> Then there is my beloved Ghana who were runners up two years ago and I have no doubt will be up there again this year . I can see us playing Ivory Coast in the final if our paths do not cross earlier . Unfortunately I am unable to be there and as a matter of fact the team were at the last African Cup and World Cup without me so there is nothing new there . <p> The Ghanaian team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players and that is a very good combination for this year ? ? ? s African Cup . There is captain John Mensah , Asamoah Gyan , Andre Ayew and Sulley Muntari among many other players . <p> This team knows how to play at tournaments and nearly made the semi-final at the last World Cup . They are a proper unit and play for the nation and that ? ? ? s why I fancy them to make the final and probably win it . <p> My outside bets Mali and Senegal both have experienced players who play at the highest level round the world and have also played at major tournaments . Senegalese will tell you about their World Cup win against France , albeit almost 10 years ago , and they still have the spine of that team and will always give anyone a good game . <p> Mali ? ? ? s Seydou Keita and his team are winners who will always fight to the end .

This will ensure the tournament does not clash with the World Cup which takes place in even years . The 2013 competition will be held in South Africa . <p> Let me know your predictions and for now sit back and enjoy the 2012 African Cup of Nations ! <p> Do you have information you want to share with Ghanasoccernet ?

@@31493237 <h> The wild story of a footballer who scammed four teams in a year <p> Dutch winger Bernio Verhagen signed with four clubs in four countries , without playing a single game . <p> Earlier this year , 25-year-old Bernio Jordan Enzo Verhagen made a surprising move for a Dutch amateur football player . He hopped on a plane to play for a club called FC Dinamo-Auto in Transnistria , a Moldovan breakaway state that declared its independence in 1990 . <p> FC Dinamo-Auto is basically an amateur club , without its own stadium . Verhagen stayed with them for only a short time and never made his debut in the first 11 . He soon returned to the Netherlands , where I caught up with him on my Dutch podcast to ask him about his time in Transnistria . After the podcast episode was released , I received a few concerned messages from listeners warning me that Verhagen was involved in credit card fraud . <p> When I asked him about the allegations , he said they were " just haters " and asked me to give him their names . I did n't , but something did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his career which , to my surprise , took him to South Africa , Chile and Denmark by the end of the year . <p> When I saw on Twitter that Cape Town City FC had announced Verhagen as one of their new players , I was surprised . Verhagen had n't played a single game in Transnistria , and Cape Town City FC is a legit club in South Africa . But things got even weirder when Verhagen left Cape Town City after only one month , again without playing a single game , only to pop up again at Audax Italiano , a club in Chile 's Premier League . A few months later , Verhagen was gone -- after playing zero games . <p> The next time I heard about him was on the 5th of November . Danish Viborg FF , a first division club that won the Danish cup in 2000 , posted a statement on their website saying they had signed Verhagen . He got jersey number 28 . <p> Right before Viborg FF officially introduced him as one of its players , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skype . Verhagen said he had left Chile with his Chilean girlfriend , Nayaret Muci , who was also on the call to help translate . <p> According to La Tercera , right before the interview , Muci had posted a few stories on her Instagram account accusing Verhagen of holding her captive in Denmark , of beating her and spitting on her . Muci brought the subject up before being asked by the reporter , saying that it was hard " to live with a person who does n't let you out of the hotel " , but that everything was " fine " now . Later in the interview , Verhagen said he left Audax Italiano because his fellow players were racist and called him an " ape " and " slave " . He would n't say which agent brought him to the team . <p> It 's a deeply strange and concerning interview that raises more questions than it answers . Who currently represents Verhagen ? Why does he keep leaving teams and getting signed across the world if he 's not playing ? Should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached out to him again and asked him about his agent on WhatsApp . " I 'd like you to stop bothering me , " he replied . <p> When contacted , the Dutch national soccer federation ( KNVB ) said Verhagen was a youth player at Willem II , a first-division Dutch club , for one year in 2009 . Since then , he had been registered at three other Dutch amateur clubs . Even though KNVB is supposed to know when a Dutch player is transferred to an international club for the first time , there 's no record of him ever going abroad . <p> According to the most recent KNVB-records , Verhagen was registered at the Dutch club Den Dungen until this year . I called their scout Marcel van Krieken , who said Verhagen played about four games and " did n't really stand out " . He also noted he was very pleasant to be around , but he did n't understand why professional clubs kept signing him . <p> FC Dinamo-Auto in Transnistria did n't respond when contacted , but the message proudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since been deleted . <p> Cape Town City FC 's spokesperson Julian Bailey said Verhagen came to them " through an agent who has a strong link with the club " , but told me he did n't know the agent 's name . He said that before Verhagen arrived , they saw a video of him playing . " The head of the club liked what he saw , so we offered him a contract . " But when Verhagen got to Cape Town City FC , he was n't in shape and had to train by himself . " We did n't get a chance to see if he 'd get to the level we had seen in the video , " said the club . " But his attitude was great . " <p> According to Cape Town City FC , Verhagen soon left because he wanted to return to Europe . But next he went to Audax Italiano in Chile . Lorenzo Antillo , the head of Audax , dodged questions , saying : " I 'd rather not discuss this topic . I have got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Meanwhile in Denmark , a few remarkable stories start popping up . Football news site Bold spoke to Verhagen , who told them he had been on trial at the clubs N ? stved and Randers in the past . Bold fact-checked his statements with both clubs and they claimed they had no idea who Verhagen was . It also turned out that Verhagen was training by himself in Denmark , just like in Cape Town . <p> Next , Danish newspaper Politiken revealed that Verhagen had previously pretended to be an FC Kopenhagen player in Denmark , supposedly in order to seduce a woman before stealing money and jewellery . In response to the revelation , Viborg FF released a lengthy statement , claiming they believed they had signed Verhagen via Stellar Group , a huge agency representing big names like Gareth Bale . <p> In reality , the club hired him based on fraudulent emails , documents and phone calls from one or multiple people pretending to work for Stellar Group . One of club 's directors said he communicated almost daily with a man claiming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually sell Verhagen to a Chinese club that had expressed interest . Of course , the letters sent from the Chinese club also turned out to be completely fake . <p> It was only when Verhagen arrived at Viborg FF that they realised they had been scammed . On closer inspection , the emails from Stellar Group came from an account ending in " . co " instead of " . co.uk " . Viborg FF is currently collaborating with the real Stellar Group to hand the case over to the Danish police . <p> On the 26th of November , Viborg FF announced it had terminated his contract . One day later , Verhagen was arrested in Denmark on suspicion of assaulting and robbing multiple people , including Nayaret Muci , and was charged with fraud on December 3rd . It seems the unlikely success story of a player who never spent a minute on the field has come to an end .

The term is of British origin , and the Oxford English Dictionary traces its earliest print attribution to 1833 , four years before Charles Dickens referred to it in " The Pickwick Papers . " <p> The exact roots of the holiday name are unknown , but there are two leading theories , both of which are connected to charity traditionally distributed to lower classes on the day after Christmas . <p> One idea is that December 26 was the day centuries ago when lords of the manor and aristocrats typically distributed " Christmas boxes " often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner to their household servants and employees , who were required to work on December 25 , in recognition of good service throughout the year . These boxes were , in essence , holiday bonuses . <p> Another popular theory is that the Boxing Day moniker arose from the alms boxes that were placed in churches during the Advent season for the collection of monetary donations from parishioners . Clergy members distributed the contents of the boxes to the poor on December 26 , which is also the feast of St. Stephen , the first Christian martyr and a figure known for acts of charity . ( Ireland celebrates December 26 as St. Stephen 's Day . ) <p> Although the practice of almsgiving on December 26 has faded with charity now being given in the weeks leading up to Christmas , the Boxing Day name has endured . These days , December 26 is a popular holiday in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth countries for watching sports such as soccer and cricket , shopping and visiting friends .

This undermines the elective principle so the Speaker must be elected as well . <p> " The Speaker should be one of the elected MPs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that he plays that role as a fair referee . I think the late Ala Adjatey tried to do that to the best of his ability . A future Speaker must first be elected as an MP and then later voted for to become the Speaker , " Dr. Theophilus Richardson .
