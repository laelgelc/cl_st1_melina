@@1829236 <h> 2015 : Customs boss , minister , others battle for Shema 's seat <p> JAMES DANJUMA writes on the probable successors of the incumbent governor of Katsina State , Ibrahim Shema , as the race towards 2015 begins to take shape . <p> The governorship seat of any state of the federation is one public office many political bigwigs often aspire to occupy . Despite that the 2015 poll is some two years away , several political bigwigs across the country have nonetheless begun overt and covert moves to ensure they contest in the next governorship election . <p> Such quests for the governorship seats are common in states that have incumbents that are in their second term , which create opportunity for prospective candidates to vie for the position . With Katsina being one of such states , it comes as no surprise that some of the bigwigs interested in the governorship position have begun personal and collective moves to actualise their political goal . Not so appealing however is that most of those said to be eyeing the seat are showing more of a clandestine than an open interest . <p> This , according to political observers , may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the emergence of the incumbent state governor in 2007 . Around the time of the 2007 election , the late President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua , then governor had supported the emergence of two people that would possibly contest for the seat on the platform of the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) . Yar'Adua was said to have tacitly endorsed former Speaker of the House of Representatives , Aminu Bello Masari , and later , Abdullahi Garba Aminchi ; other contenders for the seat were Ambassador Magaji Moh 'd and Tukur Jikamshi . <p> But the PDP at the state and national levels was said to have thought it wise to back another candidate , which led to a lastminute decision to field the incumbent to contest for the seat . The uncertainty as to who the PDP might support to contest the governorship seat during the next general elections , is said to have made interested candidates to lie low for now till they get some sort of green light to openly declare their interest . <p> Secondly , the only person to have publicly declared interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is also known as Tata , had severally become a target of attacks by thugs and others interested in the position . Not wanting to be at the receiving end of attacks , prospective aspirants are said to have opted for latent show of interest for the seat with underground moves however ongoing . <p> Notwithstanding , there are several bigwigs in the state that have had groups , their community areas or supporters called upon them to come out and contest the forthcoming gubernatorial election . Within the PDP , those said to be nursing governorship ambition include the Deputy Governor , Abdullahi Faskari ; Senator Ibrahim Ida ; Musa Sada , who is the current Minister of Mines and Steel , and the Comptroller- General of Customs , Dikko Inde . Others are the current Commissioner for Agriculture , Musa Adamu ; Nura Khalil ; and former Executive Secretary of the Petroleum Technology Development Fund ( PTDF ) , Muttaqa Darma . <p> Faskari <p> Faskari is from Katsina South Senatorial zone and hails from Faskari local government area . He was Education and Justice Commissioner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his incumbency as the deputy governor and the cordial relationship he has with his boss . <p> He also has a strong support base with the zone he comes from , having a strong voting strength . However , being from the southern part of the state may work against him as past and present governors have come from the northern part . The PDP may decide to support another person instead as choice candidate for the position . <p> Ida <p> The former senator has political experience to his advantage , and his closeness to the PDP national chairman , Bamaga Tukur , as his chief of staff , could work to his advantage . He is from Katsina council area , in Katsina Senatorial zone and has the wherewithal to contest in a governorship election ; he also has a strong support base with his zone a strong determinant on who gets to win elections due to population strength . <p> Ida was reported to have accepted the appointment in the ruling party 's headquarters so that he can get the ticket for the seat through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however come from political intrigues that often accompany primary elections within the PDP , as also found in many political parties in the country . <p> Sada <p> He has his ministerial position to his advantage , and could use same to win the hearts of the Abuja-based politicians of the state . An engineer , he has previous experience as Commissioner for Works and Housing to his advantage . He is from Mani council area , from Katsina North Senatorial zone where voting strength is often utilised to shift election votes to candidates ' advantage . <p> The setback to his ambition is his low support base , as he is not much of a household name within political circles in the state . It remains to be seen if he has the wherewithal to run for a gubernatorial contest . <p> There are speculations that the incumbent governor may have earlier supported him for the 2015 race , but that their political relationship had cracked somewhat due to Sada 's fraternisation with Vice- President Namadi Sambo 's camp . Governor Shema is nursing a presidential ambition , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vice president for the same post . <p> Dikko <p> The Customs boss has the influence , support base and charisma to contest in a gubernatorial election ; he is a blue blood with an advantage of his primary constituency -- the traditional institution . His influence within the rank and file of the Nigerian Customs Service ( NCS ) is also a plus for him , and being from Katsina Central Senatorial zone , where population strength is a factor , could work to his advantage . A setback for him could be his inexperience in politics and whether he would be accepted by the ruling party to contest the governorship election . <p> Tsauri , Adamu , Khalil and Darma <p> Tsauri has the charisma , strong support base and has been the only man to have come out publicly to indicate interest in the governorship ; this is despite being faced with stiff resistance from some quarters . He comes from Katsina Central senatorial zone , and is from Dutsinma , the same council area with the incumbent state governor . Major challenge to his ambition is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who see his ambition as a threat to theirs or someone else 's they represent . <p> Adamu has advantage of experience , as a former lawmaker and commissioner . He has strong support base , and hails from the southern part of the state , Katsina South Senatorial zone , that has been agitating to be given the chance to also govern the state . Where he hails from could however work against him as only deputy governors have been produced from the area since 1999 . <p> Khalil , who is from Bakori council area in Katsina South Senatorial zone , has contested for the governorship seat on at least two occasions , and he is seen to be a popular person with a strong support base , but like Senator Ida , he would have to face the intrigues of a primary election . <p> His being seldom seen in the state and prolonged political silence until election time could work against him . Darma , from Katsina Central senatorial zone , has a strong support base , and has past experience , as a former commissioner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge could come from the PDP accepting him as a candidate . <p> Opposition candidates <p> For the opposition parties , majority of those nursing governorship ambition are former Speaker of the House of Representatives , Masari of the Congress for Progressive Change ( CPC ) ; Usman Bugaje of the Action Congress of Nigeria ( ACN ) , and Senators Sadiq Yar'Adua and Kanti Bello . Others are Senator Abu Ibrahim ; former Secretary to the State Government ( SSG ) , Mustapha Inuwa ; Mannir Yakubu , who is a popular politician and Abba Sayyadi Ruma , who was late Yar'Adua 's Agriculture Minister and Abdullahi Yar'Adua . Masari had contested for the same position in 2011 and his supporters are already telling whoever cared to know that he would contest in the next general election . <p> His been former Speaker of House of Representatives could work to his advantage , along with the support of most of the current members of the National Assembly members from the state who are from his party . Any major challenge would have to come from the strength which PDP @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since 1999 . <p> Bugaje , who is from Jibia council are under Katsina Central , has the intellectual capacity , support base and charisma to contest for the election , though he had contested on two or more occasions without coming out successful . Senator Yar'Adua is the current senator representing Katsina Senatorial District . Though he has served under a previous government as its spokesperson , it is unclear if he had held a public office before . <p> Senator Bello , from Katsina North , was formerly with the PDP , before moving to the All Nigeria People 's Party ( ANPP ) ; he recently pitched his camp with the CPC to support General Muhammadu Buhari whom he had been together with in the ANPP . Senator Ibrahim , who is currently representing Katsina South , had contested for the governorship election on two occasions on the platform of the ANPP , but did not come out successful . Several of his supporters said that he plans to contest for the governorship seat come 2015 , and that his strong support base and political experience would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SSG under late Yar'Adua 's administration as governor . He moved to the CPC and has been gradually gaining popularity , which prompted some of his supporters to call on him to contest . He hails from Danmusa council area under Katsina Senatorial zone . Yakubu had the opportunity to contest in the last gubernatorial election , but internal party intrigues within the CPC kept him from realising his ambition . He is from Faskari council area , also form Katsina central senatorial zone . Whether Ruma would contest in the next general election is something that sceptics have been pessimistic about , but his supporters are confident that he is interested in the state governorship seat . <p> They say he could contest on the platform of the PDP or another political party , depending of course on which would give him the necessary support . Yar'Adua , also known as Audu Soja , is younger brother to the late President Yar'Adua . He recently forayed into politics after Yar'Adua 's death , and had been with the opposition . He was said to have nursed the ambition of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing so by highly placed individuals in the PDP . As noted earlier , these possible contenders would have to face the formidable influence which the ruling party wields in the state 's political scene . <p> What could work in their favour is the formal launch and smooth operation of the proposed mega opposition party , the All Progressive Congress ( APC ) ; but this is , however , subject to conjecture . Political observers however say these prospective candidates are in no way exhaustive , as there are others whose names are not mentioned that may yet come forward to announce their interest in the race

@@1834232 <h> Who Told Aregbesola to Open His Pocket ? <p> Wonders will never end in this Nigeria . I am sure you have heard the latest story , more evidence of the very high disparity between crime and punishment in Nigeria . Two days ago , a High Court judge in The State of Osun sentenced 31 year-old ex-convict Kelvin Igha Igbodalo to a total 45 years in jail for stealing a telephone handset belonging to Governor Rauf Aregbesola . Even though the many sentences are to run concurrently , the young man will spend a minimum of 10 years in jail . Actually , he only recently came out of the Ikoyi Prison , having done a 6 year time there on a murder rap . <p> I know that telephone handsets are being stolen everyday in Nigeria these days . Anyone who forgets his phone in a public place for a few minutes , including in mosques and churches , will have it spirited away by a modern-day Good Samaritan who must " liberate it from redundancy , " as university students used to say in the olden days . There are a lot of clever young men these days who wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can find , be it a market , a mosque , a church or the venue of a seminar in order to liberate other people 's telephones from redundancy . Therefore , anybody who goes to such places must have both hands in his pockets to closely guard his phones . <p> Which brings me to the case of Governor Rauf Aregbesola . The theft was said to have occurred at the Osun State Technical College Sports Ground in Osogbo on November 24 , 2010 , the day Aregbesola was sworn in as governor after the Court of Appeal took the juicy seat away from PDP 's Prince Olagunsoye Oyinlola and awarded it to him . Aregbesola knew that thousands of people will be there at the Sports Ground to watch the historic ceremony . He knew that , yet he went there with his pockets wide open ? He was probably wearing a traditional Yoruba sokoto with its wide side pockets , completely unguarded , as if he was going to a sedate meeting of community elders . So it was easy for Igbodalo to dip his hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Whose fault was that ? Who told Aregbesola to leave his pockets wide open because he was jubilant and carried away by his court victory aided by Salami , according to PDP partisans . <p> Even the people that convict Igbodalo was said to have duped using the stolen phone , what was his fault there ? The prosecutors said that he used the stolen phone to dupe the Owa-Obokun of Ijeshaland , His Royal Majesty Oba Gabriel Adekunle Aromolaran of N500,000 which " he obtained under false pretence . " Which false pretence ? Are you saying His Majesty hurriedly parted with half a million because he received a text message emanating from the new governor 's phone number ? Did His Majesty stop to ask himself why a man who just inherited a rich state treasury complete with a fat security vote will ask a mere traditional ruler to give him money , a mere half a million naira ? <p> In any case , why did n't this judge take his cue from his colleague Justice Talba of the Federal High Court Abuja who fined pension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of naira ? He jailed Kelvin 45 years for stealing a telephone , for that matter from a man who was too excited to close his pockets . Something does not add up here . <p> Why would the author of this post blame the victim . I understand the unbelief with the sentencing but to blame the victim probably because he is the governor is uncalled for . This story must have been written by an opposition loyalist .

@@1834236 <h> I was the first Papa Ajasco -- Peter Fatomilola <p> Peter Fatomilola has been on the movie scene for decades . The veteran actor , who hails from Ifishin in Ido/Osi Local Government Area of Ekiti State , in this interview with DOYIN ADEOYE , speaks on his acting career , his foray into lecturing , and life as a traditionalist . <p> How did you develop the passion for theatre ? Theatre for me started when I was a child . I remember when I was in primary school and we would stage plays during the end of the year parties . Anytime we performed these plays , I loved to play prominent roles , and this continued through my secondary school education . I remember in 1967 , while I was at the Ife City College , I led my group , the ' Ife City Dramatic Society ' , to a competition , which was the Oranmiyan Festival of Arts . We performed a play entitled Oro Ikoko and I played the role of Atitebi . <p> Fortunately , the late Professor Ola Rotimi was the chairman at the occasion and he discovered my talent and decided to help nurture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second week , he was in my school . He nurtured me into professional theatrics . <p> What was the first major role you played as a thespian ? I ca n't really cite the first major role I played , but the first major role that thrilled me was my role as Lawuwo in Rere Run . I acted as a labour leader , who fought the government on behalf of the masses . It was written by Dejo Okewumi and directed by Ola Rotimi . People really loved it , and for a while , I got stuck with the name Lawuwo . But I had to drop it because I do n't like taking on nicknames . My name is Peter Fatomilola . <p> You were a part of Obafemi Awolowo University 's Theatre Department for 37 years . How was the experience ? Initially , I started as an actor when I got to the then University of Ife , before I was later admitted into the school to acquire more knowledge in drama . I started off as a member of the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ori Olokun Players . It was later changed to the University of Ife Theatre in 1973 . And during the 1977/1978 session , the Department of Dramatic Arts was established . <p> But prior to that , University of Ife never had a drama department . Our activities as Ori Olokun Players and University of Ife Theatre made the university authorities decide to come up with a department that would centre on dramatic arts . So , we were the first set of students at the school before we were retained as instructors , to take the students in the practical aspects of theatre . I retired as a principal actor at the institution . I 've been retired now for almost seven years . <p> What are your memorable moments as a thespian ? There are quite some memories , but the one that often comes to mind was a time when we were set to travel abroad for a performance . My name was , however , not shortlisted with those that would make the trip , despite having participated in the rehearsals . Fortunately , Professor Wole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list , he included my name immediately when he realised my name was n't included . That was how I joined the troupe for the performance in New York City . I was so happy that day that I spent the evening with my colleagues at the Kegites ' Shrine , where I spent all the money I had on me in buying palm wine for myself and my friends . Another memorable moment that thrills me was the day I was called to play the role of Papa Ajasco in 1983 . <p> Judging by the roles you play nowadays , no one could imagine you once played comical roles ? Yes , I once did ; and of all the people that have played the role of Papa Ajasco ever since the inception of the series , no one has reached the standard I set . I was really good at it and people really loved how I interpreted the role . <p> You hardly play comical roles in movies nowadays ? That is because many people do n't see that in me . They only see me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a herbalist and I used to study with him as a child . By the time I was nine years old , I could interpret the Odu Ifa for anyone . I am a practising herbalist today , but only people that know me from way back know that I can play comical roles . I am a flexible actor . I was trained to play any role , but the problem is once you are made a soft character , such as a comedian , you tend to lose other roles . <p> What is your religion ? I do n't have a religion . I am a man of no religion , because God himself has no religion . The word ' religion ' is a creation of man . If you call God in the name of Orunmila , Jesus Christ , Moses , Muhammed , Buddha , Hindu and the likes , He will answer you . But I practise the three prominent religions among the Yoruba , which are Ifa , Christianity and Islam . By practice , I do n't mean that I visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child and I studied the Bible when I was in school . This gave me a platform to compare the Bible with the Ifa , and I discovered that both are preaching the same thing . So , this prompted me to probe Islam , which I did and I discovered that Islam is also preaching the same message . The stories of the creation of these three religions are interwoven ; the only difference is the language and the practice . God has no religion , and I do n't either . I have the Bible , Quran and the Ifa . Ifa , to me , is a sacred knowledge . <p> You own the Olumodu Cultural Studio . What is it about ? The Olumodu Cultural Studio is a study centre where people come to study Ifa , theatre , as well as other cultural heritages . The studio entails Yoruba oral literature and the study of traditional medicine in Yoruba land . I teach people that , because it is what I know . At age 15 , I was already a practising herbalist , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other herbalists in Ife . I have the certificate of the Agboniregun . <p> Who are the professional actors that have passed through your tutelage ? There are many of them that have grown into big actors and actresses today . <p> How did you come about being the Osi Amuludun of Ife and what are your responsibilities ? I remember I was just in my house that day when I was summoned by the king that I would be given the chieftaincy title , as the Osi Amuludun . For someone like me to be named a chief in another man 's land was really surprising . <p> Although , prior to that , I had been made the Chief Saloro of Ifishin-Ekiti , which is equivalent to a Balogun . So , the title made me feel really appreciated . I remember at the king 's coronation in 1980 , after my performance , the king called me and prayed for me . I never knew the journey was still far ahead . After the coronation 33 years ago , I visit the palace once every year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2012 and my duty is to see to the peace of the city . <p> It was reported that you were seriously ill early this year . Is that true ? It is true . It started around mid-December through January . I woke up one day and I discovered I could n't talk ; I could n't move my right arm and leg . I could hear people talk , but I could n't answer . My memory was pale , my body had failed and it was really torturing . But I called on God and He came to my rescue . Having prayed to him and using the natural herbs and the modern day medicine I was given , my health was restored . <p> Do you think travelling theatre can still be revived ? I think it can still be revived , but the truth is that it is very costly . The cost of transporting actors is very alarming . Feeding and accommodation expenses can also be difficult to sustain , unlike the present home video which is cheaper . So , I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government and other philanthropists , who could invest into theatre as it is done in the sporting world . <p> Travelling theatre is entertaining . I remember on December 6 , 1980 , I was the one who organised a play at the coronation of Oba Sijuwade . The play was entitled : Orirun . Also at the first Ife Day , I presented a play to Ife people , entitled : Ajo ko da bi ile . If the stage industry can be financed , I think it can be revived . <p> Tell us about your early years . As a child , I used to follow my father to the farm . I had many siblings , but I am my mother 's only child and , thanks to God , she is still alive . So , my parents trained me both through my primary and secondary modern school education . From there , I shouldered my education up until the university level . I 've been living in Ife for over 40 years . <p> What about your school days ? I attended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ilesa , before I proceeded to the Apostolic Secondary Modern School , Oke Oho , Ifaki , Ilesa . We could n't finish at Ilesa due to the riot that broke out during the Operation wet e in 1965 . So , I attended the Ife City College in 1967 for my secondary school education , and since then , I have been in Ife . <p> Would you say your career has been fulfilling ? To some extent , I would say it is . No matter what one does , contentment matters and I have that . The reaction I get from people is satisfying . <p> Are any of your children taking after you , both in theatre and the Ifa tradition ? All my children are into one form of theatre or the other , and almost all of them know the Ifa tradition too .

@@1835230 <h> Poverty Threshold in Nigeria : Myth or Reality ? <p> NOI Polls Limited , Nigeria 's leading opinion polling and research organisation , recently released a report , which focused on an age-long myth on the country 's threshold of poverty , against the global standard of $1per day . Abimbola Akosile examines the findings <p> The issue is simple . It is not whether there is poverty in Nigeria or not . And it is not whether majority of the country 's 160 million citizens are poor or not . Enough statistics have shown that already . <p> The question here is how relative poverty is among the citizens , with focus on the amount spent on food daily , in comparison with the global standard or threshold of $1 or N160 a day . It is easy for a self-styled ' poor ' man in Nigeria to spend up to and even more than N300 on a meal in a day , and to eat two of such meals in 24 hours . It is equally easy , according to analysts , for a poor man to eat a meal of less than N150 just once in a day . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject , or in this case , the citizen . <p> Global Poverty Line The dollar-a-day poverty threshold is considered to be one of the globally recognised measures of poverty . According to analysts , the dollar-a-day threshold was a common international poverty line developed by economists in the late 1980s . <p> A group of economists at the World Bank in Washington DC noticed that a number of developing countries drew their poverty lines at an income of about $370 a year , which reflected the basic amount that a person needed to live . <p> Each country had a different sense of what the essentials were , but the figure of roughly $370 was common to all , so the World Bank team proposed it as a global poverty line . If one divides that $370 by 365 days , it comes to just over $1 ; so the catchy " $1-a-day " concept was born . However , over the years , the dollar-a-day poverty threshold has been criticised both locally and internationally , with scholars , statisticians and development agencies reconsidering more realistic poverty measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now adopts a standard measure of $1.25 per day . <p> Similarly , in 2012 the African Development Bank ( AfDB ) adopted $2 per day as the poverty line for the continent , and found that 34 per cent of the population above it . According to the National Bureau of Statistics ( NBS ) about 61 per cent of Nigerians live on less than $1 a day . Over the years , this figure has elicited comments and debates from scholars and analysts calling for a review of this threshold to reflect a more realistic poverty line . <p> Tackling the Myth NOI Polls Limited , Nigeria 's leading opinion polling and research organisation , recently released a report , which focused on the country 's threshold of poverty . The organisation works in technical partnership with the Gallup Organisation ( USA ) , to conduct periodic opinion polls and studies on various socio-economic and political issues in Nigeria . <p> According to its executive summary , NOI Polls has conducted its recent polls to estimate what Nigerians spend daily on feeding . Key findings from the poll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least once a day , only about 2 in 10 Nigerians ( 19 per cent ) were found spending below N160 ( $1 ) for their meals in a day , with 80 per cent spending above the threshold . Furthermore , on the assumption that people eat at least three times a day , the results indicate that less than 1 per cent of Nigerians were found to spend below N160 daily . <p> In summary , given that these current figures only focus on daily food estimates , and not shelter , clothing or transportation , NOI submitted that a lot more Nigerians live above $1 ; and called for further investigation and , perhaps , a review of the dollar-a-day poverty threshold . <p> Background In February 2012 , the NBS released its report titled ' Nigeria Poverty Profile 2010 ' , which stated that about 61.2 per cent of the population - more than 100 million Nigerians - were living on less than $1 a day at the end of 2010 . <p> This figure represents almost a 10 per cent increase from 51.6 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This statistic suggests that the majority of Nigerians live in poverty and , as a result , can barely afford the basic necessities of life such as food , shelter and clothing . Although there are several approaches to measuring poverty such as the relative , absolute and subjective poverty measures , as well as the income inequality and consumption expenditure measures , the dollar-a-day poverty threshold has been considered one of the globally recognised measures for poverty , NOI noted . <p> In Nigeria , the $1-a-day measure continues to be questioned as analysts argue that the proponents of the dollar-a-day statistic did not actually convert $1 to Naira to determine what could be bought by an average Nigerian . <p> A detailed analysis provided by Enhancing Financial Innovation and Access ( EFInA ) , a donor-funded organisation , estimated Nigeria 's adult population at 87.9 million . It further divided this total between four million adults earning above N70,000 ( $440 ) monthly , 38 million adults earning between N18,000 and N70,000 , and the balance 45.9 million adults ( 52 per cent ) earning below the national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debate in Nigeria regarding the reality of the dollar-a-day statistic . Opinion leaders , according to the NOI report , have questioned the finding by NBS that the majority of Nigerians ( 61 per cent ) live below the poverty line . Specifically , analysts have been asking : Is it true that most Nigerians live on approximately N160 ( $1 ) a day , given inflationary trends and the rising cost of basic essentials such as food , shelter , clothing and even transport . <p> Fact-finding Poll Against this background , NOI Polls conducted this latest poll to examine the assertion that most Nigerians live on less than $1 a day . An additional objective of this poll is to validate the suitability of the dollar-a-day statistic as a measure of poverty in Nigeria . <p> In conducting this study , NOI Polls adopted an expenditure approach to estimating the cost of one of the basic necessities of life . Food , clothing and shelter are considered basic necessities , and we decided to estimate the daily cost of food . <p> The decision to poll on food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Also , the organisation expressed belief that every Nigerian eats food to survive and will be able to easily relate with " food " , and unlike shelter and clothing that may elicit relative responses . In furtherance , the poll involved telephone interviews of a random nationwide sample and was conducted from March 18 to 19 , 2013 . A total of 1,002 randomly selected phone-owning Nigerians , aged 18 years and above , and representing the six geopolitical zones in the country , were interviewed . <p> " With a sample of this size , we can say with 95 per cent confidence that the results obtained are statistically precise - within a range of plus or minus 4 per cent . The questionnaire was designed in English and the poll was conducted in English , Hausa , Yoruba , Ibo , and Pidgin , to ensure coverage of relevant geographical and demographic groups " , NOI Polls explained . <p> Results &amp; Findings Respondents to the poll were asked people three specific questions . The first question sought to establish what Nigerians eat for breakfast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 42 per cent ) eat bread for breakfast , followed by those who eat rice , spaghetti or noodles ( 22 per cent ) . Ball foods ( such as Eba , Fufu , Semovita and Amala ) were mainly consumed for lunch ( 50 per cent ) and Dinner ( 48 per cent ) . Similarly , the Rice , Spaghetti and Noodles food category was the second most popular option for both lunch ( 35 per cent ) and dinner ( 34 per cent ) . <p> Next , in order to ascertain where Nigerians eat their meals , respondents were asked and the results showed that for the majority of respondents ( 76 per cent ) breakfast is mainly either eaten at home or taken from home to be consumed elsewhere . <p> This also applied to lunch ( 36 per cent ) though the proportion refers more to those who take food from home to consume at work or elsewhere . Once again , the results showed that majority of Nigerians ( 87 per cent ) eat dinner at their homes . <p> Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily meals , respondents were asked how much they spend daily on breakfast , lunch and dinner , and were encouraged to estimate for only themselves even when they eat communally . <p> The results , according to NOI , showed that for breakfast the slight majority ( 29 per cent ) spend between N160 to N239 ( an average of N200 ) , closely followed by 27 per cent that spend between N80 to N159 ( an average of N120 ) . Also , most Nigerians spend more on lunch and dinner , than on their breakfast . The majority spend between N240 and N319 ( an average of N 280 ) ; lunch ( 33 per cent ) and dinner ( 39 per cent ) . <p> Breaking it Down Taking a look at the figures for each meal independently , the results showed that , for breakfast , lunch and dinner only 30 per cent , 14 per cent and 13 per cent of respondents , respectively , feed on less than $1 . Therefore , based on NOI 's initial assumption that people eat at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reveal that only about 19 per cent of Nigerians live on less than $1 a day . <p> Overall , the results showed that the majority ( 24 per cent ) of respondents spend between N634 to N791 ( an average of N713 on feeding daily ) . Again , this clearly shows that almost all of the respondents that participated in the poll spend more than N160 ( the equivalent of S$1 ) on their feeding each day . <p> Surprisingly , the national average of N713 spent on food each day did not present any significant difference on whether respondents live in rural or urban areas . Although , as expected more people living in rural areas spend less on their daily feeding ; and more people in urban areas spend more than the national average on their food . <p> Nationwide , less than 1 per cent of the respondents actually spend below the $1 mark on their feeding daily . Considering that the costs of shelter , clothing and transport have not been added to this analysis it becomes clear the assertion that 61 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questionable , according to NOI . <p> Results indicated that , on the assumption that Nigerians eat at least once a day , only about 2 in 10 Nigerians ( 19 per cent ) live on less than a dollar-a-day ; while about 80 per cent live above the poverty threshold . <p> Furthermore , on the assumption that Nigerians eat at least three times a day , the results indicate that the majority of Nigerians spend an average of N713 ( $4.5 ) on their feeding each day ; and less than 1 per cent of Nigerians actually live on less than $1 a day . <p> Finally , according to NOI , the assertion that 61 per cent of Nigerians live on less than $1 a day is questionable , and calls for further investigation and review of the dollar-a-day poverty threshold . The NOI poll has helped to shed more light on the poverty threshold and scenario in Nigeria , and the findings are relevant for development planning . <p> However , another question is whether Nigeria , which is one of the world 's largest exporters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for such a large of its 160 million citizens living in poverty , relative or absolute or even ' affluent ' poverty .

@@1835237 <h> Clipping the Wings of Private Jet Owners <p> Adeola Akinremi writes that the new aviation policy may be a checkmate on the well-heeled Nigerians , though the authorities claim it 's an attempt to sanitise the industry to bring it to form with international standards <p> These days a private hangar located within the precinct of Nigeria 's Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos has become a hub of aviation activities . At the hangar , private jets land and take off at such frequency that is typical of commercial flights . Yes , corporate jets are still reserved for the well-heeled , even chartering a jet for one flight costs thousands of dollars an hour . But now , there is a twist in the tale . Officials say the number of private jets in the country has steadily increased and seem to be overshadowing commercial flights in numbers . <p> Perhaps a direct response from business travellers to the increased hassle of flying commercially , the General Manager , Corporate Communications , Federal Airports of Nigeria ( FAAN ) , Yakubu Dati thinks otherwise . <p> He says there is illegal operation going on among the private jet owners . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Nigerian Civil Aviation Policy ( NCAP ) unveiled in Abuja last week by the Minister of Aviation , Stella Oduah . <p> Dati says , about 80 per cent of the 150 private jets operating in the country are registered overseas , " which means that they are exempted from paying taxes and five per cent charges to the Nigeria Civil Aviation Authority ( NCAA ) and although they are owned by Nigerians they are still designated as leased so they are brought into the country without paying Customs duty . <p> " So when you collate what government agencies lose by the illegal operations of these aircraft it amounts to over N25 billion in a year . And I can authoritatively tell you that it is now a lucrative business that businessmen bring in aircraft to operate as private jets while they are actually used for commercial purposes , so it makes nonsense of those charter operators who followed the laid down process , whose business has now been taken away by the illegal private operators . " <p> He adds : " These illegal charter operators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would have filled the business class cabin are now airlifted by illegal private charter services . <p> " This explains why our airlines are not growing . Instead of marked growth of our airlines it is the number of private jets that are growing . This is an aberration , so government can not fold its hands and watch this unfavourable situation which has already started affecting the nation 's economy , knowing the crucial role scheduled airline operation play in any country . " <p> Dati is also concerned that most of the money used to buy these aircraft were made locally but taken away from the country to maintain foreign licence , foreign pilots and engineers and foreign maintenance services . <p> So a part of the new aviation policy reads : " For private aircraft owned or leased by individuals , only the family members of the owner/lessee of the aircraft will be permitted on board as passengers . <p> " For private aircraft owned or leased by companies or corporate entities , only the employees and members of the board of directors of the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For aircraft belonging to non-scheduled or scheduled operators , only the employees and members of the board of directors of the company or the corporation may be permitted on board as passengers ; all operators will declare the identities of all passengers on non-revenue charter flights in the appropriate general declaration forms prior to obtaining Air Traffic Control ( ATC ) clearance . " <p> This section of the law is however generating reactions , especially among the private jet owners who feel the policy is injurious to them . <p> For instance , Chairman , Private Flyers Nigeria , Bala Na'allah says the policy would undermine the existing Civil Aviation Act , adding that " Section 33 of the Act does not require an owner of private jet to look for a permit from anywhere as stated in the policy . " <p> Na'allah says : " Since we are having some sections of the policy that are not in agreement with certain parts of the regulation in terms of putting up a defence , which one supersedes the other ? I suggest that the ministry allows us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewed if we must grow this industry . " <p> Also , a private jet owner who would not want his name mentioned says : " Demand for passengers ' manifest will bring bottleneck and it is just like asking the police to mount roadblock where it is not necessary . " <p> He argues that requesting that private jet owners should not carry friends or relations might impinge on freedom of association and in particular frustrate harmonious relationship . <p> " We are studying the policy , but clearly from what we have seen so far there would be infringement of rights to associate and freedom to relate with friends . We are also concerned that there may be need to go around with certificates to proof relationship and whatever since there must be clear identification and I hope someone is not just doing this to satisfy ego , " he says . <p> But the Minister of Aviation , Princess Stella Oduah insists that the new policy is in the best interest of the private jet owners and the country as a whole because the aviation policy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Oduah , many provisions in the last policy review had become obsolete and out of tune with modern realities in the global aviation sector . The new policy , she argues will introduce new and sustainable regulatory regimes into the country 's aviation sector . <p> " The sections of the policy which people are mixing up are related to insurance for passengers on private jets . There is nowhere in the new policy where friends are barred from being on board their friend 's private jet , " she explains <p> She further maintains that there is need for sufficient focus on air safety and passenger insurance as well as a coordination of both . She says : " Any insurance policy that indemnifies private jet owners in the event of an accident or mishap will be adequate . " <p> During the presentation of the policy to the public in Abuja , Oduah notes that " this revised policy captures the new vision and mission , the Aviation Master Plan of the Ministry and more importantly major programme areas like state safety programme ; accident investigation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case of aviation accident ; monitoring and control of General Aviation ; introduction of an effective search and rescue mechanism , and the development of an effective and sustainable Economic Regulatory Framework , among others . " <p> She says the new policy places considerable focus on the efficient airspace management , human capital development , infrastructural development , and the introduction of dedicated policy and regulatory framework in controlling and monitoring of General Aviation operations , especially foreign registered aircraft . The essence of this , according to her is to streamline the operations of non-scheduled flights to conform with International Standards and Recommended Practices ( ICAO SARPs ) and the Nigerian Civil Aviation Regulations . <p> The minister claims that the adoption of the policy would ensure that the General Aviation would now have a dedicated policy , regulatory framework , infrastructure and services to support its operations , unlike in the past when it operated largely in the shadow of commercial airlines . <p> " The policy also captures the validation of foreign crew licence required to certify foreign pilots who will be employed solely to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandatory flying experience . " <p> She believes that the revised National Civil Aviation Policy would , among others , " be responsive and adaptable to the new safety , security and technological dynamics of the global aviation industry ; strengthen the existing regulatory framework ; facilitate the growth of domestic airlines , the setting up of the National Carrier , the development of Aerotropolis ( Airport Cities ) , and support the introduction and sustainability of affordable flights to remote and underserved cities as a Public Service Obligation . " <p> Perhaps the policy will impact negatively on the outlook of the sector and in particular the wealthy Nigerians ' insatiable demand for private jets which currently put the total private jets in the country at 150 with a value worth $3.75 billion , analyst say there is no reversal of the trend , especially with prevalent global security issue . <p> On the average , each jet costs $25 million , which carries both local and international registrations . <p> The total number of private jets in the country has made Nigeria the continent 's largest market of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $65 million ; excluding other associated costs like registration and legal ; remuneration of pilot and crew ; fueling and maintenance ; insurance , landing , parking and overflying . <p> Depending on the jet usage and size , the associated costs can be $250,000 to $1,000,000 per year , according to experts , just as 70 per cent of jet purchases are made with cash according to industry sources . <p> For the policy , Dati who is also the Coordinating Manager of information and communications for aviation parastatals , says : " Nigeria is a signatory to the Chicago convention where some of the statutes were agreed upon and can not act otherwise . " <p> There are strong indications that most private jets in Nigeria carry foreign registration because their owners do not want the ownership traced to them . An industry expert says the Nigerian Civil Aviation Authority , the regulatory agency , which registers all aircraft operating in the country , keeps records and with those records it would be hard to keep any secret by the private jet owners . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because in the process of trying to do so , they will need to reveal who really owns the aircraft and you know , security and other agencies can take advantage of such information to go after them . Many of the aircraft are parked in Accra with foreign registration and they belong to Nigerians . <p> " Let me also add that some of them are registered as private jests but in the face of economic situation they are now being used as commercial jets without obtaining necessary documents to fly commercial including the pilots flying them and that is truly not good for security which may have informed why the aviation authorities respond with the new policy , " he reveals . <p> And as the battle rages it may not be too long before the die is cast over the new policy . <p> Please leave your comment below .

@@1835238 <h> CBN : Planned Scrapping of Polymer Notes Wo n't Attract Extra Cost <p> As the planned reversal of the policy on the use of polymer notes for some naira denominations continues to generate controversy , the Central Bank of Nigeria ( CBN ) has said the switch to paper naira notes for some denominations will not attract any additional cost . <p> The printing of lower denominations of naira notes in polymer -N5 ; N10 ; N20 and N50- was introduced during the Prof. Chukwuma Soludo 's tenure as CBN governor . <p> But the apex bank had last month hinted of plans to scrap the polymer notes because they fade easily , despite earlier experiments , which showed that the notes could last longer than paper notes . Critics of the planned action argued that the policy reversal with its attendant huge capital outlay would constitute a drain on the nation 's economy . <p> Some of the issues thrown up by the CBN 's change of mind included what becomes of the initial investment in the polymer technology , considering that the notes have been in circulation for only six years after their adoption in 2007 . <p> However , CBN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an interview with THISDAY at the weekend , said the switch-over to paper notes would not cost the apex bank additional money . <p> He said contrary to the fears being nursed in some quarters , the planned switch over to paper notes " does not have cost implications since we are not destroying the polymer notes in circulation . <p> " What we have resolved to do is to switch over to paper notes when next we want to print naira notes . " Lemo explained that the decision to revert to the use of paper notes was in response to public outcry in the wake of the erosion of the quality of some of the polymer notes . <p> " This is a hot environment and the prospect of the polymer notes lasting longer with all their features intact was not working as we had thought when the use of polymer notes was adopted . " We later discovered that the environmental impact of the destruction of polymer notes is not good for our environment . We wo n't want to do open air burning , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because the polymer notes , though durable , fade out easily , although the research the apex body conducted showed that the polymer could last more than paper notes . <p> He explained that the substrate ( the plastic ) lasted longer , but the in-cosubstrate ( printing chemical ) had a short life and therefore " with the benefit of hindsight , we probably should not have adopted polymer " . <p> On the modality to be used for the switch-over , the CBN chief explained that when the polymer notes in circulation become tattered and ready to be disposed off , the CBN would start the printing of paper notes . <p> Lemo also said the apex bank decided to discontinue with the printing of polymer notes because the printing firm -- Securency- partly owned by Reserve Bank of Australia , and which was contracted in 2006 to produce the notes , was recently indicted over its activities in many parts of the world . <p> He said having been blacklisted for allegedly offering bribes in some countries , CBN decided that Securency is not an institution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper money is susceptible to counterfeiting , the CBN chief said technological advancement had dealt with the issue of counterfeiting , saying " technology has given us the ability to detect counterfeiting . " <p> According to him , there are three levels of authentication in the management of paper money , adding that their security features are much more robust and stronger than previous ones . He said rather than heap blames on CBN , the apex bank should be commended for responding to the complaints of members of the public on polymer notes . <p> The CBN chief was earlier quoted in Washington DC as saying the bank would start to produce the second generation of lower denomination notes in paper and not in polymer . <p> He spoke on the sidelines of the Spring Meeting of the World Bank and IMF last month .

Both the mean and median measure the average performance of each zone . Median is a preferred measure of measuring average because of its robustness against skewness which is often due to presence of outliers . The larger the mean or median in this case , the better . So you look for a large median or mean but a small standard deviation . <p> The shocking differences seen in this summary and raw data can be visualized through boxplots . The dramatic differences light up in a boxplot like the sun 's corona @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heart of Nigerian problems . In light of the critical role education plays in any nation 's life , the summary above is simply telling you that there are clearly two groups ( or , rather two countries ) in one . This dichotomization has been our nemesis since Lugard made that terrible mistake of combining incompatibles . Let 's make some observations from the above statistical summary : 1 ) Clearly southern regions take a clear lead here with the highest average performance going to the SE while consistency in performance within each region goes to the SW due to its smallest sd . Both measures are statistically important . 2 ) Each of the three regions in the south performed roughly three times better than each of NE and NW medianwise . The significant drops in NW and NE averages can be seen by a blind person . 3 ) Double jeopardy for the NW in light of comparable values for their averages and standard deviations -- a very mediocre ( low ) average and high sd . The NE is not far behind NW in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its middle-of-the-road role in this summary -- its average performance lies between the south 's and the core north 's ( NE and NW ) . 5 ) Both NE and NW performance falls badly below the national average performance . That needs not saying ; it is obvious everywhere in the data . The level of education in Nigeria today is nothing to write about , this dismal performance from NW and NE adds another layer to the index of mystery . 6 ) Now if you go back to the raw data , it is obvious that most of the the northern states that performed above national averages contain a good number of christians . I do n't know what this observation means , but that is what the data are saying . I am just letting the data do the talking . 7 ) Now the data tell it all about the reason for abundance of Boko Harams in NE and NW . What the data depict is a serious national problem and , more tragically , the so-called northern leaders mix this tragic level of performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the first item to address , and not amnesty to boko harams . Now we have strong evidence as to why Boko Harams and their supporters from NE and NW hate western education . Yea , somebody with this type of dismal performance would hate western education . The big question is : How will the country remain united and , more importantly , progress aggressively with the rest of progrssive world under this type of tragic schism in education ? This is what that requires a national dialogue , and not a useless and meaningless dialogue with Boko Harams -- murderers without conscience . As a Northerner , I believe , can we hear from the minister of education on how she and her boss are going to address this calamity ? Or , is it alright to them to be putting a student with a 2-point score and a student with a 130-point score on the same platform together in the same classroom in the name of so-called national interest and federal character ?

But now that the leagues are over , the question that comes up is " What exactly are we paying for ? " <p> DStv prides itself on having over 600 Channels , but really how many of these your channels do work ? While i subscribe for the full bouquet i get this message a lot when i try to watch a channel like Ghana 's TV3 " you are not enabled to view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not for my region/country , then why on Earth is the channel there ? <p> I have to give you props in one department though , you do listen to complaints .

When people started complaining about signal interference when it rains , you came up with an advert explaining things . Then when people started complaining about the rate at which you repeat movies you once again came up with another advert explaining how the chain works from the movie studio to the payTV ... But seriously we did n't ask for that story , just try to fix the issue is all . <p> Well one thing is clear , when the football season ends it 's time to stop paying the full bouquet or stop entirely and move to watching TVC and Channels TV .

Gossip girl ended ages ago yet it ca n't be shown in africa ? ? How about 90210 which still runs but they stopped showing . There are millions of movies that can be screened that do n't have to be new releases , that will help a lot more than repeatitions all the time . A station like mnet zone has n't shown one good movie I remember yet it counts as a movie channel . Absolute rubbish ! They shld give their customers value for their money .

The ministry of agriculture and rural development disclosed that about 4 million farmers were registered in 2012 , while over 10 million were registered in 2013 . <p> Under the scheme , registered farmers receives 50 per cent subsidy on their farms inputs from the federal government with the support of the state governments . <p> The Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development , Dr. Akinwumi Adesina , boasted at the public hearing to have returned dignity to the Nigerian farmers through the e-wallet system . <p> With this system , farmers receive SMS alerts on their mobile phones and proceed to the nearest agro-dealers to redeem the inputs with 50 per cent value of the inputs price . This , according to the minister , has put an end to the age-long queue by farmers only to secure a bag of fertiliser for a group . <p> He noted that high level of corruption and insincerity in the previous input distribution strategy saw a major failure in the system , adding that low level of the use of fertilisers and improved seeds reduced farmers ' productivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of Nigerian farmers benefited from the old system while political elites diverted bulk of the inputs purchased by the federal government to neighbouring countries . <p> " There was a major failure in our policies ; low level of fertiliser and improved seeds reduce productivity , the supply of improved seeds to farmers were woefully low ; the old system was inefficient and fraudulent ; there was a leaking pipeline where inputs went to political elites and outside the country , while less than 11 per cent of Nigerian farmers benefited , " he said . <p> Adesina also disclosed that the old system totally displaced the private sector players in the supply chain , and thereby gave room for the supply of fake inputs . " Contractors deliver 50 per cent sand and 50 per cent fertiliser , farmers were being cheated and the environment was being damaged ; the system lacked actuality and transparency , " he added . <p> Impacts <p> In less than two years of its implementation , the GES scheme , according to the minister , has increased the number of farmers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 60 per cent . The minister said about 1.5 million farmers benefited from the GES scheme in 2012 , and the farmers were able to produce 8.1 million metric tonnes of food . i.e. a 70 per cent sharp increase from the food production level in the past . <p> Challenges <p> The minister observed that farmers ' apathy was a major challenge to the success of the GESS in 2012 , as he said only 61 per cent of expected beneficiaries turned out to redeem their inputs . He also identified low density coverage of agro-dealers as a challenging factor . This , according to him , may not be unconnected to inadequate loan facilities for the dealers as the N60 billion NISER fund has not been accessed . <p> " Farmers thought it was scammers at work when they received the text messages ; so many of them did not turn out to redeem their inputs , " he said . <p> Complaints <p> The GES Scheme is being heavily criticised by some farmers .

Oyeleye said the policy thrust did not capture medium-scale and large scale farmers in its conception . <p> He also explained that the logistic problem being encountered with the GESS database was caused by farmers who registered in groups with only one telephone number . <p> " One of the problems is that the system does not allow more than farmer to register with a telephone number , so in the situation that a family of group of farmers register with more than one telephone number , only one person 's data will be captured as being registered , and that explains why some names are missing on the database , " he said . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unanimously lauded the GES scheme and urged the Minister to ensure continuity of the scheme without misplacing its priority . <p> Also , Speaker of the House , Hon.

Excerpts : <p> Can you give insight to the country 's technology ecosystem and the role of Intel in developing the ecosystem ? <p> The technology ecosystem in Nigeria is diverse and evolving . As Information Technology ( IT ) penetration continues to deepen in the country , the number of users of the technology devices and solutions are also increasing . So whichever angle people may want to look at technology development , they will discover that the technology ecosystem is actually growing in Nigeria . <p> On the part of government , more government activities are now online , making it easier for the citizens to access government information easily , unlike what it used to be in the past . Today we have more foreign technology-based companies coming to invest in the country , and we also have more home-based technology companies springing up in the country . Nigerians are becoming more technology savvy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A quick survey of the volume of foreign direct investments in the country in the past few years shows that such investments were more from technology companies . So as the technology ecosystem is evolving , more developments are expected in this regard , to further boost the ecosystem . <p> So what are the indices that led to the growth of the technology ecosystem ? <p> One thing that is outstanding in the contribution to the growth of the country 's technology ecosystem is the availability of broadband capacities in the county , through the landing of submarine cables from Main One , Glo 1 , Sat 3 , and MTN West African Cable System ( WACS ) . All these cables that had their roots from far away Europe are now in Nigeria and they have increased the availability of broadband capacities in the country , and broadband is the key driver of technology development . <p> With the availability of broadband , more people now have access to the internet and other forms of technologies that are driven by broadband . The best way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ access to the internet , and with the internet , people can comfortably sit in any location in Nigeria and connect the whole world with the click of the computer button . <p> Again , the growth of technology companies in the last few years , has greatly contributed to the growth of the country 's technology ecosystem . American companies are very good technology companies and most of them like General Electric Company ( GE ) and Microsoft , are here in Nigeria , investing in the technology growth of the country . Intel is also here in Nigeria investing in the technology growth of the country . <p> Intel has been in Nigeria for some time now , and we just moved into a new office which is an indication of growth and expansion in Nigeria . Technology companies from China like Huawei as well as companies from other developed countries are in Nigeria and they are contributing immensely to the growth of the country 's technology ecosystem . <p> You mentioned availability of broadband as one of the indices for the growth of technology ecosystem in Nigeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the high cost of bandwidth . What is your take on this ? <p> Yes , for now cost of bandwidth appears still high , but as time goes on , we will begin to experience downward slide in the cost of bandwidth in this country . One good thing is that there are broadband cables in the country , which has resulted in increased bandwidth , even though much of the bandwidth capacities are still at the shores of the country . <p> Bandwidth availability means a lot to the Nigerian economy . It will increase and improve productivity in agricultural produce , because farmers will sit in their farms in any part of the country and sell their products without leaving the farm environment . This is because information on farm produce is already uploaded in the internet and people all over the world can see the farmer and also locate the farmer . <p> Those that are interested in buying the goods will know where to go and make purchase orders . The farmers too can make online purchase of fertilisers and farm tools , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits that come with bandwidth in the area of agriculture , and this also has ripple effect on other areas of the economy like education , medicine , e-commerce , among others . <p> Today we have Jumia , Konga and other e-commerce platforms where Nigerians do shopping online and all these are as a result of availability of broadband . Before the landing of submarine cables , Nigerians were not able to have easy access to the internet , but today the story has changed and with some little more time there will be influx of bandwidth in this country and the cost will definitely reduce . <p> Software development in Nigeria is still at its infancy stage . What must be done to grow the local software industry in the country ? <p> Software development is a major driver of economies globally , and most of the advancements in developing countries of the world are software driven . A good example is the Facebook that has presented a global platform for social networking , and it is software based . Software services are critical in economic development . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are beginning to develop that sector of the economy . <p> Intel for instance is supporting the government to develop software hubs for the country . The Ministry of Communications Technology has set up software incubation centres in Lagos and Calabar , where people are trained in software development . This was how developed countries of the world started and we are beginning to learn the ropes . The idea of incubation centre is to train people who will in turn develop software that can be commercialised in Nigeria and outside Nigeria . <p> In spite of government efforts to make Nigerians believe in the efficacy of locally-developed software , Nigerians still patronise foreign software . What is your take on this ? <p> One thing we should not forget is that the software sector is an evolving one , just as technology is evolving . Nigerians may still be in love with foreign software because they have long been patronising it and it will take some time for them to drop the foreign software for the local software . They still look at standard and quality and these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to compromise on standards and quality of the kind of software that drives their business . What government is doing is to lay the foundation by developing policies that will help the growth of the software industry , and the expected change will not happen overnight , but will take a gradual process . There are Nigerians that have developed banking applications that are of standard but Nigerian investors are yet to buy into it and that is what the government is trying to change . There is need to redirect the orientation of our people to begin to believe in locally developed software . <p> Recently , the Ministry of Communications Technology launched the Techlaunchpad initiative , aimed at training Nigerians that will develop local software that could be marketed within and outside the country . Do you see government achieving this objective ? <p> It is a fantastic idea and I strongly believe that government will achieve the objective . In the first instance , what government is trying to do is to create a forum where people could develop local software with international standard and quality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the private sector . <p> Software development is all about finding an appropriate place and bringing in people that will share ideas on how to develop marketable software . Once the basic things are put in place , then the possibility of achieving results will be very high . <p> Intel has been in Nigeria for quite some time . What is its role in technology development in the country ? <p> Our role is basically in the area of enabling the technology ecosystem of the country . As a technology company , we always believe that individuals will advance technologically , when the ecosystem is growing . The truth is that economies and individuals can not grow in isolation . So our focus has been in helping the ecosystem to grow . In order to achieve this , we do a lot partnership with government , corporate organisations and individuals . The incubation hubs we have earlier discussed in the course of this interview are practical examples of our involvement and role in supporting technology development in the country . We also partner local Original Equipment Manufacturers ( OEMs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . In the area of education , Intel has done so much for Nigeria . <p> We have been involved in several technology training for teachers and we are also involved in several entrepreneurial trainings in the country . We have carried out entrepreneurial training for National Youth Service Corps members over the years , while they were in their camping grounds . Recently we organised training for medical Doctors and currently we are working with the Ministry of Communications Technology to further develop technology in Nigeria . <p> What specific impact has Intel created on the Nigerian economy ? <p> Intel has impacted so much on the Nigerian economy and I can give you classical examples on that . For instance we are currently working with the federal government to extend personal computer ( PC ) penetration among students in the country . We partnered Sterling Bank and some OEMs to drive the initiative even among Nigerian workers . <p> PC penetration in the country is about 3 per cent , which is very low and Intel is worried about it , just the same way the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with government to deepen PC penetration and the result is coming up , as more students and workers now have PCs of their own to work with . For PC penetration among students in tertiary institutions , we have 12 universities on our pilot scheme and we plan to extend the number to accommodate more universities . <p> Intel is known for the design and manufacture of micro chipsets in driving technology development . How has the company been able to sustain this over the years ? <p> Chipset design and manufacture is a core business of Intel and we have been doing that over the years . In the last five years , the federal government , through the Nigerian Communications Commission ( NCC ) , has been implementing the school access programme , designed to enable students in primary , secondary and tertiary institutions have access to computers that will help them in their studies , and Intel designed the micro chipsets for that project . One of the devices that our chipset is driving with that project is the Plasmic PC , which has long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is water proof and rugged to withstand any form of handling by the students . These are some of the technologies that Intel imputed into the PC and Nigeria happened to be the first country in the world where the PC was tested , and five years down the line , government is still implementing the project . <p> Telecommunications growth in terms of voice telephony has been very tremendous in the country , but that can not be said of Information Technology ( IT ) in terms of software and hardware . Why the gap ? <p> It is all about government setting the right policies and enabling the right environment . The major reason for the gap is in the level of IT infrastructure in the country , which is still very low . For us at Intel , our efforts in deepening PC penetration also largely depend on the availability of broadband in both the urban and rural communities and this is part of the infrastructure dearth I am talking about , and government has to do something fast about improving the level of IT infrastructure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of IT infrastructure in the country , the usage of Information Technology in itself is still low among Nigerians . Why is it so ? <p> This is what I am talking about . The usage of IT is currently being hampered by the low level of IT infrastructure . If the infrastructure is available , it will increase usage . The first thing that must be done is to increase the level of IT infrastructure in the country , and it will impact greatly on its usage . Access to IT infrastructure should spread across the country , and this is key to development . <p> So what positive impact can Nigeria boast of in IT development in recent times ? <p> There has been some remarkable development in IT in some areas of the Nigerian economy , which I think the government can be proud of . In the area of IT penetration for instance , there has been a remarkable improvement . Most government activities are now online and this is a shift from what it used to be before now , where everybody who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices . <p> Today that scenario has changed and people can now access most of the government information online . Again the activities of the Joint Admission and Matriculation Board ( JAMB ) and the West African Examination Council ( WAEC ) , are now online and candidates do no longer flock JAMB and WAEC offices to get exam forms or even check results . All these are done online . The area of PC penetration is also improving and the cost of bandwidth has reduced from what it used to be before the landing of the several submarine cables that we currently have in the country . All these are areas of improvement that have impacted IT development in the country . <p> The Nigerian Computer Society ( NCS ) is collaborating with government to drive job creation through the use of Information and Communications Technology ( ICT ) . What is Intel doing in this regard ? <p> Like I said earlier , our focus is to grow the technology ecosystem in the country , and we are still doing that . We are interested in job creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in several partnerships and training programmes that are geared towards self empowerment and job creation . <p> Technology is evolving from 2G to 3G to the Long Term Evolution and today the world is talking about cloud computing . Is Nigeria actually ripe enough to embrace these technologies as they evolve ? <p> There are lots of things we are doing in Nigeria that looked like we are leapfrogging in embracing different technologies as they evolve , but that is not to say that the technologies we had already embraced are no longer useful to us . The truth is that most of the technologies we already have , like the 2G and 3G , have not been fully utilised to their full potentials , but because technology is evolving , they become cheaper and better as new technologies come into play , and Nigeria can not be left behind new technologies that are evolving by the day . <p> In the area of cloud computing , I will say yes Nigeria is ripe enough to embrace it , and I say this because most of our sectors in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology to run their services and store their big data in the cloud . The issue of security risk in cloud computing has been raised , but the fact is that technology developers are not sleeping , and they are also working on security measures to guard against hacking and all of that . <p> Please leave your comment below .

@@1842235 <h> Wogu : SURE-P Project is Tackling the Myriad Problems of Unemployment <p> Minister of Labour and Productivity , Chief Emeka Wogu , spoke with journalists on the achievements of the Subsidy Reinvestment Empowerment Programme ( SURE-P ) project of the federal government . He also spoke on the challenges confronting the scheme and the measures put in place to address the challenges . Linda Eroke presents the excerpts <p> The ministry of labour is now handling the Community Services , Women and Youths Employment ( CSWYE ) project of the Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme ( SURE-P ) . What is this project all about ? <p> This project is aimed at providing stop-gap employment opportunities for women , youths and other vulnerable persons , including people with disabilities , in their various communities . It was designed with unique features that ensure direct impact on these members of the society , who form the majority of the poor , unskilled and unemployed Nigerians , by transferring parts of the wealth saved from the partial removal of oil subsidy directly to them seamlessly , thereby empowering them economically . The programme is a laudable social security intervention by the federal government , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> During your ministry 's inspection of some of the project sites , you met some of the beneficiaries of the CSWYE project of the SURE-P . So far , what is your impression about the programme in the North West Zone ? <p> In the North West zone what we gathered at the stakeholder 's forum , it shows that a lot has been done in the whole zone . You know we did n't go to the whole zone rather we had representatives from each of the states in the North West coming to Kaduna . But we had full attendance from Kaduna State of the beneficiaries . In Kaduna State we had approximately 3,000 people who have benefitted attending that stakeholder 's forum , while we had representatives from the other states in the North West . <p> Then before the stakeholders ' forum I was taken to the worksites though I could not go to all the worksites because there are more than 160 worksites . I could see people doing what they are supposed to do on the sites . So reasonably even on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shows that they have done ninety per cent of work . In terms of the obligations of the government to the beneficiaries , we have paid them up to June 2013 , that is the stipends that are supposed to be paid to them and the tools that are supposed to be given to them , the work tools have equally been provided for them . <p> I am highly impressed ; I am equally highly impressed with the feedback we are getting . Even the criticism from some of the beneficiaries , we are looking at it , because that is the essence of this sensitisation and appraisal tour to all the geo-political zones to appraise what has been done in those zones . The outing here yesterday and the previous day actually , I will rate it as highly successful . It is an improvement on what we saw in the South-South zone . <p> I think as we progress to the other zones , we will see a lot of improvements . And the number of complaints so far is being reduced because we have a handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I and my colleagues who are in the inter-ministerial committee would look at some of the issues that came up on this tour to improve on what we would do in some other geo-political zones . <p> What is the reason behind the tour ? <p> The purpose of my visit is to sensitise the general public on what we have done and still doing to fulfill the promises of President Goodluck Jonathan , to Nigerians when he promised to use part of his savings from the partial removal of oil subsidy to cushion the effect of that policy . The President promised to deliver this promise through the subsidy Reinvestment and empowerment programme ( SURE-P ) , which as you know , of which the community service , women and youth employment ( CSWYE ) project is a sub-component under the Social Safety Net Programme ( SSNP ) . <p> We are also trying to explore areas of possible partnerships between the federal , state and local governments on this CSWYE SURE-P project in tackling the hydra-headed problems of unemployment . We also want to see how it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seek further involvement of our royal fathers , the traditional rulers . <p> With all you have seen and heard during the tour , how will you rate the involvement of Emirs and other traditional rulers ? <p> You see there was a large turnout of different levels of traditional institutions because I understand that in this part of the country , there are stratifications , grade one , grade two or grade A or grade B and all that . You could see everybody turning out , the impression , and from the statements of the representatives of the Emirs , the traditional institutions that spoke yesterday , you can see that they are overwhelmingly supporting this programme . <p> So it is gladdening to hear from the traditional institution that this project is good , they support the initiative of Mr. President and they asked us to keep it up and expand it . That was the same message when we went to the Emir of Zazzau , Dr. Shehu Abubakar Idris , who said that this programme is good , that he supports the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stakeholders forum that he will equally require from us the conclusion and how they can continue to help in the project . So , it is a welcome approach and attitude and I thank them for the support they have given to this administration vis-a-vis this SURE-P programme . <p> Government claimed to have done a lot on this programme , but there are still a lot of youths who have not been accommodated in this project . How do you intend to address this ? <p> You could see at a point when I was talking , the beneficiaries hailed President Jonathan for putting this in place and that if this thing has not been put in place , most of them would still have remained unengaged and unemployed . In fact , they were so happy , ecstatic even coming at the time of fasting when you expect them to be weak because of the fasting engagement . <p> You could see them ecstatic , jumping , thanking Mr. President , thanking the federal government and actually they asked for more and we are going to address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be engaged all over the country in each of the 36 states including the FCT . But the message is clear that government has done well , but that we should equally open it up so that more people will be engaged . So we would look at those complaints . <p> How does government intend to sustain a programme of this nature ? <p> That is an issue that came up , it is a programme that has to be sustained as far as we keep receiving budgetary allocation from the National Assembly as appropriated . The measure that would be put in place is that as we go , we would make estimates of what it would take us to continue in the project , so , the rest depends on the legislative approvals . Each fiscal year , the Executive is expected to come up with budget estimates . <p> So when the one for next year is going to be done , it would be incorporated , what we need to sustain it for next year . But actually for this year we still need approval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this SURE-P . And majorly , it is all about the stipends . So , if the stipends contained in the amendment are not approved , it means that there is likely hood of running into a problem , a big one in terms of continuity of payment of stipends . <p> What was required for the year is about N20 billion . But so far we are made to understand that only N5 billion has been released . How do you justify this and how do you see it affecting the sustainability of the programme ? <p> Let me put the record straight . There are a lot of figures that have been brandish about in the public domain . Actually , we asked for an approximately N28 billion in the estimate that went to the National Assembly , N9 billion was appropriated . That shows that there is a deficit of about N18 billion . A great aspect of the budget is the need for the payment of stipends and running cost in each of the 36 offices of the CSWYE aspect of the SURE-P including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the National Assembly which was sent by Mr. President to them included that of augmentation and completion of what was budgeted for the SURE-P programme and other aspects . There were a lot of areas that were put across to the National Assembly for amendment so that governance will continue to run smoothly . This aspect of SURE-P is part of it . So , you can see that there is a huge deficit between what we proposed as estimates and what was appropriated . It is not a question of releases now ; it is a question of inadequate budgeting appropriation for the project . <p> What message do you have for the beneficiaries and those who are yet to benefit from this programme ? <p> From what I gathered they are saying that they are supporting Mr. President and the transformation agenda and we say for Mr. President to have given them this opportunity to be engaged , we expect a reciprocal attitude to the project and to what Mr. President has done , by been law abiding citizens , keep away from crime , shun violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in whatever way we can through this process of social safety net . <p> Now they are happy that government has given them what they require , so government expects that reciprocal approach from them to shun violence . As you can see with the implementation so far , areas that are prone to be violent , youth restiveness and violence are steadily coming down . We know those areas , you could see their happiness yesterday in the hall . If those youths were left unengaged and they remain in the township they would become restive and become street urchins and all that . <p> I equally thank Mr. President for giving us the support we have gotten so far because this project is so passionate and so dear , and at the same time so dear to the members of the Federal Executive Council because everybody irrespective of his or her ministry involve in job creation , youth empowerment and all that because we appreciate that employment , youth engagement is central to the success of the transformation agenda . <p> So I urge all Nigerians , well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President through support and good advice and practical criticism , not just criticism based on let us run the administration down or intended to denigrate the exalted office of Mr. President . I will equally call on all Nigerians to join hands so that all hands will be on deck so that we will solve this problem . <p> Please leave your comment below .

@@1842237 <h> Endless Season of Strike in the Education Sector <p> There appears to be no end to the ongoing strike embarked upon by unions in the education sector , as industrial action is crippling the sector , Linda Eroke writes <p> For the education and the oil and gas sectors , the second and third quarter of the year 2013 began on a negative note , in view of high incidence of strike that have paralysed activities and slowed down growth in the nation 's economy . <p> Of greater concern is the ongoing industrial action embarked upon by unions in the education sector over the failure by government to fulfil its own part of the Collective Bargaining Agreement ( CBA ) entered with the concerned unions . <p> It is instructive to note that these strikes have been brewing for some years , being fallout of the federal government 's non-implementation of some key clauses in the agreement that it entered into with the unions . <p> For , instance two of the workers ' unions in polytechnics ( ASUP and SSANIP ) have been on strike for over two months with no sign of the strike coming to an end as government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The unions are protesting the non-implementation of agreement reached with government since 2009 as well as the near collapse of polytechnic education . <p> Similarly , the Nigeria Union of Teachers ( NUT ) has since June 1 been on a sit-at-home strike in the states where the Teachers ' Peculiar Allowance ( TPA ) has not been implemented . While the strike has been suspended in some states , it is still on in others . <p> The latest strike is the one embarked upon by the leadership of the Academic Staff Union of Nigerian Universities ( ASUU ) over the non-implementation of some key clauses in its memorandum of understanding that government entered into with the lecturers in 2009 . <p> Notable amongst the said clauses is that dealing with the " Academic Earned Allowance ( AEA ) " which the federal government agreed to be paying the lecturers . The allowances are for excess work load , high carriage of student per lecturer , responsibility allowance ranging from administrative responsibility borne by lecturers , etc . <p> The central demands of the ASUU , apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to revamp university education in Nigeria . <p> The leadership of the union had explained that it has been forced to embark on indefinite strike by the non-compliance of government to implement agreements ; having tried severally and unsuccessfully to get the government to fulfill its promises . <p> When one looks at the issue of industrial harmony in the country , the question that comes to mind is why is the nation having an unusual high incidence of strike in this environment ? <p> The indefinite closure of the education sector has continued to elicit concern from various stakeholders which view the industrial action as an ill wind which itself does the country no good . <p> To stem this tide , stakeholders in the labour industry have charged government to act responsively by honouring agreement that it has signed . They also advised government to develop a professional arm that would assist it in negotiating with the unions . <p> " Whether in the civil service and the ministry of labour , we need a crop of professionals that will assist in negotiation with the unions at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be empowered to do that based on the ability of the state " , they stressed . <p> Secondly , the unions have been urged to up their game in terms of leading the values of true collective bargaining , which stretches the imperative of giving dialogue a chance before embarking on strike . There is a law of the land that stipulates on how the unions can go about their industrial action but industry watchers say the laws are not respected by parties in industrial dispute . <p> Call for Dialogue <p> For instance , the Trade Union Congress of Nigeria ( TUC ) , while expressing concern at the lingering industrial dispute between unions in the sector and government , warned that it would be a disservice to posterity if " we fold our arms and watch haplessly while strikes cripple the education sector " . <p> The Congress specifically frowned on the manner in which government fail to honour agreement four years after it was signed with the lecturers of tertiary institutions . <p> President of TUC , Mr. Bobboi Kaigama , emphasised that the disruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact on the nation , stressing that no nation does better than the level of education of its people would permit . <p> He called on government to engage all the striking workers in a dialogue to resolve the issues at stake and give room for a more conducive and optimally-productive working environment . <p> Government , he pointed out , must take decisive action that would meet the legitimate needs and expectations of ASUU and ASUP . <p> At the same time , he urged the concerned parties to consider the adverse effects that the strike has on parents/guardians of the students , as well as the students themselves who might be forced to spend extra years in school . <p> " We urge President Goodluck Jonathan not to rely solely on reports from people in his cabinet who might never tell him the truth about the situation at hand . From one side of their lips they tell us that Nigeria has a robust and strong economy and from the other side they tell us that from October , 2013 the government may have problems paying workers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If nothing is wrong there is no reason why an agreement that was signed in 2009 with stakeholders in the tertiary institutions is yet to be honoured four years after . This is not only preposterous but also has a devastating and fatal consequence on the sanctity of contract , " he said . <p> NLC Intervention <p> Also blaming government for the ongoing strike in the education sector , the Nigeria Labour Congress ( NLC ) said the strike was completely avoidable , but made inevitable by the federal government 's insensitivity and penchant for reneging on agreements . <p> The Congress said it was completely unacceptable for government to implement agreements it willingly entered into . <p> The NLC President , Abdulwaheed Omar , argued that the issues articulated by ASUU were not self-serving but tenable , valid and germane to the sustenance of a qualitatively viable education system . <p> According to him , these issues include : the lingering crisis at the Rivers State University of Technology ( RSUST ) ; the continued violation of the rights of the re-engaged 49 academics at the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Visitation to the University of Abuja ; and the parlous state of the economy and government 's disregard for its agreements . <p> He noted that the violations at RSUST and Unilorin hurt academic ethics and culture as well as infringed on human rights of specific parties and was therefore not acceptable . <p> The Congress , he added , is saddened by the fact that government always find money to service its insular political interests , but never enough for education , stressing that the rot and the decay in the education system calls for an urgent intervention . <p> To this end , he called on government to declare a state of emergency in education and review its economic policies that will not only be productive , but are job and development-oriented . <p> " Government does not expect that its serial acts of breach or impunity will go un-protested . The crisis in the education sector with multiplier effects ought to worry the government . Rather than join issues with ASUU , it should collaborate with it as a partner . None of these issues is new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not following due process before going on strike . <p> " We equally align ourselves with ASUU on its position on the economy ; economic growth without jobs or development is nothing . In the light of the foregoing , Congress wishes to call on the government : immediately end this strike action by implementing the agreements it entered into with ASUU , declare a state of emergency in education , as no nation grows without education , " Omar said . <p> Flaying Warring Parties <p> Joining labour in the call by government to put an end to the incessant strike in the country , the Director General , Nigeria Employers Consultative Association ( NECA ) , Dr. Segun Oshinowo , said " We are undermining the productive potential of our country if we can not guaranty industrial harmony . Industrial is equivalent to social harmony which is extremely important for promoting productivity and economic growth . This is because strike simply amounts to loss of productive hours " . <p> Oshinowo stressed the need for government to call a meeting of the social partners to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NECA DG , who blamed government for not acting responsively in terms of honouring agreements it signed with the unions , said : " When you look at the root cause of some of these strikes , you will discover that government has part of the blame . Why should government sign an agreement that it will not be able to implement ? In industrial relations , we are all familiar with the concept of sanctity of collective agreement . Once you have signed an agreement , you are bound by that agreement . <p> " First , government will have to stop signing an agreement which it can not implement . If it does not have the means to implement such agreement let the unions know and confine yourself to those things that you can honour rather than just put pen on paper in order to get temporary peace when you know very well that two , three years down the line , you will not be able to implement such agreement " . <p> He also blamed the unions for refusing to allow the rules of collective bargaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " There are rules of engagement , why should strike be the first resort ? It is supposed to be the last resort . Why do n't the unions give dialogue a chance , why do n't you give the dispute resolution machinery a chance before you trigger the last resort , which will be strike ? So , we need to really look at those basic issues if we are to stem the tide of high incidence of strike in this environment " . <p> General Strike Call <p> Meanwhile , calls have been made to the two labour centres to mobilise Nigeria workers for a general strike and mass protest to save the education sector from an imminent collapse . <p> Socialist Party of Nigeria ( SPN ) , said the strike actions by the education workers ' unions on the parlous state of education in the country places the burden on the leadership of the two labour centres to come to the centre stage in the struggle to save education from collapse . <p> The group , in a statement issued by its National Chairperson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes in the country have shown the inability of the " capitalist ruling elite " to deploy the wealth of the society for the benefit of the working people and the society as a whole . <p> " The leadership of the labour movement must rise to initiate the united mass movement of education workers , students and youth by calling a full-blown 48-hour general strike with mass protests against attacks on education and police brutality . In calling a 48 hour general strike , the leadership of the labour movement would step up the pressure on government to meet their demands as against the grave silence it has maintained to the demands of the unions , " the group stated . <p> Please leave your comment below .

" <h> Preparation For Retirement <p> By S.I . EKHATOR <p> Being A Paper presented by Mr S.I . Ekhator JP , MNIM on The Occasion of A workshop for principals of secondary schools at St Aiyela 's secondary school , Uzairue , Edo State , recently . <p> First , I wish to start this paper by giving in precise terms the definition of retirement . Retirement is the point where a person stops employment completely . Furthermore , retirement can occur voluntarily or compulsorily . Whichever , the essence is that a worker ceases to work and thereafter begins to receive his pension as well as his gratuity . <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 60 years or by convention at the attainment of 35 years of service when you exit from employment compulsorily . Voluntary retirement or early removal from office on disciplinary grounds can earn gratuity and pension provided the retiree covers the minimum mandatory period of service prescribed by existing regulation . <p> In the time past , government alone pays retirement benefits to its workers at the point of retirement and thereafter . The current situation is now different from this early arrangement and practice . What now obtains in the new scheme is a contributory , privately managed pension scheme . Every eligible employee shall maintain a retirement Saving Account in his name with the Pension Fund Administrator ( PFA ) of his choice . <p> The employee shall notify his employer of the PEA chosen and the identity of the Retirement Saving Account ( RSA ) opened . The employee and employer contribute a minimum statutory percentage of the employee 's monthly emoluments comprising basic salary , housing allowance and transport allowance with the Retirement Savings Account of the employee . The contribution would be managed and administered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fund Custodians . At retirement , the amount in the employee 's Retirement Savings Account would be the total contribution plus income and capital gain earned on the contributions mode . <p> In treating this subject , it is necessary to observe the need for early planning for retirement and old age in life . One should be told early that planning for retirement should start unfailingly from day one of your service career . As usual , a very clear focus and vision should be developed early . <p> What is important is that employees should ab initio endeavour to save a part of their income for the raining day . They say , " a journey of a thousand miles start with the first step " . <p> it is necessary at this juncture to relate a personal experience that I use to tell my audience during occasions like this . I was particularly lucky to have come in contact with an admirable and pleasant personality in person of Engr . Chief G.O . Aiwerioba , . O.O.N , retired Permanent Secretary , defunct Mid-West State Ministry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ministry just fresh from the University in my first appointment in the Civil Service in the early nineteen seventies . Chief Aiwerioba advised me then to always invest in bricks and mortar as investment in houses can never fail and it would appreciate over time . <p> I therefore use this opportunity to urge you all to invest early in your career in the building of your personal houses . Such investment would definitely turn into great assets in the future . If the investment is more than one , you would apart from not paying rents for your accommodation begin to earn additional income from the rents accruing from your personal houses . <p> Another area that I would like you to engage your attention is the area of purchasing and investing in genuine land acquisition . Such investments would appreciate over time and you will be the one to gain and enjoy the proceeds of your wise investments . <p> Also , there is another important area of investment which are stocks and share purchased in viable and progressive companies . The investments might be small initially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holdings in the future to yield you ample dividends and business opportunity . <p> It is my honest advice that as public officers you should join the co-operative society in your establishment as a way of raising capital and loans to execute genuine personal projects . <p> Similarly , you are urged to take advantage of the existence of loan facilities in various lending institutions like banks including the mortgage banks . Such loans when well used and managed can lead ultimately to increase in the quality and welfare of one 's situation in life . In this connection , I wish to relate an injunction we had from my lecturer , late Prof. 0 . Aboyade , Professor of Economics at the University of Ibadan in the late nineteen sixties that as students if we begin to work , we should not fail to take the opportunity if offered the chance be paid five years salaries in advance . He explained then that as borrowers , we stand to gain and the creditors would lose due to the effects of inflation . You are , however , warned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desist from such flimsy and petty frolics of using loans for staging lavish and wasteful parties and marrying more wives . <p> I wish to urgently sound a note of warning that my advice to you to invest in life , does not include a licence for unbridled quest for material and other unwholesome acquisition . You are admonished to be honest and upright in the due discharge of your assigned responsibilities . Always note that honesty is the best policy and crimes , eventually do not pay . <p> As you are aware , some officers like professionals are allowed in the public service to do private practice while in career employment . However , there are extant rules and regulations governing it . Such officers should try to practise without infringing on their primary assignments within the existing rules and regulations . They should ensure that the core ethics of the public service is preserved . <p> These days to encourage food production and to avoid famine , Government encourages public officers to in their private time go into farming . From involvement in agricultural practice , officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income . <p> The next topic of interest is the need for all public officers to endeavour to improve their academic and professional skills . When it was available , officers could study law and qualify as lawyers . At retirement , they can practise as lawyers . Also officers can utilize their time by doing part-time courses in the universities to add to their qualifications . <p> Possession of second and third degrees are useful assets in retirement . With such qualification and experience in public service , one can get jobs as lecturers in the several universities that abound now in the country . With the possession of higher qualifications , officers are more suitable to partake in politics after the service . <p> The key area required in preparation for retirement is adequate planning and maintenance of the family . You are advised to look carefully in choosing your spouse and in my candid opinion , you should marry well . A bad marriage can kill you . This admonition is borne out of what a bad marriage can cause . As long as your home front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to suffer . There are a lot of reasons that need to be considered while marrying and these include some medical and socio-economic factors . Try to examine the factors critically before taking the marital plunge . Ensure you marry well to gain the benefit of life and living xowards your eventual retirement . <p> Added to this is the crucial need to train and develop your children . It is quite important that parent should bring up children in the fear of God and ensure that they are well trained and developed to be independent of you . Such well trained and cared for children will have the ability to stand on their own and would be in a position to render due assistance and support to you in retirement and old age . <p> As public officers , you need to have and maintain regular medical check-up as only those who are healthy are in a proper position to render effective and efficient service in their workplace . Also , you should ensure that you enjoy your annual leave to unwind and relax fully away from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you maintain and keep good medical and healthy profile , you are guaranteed healthy life so that you can live to earn your retirement including your retirement benefits . If you fail to adhere to these cautions , the next option would be either dying or compulsorily sent out from the service . Kindly make sure that you do n't over do any things as moderation is the essence of life . <p> Officers should not fail to realize that there is beautiful life after service . If you do your work well and live well , you will be happy and look forward to happy and fruitful retirement . <p> There is life after service . You do n't need to be scared by the pang and fear of retirement . If your service is honest and fruitful , you will not indulge in falsification of your records of service . Make sure that your efforts in the service career lead to assist and help other people . Ensure you are kind to your clients and neighbours without comprising standard or integrity of the service . One good turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what one sows , is what he reaps is very apt and true in this circumstance . The opportunity that has been offered to you in this seminar is great and marvellous . Ensure you internalize the message and essence of this seminar . You should not fail to attend other seminars/workshops during your service career . Such opportunity offers the worker a lee way to improving on the quality and competence of their knowledge . <p> On the part of the employer i.e the Government should be commended for hosting and mounting this seminar/workshop . It is my honest advice and counsel for Government and its agencies to do more seminars/workshops so that other officers can enjoy and benefit . <p> Government is accordingly advised to endeavour to put up a programme to enlighten staff due for retirement to awake their awareness and consciousness of the imminence of retirement and disengagement from the service . Also , an established process and procedure to pay retirement benefits including gratuity and pension promptly and duly to officers in their retirement , Apart from this , adequate and specific arrangement should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as provided for in the constitution . <p> Conclusion Finally , it is my hope that you as participants of this workshop and seminar would put in practice and observe the tenets of real message and essence of the workshop for the performance of your duties in the service . We hope and pray that you will all work assiduously and retire meritoriously from the service and enjoy the fruits of your hard work in retirement and old age . .

They comprised a 176-room modern hostel , two large lecture halls , a business education centre and staff offices . <p> She said the commission 's intervention in the education sector was holistic as it did not end with providing physical infrastructure .

This question is worth interrogating in view of the fact that what the royal father sought to jettison without due process were established values and deep-rooted beliefs of his people which have persisted over generations--traditions over which he was appointed to serve as custodian . <p> I find the Warri Kingdom crisis fascinating because it speaks to the tension between Pentecostal Christianity and tradition , especially in our country and Richard Niebuhr 's highly revealing book , " Christ and Culture " , perhaps opens some window of understanding . To demonstrate how Christians have attempted to deal with the challenge of their faith against the background of old beliefs and customs , Niebuhr identifies five approaches which he listed as : Christ against Culture ; The Christ of Culture ; Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Transformer of Culture . <p> Unfortunately , the Pentecostalism that has been embraced in Nigeria today fits into the paradigm of " Christ against Culture " , a notion which rejects all the traditional African mores as archaic , backward and evil . The presupposition is that those traditions belong to some sinister gods that need to be dropped for us to prosper materially and spiritually . For that reason , many Nigerian Christians have had to change their names based on the theology that those names were dedicated to some ancestral spirits whose yokes would have to be broken for them to be free from poverty , disease and curse . While expressions of faith differ from one denomination to another , the preponderance of opinion among pastors is that our traditional heritages ( sometimes including priceless artifacts , dating back to centuries ) are hindrances to our faith and callings as believers hence we have to do away with them . It is within that context that we can situate the spiritual edict which got the Olu of Warri into trouble . <p> Now , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all my failings and imperfections--and I understand that one can not serve the true God and still be worshipping idols . But I have problem with a faith that is expressed in symbolisms and even superstitions . For instance , I have listened to several songs and messages that the economic and political problems which plague our nation today can be traced to our hosting of FESTAC in 1977 during which , as the tale goes , several countries came to dump their Satanic gods on our land . Not only do I believe there was nothing wrong in our hosting FESTAC , I see no correlation between it and our inability as a nation to harness our enormous potentials for the advancement of our society . <p> The Warri incident is instructive because there is a constitutional dimension to it which in itself can be considered within the context of the Christian faith . The Olu for instance already has a Church within the palace and it is not on record that his people quarrel with that ; so the attempt to change the tradition under which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like all positions of authority , there are sacred rules that bind the leader to the community and that explains why in other climes , Kings have been known to abdicate their thrones whenever there are irreconsiliable conflicts between personal convictions ( which sometimes include the love of certain women ) and the traditional order . <p> In the particular case of Warri , the matter is even simple . If the Olu can demonstrate the true essence of his faith and his subjects could see the evidence in his deeds , perhaps he could gradually reform some of the traditions without the public drama that almost ended in hubris . The problem I see , however , is that such public profession of political Christianity has become the vogue . I have read of a minister who holds a strategic portfolio under the current administration who also doubles as the General Overseer of a Church he founded . Even if we choose to ignore the several issues begging for clarification in such God-Mammon portfolio , the question must be asked as to whether his faith is reflected in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we digress , what many fail to understand is that in order to develop our country and uplift our people , we need to burnish our cultural identity while adopting the instruments and methods of scientific civilisation . However , a fuller exploration of the issues will take us to the place of symbols in belief systems ; the essential privacy of religion and indeed the tricky point of how all these intersect to sustain public order and social peace . To that extent , the peaceful resolution of the clash between the Olu of Warri 's private Christian belief and the imperatives of his public cultural symbolism as a traditional monarch speaks volumes to the rest of us . Religion as an aspect of culture thrives on symbols and rituals . Pentecostalism of course rejects the rites of the traditional Christian churches as it is founded on the redemption work of Christ on the Cross of Calvary . But I remain unconvinced that salvation is also a function of cultural suicide . For me , there is nothing that should preclude a traditional ruler from being a disciple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his people . This is the crux of a debate that is waiting to be inaugurated . <p> The Real Essence of Power In a piece she contributed for the UK Guardian last Saturday , former Prime Minister of Australia , Ms Julia Gillard , spoke about the regrets and pain of losing power in such a profound manner that leaves lessons for all politicians ( http : **74;34;TOOLONG ) . <p> Gillard who was Australia 's first female prime minister was ousted by long-term political rival , Mr. Kevin Rudd , in June this year , because the Labour Party felt she had become unpopular and might lose the September 7 general election . But notwithstanding , the party still lost to the conservative party . Gillard lamented that the change of leadership within the Labour Party just a few weeks to the general election had sent a " very cynical and shallow message " about the primary purpose of the party . " The decision was not done because caucus now believed Kevin Rudd had the greater talent for governing . Labor unambiguously sent a very clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of survival of its members of parliament at the polls . " <p> The message from Gillard is that there should be a higher purpose to seeking public office than the prospect of winning elections . Unfortunately , in our country today , politics has become an end in itself rather than the promotion of the public good . That explains why the last couple of months have been spent by our political office holders ( at practically all levels ) making permutations about the 2015 general elections rather than fulfilling the promises of their current mandates . There is crisis in our public university system with the students marooned at home due to ASUU 's endless strike ; the 2013 budget is in a tailspin on account of the activities of some oil thieves ; a group of Ombatse cultists are gradually carving out an empire for themselves in Nasarawa State while the Borno/Yobe axis of the country has almost become a war zone because of the seemingly intractable Boko Haram insurgency . Yet the only agenda in Abuja is the desperation about who becomes the president of Nigeria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) should come from . <p> Even though Gillard has now quit politics for good , a portion in her intervention which I commend to readers should serve those who wish to learn lessons about the futility of power and its real essence : " Losing power is felt physically , emotionally , in waves of sensation , in moments of acute distress ... know too that you can feel you are fine but then suddenly someone 's words of comfort , or finding a memento at the back of the cupboard as you pack up , or even cracking jokes about old times , can bring forth a pain that hits you like a fist , pain so strong you feel it in your guts , your nerve endings . <p> I know that late at night or at quiet moments in the day feelings of regret , memories that make you shine with pride , a sense of being unfulfilled can overwhelm you .

@@1848234 <p> What happens when the promises of men are not fulfilled ? We are disappointed . We might even become bitter . What about the promises of God ? They never disappoint . Even when they are not fulfilled , we are not bothered because we know that God 's promises transcend time . His word is from everlasting to everlasting . Therefore , God 's promises move us from time to eternity . If they are not fulfilled in this lifetime , it is only because they are slated for fulfilment in the life to come . <p> Men of faith <p> Indeed , the non-fulfilment of God 's promise in this lifetime is a cause for great joy because it can only mean we shall inherit eternal life . To receive the promise of God is to move from death to life . Even when it is fulfilled , we can rest assured that its fulfilment can not be limited to this lifetime because God 's word never passes away . <p> Jesus says : " Abraham rejoiced to see my day , and he saw it and was glad .

" ( Hebrews 11:13 ) . <p> These men of faith were not disappointed because they discovered that the very making of the promise by God was more than enough , without the need of its fulfilment . In many respects , God 's making of a promise is even more substantial than what he promises . This is because God 's promise brings us to God . God 's promise keeps us with God . And being with God provides the fullness of joy . <p> It is the promise of God that lays the foundation for our continuing relationship with God . Indeed , the promise is the confirmation that there is a relationship . A gift provides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is received , we no longer need the giver . But when we receive a promise , we are required to live on the promise . Jesus says we live on every word that comes from the mouth of God . ( Matthew 4:4 ) . Therefore , if God promises us something , the promise becomes our life , even without its fulfilment . This is because God 's word is truth and his word is life . <p> The real McCoy <p> Let me illustrate this further . When we want something and approach God for it in our prayer-closet , he sometimes turns the tables on us . Instead of granting our wish , he makes us a promise ; and the one thing about the promises of God is that they are always mind-blowing . <p> Abraham only wanted a child . But God promised him uncountable children . He told him to look at the stars and see if he could count them : " So shall your children be . " David was only concerned that he should not be overthrown as King of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the meantime , both Abraham and David would have to wait and watch , for the promise is for an appointed time . <p> But here is the rub : while we are waiting for the actualisation of God 's promise , we again receive far more than we bargained for . This is because while we are waiting , we discover the God of the promise . He becomes our exceeding and great reward . With the result that , by the fulfilment of the promise , we are no longer that excited about it . The promise then becomes essentially the bait that hooks us on to " the real McCoy ; " which God himself . <p> Spirit of promise <p> Jesus told the Samaritan woman at the well of Jacob that temporal gifts never bring fulfilment : " Whoever drinks of this water will thirst again , but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him will never thirst . But the water that I shall give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quenches all thirst is none other than the Holy Spirit of promise . <p> Jesus told his disciples to wait in Jerusalem for the promise of the Father . When they did , they did not come into houses , lands , positions or wealth . Instead , they received the Holy Spirit . Nevertheless , they were not disappointed . So how come the Holy Spirit is not enough for us today ? How come we still feel incomplete with him ? How come we insist we are only complete with a job , a husband , a child or a car ? <p> If the promise of the Holy Spirit was sufficient to motivate others , surely the reception of the Holy Spirit should be enough for us today . Jesus says : " If even sinful persons like yourselves give children what they need , do n't you realize that your heavenly Father will do at least as much , and give the Holy Spirit to those who ask for him ? " ( Luke 11:13 ) . With the Holy Spirit comes our tutelage in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true whole-hearted worship .

" ( 1 Samuel 1:8 ) . Is having the Holy Spirit not better than having ten houses ? Is having the Holy Spirit not better than ten husbands ? Is having the Holy Spirit not better than being Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria ? <p> Prince of peace <p> The psalmist says : " I will hear what God the LORD will speak , for he will speak peace to his people and to his saints . " ( Psalm 85:8 ) . When God makes us a promise , the first thing we receive is peace .

Prince Omaghomi asserted that Ogiame Atuwatse II as the 19th monarch was actually the 10th Christian to ascend the royal throne , hence no one could rightly argue that it had to do with religion though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ external elements with a " hidden agenda " . <p> Similarly , Mrs Progress Oyibo , an Itsekiri woman leader who presided over the cooking and dishing out of food at the palace ground while the protest lasted , thanked the Itsekiri leaders for their cooperation in defending the tradition of the land . <p> The bone of contention <p> Earlier , at the height of the conflict , the Warri Council of Chiefs had taken strong exception to the " New Order of Iwere Kingdom " proclaimed by the monarch in which the Olu said that as a descendant of Prince Ginuwa of the Benin Kingdom , the progenitor of the Iwere monarchy , and " as a royal priest in the order of Melchizedek " he was using " the authority of the blood of Jesus to destroy all ancient and new altars in Iwere land not raised up to the Lord by the laws governing the new covenant of life in Christ . " <p> But the Emiko royal family quickly dismissed the declaration as a flagrant disobedience to the rules that brought Olu to power with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by 37 members of the Emiko royal family of Warri , they declared that historically " when Prince Ginuwa left Benin to become the first Itsekiri monarch about 1480 , it was with the authority and blessing of his father ( Olua , the then Oba of Benin ) to reign over the river - hence the title ' Ogiame ' " . Therefore , the title deed over the riverside areas as well as the " Ogiame " title belongs to the Itsekiri people , who have so addressed their rulers that included Christians for over 500 years . <p> So , as soon as the people realised that the monarch chose to play tough , following reports that he had practically shut the door against his people and was no longer acknowledging traditional greetings reserved for the monarch , the Istekiri leaders swung into action mobilising the people for an indefinite , but peaceful protest including laying siege to the palace of the Olu of Warri . They maintained that though the monarch , as the custodian and trustee of the title on behalf of the Itsekiri people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the traditional practices , he could not do so without due process including having consultation with Itsekiri stakeholders and the constitution . <p> When the heat was turned on and the battle-line drawn , even the noble supporters of the king , including the about ten who signed the contentious document to supplant the Itsekiri I customs and traditions capitulated , either renounced the new order or went into a hidden . <p> The Governor 's Intervention Governor Emmanuel Uduaghan had cut short his engagements in Abuja to visit his kinsmen at the palace in Warri and appeal to them for peace to reign . In the end , the protest was without any recorded incident - thanks to the free food and other supplies that apparently kept the youths in check . <p> Nonetheless , one interesting aspect of the obvious collision of cultures in Iwere-land ( Itsekiri Kingdom ) remains the invaluable power of dialogue in social conflict resolution .

@@1848239 <h> Agency arrangement in tax collection <p> The topic of agency arrangement can not be discussed without stating what agency itself entails . The free dictionary.com defines agency as follows : <p> A consensual relationship created by contract or by law where one party , the principal , grants authority for another party , the agent , to act on behalf of and under the control of the principal to deal with a third party . An agency relationship is fiduciary in nature , and the actions and words of an agent exchanged with a third party bind the principal . An agreement creating an agency relationship may be express or implied , and both the agent and principal may be either an individual or an entity , such as a corporation or partnership . <p> The law of agency allows one person to employ another to do his or her work , sell his or her goods , and acquire property on his or her behalf as if the employer were present and acting in person . The principal may authorize the agent to perform a variety of tasks or may restrict the agent to specific functions , but regardless of the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the agent represents the principal and is subject to the principal 's control . More important , the principal is liable for the consequences of acts that the agent has been directed to perform . <p> History of Agency Collection of Tax In Nigeria <p> *In the 1961 Act dividend income was the only one subject to withholding tax ( WHT ) and the rate was the applicable income tax rate at that time <p> *Decree 1979 included the following other income sources : interest , management fee and royalties .

It extended it to cover : All investment income such as dividend , rent , interest and royalty and services <p> The Federal Inland Revenue Service ( FIRS ) noticed that the Major oil companies were so dilligent in deducting and remitting the WHT from their contractors and customers .

Roles of Banks as Agent of Tax Collection <p> Nigerian Banks play vital roles in tax collection . FIRS usually appoints banks as collecting banks after fulfilling basic criteria for appointment . The banks are expected to abide by the agreement of both parties and carry out the following roles : <p> *Ensure that there is a customised payment teller for different tax types . <p> *Banks are to ensure that the payment teller are pre-numbered and taxpayers friendly . <p> *Banks are also to ensure that as soon as the taxpayer make his payments , the account of the FIRS is credited immediately <p> *Banks are to issue an e-ticket to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pays tax through a cheque , a pro-forma payment acknowledgement slip will be issued indicating when the amount will clear before a confirmed e-ticket would be issued . <p> *As soon as the amount is cleared and e-ticket issued the banks are expected to sweep all payments within 24 hours to Central Bank of Nigeria . As consumers of goods and services , ministries , parastatals and other agencies of government pay VAT on their consumption in addition to the contract price of the item consumed by them and , for the contractor to render monthly returns , government agencies must obtain receipts from FIRS for the VAT paid on behalf of the contractors . The FIRS will issue the receipt in the name of the government agency which will in turn issue its own receipt along with a photocopy of receipt received from FIRS to the contractor .

@@1850231 <h> PDP crisis may become national -- Yakassai <p> Elder statesman and Second Republic Political Adviser to the Shagari administration , Alhaji Tanko Yakasai is not happy with the current political crisis rocking the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) . He thinks that the crisis shares a lot of disturbing similarities with the crisis that rocked the Action Group ( AG ) which spiralled into the collapse of the First Republic . He is worried that , if not checked , the PDP crisis may plunge Nigeria into an avoidable disaster . He spoke to DESMOND MGBOH in Kano . <p> Excerpts : <p> Sir , may we have your impression on the current crisis in the PDP ? <p> Well , I see it as the most unfortunate thing in the development of democratic system in Nigeria . I am worried about this development because of the experience that this country had passed through some years back where disagreements of this nature in the Action Group ( AG ) ; where the party was divided into two factions-one led by its leader , Chief Awolowo and the other faction led by his deputy , Chief Akintola-led to dire consequences . That disagreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national issue . And that was the first major development that created the condition for the eventual military take-over of government at that time . <p> So , this is my concern in this whole development . I fear that what has started as internal difficulties in the PDP- if care is not taken -- is capable of developing into a national crisis . And I sincerely hope that those concerned in this struggle would place the interest of the country at heart , that they would take into consideration the interests of the present democracy . They should try hard to make sure that their personal interests do not push this country into a national crisis that would affect , by and large , all Nigerians . <p> Interestingly , you are a veteran of politics . At present , we have " Old PDP " and " New " PDP . Is it really possible to have a party within a party ? <p> But this is exactly what happened in the Action Group ( AG ) . I do n't know if you are able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happened . Chief Awolowo 's faction remained the main Action Group . Akintola 's faction continued to function as Action Group and later on , they changed their name to Nigeria National Democratic Party ( NNDP ) and that problem got out of hand . It emerged from an Action Group 's internal problem , it became a national problem because the House of Assembly was divided into two . Eventually , an election was summoned , the House of Assembly was dissolved and during the elections , two factions claimed victory at the same time . It was alleged that one of the factions enjoyed the support of the Federal Government at that time , and the other faction which felt that it rightly won the elections , but was denied by the Federal Government , resorted to violence leading to situations where people were set ablaze in broad day light , where property were set on fire and burnt . The crisis developed into a national crisis . At that time , there was also the Tiv Riot . It led to a general crisis in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers , but that which was claiming lives and property and the Federal Government had no option but to deploy -- at first the police and later the military- to the affected areas . <p> What is , therefore , your recommendation to Alhaji Bamaga Tukur bearing in mind that the crisis as you have outlined , could lead to a national catastrophe ? <p> Well , I do n't think , in my personal opinion , that Alhaji Bamanga Tukur can solve the problem of the PDP today . This is because unfortunately he comes from Adamawa State and the crisis in the state has pitched him and the governor in two different camps . So , it is not the question of getting Alhaji Bamanga to solve the problem . It is to urge the president as the leader of the party and the father of the nation , to step in and do whatever he can to resolve the issue . After all , it is a problem within his own party and directly or indirectly , it affects him . Because it is the stability within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of his tenure and would enable him to get elected in the event that he wants to be re-elected in the future . <p> As a father , what advice do you have for these " rebel " governors ? <p> I will rather offer advice to the president and the governors . As I started saying , they should put the interest of this country before them . When the problem grows out of proportion , it would not distinguish between the governors and you and me . That was how it happened in Nigeria in the past . When this simple crisis between a leader of party and his deputy broke up , nobody thought that it would affect the ordinary Nigerians ; but eventually it was the genesis of the civil war in Nigeria , where thousands and thousands of innocent people lost their lives , where innocent people lost their property . That civil war dragged the country backwards and till today , we are still suffering from the outcome of that war . I do n't believe that it is beyond the capacities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger . So , I hope that they would consider the interest of this country and the future of its people above all interests . <p> When you just said , " Do whatever you can to solve the problem " , in practical steps and solution , what exactly are you thinking of ? <p> No ! I can not prescribe what will be the practical steps . They know best . They know what is possible and what is not possible . <p> One of the things that has surprised many Nigerians in the crisis is how come the president and Commander -- in- Chief of the Nigerian Armed Forces with all the intelligence at his disposal was simply unaware ; had no wind of such a deadly plot until it was hatched and delivered life ? How do you see it ? <p> Well , I think at the initial stage , it was something that was not planned . This is what I was told and I believe it . Because those who told me the story ...... I do n't think the governors entered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president . Otherwise , I can not see the reason Sule Lamido would dress himself in a PDP apparel . If he had wanted not stay at the convention , I do n't think he would have worn that apparel to that venue . I still feel that it was a spontaneous decision . <p> But Chief Obasanjo stayed away from the convention and the argument is that he may have been in the know . This gives credence to the fact that it was a plot and not an accident as such . <p> Well , there are many things that would make Chief Obasanjo not to take part in the party 's special convention . Obasanjo , already , was a discontented member of the party . This is because most of his loyalists were not in good positions in the party . For instance , the man he supported to be the National Secretary of the party was somehow edged out . And the man who he put in as National Vice President for South West was also not allowed to function properly . Both of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is an open secret that that they were members of the kitchen cabinet of Obasanjo in the South West . <p> So , Obasanjo was already discontented with the way things are going in the party . His absence from the convention is not as result of the crisis between some governors and the PDP or the president , but also because he has grudges against the party . So , I am not surprised that he was not at the event . <p> Let us look at it from the background that Obasanjo is a discontented member of the party . My question , therefore , is , can such a discontented member facilitate the repairs of the problems in the party ? <p> This is Nigerian politics ( laughs ) . No matter how well informed you are about Nigeria politics , it would all of a sudden spring surprises that would throw you into confusion . It is not in dispute that Obasanjo is a discontented member of the party . The fact that he did not turn up at the special convention says a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is now part of the group that is trying to patch up the crisis . <p> Some people have insinuated that he is the cause of the problem , that he enabled the present crisis as his own mischievous way of paying back to the PDP system . Do you think along those lines ? <p> I will stop not such people from thinking the way they are thinking . After all this is democracy . People are free to think in the way they see things . ... <p> ( cuts ) But what do you , as an elder , think regarding ...... ? <p> Myself ? <p> Yes ! <p> Well , my own thinking is that as I told you , is that they walked out of the convention . I do n't think it was a preplanned thing . But maybe as they ( the governors ) are working as a team , they felt that what happened to one of them happened to all of them . And particularly , the bone of contention was the party leadership in Adamawa State . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , the party appointed a committee headed by Governor Sule Lamido , who made recommendations , which was accepted by the leadership including the president , but which was later on scuttled by the leadership of the party . <p> So , I think that all these crises , whatever grievances the other governors had , eventually became connected with the party crisis in Adamawa State . When the delegation of the Governor of Adamawa State was prevented from entering the convention , that gave reasons for the governor of Adamawa to say that if his delegation would not be allowed , then he would not attend . And when he decided not to attend because his delegation was not allowed in , his governor colleagues , in show of solidarity , also decided to walk out of the convention . Because even people who are at the Yar Adua Centre said that the meeting at the Yar Adua Centre was hurriedly organised . <p> Yet they had a chairman and a secretary in waiting ... ? <p> No ! No ! ! When they came out before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't just stage a walk-out and go like that . They had to do something . <p> How much of 2015 is responsible for the PDP crisis ? <p> It may be , it may be a part . <p> Precisely , how much of it do you think we are dealing with ? <p> I am yet to determine , but I believe that 2015 maybe playing in the current dispute . <p> What is the way out because 2015 is a matter of months ? <p> Well , they are now negotiating and I would rather suggest that we all wait to see the outcome of the negotiation . <p> But what advice ........... ? <p> Drawing from the experience of the Action Group , I feel that it is high time some patriotic Nigerians intervene . On my own I thought of talking to some people , then I decided against it because I felt that if I go to sell the idea to somebody , I do n't want him to discourage me and say that he was not interested . So , I decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the basis of person to person in private . All the time I had met with him was in public- So , I decided on my own to seek audience and he consented to see me . The president and I met days later . I went and I saw him , and I told him what I felt about the crisis and he seems to share some of my concerns and I gave some suggestions . I did not know whether he took them or not . But definitely , he listened to me . <p> Finally , some many groups are already making ethnic and provincial noises ; noises that are capable of realising our fears and destroying the unity of Nigeria . What do you tell such groups that are renting and polluting the air ? <p> I am concerned that most of the affected governors are from the North . I am concerned about the fact that such a scenario is capable of giving an opportunity for people to make mischief of the situation . But thank God that the whole thing started from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Governor Ameachi who is from the same zone with the President became a part of the crisis .

The fact that men -- both young and elderly -- stare at her would have been understandable , but staring at just one part of her body for so long makes the matter worse for her . In this interview with SAMOD BIOBAKU , Obiefuna whose first name coincidentally sounds like that of one of Nigeria 's most controversial actresses , Cossy Orjiakor , spoke about different aspects of her life , <p> including her experience as a model , her good , bad and ugly moments as well as how she deals with the attention she gets . Still in her mid-20s , Obiefuna has sure had more than her fair share of attention from admirers especially men who salivate and gawk at the sheer size of her boobs .

I do n't like it when people get on my wrong side . <p> Run though the schools you 've attended till date . <p> My primary education was in Borno State . I was raised in the North though I was born in Imo State . The nature of my dad 's job required that he moved around a lot so as expected , I was also moving with him .

Fortunately , I had some with me so I gave them to him . That was the first time I appeared in a magazine . The magazine is called Jasmine . That was how the whole thing began . <p> Well , the experience must have opened certain doors for you .

He revealed that he went back a week after , precisely on September 16 to take the hands while he still kept the head there . <p> Police sources told Crime Reports that the head had been recovered from where it was kept , but the identity of the corpse remains unknown . <p> In an interview with Crime Reports , the deceased said it was his quest to become rich that pushed him to committing the act , saying that he knew he was in trouble when police came to arrest him .

@@1851230 <p> The former Governor of Delta State , Chief James Ibori , has told the Southwark Crown Court in London that the British court system lacks the power and jurisdiction to determine and reach a conclusion for the Nigerian Code of Conduct Bureau to confiscate his assets . <p> Ibori is currently serving a jail term in a London prison . The former governor , who spoke through his lead counsel , Ivan Krolic , argued that since Nigeria was an independent nation , is the British court system lacked the powers and jurisdiction to determine and reach a conclusion over assets declared or undeclared in Nigeria . <p> The British Crown prosecution , among other allegations , have accused the former governor of non-declaration or false declaration of his assets as required by Nigeria 's Code of Conduct Bureau ( CCB ) during his time as governor of Delta State . <p> As the legal battle on the assets confiscation hearing of the former governor enters its final stage , the British crown prosecution in their arguments asked the British court to confiscate the assets of the former governor because he breached CCB statutory requirements on assets declaration . <p> The crown 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every single penny above the sum of Ibori 's emoluments as governor said : " Every asset over and above that which was declared and which was referable to his ( Ibori ) level of salary can be shown to be the proceeds of his criminal conduct , namely fraud and corruption . " <p> Ibori 's lawyer firmly opposed that stance . In a firm manner and looking straight into the British Judge Anthony Pitts 's eyes , Krolic said : " Even where there is a legal obligation to make declaration of income or assets , the failure to make any such declaration or making of false declaration ( if such exists ) can not cause the property to be confiscated because this can not turn otherwise legitimately acquired assets into criminal property , since this procedure requires the intervention of a third party , CCB And with the unknown outcome of the bureau 's input , it is not possible for an English court to reach any conclusion about the attitude of Nigeria 's CCB to issues to issues as whether undeclared property held in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conduct . " <p> Krolic added : " In any event , these procedures are those of the of the Federal Government of Nigeria and thus , any forfeiture would benefit the Federal Government of Nigeria and non-declaration could not constitute a defrauding of Delta State , a necessary provenance in these proceedings . " <p> He had earlier told the court that despite the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ( EFCC ) and British Metropolitan police 's arrest and detention of the officials of Delta State Government including its Accountant-General between 2005 and October 2007 , the EFCC and the British Police did not have any evidence that the state was defrauded by Ibori or that the state funds could be traced to accounts of the former governor except for his salary . And this is an incontestable fact , " he said , nodding his head repeatedly for effect . <p> Relying on the evidence given before the crown court by the former Chairman of the EFCC , Nuhu Ribadu , where he , said " Over the eight years of Ibori 's governorship , approximately half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen by him , James , " the Crown Prosecutor , Wass said : " This puts Ibori 's benefits figure in the region of $500 million ' . <p> She , therefore , urged the British court to make a confiscation order of ? 90,000,000 against Ibori , based on nothing but somebody 's whimsical and capricious comments . <p> In his argument against the crown prosecution 's confiscation request and their reliance on Ribadu 's claim that Ibori defrauded Delta State , Krolic said : " It is the crown 's case that Delta State was the victim of the fraud done by James Ibori , yet there is no single evidence from Delta State , the victim , either in the Crown 's trial bundle or this hearing that there were withdrawals and funds diversion without just cause despite Nigeria EFCC 's and British Met Police 's detention of Delta State top officials in the course of their investigations .

" <p> " And this is where Ribadu or the British Police have done nothing at all to advance their case ; they have all the while relied on scoring sensational headlines in the news media . " <p> Ibori continued : " The prosecution has always claimed that I defrauded Delta State of huge sums of money , I am content to say that in this case that we have been witnessing for the last three weeks , the evidence should speak for itself and it should be crystal clear to anyone except the most biased observers that there has been a huge and substantial gap between the prosecution 's sensational claims and the hard evidence required to back up those claims , the sort of evidence that is backed by verifiable facts , instead of nothing but unjustifiable quotes in the news outlets . " <p> Meanwhile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charles Ajuyah ( SAN ) has denied allegations by the London Metropolitan Police that the state government refused to release vital documents to it while investigating the corruption case against Ibori . <p> Ajuyah , who made the clarification while speaking to the press yesterday , said he was shocked that the London Met police could make such allegations against the state government when in fact it never made any request for any document relating to Ibori 's trial . <p> He said : " The truth is that there was never a time the Metropolitan Police requested for information or document from Delta State . <p> " No request was made either formally or informally and I do not think the person who made that assertion actually meant Delta State . If he did , then it is not a sincere or truthful statement . <p> " I believe a request on that nature should be in writing . Was any evidence of the request produced ? None was produced .

Each film comes with its own challenge . <p> What actually influenced your decision to go into acting ? <p> It was Efe , a character in the now rested soap opera , Behind the Clouds that influenced me .

Most objective ranking of universities attempt to measure the extent to which a university is achieving its mission , which generally includes teaching , research , service and knowledge ( technology ) transfer . <p> In the final analysis , institutional mission and student success are indistinguishable . Top rank universities in Africa such as the University of Cape Town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nairobi excel across a broad spectrum of indices . Universities in Nigeria are competitively disadvantaged by the lack of adequate infrastructure to support teaching and research mission . <p> Brain drain of both faculty and talented students and mismanagement of scarce resources are contributory factors in the poor ranking of universities in Nigeria compared to other universities in Africa.I see a glimmer of hope in the private universities in Nigeria . The new private universities in Nigeria should develop curricula that are innovative and timely especially in the STEMM area instead of curricula that are merely duplicative of programs at other universities in Nigeria . The private universities have a potential for improved ranking if their resource base can be sustained . <p> What is your assessment of strikes every time in the education sector in Nigeria ? <p> The crisis rocking the education sector in Nigeria is no different from the crisis in the petroleum sector , power sector , aviation sector and many other governmental sectors . My role here is not to be overly critical but to propose ideas and solutions that upon further development and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pains me to admit that a great part of the problem stems from corruption , centralization of power at the federal level and leadership appointments based on nepotism with very little consideration for merit . <p> University leadership appointments are currently politicized with little or no expectations on performance , transparency and accountability . This often breeds discontent between university leadership , the academic and non academic staff and ultimately results in a lack of trust . What is needed is a paradigm shift in the governance structure of Nigerian universities from a centralized top heavy administrative model to a structure based on shared governance whereby administrators , academic and non -academic staff and students collectively develop a shared vision for their institution . <p> The private universities should be the laboratories for testing the new paradigm . The crisis in the education sector is also a crisis in management . The National Universities Commissionl and the governing councils of Nigerian public universities need restructuring with roles and responsibilities that are benchmarked and assessed continuously . There is also a misalignment between the needs of the country , the intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new knowledge relevant to the natural and human resources available for the development of the Nigerian people and the country at large . <p> The following should be emphasized : Nigeria 's new knowledge agenda must be based on an educational curriculum designed to reflect and unify the country ; around its dynamic cultural and ethnic heritages , its complex national history , multicultural identity , and its ancient technologies , creative arts , archaeology , iconographies and epistemologies . These markers allow people to build upon what they know and to connect with what they do n't know and seek to achieve . <p> In short , Nigeria 's education and future success rests upon taking pride in its patrimony as the foundation of its ascendancy . In the national interest , the country 's education policy must envision the competitive training , research and development of science , technology , engineering , mathematics and medicine ( STEMM ) citizens who focus on the national needs as an engine for driving the national economy and global competitiveness . <p> The national education agenda must revamp universal , free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be wise to incorporate traditional knowledge including medicines into the curriculum through the study of local flora , fauna , and geosciences . <p> A national assessment instrument that incorporates the effectiveness of such alignment and national goals at diverse levels within the country is essential for driving the education , development and employment sectors . <p> The funding base needed to achieve the broader educational agenda for the country must be increased at all levels with a portion centralized in an infrastructure trust fund disbursed by a competitive process that is truly accountable and transparent . A radical approach is to entrust the infrastructure trust fund to the control of a single individual who would be accountable to all because the other methods of funding have not worked . <p> As a result of the crisis in the education sector in Nigeria , the country is experiencing brain drain.What do you think could be done to stop this ? <p> Most qualified Nigerians who leave Nigeria do so for a number of reasons which may include but is not limited to the academic environment . People generally seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Faculty leave the country to pursue their research in more stable , conducive , productive , and competitive environments . In order to minimize the brain drain , government must confront the lack of incentives to work in Nigeria , for example , overcrowded , poorly equipped classrooms ; inconsistent electricity , inadequate facilities , and generally unpleasant , dilapidated infrastructure . <p> There 's no real reason for such disincentives to exist . Adequately funding research opportunities that contribute to the overall well- being of the nation would also appeal to Nigerian and other professionals who wish to contribute to the national good . Such competitive research contributes to the local , state , and national conversation and pride that is essential to academic quality and innovation . The brain drain also applies to talented students who seek admission to study abroad . <p> Therefore , to slow the brain drain , all academic and non-academic needs must be addressed to improve the learning and working environment and enhance the quality of lives of Nigerians . <p> Nigerians are hungry for a well-developed , transparent , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funding levels that can seriously address the sagging infrastructural and material needs of the entire educational system . <p> The following should be considered : A national funding strategy that includes all levels of governance with fiscally responsible , well-trained educational leaders who know how to leverage buy-in and generate ideas and partnerships with local and business communities ; provide resources at levels designed to increase wages and subsidize more impoverished local areas to caste a broad educational net in order to harvest multiple talents from the vast populations and cultures addressed above ; provide separate infrastructural funding that is conducive to learning and that inspires students and graduates to maintain loyalty to their institutions and county and that respects the people who enliven the institutions ; compete globally for the best technology and trained technicians to maintain the investments in teachers , students , and citizenry . <p> That means taking advantage of technologies such as smart classrooms , laptops , and iPads to drive innovation ; upgrade all levels of post-secondary education including teacher education and technology , and build on both National Youth Service and the diversity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education strategy with specific and measurable goals ; address infrastructural obsolesce and poor facilities maintenance as central to internal respectability and global competitiveness ; and provide regular internal , national as well as international opportunities for faculty , students , and members of the public to engage in collaborative experiential learning opportunities . These ideas are not new or unique . <p> What is lacking is the willingness to innovate . <p> What we have seen from time to time in the education sector in Nigeria is strike upon strike . How do you think this could be stopped citing examples of how education is run in the United States ? <p> Wherever there is a union and collective bargaining agreements , there will always be strikes , even in the United States . In the US , the salaries for US senators are not much different from that of a <p> professor of any major university , while in Nigeria the politicians arbitrarily assign their own salaries with allowances and bonus which are often several folds higher than their salaries . ASUU should be at the table where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set . I am advocating an administrative system that is transparent and involving some form of shared governance at the level of the National Universities Commission and other regulatory bodies that oversee education in Nigeria . <p> The problem with shared governance in a union environment is that collective bargaining by its very nature is adversarial . In return for sharing governance , ASUU should clearly articulate its position on student learning outcomes , and how faculty reward and pay structure can be tied to a transparent faculty evaluation mechanism that include courses taught and contact hours actually spent on teaching students . <p> I believe strikes can be minimized if all parties feel equally disadvantaged by the outcome of a strike . Paying competitive , timely wages incentivizes professionals to stay and contribute to the educational enterprise . This of course helps to improve the overall economy as well as the commitment of the citizens to the nation . <p> This also includes paying the lowest level workers a living wage as well as the top earners , and would go a long way in addressing the constant strikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment to the educational sector . It would also make workers feel valued by their national institutions . Changing the voluntary academic retirement age to 70 ill reap the benefits and collective wisdom of long-time faculty expertise and their collective institutional memory . <p> Education in the US , especially now , may not be the best example of stopping faculty strikes , especially since faculty in some post-secondary sectors do strike , usually over working conditions and salary . The University of California and California State Systems are examples . The difference is that when strikes occur in the US they are usually short-lived often lasting a few days ; the current ASUU strike in Nigeria has lasted over four months . There are many state universities in the US that face budgetary challenges , and the way these institutions thrive is through a transparent budget process , prioritization of scare resources and adopting corporate practices . <p> How does a Nigerian like you scale above all odds to attain such heights in an American education sector ? <p> There is no substitute for hard work in American education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tenure and promotion through the academic ranks in an American university is usually based on one 's teaching effectiveness , research publications , service and external grants and contracts depending on the complexity and mission of the institution . Merit also determines faculty rewards in the form of salary scales and annual increments . For any Nigerian to attain great heights in American higher education , the individual must minimally be as good as but preferably better than his American born counterpart . <p> All my schooling from undergraduate to post -doctoral was done in the US . I arrived at Auburn University , a major land-grant , research extensive national university in Alabama in 1984 , as a faculty member in geology and geochemistry . I immediately developed a teaching and research agenda designed to earn me tenure , which is the first step to becoming a permanent faculty member with job security . <p> I was fortunate to attract talented graduate students to my research program and benefited from financial support for my research from my university and grant funding agencies . I quickly rose through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor in the 140-year-old history of the university .

By most accounts I was a successf <p> ul Dean , which led to my appointment as Vice Chancellor at the University of Tennessee , and later as Provost and Vice President at Saint Xavier University . In all my academic and administrative appointments , each position held was the outcome of a competitive national search whereby hundreds of applications are screened by a search committee consisting of representatives from a cross section of the university community ( the internal stake holders ) and external business leaders and supporters of the university . <p> Transparency in the search process for faculty and administrative positions in American Higher Education engenders trust and ensures an acceptable outcome .

In my early career , I spent some time teaching and conducting research at the University of Ghana , Legon . While universities in Ghana face financial challenges as well , I appreciate their commitment to student learning , which is clearly what is attracting students from Nigeria to Ghana .

This trend can be reversed by the creation of more private universities or branch campuses of the major universities in order to accommodate the growing number of students hungry for education . What sets education in the United States and United Kingdom apart from most countries is the issue of access . <p> The current funding base for education in Nigeria is grossly insufficient to support the enrolment base and infrastructure needs for the development of a 21st century academic institution .

The two do n't just see eye-to-eye . <p> HER WARDROBE <p> The Nigerian First Lady is a power dresser . She is always attractively dressed ( even when the President is looking morose ) .

Ice cream ke ? Yes , and that was because she used to cool ice cream in her large deep freezers . The ice cream is then later distributed for sale . He says business was ' booming ' for her then . President Jonathan was at that time , a senior lecturer at the Rivers State College of Education . And yes , she had a poultry too at the same time . Quite industrious I 'd say . In December 2013 , at the inauguration of the Subsidy Reinvestment and Empowerment Programme Maternal and Child Health otherwise known as MAMA Project , she stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Mama Peace . <p> SHE HAS HER OWN SEAL OF OFFICE <p> Yes , she has her own seal and she uses it during public functions ( see picture ) . <p> This action itself has generated some controversy and criticism because the office of the First Lady as it is , is not recognized in the Nigerian Constitution . Only the Commander-in-Chief ( and others as stipulate ) is allowed to use a Presidential Seal on his lectern while speaking in public . <p> HER FRIENDS <p> The Dame is quite a sociable woman and she is usually seen with her retinue or battalion , of friends . <p> Some of her closest allies include the wife of the Vice President , Hajia Amina Sambo ( she calls her her ' twin sister ' ) , wealthy businesswoman , Hajia Bola Shagaya ( who has been friends to the Aso Rock for decades since Maryam Babangida 's time ) , Helen Mark , wife of the Senate President ( she once referred to her as her ' younger friend ' ) , Yemisi Suswan , the wife of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ladies , female ministers and wives of military service chiefs . <p> SHE WAS ONCE REFERRED TO AS JESUS CHRIST <p> Irrespective of the opinion you hold of the Nigerian First Lady , there are those who are absolutely in love with her and will do anything to defend her and proclaim their loyalty . One of such people is Evans Bipi , member representing Ogu Bolo State Constituency in the Rivers State House of Assembly . In an interview , he stated : <p> " People are misinterpreting this Jesus Christ on earth . Let me say this . Man is God to man ; it is in the Bible . You must not see God ; you will see God through somebody . God said , see me through Jesus Christ . That is why we are seeing God through Jesus Christ .

When a woman attains such level , everybody calls her mummy . It is a form of respect to her . But to me , my mummy ( Patience Jonathan ) is special because she brought me up to this level . SHE HAS A BOISTEROUS MEDIA TEAM <p> In a nation of over 170 million people , you will do well to shield yourself from criticism of many as the First Lady of the nation .

@@1858232 <p> NEWS EXPRESS -- My attention was drawn to President Jonathan 's goodwill message to Nigerians on Christmas . Having read many speeches from the President of Nigeria , I am always certain that there would be grammatical and other kinds of errors in his speeches . Indeed , I have stopped bothering about it . But when I read his present speech , I had to comment , initially for the benefit of my friends . <p> The responses to my comment promoted me to further analyze that speech . ( Before you go further , remember that anybody can make a mistake . It is a matter of degree ; but the office of the President of Nigeria should not make the same type of mistake that an individual like me could make ) . The funny thing is that I am actually familiar with how the presidency works or should work . There are layers of personnel to ensure that anything coming from the President , directly in his name , reflects the best the country is capable of . That is supposed to be the general state of affair and everybody in the presidency understands and works towards that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secretaries and other support staff working in a structure where they are positioned to detect errors and correct them before the matter gets out . <p> For instance , it is a serious problem to submit a document to the President for his signature , where such a document has an error in it . We refer to documents signed by the President as documents that are watertight and perfect . They leave no room for typos or other problems . That is why a document bearing directly the name of the President would go through several checks and reviews before publication . <p> Note that this was not a speech delivered on behalf of the President by an aide . It is not a thing by a press rep . It is not a thing by his advisers . It is directly in the name of the President . So , efforts should have been expended to ensure that it met the highest standards . If they were not sure of that standard or they lack the time and resources to ensure the highest standards , they could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some other official . <p> What I think happened was that they allowed a low grade , low talent ( but highly paid ) connected political player 's relative to man the President 's Facebook account . They forgot that even though it was Facebook , that was the President directly communicating with the world . <p> Some people naively think that this is just about grammatical error . They are satisfied that he even bothered to greet them on Christmas . But , rather , this matter reflects failure at several levels . It is failure to understand the use and significance of the social media in modern governance . It is failure to understand the people and the audience the President is trying to reach . It is a failure to select the right officials based on competence rather than political patronage . It is simply a huge failure to lead the country with any sense of modernity . <p> A few days ago , President Putin of Russia had a meet-the-press session attended by 3,000 press people . Putin communicated with the world with the latest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But here , the President of the most populous black nation in the world where 65% of the population comprises of people under age 30 could not even send a simple message on Facebook without so many basic errors . <p> Now , I used this simple issue to test Nigerians . I wanted to see how many of the youth would understand what is in issue here . Many do not understand that if you do n't speak any language of your choice in the correct grammatical format , that would cause you to say the opposite of what you meant to say . Now , may we examine in some specific details the statement by the President of Nigeria , as follows : ( I placed my comments as Notes after the first four paragraphs ) . PRESIDENT JONATHAN 'S SPEECH : FIRST PARAGRAPH : As the world marks the birth of Jesus Christ , let me , on behalf of myself , my family and the Federal Government , extend the good tidings of peace , progress and joy to every home throughout our beloved country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as : ( 1 ) The world does not mark the birth of Jesus Christ , really . Only Christians do that . This is because the word " marks " , as used in this first paragraph means : " a festival to mark an anniversary : celebrate , observe , recognize , acknowledge , keep , honor , solemnize , pay tribute to , salute , commemorate , remember , memorialize . " Only Christians do that for the birth of " Jesus Christ " . Also , there is a difference in connotation between " Jesus of Nazareth " and " Jesus Christ " . Jesus of Nazareth is a historical figure that everybody agrees was born , lived and was killed in the region of Judea about 2000 years ago . The Jews and Muslims and everyone else really call him " Jesus of Nazareth " , but they do not accept that he is " Christ " the Messiah . So the world could not really " mark " the birth of " Jesus Christ " , any more than it would be correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . ( 2 ) The use of the phrase , " on behalf of myself " is questionable on grounds of appropriateness . If you must add " myself " on the list of people the President was speaking for , that should be the last on the list . ( 3 ) The phrase , " the Federal Government " , is incomplete and ambiguous . While acceptable in some clear contexts , it is ambiguous to someone who might not automatically know that Jonathan is the President of Nigeria . So , that phrase ought to have been " Federal Government of Nigeria " or anything else that specifies the country in question . This is particularly so because the phrase is being used for the first time in the speech . It is true that he subsequently added in the same paragraph the word " Nigeria " . But that does not cure the error . ( 4 ) The last phrase in that paragraph , " our beloved country Nigeria " is incorrectly written . There ought to be a comma between " country " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the writer had used the readily available spell checker on his or her computer , many of these errors would have been highlighted and taken out . So , how could our officials be so lazy and daft ? <p> SECOND PARAGRAPH : Christmas is a time of joyous family gatherings and as President , I see every Nigerian as a member of my family and I urge us all to retain the unique sense of brotherly love that this season evokes beyond the Yuletide period . <p> Note : ( 1 ) This paragraph is mostly meaningless . The President 's attempt to define Christmas only as " a time for joyous family gatherings " does not reflect an intelligible articulation of the purpose of Christmas . In fact , religious scholars do not believe that the central connotation of Christmas involves family gatherings , as there is no such religious obligation for families to gather . Of course , he could have avoided this ambiguity by indicating that this is his own understanding of the meaning of Christmas . ( 2 ) Also the use of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not reflect the best practice . ( 3 ) Similarly , there ought to be the definite article " the " before the word " President " in that paragraph . ( 4 ) The most disturbing error in the second paragraph of the speech has to do with the last seven words in that paragraph , " this season evokes beyond the Yuletide period " . The problems here are : ( a ) What is the " season " mentioned here ? That is Christmas season . ( b ) What is the " Yuletide period " mentioned here ? That is Christmas period . So , that statement really says something like this : " This Christmas season evokes beyond the Christmas period " . You can see immediately the dumbness of such statement . It is a lazy statement by a lazy writer . And , by the way , what is the meaning of the word " Yuletide " ? It is defined by Wikipedia as : " Yule or Yuletide ( " Yule time " ) is a Pagan religious festival observed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Christian festival of Christmas . " The English Dictionary defined it as " Archaic way of saying " Christmas " " . Now why would this writer use such term , really ? <p> THIRD PARAGRAPH : While we will surely mark this holiday in our different ways and according to our established traditions , it is my desire that we all celebrate Christmas with some minimum comforts and my team and I have long prepared for this by working to improve our infrastructure especially those that most serve us during this season . <p> Note : This paragraph , like all other paragraphs in the speech , contains at least four errors . I do n't need to mention them here , except to point out the most bizarre of the errors . That has to do with the phrase : " it is my desire that we all celebrate Christmas with some minimum comfort ... " What does the President mean to say here ? Is he urging Nigerians to show restraint in their consumption during the period , which might make sense , or does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the period ? ( If Nigerians do n't have electricity during the period , yes , that would be " minimum comfort " for them ) . It is totally bizarre for such ambiguity and confusion to emanate from a simple statement of goodwill from the President of Nigeria . I will not bother to list the errors in the remaining paragraphs . Those are even too disturbing for anyone to bother to point them out . It is easier to point out the correct statements here than to point out the errors because only about five sentences in the entire speech are correct grammatically and otherwise . And most of the factual assertions in the speech are false and most statements of opinion in it are illogical . <p> FOURTH PARAGRAPH : Knowing that this period is the peak period for cross country travels amongst our people , this administration has fast tracked the repair and reconstruction of artery roads nationwide . We have also ensured that the nightmare our citizens suffered at fuel stations during periods like this is put behind us . For the second year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lagos Terminus all the way to The hinterlands of the North . This year , we also introduced cargo and haulage train services from the Lagos Port to up country locations . FIFTH PARAGRAPH : With the Enugu airport now handling international flights , more of our people can fly directly to their localities resulting in reduced pressure on our roads . <p> SIXTH PARAGRAPH : Our policies to spur local production of staples such as rice and wheat are bearing fruits as evidenced by the 2013 Global Hunger Index . <p> SEVENTH PARAGRAPH : Although I will not depend on statistics until every Nigerian has enough to eat at all times and in every season , the report is salutary and only galvanizes us to further action . EIGHTH PARAGRAPH : I have also personally monitored government 's fiscal effort which we ensured were tightened for the purpose of avoiding or severely reducing the seasonal inflationary trends on consumer goods around this time of the year with the attendant result that inflation is at single digit rate . <p> NINETH PARAGRAPH : These steps have been undertaken because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible in our country if we desire to achieve it . <p> TENTH PARAGRAPH : So , as we all celebrate with friends and family , I say from me to you , Merry Christmas and may the joys of the season extend from our individual homes to those of our neighbors and neighboring communities irrespective of religion and region . GEJ <p> Remember , the dialect of President Jonathan is Broken English ; therefore , do n't blame him if he ca n't speak or understand proper Queen 's English . Nigeria deserves what they get . <p> Uduak Effiong <p> Yorobas are now expert in English language just so as to ridicule an Ijaw man who is president whether they like it or not . Jonathan is still more refined , speaks better than apeman Obasanjo , the Yoruba president .

How many errors were in Obasanjo 's useless speeches which he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The writer is simply an individual who is trying to show off or advertise himself as a better replacement for the fellow in charge of managing the face book of President GEJ , " bad belle " mind your own business . <p> http : //Www.omoife.org Omo IFE <p> Is there anything GEJ does that has no errors .

Of course , we know a succession of Nigerian presidents and many of our leaders demontrate poor communication skills , but on this score , I would think GEJ should be commended for his embrace of social media ( first to do so , really ) , while we can expect his successors to take it a notch higher ( like Putin , the Pro- : ) <p> Also , I do n't think anyone expects a posting on social media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let it go ! <p> http : //www.charlesemeka.com Charles Emeka <p> The message at this time is more important than the grammar .

Let 's not sweat the small stuff and because the Internet is not policed , it has given everyone the opportunity to say whatever they like , how they like . No party in Nigeria stands for anything specific so let 's focus on personality and policy and not party . Most members of all the parties used to be in the same party . As long as us Nigerians re happy to keep slicing , dicing and dividing , we will not make much progress .

The Nembe elders noted with concern that Nigeria is infamous for its callous neglect of the Niger Delta region particularly the Nembe territory which is the most tragic example of that neglect .

Ejiofor Alike writes <p> In 2013 , the Federal Government , through the Bureau of Public Enterprises ( BPE ) handed over the assets of the Power Holding Company of Nigeria ( PHCN ) to the private investors , successfully concluding the journey that started in 1999 , when former President Obasanjo inaugurated the Electric Power Implementation Committee , which developed the National Electric Power Policy in 2001 . <p> The enactment of the Electric Power Sector Reform ( EPSR ) Act of 2005 ; establishment of PHCN ; repeal of the Act that established the National Electric Power Authority ( NEPA ) and the creation of 18 successor companies from the PHCN -- six generation companies ; one transmission company and 11 distribution companies were part of the initial stages of the reform . <p> The EPSR Act of 2005 , which changed the legal and regulatory environment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission ( NERC ) to regulate the entry and operations of the private sector in terms of the tariff and service delivery . <p> Obasanjo commenced the implementation of the EPSR Act , before he handed over to the late President Umaru Musa Yar'Adua , who suspended the implementation of the power reforms . <p> The BPE , under President Jonathan , restarted the privatisation of the assets of the PHCN in December 2010 ; four months after President Jonathan launched the Power Roadmap in Lagos . <p> A detailed report of the privatisation programmes obtained at the weekend by THISDAY from the BPE showed that on March 30 2012 , the privatisation agency issued the revised bidding documents to bidders , while the final comments were received on April 20 . <p> The final bidding documents were issued to investors on May 11 , 2012 and by July 17 , 2012 , a total of 25 proposals were received for the generation companies ( GENCOs ) and by July 31 , 2012 , a total of 54 proposals were equally received for the distribution companies ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission ( NERC ) , Ministry of Power , NEXANT , CPCS and NIAF were constituted to evaluate the bids , with operatives of the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission ( EFCC ) , Independent Corruption Practices Commission ( ICPC ) and the State Security Services ( SSS ) serving as observers . <p> The National Council on Privatisation ( NCP ) approved nine prequalified bidders for the GENCOs on August 14 , 2012 while 31 prequalified bidders were approved by NCP for the DISCOs on September 18 , 2012 The financial bid opening ceremony was held on September 25 2012 for the Gencos and October 16 2012 for the Discos NCP on October 29 , 2012 approved the five preferred bidders for Genco &amp; 10 preferred bidders for Disco <p> Reform Activities in 2013 The emergence of preferred bidders triggered the process of Negotiations of the share sale agreement , according to the Director General of BPE , Mr. Benjamin Dikki .

According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first week of November 2013 . <p> Origin of Power Reform With increasing demand for electricity supply by more Nigerians and without corresponding increase in power generation , the power infrastructure collapsed in 2000 shortly after the commencement of the current democratic rule in 1999 . The crisis in the power sector prompted the then President Olusegun Obasanjo to sack the board of the National Electric Power Authority ( NEPA ) and to set up a nine-man technical committee , headed by the current Governor of Cross River State , Senator Liyel Imoke . <p> The setting up of the committee to probe the inefficiencies of NEPA signaled the beginning of the the power reform , which culminated to the handover of the PHCN assets to the private sector . <p> During his second term , Obasanjo again dissolved the NEPA board headed by Alhaji Umaru Ndanusa and replaced it with a new technical committee , also headed by Imoke , who was then Minister for Power and Steel . <p> The committee had a mandate to run the affairs of NEPA and see it through the privatisation process . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General of Bureau for Public Enterprises ( BPE ) , Dr. Julius Jubril Bala , who was Deputy Chairman ; Senior Special Assistant to the President on Budget Monitoring and Price Intelligence , Mrs. Oby Ezekwesili and the then Managing Director of NEPA , Mr. Joesph Makoju . Others were the Managing Director of Nigerian Gas Company , and Mrs. Irene Chigbue also of BPE and a Director in the Office of the SGF , Dr. BY Abubakar . With the National Electric Power Policy produced from the works of Imoke 's first committee , NEPA was transformed into the Power Holding Company of Nigeria ( PHCN ) , with 18 successor companies . <p> The Electric Power Sector Reform ( EPSR ) Act of 2005 was signed into law on March 11 , 2005 to support the power reform . <p> The Act created the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission ( NERC ) and also seeks to privatise the PHCN successor companies .

@@1858238 <h> Changing Fortunes of PDP <p> Last week 's defection of 37 lawmakers of the Peoples Democratic Party ( PDP ) in the House of Representatives to the opposition All Progressives Party ( APC ) has changed power configuration in the green chamber of the National Assembly , making the ruling party to lose its majority status in the legislature . Ademola Adeyemo , Shola Oyeyipo and Ojo M. Maduekwe analyse the implication of the defection on the future of the PDP and President Goodluck Jonathan 's yet-to-be declared second term bid <p> In politics , just like in life , nothing is permanent . This was aptly captured in the pithy saying of the great philosopher , Socrates , who was quoted as saying that " No condition is ever permanent , then you will not be overjoyed in good fortune nor too scornful in misfortune . The only thing that is permanent in this world is change . " His maxim aptly captures the situation the ruling Peoples Democratic Party has found itself . Overnight , the largest party in Africa , as its chieftains like to describe the power machine that has been ruling Nigeria since the rebirth of democracy in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unraveling of PDP began on November 26 with the defection of five of its seven aggrieved governors to All Progressives Congress ( APC ) . Last week , the ruling party suffered further losses with 37 members of the party in the House announcing their defection to the opposition party . Until last Wednesday when the defection took place , PDP was the majority party in the House . With this development , the APC is now in the majority with a slim margin of one lawmaker . The numerical strength of the two major parties as at now in the House is APC 172 as against PDP 's 171 . The APC , however , needs 181 members to take over the leadership of the House from the PDP and it may get it and even surpass the figure as more lawmakers from the ruling party are only bidding their time before they switched political allegiance . The party 's hope to emerge the dominant organisation in the House that would enable it to take over the leadership of the lower chamber of the legislature is hinged on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the lawmakers loyal to their governors , whom had declined to join their five other colleagues to cross over to the APC , had also pulled back until the political direction of their governors is clearer . If the 17 lawmakers from the two state , six from Niger and 11 from Jigawa had joined others to move to APC , the party would have been in a comfortable majority to assume the leadership of the House . The development however has implication for the leadership of the House , which may be changed since the opposition has displaced the PDP as the majority party in the House . <p> But in the Senate , PDP is still having 48 senators , New PDP , the group which aggrieved members of the ruling party belong , has 26 and APC has 29 . With the merger , 21 of the 26 have joined APC with their governors , increasing the number of the APC to 50 . <p> However , the development may not have come to Nigerians as a surprise given the unfolding events in the ruling party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the leadership of the party 's National Chairman , Alhaji Bamanga Tukur . <p> The Onset of Crisis The trouble in the PDP started during the last special convention of the party , where some leaders , led by former Vice-President Atiku Abubakar , Abubakar Baraje and seven governors walked out on President Goodluck Jonathan and other leaders to form the New PDP . In announcing the birth of the splinter group , the leaders had cited the maladministration of PDP that has led to marginalisation of key members , a regime of injustice and violation of key party grundnorm as reasons for their ' redemptive ' rebellion . <p> Months later , five of the seven New PDP governors , tired of the endless peace talks with Jonathan and party leaders , decided to pitch their tent with APC . After a meeting that took place at the Kano Governor 's Lodge in Abuja , the five governors , Rabiu Kwankwaso ( Kano ) , Aliyu Wamakko ( Sokoto ) , Murtala Nyako ( Adamawa ) , Abdulfatah Ahmed ( Kwara ) and Chibuike Amaechi ( Rivers ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sule Lamido ( Jigawa ) and Mu'azu Babangida Aliyu ( Niger ) declined to follow their disenchanted colleagues to the opposition party . They said they would prefer to stay in PDP to see through the negotiations with the party leaders . <p> The cross over thus shot up the number of APC governors from 13 to 18 while PDP 's shrinks to 16 , with All Progressives Grand Alliance ( APGA ) and Labour Party having one governor each . As if that was not enough , last Wednesday , 37 PDP members of the House became members of the APC . Speaking on the why they decided to dumped PDP for APC , Baraje lamented that they did all they could to reconcile with PDP to no avail and blamed the president for allowing the hawks within the presidency and PDP leadership to convince him to abort the last peace meeting that would have brought peace to the party . " <p> " So we have no other option than to formally announce the death and burial of PDP . Day and night , we cried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party from imminent doom but we were conveniently ignored and abused . Now , we have reached the stage that we can only say : " PDP , your sinking ship has been abandoned to you ! You brought this misfortune upon yourself , now you must bear it alone ! " <p> " As for us , we are happy to belong to the APC , where our value is appreciated , where we are made to feel truly wanted , and where we can now join forces with like minds in our struggle to liberate Nigeria from PDP 's misrule , which is soon to end , " he said . <p> However , based on the new configuration , no party currently commands simple majority in the House . This leaves the fate of the leadership of the chamber uncertain . But Jonathan both as the president and PDP national leader has lost his majority in the House and this is the first time a sitting president will do so since the rebirth of democracy in 1999 . The implications for the president 's presidential ambition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The defection of the lawmakers portends bad omen for the PDP leadership of the House as the party could soon lose its members who occupy plum positions due to the changes . Pending any further defection by members of the leadership , House Speaker , Aminu Tambuwal ; Deputy Speaker , Emeka Ihedioha ; House Leader , Mulikat Akande-Adeola ; Chief Whip , Mohammed Bawa ; Deputy Leader , Leo Ogor and Deputy Whip ( What is his first name ? ) Muktar may move over to minority positions unless they join APC . However , unlike others , Tambuwal , who is believed to be bidding his time before he joins others in APC , may retain his position as he is a loyal supporter of Wamakko and he is expected to join his political leader in the opposition party . <p> Implication for Jonathan 's Second Term Political observers believe that with the ongoing political realignment in the country , the journey to 2015 would be a different ball game . Although it was said that the president is still exploring avenues to make amends contrary to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defection , the PDP can no longer be so cocksure of victory in the forthcoming general election as it is wont to before the current political development in the country . <p> In the 2015 general election , APC may enjoy support in Adamawa State despite being the home state of the Tukur as Nyako , who also defected to APC , had asked his supporters to join the APC en masse . With the defection of PDP members in the House of Representatives in the state to APC , PDP 's grip of the state may be shaking . Also , Kano State may be a determining factor in the politics of the North-west region . Like Kaduna , which is the political capital of the North , Kano , with its size and population , will definitely cause a major shake-up , especially when its members in the House of Representatives have decided to move to the APC . With a good synergy between Kwankwaso and his predecessor , Malam Ibrahim Shekarau , if they are able to put aside their political differences in the interest of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state in 2015 . <p> In Sokoto State , Wamakko and his former boss , Attahiru Bafarawa , may join forces together in APC and mobilise support against Jonathan in the city of caliphate during the 2015 elections . Also in Kwara State , now that the Saraki political machine has been moved to APC by Senator Bukola Saraki , PDP may find it difficult to retain the state in 2015 . The defection would no doubt have serious implications on how Jonathan would be able to overcome the challenges to get a second term in office in 2015 . <p> Lawmakers , Others React But to Hon. Henry Ofongo who represents Southern Ijaw Federal Constituency of Bayelsa State , the home country of the president , PDP still leads the National Assembly . " As far as I am concerned , PDP is not a party in disarray . It is intact . In a party people can have misunderstanding . It is normal in politics that when you come as a union of people from different backgrounds , different ethnicity , different religions , it is normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you people understand yourselves , how you handle whatever misunderstanding , you come together and work as a team , " he said . <p> Also speaking on the development , Lagos-based human rights activist , Yinka Odumakin , who is also the Publicity Secretary of Afenifere , said there would definitely be legal battle ahead as the defections raise some constitutional issues that only the court can resolve . <p> " Politically , we are going to see overheating of the polity as APC will use their numbers to continually harass the president . The whole project is a clear gang up and the effects would be serious , " he said . But to a former governorship candidate in Lagos State , Mr. Jimi Agbaje , the development will engender a robust debate , " I will leave legal implications to the lawyers . But politically , we will have more robust debates at the National Assembly . The executive would need to work closer with other minority parties to get its bills through . Greater participation of the polity would also be encouraged because the executive would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leader . Hon. Samson Osagie ( APC , Edo ) , said it was too early in the day to start celebrating as the process had not been consummated yet . But he hailed the defection as a good development for the polity . <p> The pan-Northern socio-cultural organisation , Arewa Consultative Forum ( ACF ) , also expressed its support for the defection of PDP lawmaker to APC , describing it as a healthy development towards the emergence of a viable alternative platform for the polity , considering the fact that democracy without viable opposition is a sham . ACF , however , expressed hope that the unfolding political dynamics would lead to the evolution of two political parties , which are far-sighted , surefooted and resolute in their determination to promote democracy premised on triple foundation of liberty , justice and common decency , needed for the development and growth of the country 's democracy . <p> For Mr. Clem Aguiyi , a political analysts and consultant , the defection by some PDP members in the House of Representatives to the APC , is good for Nigeria 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the PDP once enjoyed was not in their favour , because the numbers was a " foolish majority . " <p> He said : " There was a time the PDP had the majority of seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate , but what were they able to achieve with that number of lawmakers ? In my view , they had a foolish majority ; a majority whose members were largely opposing their own government . The new shift in balance is good and should make the PDP to sit up . " He explained that the implication of the defection would make the 2015 general election an exciting and intriguing one . " It will make the political landscape exciting and democratically interesting . I believe our democracy is evolving . Now , let the politicians sought themselves out . If in 2015 APC defeats the ruling PDP , then it is good for our democracy . " <p> Please leave your comment below . Your name will appear next to your comment .
