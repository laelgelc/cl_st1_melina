If all of the pro-democracy Election Committee members participate in the campaign , they can nominate -- at most -- two candidates . <p> In 2013 , Tai founded the Occupy Central campaign to engage the public in designing an electoral system based on universal suffrage , as the government was about to prepare a political reform package . Different political groups then campaigned for their ideas on universal suffrage , with the idea of " public nomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most support in an unofficial plebiscite . <p> Despite demands for greater electoral freedom , Beijing held that a 1,200-member nomination committee would vet candidates before a popular vote . The decision eventually led to the 79-day pro-democracy Occupy protests . <p> Under the new plan , pro-democracy Election Committee members will consider nominating a candidate who meets three criteria : They must receive 37,790 nominations -- representing one per cent of the electorate -- from the general public ; they must promise to push through a political reform package not based on Beijing 's decision in 2014 ; and they must promise to defend the city 's core values . <p> Around 80 out of 325 pro-democracy Election Committee members have joined the campaign , HKU legal scholar and an Election Committee member Eric Cheung Tat-ming said . He believes it will win support from more than 150 members . <p> Members of the public will be able to cast their " vote " between February 7 and 22 in an electronic system jointly run by HKU Public Opinion Programme and the Polytechnic University 's Centre for Social Policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the four publicly declared candidates , and anyone else who wants to contest in the poll , Tai said . <p> The organisers will then hold a public event on February 25 for candidates to debate their platforms and for members of the public to discuss whom to nominate . The idea is similar to the " deliberation day " event organised by Tai in 2014 , during which participants formulated and discussed their ideal electoral systems . <p> Lawmaker " Long Hair " Leung Kwok-hung indicated his intention on Sunday to participate in the poll . He said he would only consider whether to run for chief executive after securing the required number of public nominations . <p> ' Lesser evil ' <p> Some pan-democrats have attracted criticism for hinting that they may nominate former finance secretary John Tsang , whom they consider to be a " lesser evil .

Malay Muslims who make up the majority in of the three provinces have resented what they see as an imposition of Buddhist culture for decades . After a nationalist military junta seized power in 1932 , Thailand passed the " National Culture Act ' ' to press a uniform culture on the country . Lessons taught in local Jawi script were switched to Thai , and Muslim courts were replaced by civil courts , sparking resistance . Sapae-ing was educated in local Islamic schools before departing for Mecca , Saudi Arabia , to study Islamic law in 1964 . After his return , he swiftly established himself as a theologian .

Older Americans are divided , but Trump 's base lies among those above the age of 45 . <p> On issue after issue , younger voters will reject Trump , viewing him as a politician of the past , not the future . <p> Of course , these are averages , not absolutes . Yet the numbers confirm the generational divide . <p> According to exit polls , Trump received 53 percent of the votes of those 45 and older , 42 percent of those 30-44 , and just 37 percent of voters 18-29 . <p> In a 2014 survey , 31 percent of millennials identified as liberals , compared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the survey ) and only 18 percent of the silent generation ( 69 and above ) . <p> The point is not that today 's young liberals will become tomorrow 's older conservatives . <p> The millennial generation is far more liberal than the baby boomers and silent generation were in their younger years . <p> They are also decidedly less partisan , and will support politicians who address their values and needs , including third-party aspirants . <p> There are at least three big differences in the politics of the young and old . <p> First , the young are more socially liberal than the older generations . For them , America 's growing racial , religious , and sexual plurality is no big deal . <p> A diverse society of whites , African-Americans , Hispanics , and Asians , and of the native-born and immigrants , is the country they 've always known , not some dramatic change from the past . <p> They accept sexual and gender categories -- lesbian , gay , trans , bi , inter , pan , and others -- that were essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Trump 's ) generation . <p> Second , the young are facing the unprecedented economic challenges of the information revolution . <p> They are entering the labor market at a time when market returns are rapidly shifting toward capital ( robots , artificial intelligence , and smart machines generally ) and away from labor . <p> The elderly rich , by contrast , are enjoying a stock market boom caused by the same technological revolution . <p> Trump is peddling cuts in corporate taxes and estate taxes that would further benefit the elderly rich ( who are amply represented in Trump 's cabinet ) , at the expense of larger budget deficits that further burden the young . <p> Indeed , the young need the opposite policy : higher taxes on the wealth of the older generation in order to finance post-secondary education , job training , renewable-energy infrastructure , and other investments in America 's future . <p> Third , compared to their parents and grandparents , the young are much more aware of climate change and its threats . <p> While Trump is enticing the older generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have none of it . <p> They want clean energy and will fight against the destruction of the Earth that they and their own children will inherit . <p> Part of the generational divide over global warming is due to the sheer ignorance of many older Americans , including Trump , about climate change and its causes . <p> Older Americans did n't learn about climate change in school . They were never introduced to the basic science of greenhouse gases . <p> That is why they are ready to put their own short-term financial interests ahead of the dire threats to their grandchildren 's generation . <p> In a June 2015 survey , 60 percent of those aged 18-29 said human activity was causing global warming , compared with just 31 percent of those 65 and older . <p> A survey released in January found that 38 percent of American survey respondents 65 and older favored fossil-fuel expansion over renewable energy , compared with only 19 percent of those 18-29 . <p> He favors tax cuts for the older rich , which would burden the young with higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of student debt . <p> He is reprising the 1990s NAFTA debate over free trade , rather than facing the far more important 21st-century jobs challenge posed by robotics and artificial intelligence . <p> And he is obsessed with squeezing a few more years of profit out of America 's coal , oil , and gas reserves at the cost of a future environmental catastrophe . <p> One might attribute Trump 's backward-looking mindset to his age . At 70 , Trump is the oldest person ever to become president ( Ronald Reagan was slightly younger when he took office in 1981 ) . <p> Yet age is hardly the sole or even the main factor here . Bernie Sanders , certainly the freshest mind of all the 2016 presidential candidates and the hero of millennial voters , is 75 . <p> The young are enchanted with Pope Francis , 80 , because he puts their concerns -- whether about poverty , employment difficulties , or vulnerability to global warming -- within a moral framework , rather than dismissing them with the crass cynicism of Trump and his ilk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not chronological age . Trump has the shortest time horizon ( and attention span ) of any president in historical memory . <p> And he is utterly out of touch with the real challenges facing the young generation as they grapple with new technologies , shifting labor markets , and crushing student debt . <p> A trade war with Mexico and China , or a tragically misconceived ban on Muslim migrants , will hardly meet their real needs . <p> Trump 's political success is a blip , not a turning point . Today 's millennials , with their future-oriented perspective , will soon dominate American politics . <p> America will be multiethnic , socially liberal , climate conscious , and much fairer in sharing the economic benefits of new technology . <p> Too many observers remain fixated on the traditional party divides in the US Congress , not on the deeper demographic changes that will soon be decisive . <p> Sanders nearly captured the Democratic nomination ( and would likely have triumphed in the general election ) with a platform appealing powerfully to the millennials . <p> Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support in 2020 . <p> Jeffrey D.

In the Hong Kong Civil Service , decisions like that must be difficult to make without referring to the boss but the boss was a candidate so , in terror of being faulted later , the question was put to the mob by a nail polished hand sliding each ballot paper under an overhead projector , in a way not seen since many years back before Powerpoint . <p> Photo : HKFP . <p> The returning officer had quite forgotten about the angry and the loonies . There were signs of trouble with the third ballot paper which had been stamped over with a plague of ticks . The elector mob was amused .

Although thousands watching the wall-to-wall TV broadcast might have shared this reaction to the hall full of plutocratcs , placemen , cronies and crooks , who among them would have done it ? A closet Trotskyite in the DAB ? A pro democrat putting his ballot to better use than John Tsang ? A property developer doodling ? <p> A protest ballot which features the character for " fuck " .

The official threat level has been lowered from " critical ' ' the highest level , meaning an attack may be imminent to " severe , ' ' which means the government believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remain ready to deploy if needed . The end of the military role came after Manchester Police said they had released a man who was arrested in the concert bombing investigation without charging him . Police said the 21-year-old was set free Wednesday night . His name was not released . Ten men are being questioned in custody about possible roles in the blast . All were arrested on suspicion of violating the Terrorism Act . They have not been identified or charged . Six people , including a woman , have been released without being charged. -AP

@@18829230 <h> Behind the CFA program <p> CFA Institute made global headlines in early May when it announced that financial technology ( fintech ) would be added to the CFA exam curriculum in 2019 . We were surprised by the media interest -- after all , we have been talking about this topic for some time , particularly in Asia . Readers of this column know we write regularly about blockchain , big data , and fintech . <p> A key part of our job as a global member organisation is to stay abreast of topics that impact the industry we serve . So , the media 's interest in our taking a prospective view on investment trends made us think there is a gap in perception -- at least in the media 's knowledge -- in how CFA exam development and industry practice are linked . So , this is an appropriate time to debunk any myths , talk about what 's changed , and share insights about Asia 's role in global exam development . <p> Our practice analysis , curriculum development , and exam development teams number nearly 90 colleagues and are supported by almost 1,000 volunteers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consortiums , and task forces . They are graders , board and committee members of local CFA societies , and are both experts and practitioners in their respective fields . Volunteers are critical to maintaining the global relevance of the CFA program . <p> At the heart of exam development is what we call global practice analysis . Its purpose ? To identify the knowledge , skills , and competencies that are essential to competent performance of investment management professionals . <p> The global practice analysis process <p> In-depth discussions take place with investment industry professionals about their job roles and professional practices . <p> Scholarly research and academic theory is shared from university faculty participants . <p> The back story <p> Before we dive deeper into what happens in global practice analysis , let me provide some context . First , we have the global body of investment knowledge , or GBIK , which covers the range of knowledge investment management professionals should know over the course of their career . It 's a substantial amount of information -- the outline alone is 18,350 words and 85-plus pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , R2 and heteroskedasticity ; to the role of central banks , and the cost of regulation . It forms the basis of our continuing education , publications , conferences , and the CFA exam . <p> Relevant sections of the GBIK become the CFA program 's candidate body of knowledge , or CBOK , which represents the core skills , knowledge and abilities used in practice in a generalist context . CFA program candidates must master this knowledge to pass all three levels of the exam . It is knowledge expected by industry employers at the early stages of a CFA charterholder 's career . The CBOK covers ten main domains -- from fixed income to ethics -- and dozens of sub-topics . Each level of the exam has six volumes of study materials , readings , learning outcome statements , reading questions , and more ( see table ) . Becoming a CFA is not for the faint-hearted . <p> Global practice analysis <p> The process of including a topic in the CFA program curriculum and eventual testing starts quite simply : do practitioners throughout the world deem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world change at different rates , as does our global practice analysis process . Simply put , global practice analysis is the vetting and validation process of what 's taking place in finance and the investment industry , and is a critical link in the continual evolution of the exam . <p> So how does it work ? <p> First , we listen . We listen very carefully to what the industry says . The industry -- collectively CFA charterholders , non-charterholder practitioners , employers , academics , and regulators -- is the foundation for global practice analysis . <p> We do this through surveys and face-to-face panels and discussions held throughout the world . Volunteers assess the CBOK vertically -- knowledge needed across domain topics ( e.g. , equities ) -- and horizontally ( an in-depth discussion of a specific topic , e.g. , fundamental analysis ) . Given the global nature of the exam and our candidate base ( some 49% of candidates registered for the June 2017 exam are from Asia Pacific ) , participants from Asia Pacific today represent 30% of global practice analysis sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 17% in full fiscal year 2016 ( fiscal year is from September 1 through to August 31 ) . <p> Second , relevance on a global scale is critical to the CFA exam . Authors and curriculum reviewers ensure the language , culture , and practices that are tested are unbiased and fair to candidates worldwide . We consider carefully the global candidate experience . For example , if English is your second language , do you read the questions differently from a candidate who is a native English speaker ? <p> To further ensure fairness , we take the " show on the road " and hold global review meetings outside of North America . This process ensures cultural sensitivity , confirms correct answers , and vets whether there are any regulations , commercial practices , legal frameworks -- at a local level -- that could make a question and/or answers flawed . A flawed answer is when there is more than one correct answer ( Note to readers : I wanted to share a sample for this article but was told no by the director of exam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " testable content " ) . <p> Third , we have checks and balances in place at every step of the exam development process . One of the most important gatekeepers is the education advisory committee ( EAC ) . The EAC takes the insights and suggestions from global practice analysis and , in consultation with CFA Institute staff , is responsible for recommending additions , deletions and modifications to curriculum materials and , by proxy , the CFA exam . In 2016 , the EAC weighed global practice analysis input across several topics , including : <p> Alternatives : Private equity coverage should be expanded ; hedge funds and hedge fund strategies should have deeper coverage , include the evolving liquid alts space . <p> The output of the EAC then goes to the test specification task force ( TSTF ) , which uses a decision-rule model to decide what changes will be made . The TSTF is a group of 15 global industry experts -- all charterholders -- with the exception of academics . <p> Call to action <p> If you have domain expertise and are interested in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please go to www.cfainstitute.org and navigate to &gt; Community &gt; Volunteer &gt; Resources . 
@@18829232 <h> Embracing the winds of change <p> In the last year alone , markets have seen unprecedented movement influenced by factors such as Brexit and the election of US President Donald Trump , and it seems as though nothing can be truly anticipated anymore . Rising political tensions in Asia , with an increasingly aggressive North Korea , the steep devaluation of the Chinese renminbi and the usual volatility in emerging markets , have all translated into a riskier environment . There is also the issue of the so-called Terrible T -- technology -- which has been disrupting all industries . Is this therefore time for asset managers to become nimbler , or will they choose to fight against the current ? <p> Downward pressure on fees has also affected the revenue pool of asset managers . Changing investor preference from seeking huge payoffs to more sustainable returns has also sparked some soul-searching amongst the managers . Looking to address these key industry issues were the panellists and presenters at Asia Asset Management 's ( AAM ) 7th Annual Malaysia Roundtable , held in Kuala Lumpur on May 24 , 2017 . <p> The conference , themed Institutional Investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attended by over 150 industry professionals from all over Asia . The participants came from a wide range of players across the industry -- from government-linked institutions such as Malaysia 's Employees Provident Fund ( EPF ) to corporate giants such as Canada 's Manulife Asset Management . <p> The event kicked off with opening remarks by Tan Lee Hock , the founder and publisher of AAM , who relayed to the audience the dramatic changes currently facing the asset management industry , marked by a new phase of global consolidation which is sure to have an impact on how the money management sector moves ahead in coming years . He said the pensions industry is also seeing an interesting phase in its development , with the need to address an aging society worldwide . Asia 's pensions industry in particular is experiencing a sea change in the way it manages long-term risk and tackles the issue of longevity . <p> Mr. Tan thanked the event 's partners -- Kenanga Investors , Manulife Asset Management , Nuveen-TIAA , Stradegi , NUS Business School 's Centre for Asset Management Research &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handing over the microphone to the first speaker of the day , Amy Muska O'Brien , managing director and head of responsible investments at TIAA Investments , an affiliate of Nuveen . <p> Responsible investing <p> Entitled How ESG Impacts Investment Decisions and Returns , Ms. O Brien 's presentation shone an optimistic light on the current state of play in environmental , social and governance ( ESG ) investing , demonstrating that the sector is no longer considered niche or specialised , and has begun to make an impact on the mainstream investment landscape . <p> According to the United Nations-backed Principles for Responsible Investments ( UNPRI ) , there is currently US$62 trillion in AUM committed globally to ESG initiatives , and the motivations for institutional and individual investors to delve into ESG investing are incredibly diverse . Ms. O'Brien said that institutional investors in particular entered the ESG space for client-defined solutions , and a significant number of companies are beginning to realise that ESG investing is a better risk management tool because it considers long-term value drivers . <p> Growing requirements on the policy side has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information disclosure . This , coupled with voluntary disclosure standards led by industry associations such as the US-based Social Accountability Standards Board ( SASB ) , has increased pressure amongst asset owners to lean on their asset managers in terms of compliance and transparency . <p> Globally , sustainability themes such as the Paris accord on climate change is driving the push for greater regulations and setting carbon emission goals . Pension funds , Ms. O'Brien said , are also looking to partner with asset managers to adhere to new global regulatory requirements on ESG incorporation . <p> In Asia , there has been notable progress on the ESG front , with countries such as Hong Kong , Japan , Singapore , Malaysia and South Korea enacting ESG stewardship codes since 2014 , and an increasing number of stock exchanges providing issuers with guidance on how to report on ESG . Ms. O'Brien said that although the field of ESG investing has expanded dramatically , there is a need for greater buy-in amongst analysts , global dialogue , and partnerships , as well as better alignment of disclosure standards . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day was a question-and-answer ( Q&amp;A ) with chief executive officers ( CEOs ) , entitled The Changing Dynamics in Asset Management , Outlook and Challenges . The panel comprised Ismitz Matthew De Alwis , executive director and CEO of Kenanga Investors ; Jason Chong , CEO of Manulife Asset Management ; Sharizad Juma'at , CEO of RHB Islamic Asset Management Services ; Simon England-Brammer , senior managing director and head of Asia Pacific at TIAA Global Asset Management ; and Praveen Jagwani , CEO of UTI International . They discussed a gamut of issues within the asset management industry , from the emerging trend of global consolidation , to diminishing fees for active managers and the rise of robo-advisers . <p> On the topic of consolidation as a result of increased downward pressure on fees , Mr. Jagwani believes that the issue is structural , and will persist as a result of the current low interest rate and low-yielding environment . <p> " There are two kinds of asset managers , the big boys and the boutiques . Bigger asset managers tend to drift towards the mean and ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you 're a small player you do n't have pricing power . Overall , fees are fast disappearing and the advancements in machine learning , fintech financial technology , blockchain etc. only means that it fees will continue to go down . It is here to stay , " he said . <p> Adding to Mr. Jagwani 's comments , Mr. De Alwis said that although there is a downside to the structural change in the pressure on fees , it is an opportunity to promote transparency amongst asset managers . <p> According to some industry observers , investors are increasingly looking at passive management when it comes to portfolio management . To this , Ms. Sharizad commented : " It is the nature of investors -- be it retail or institutional , to lean more towards high-yielding alpha , and it will take time for the market to appreciate and embrace passive management . The retail markets in particular are looking for higher yield , which for now can only be delivered via active management . " <p> Mr. England-Brammer added : " From an internal perspective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this comes back to fees as well . If a good , long-term sustainable alpha-generating manager can deliver , then fees can be applied to that . I think it 's also interesting how we 've seen a development within the beta arena and there 's lots of focus around the ever-growing drive around smart beta and the active end of beta management . So there 's a new asset class that 's grown within the beta space as well . " <p> The panellists also addressed the issue of compliance and rising costs , and all agreed that it is a price worth paying . " I think the real benefit only comes when something goes wrong and it 's important to have it in place , especially when you do a post mortem . It definitely increases the cost of doing business for us but it is a necessary development , " Mr. Chong said . <p> As for the growing influence of technology in the asset management space , Mr. Jagwani stated that although it is inevitable , and might involve cuts in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shorter settlement cycles . " That means there 's a tremendous scope for optimisation of that cost for asset managers . So , there is hope , " he said . <p> Mr. Chong also shared his thoughts on fintech , saying that it is here to stay and should be embraced for the betterment of the industry . " It will open up a new market in terms of the mass affluent market -- which sits between basic retail investors and high-net-worth individuals , and tapping this market going forward will create a lot of opportunities . All these tools will enhance the adviser interaction and help them sell their products/ funds , and basically supplement their efforts . As we know , investments in Malaysia and Asia are still generally sold and not bought , and investors still want human interaction . " <p> Indian outlook <p> The panel discussion was followed by a presentation on India 's Economic Transformation and Investment Opportunities by Rana Gupta , senior portfolio manager , India equity specialist at Manulife Asset Management ( Singapore ) . In his presentation , Mr. Gupta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying that the country 's economic transformation marks the dawn of a new era . " GDP is picking up , inflation has come down , and the government is spending more on infrastructure , but not at the cost of fiscal growth . Although historically , credit penetration in India has been very low because people do not have transaction histories , no identification cards , and therefore can not access banks and get credit , this is set to change as credit prices fall . " <p> Tomorrow 's world <p> The second panel discussion of the day covered pensions and explored important topics such as financial literacy and investor education . Chaired by AAM 's Mr. Tan , the panel comprised Nurhisham Hussein , head of the economics and capital markets department of the Employees Provident Fund ; Dr. Chung Tin Fah , associate professor at HELP University 's ELM Graduate School ; and Dr. Joseph Cherian , practice professor of finance and director of the Centre for Asset Management Research and Investments ( CAMRI ) at NUS Business School . <p> Asked about what constitutes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The average retiree is looking for some sort of level payout to help them maintain their standard of living and include some leisure . This payout should therefore grow at the cost of living -- which as we know , is going up in Asia -- and should grow at the rate of inflation , or some measure of inflation . It should also last for as long as you live . Therefore , the programme should be a prudent one , at least for the safety net amount of savings . " <p> On financial literacy , Mr. Nurhisham was candid in his opinion : " The Malaysian person 's level of financial literacy is roughly about the same as the global average -- which is terrible . When you start talking about interest rates , compounding returns , inflation , a lot of people still have no idea what 's going on . What the Employees Provident Fund ( EPF ) is doing , in collaboration with the Securities Commission of Malaysia and Bank Negara Malaysia , is to promote financial literacy . The ( Malaysian ) government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secondary school curriculum , whilst amongst banks , including the EPF , we are basically repurposing our counter staff to become financial advisors ... whereby we take them through the whole financial planning process . " <p> Dr. Chong also said that it is important that retirees are able to generate a stream of income from their existing assets , for example in the form of an annuity or rental income . " It is very rare that people would want to employ an older person , so it is crucial that they are able to monetise their assets in such a way that they are generating income . " <p> " The passive market has grown , bringing efficiency into the market . Investors are also gaining beta exposure from ETFs and more asset owners are moving buyout funds in-house . As the front office and products become more complex , the back office and middle office have to evolve to support the front office . " He added that : " In a nutshell , asset owners are starting to look like asset managers as they become increasingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mr. Jamwal also cited the Canada Pension Plan as an example of a good pension fund model : " Its independence from the government limits interference in its operations . It also has a well-diversified portfolio -- domestically and internationally across asset allocations , significant liquid investments , a strong emphasis on cost mitigation and a strong investment committee board made up of seasoned investment professionals . " <p> Absolute returns <p> Following Mr. Jamwal 's presentation , the afternoon session of the event began with a discussion on Absolute Returns : The way forward . The panel comprised Akhter Abdul Manan , group chief investment officer of MNRB Holdings ; Sharifatu Laila Syed Ali , group CEO of ValueCAP ; and Teh Yeow Yong , investment director at Navis Capital . <p> Commenting on relative returns , Ms. Sharifatu Laila explained that it all boils down to realised returns , and that managers need to first understand the changing balance of power . " We as asset managers need to know what kind of client we are dealing with . These are asset owners who are looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So that is one of the few things that is key to an absolute return strategy . Additionally , the current environment is becoming more challenging as regulators ramp up the pressure , and despite the low-yield environment , the pressure to deliver on returns remains strong , particularly in Asia . " <p> Touching on absolute return strategies , Mr. Akhter said that according to conventional wisdom , it generally has to be unconstrained . " In this environment , it is interesting to see how this applies to domestic fixed-income mandates . In terms of unconstrained versus constrained portfolios , it is relative straightforward . However , if it 's a fund that has a mixture of asset classes like fixed income , you can add equity , bonds , property , and cash . So what I find is that fixed income is the anchor in the portfolio , and you can use your cash to control the volatility and risk . That will help to give you a consistent return . " <p> ESG revisited <p> As the main theme of the conference was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the trend of ESG investing was revisited in the latter part of the day . This time , Madhu Gayer , head of investment analytics for Asia Pacific at BNP Paribas Securities Services , approached the topic from the perspective of a custodian , covering how to measure , monitor and implement ESG strategies while extracting value . His presentation revolved mainly around BNP Paribas ' recently launched global ESG survey , in which it was found that growth is expected to occur by up to 50% over the next two years on the back of increased commitment from clients and investors alike . <p> He said that Asia Pacific investors would be the regional ESG champions , moving ahead as jurisdictions such as Malaysia increase activity in the shariah compliant space , which already incorporates ESG principles . " Growth will come from alternatives such as private debt , private equity and infrastructure , as opposed to classic public markets , " he said . <p> According to Mr. Gayer , the challenges that the sector will face in coming years include analytics -- where the data that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- as well as a lack of expertise , especially with regards to quantitative analysis . However , he added that groups such as the CFA Institute and the UNPRI are encouraging the development of expertise by providing relevant courses . " ESG is here to stay , it is growing significantly , and will have massive repercussions in Asia . " <p> Global macro view <p> Dr. Enzio von Pfeil , group economist and director at Odyssey Capital Group , was up next with a presentation titled Global Macro View : Risks and Opportunities . He said that there are essentially four different themes globally : the economic clock , defence , demography , and education . <p> " The economic clock involves pattern predictions and helps you tell the economic time when you look at business cycles and profit cycles . " He added that there is a so-called demographic dividend , meaning that young people are good for economic growth because they are more productive . He also made the link between defence , demography and education , explaining : " Social unrest is a function of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is prevalent in Southeast Asia , and it is also closely related to demography , and most certainly education . " <p> Active vs. passive <p> Jason R. Toussaint , managing partner at Hard Asset Partners followed , engaging in a lively Q&amp;A session with AAM 's Mr. Tan on the active versus passive debate . According to Mr. Toussaint , although the debate rages on , he himself is n't entirely sure why . " Basically , the more efficient a market is , the more inclined investors should be to index it . The less efficient , the more alpha an active manager may be able to add . " <p> He also added that there has been growing interest amongst institutions for exchange-traded funds ( ETFs ) . " If it 's a completion strategy or transition mandate it 's great , but institutions that can engage and grant a separate account mandate with an account manager are much better off . It is also good to have direct control and access to the portfolio manager . Investors can also add alpha and have direct ownership of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to devote their proxies for them . ETFs are also much more tax efficient . " <p> Investing in ASEAN <p> The final panel session , which concluded the roundtable , was a general discussion on investing in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( ASEAN ) , with Lee Sook Yee , chief investment officer at Kenanga Investors ; Dr. Tan Chong Koay , founder and executive chairman/ chief strategist at Pheim Asset Management ; and Lim Suet Ling , executive director and CEO of UOB Asset Management . <p> The panel concluded that the wide disparity between the ten current ASEAN countries -- in terms of income distribution , fiscal policy , market sophistication and infrastructure development -- could pose a challenge to unifying the regional grouping on a single platform . <p> " There are plenty of opportunities , but in terms of regulation and policy , there 's a need to get our act together . With regards to the ASEAN-10 , you have the very developed Singapore and Brunei , and the developing Indo-strategist China side . The difference in that is 50 years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 
@@18829236 <h> A green pioneer <p> I was in Tokyo to attend a conference on responsible investing in the last week of April this year . The meeting was in the confines of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in Nihonbashi district , and the entrance to the meeting hall -- off the back of the storied building -- took a while to locate . After going through the mandatory security screening , I took the escalator to the first floor . As I proceeded to the main meeting room after going through the registration process , I thought the room was a little too narrow and long , making it a challenge for participants seated at the back to view the presentations . <p> But I was not there to listen to most of the presentations that day ; I was there to meet Michael Jantzi , the chief executive and founder of Sustainalytics , a firm that provides environmental , social and governance ( ESG ) and corporate governance research . I had heard of him previously but had not had the opportunity to meet him in the flesh until now . <p> As the firm celebrates its 25th anniversary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more about the founder and his motivations for setting up the business . <p> I met Mr. Jantzi outside the meeting room and , along with a Tokyo colleague , James Hawrylak , we ended up in a small room where stock exchange staff have their coffee breaks . <p> So how did he get his start in the business ? <p> " My original intention was to work for the Canadian foreign office as I wanted to be a diplomat , " he says . But when that did not work out , he started looking elsewhere and at that time , he was already fascinated with investments and business in general . <p> Then one day , he heard a radio interview . " That changed my life , " he says . He explains : " It was interviewing people about this thing that was called ethical investing at that time , and these issues were important to me . I was not an activist and I did not want to work in civil society and government in particular . And I long believed that corporations were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and we can impact their behaviour through investments and capital flows -- and for me , this was a light bulb that just flashed across my mind . " <p> He did not immediately set up his own firm but eventually did so in 1992 as Jantzi Research in partnership with his wife , who was holding down another job at that time . His aim then was to provide research and insight to clients for them to make investment decisions in line with their mission and values . <p> It was a modest operation , but things began to look up . Shortly after , he signed up three clients -- two asset managers and a pension fund . From then on , it was a case of building up the research capability , and he gradually expanded the research team until the late 1990s . <p> Even so , he knew that he had to provide global coverage given the changing circumstances -- up until then the research focus was wholly Canadian and the US . Instead of establishing his own international footprint , which would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eventually teaming up with more than a dozen , including partners in Holland . <p> Significantly , too , at about the same time , pension legislation was evolving . In particular , the UK in 2000 passed a law compelling pension funds to disclose whether or not they were investing based on ESG principles , which kick-started the world of responsible investing . <p> That year also saw the Enron debacle in the US . " We had a governance crisis at that time , " says Mr. Jantzi , " and for the first time , mainstream markets understood that it was not only hardcore financial numbers that could have an impact on shareholder values . " <p> Another milestone in the responsible investing landscape occurred in 2006 when the United Nations ( UN ) published a set of principles for the industry , known as the UN Principle of Responsible Investing ( UNPRI ) , which opened up a whole new set of discussions on the role of fiduciaries . <p> The number of signatories to the UNPRI has since grown from about 100 institutions to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As of end-April 2017 , they collectively managed assets of more than US$62 trillion . <p> Meanwhile , observes Mr. Jantzi , the fiduciary role of pension funds continues to evolve , and discussions are beginning to go beyond ESG integration and into the realm of sustainable development goals . Should pension funds , beyond providing financial security to plan members , also play a role in , for example , ensuring access to health care or improved public infrastructure ? <p> In 2009 , Mr. Jantzi merged his research company with his Dutch partners to form Sustainalytics ; today , the firm has more than 300 employees globally with offices in Canada , the US , the UK , Europe , and Australia . In Asia , the firm established a six-member team in Tokyo last September , in recognition of the growth opportunities in that market . He is the firm 's second largest shareholder after Triodos Bank . There are other institutional shareholders alongside senior employees of the firm . <p> Some excerpts from the interview : <p> Asia Asset Management : How do you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Jantzi : Asia is a big region and I do n't expect these principles to be a force in every country . I am bullish on Japan where we see ESG integration gaining traction , and it will only expand in the years ahead given the lead taken by the GPIF ( Government Pension Investment Fund ) , and by extension the government . <p> If one were to look at ESG adoption in the developed markets , one sees that ESG is included in a broad and diverse range of asset classes -- in equity , fixed income , real estate , private equity , infrastructure and others . <p> In Japan , ESG integration is largely in equities but I see that changing as asset owners look to expand into fixed income and other asset classes . The Development Bank of Japan is moving into real estate and infrastructure . In other markets ( such as Hong Kong ) , asset owners there have been slow in embracing ESG even though they are on the radar . There are few ESG funds in the territory . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing for ESG ? <p> From the investment perspective , these are still early days . However , China is a big player in the market for green bonds , and depending on what metric one uses to measure market share , it accounts for between a quarter to a third of total green bond issuance . China has also taken the lead in G20 working groups on areas like climate change . India is not on our radar at the moment given the early stages of development there . <p> The National Pension Service in Korea , the world 's third largest pension fund , has had some issues with governance following a scandal last year . How do you view this particular issue ? <p> It was certainly a disappointment for the ESG community at large and a setback for corporate transparency and pension governance . I certainly hope that some valuable lessons can be learnt from this particular episode and that it will act as a catalyst for change . <p> Australia embraced the ESG agenda earlier than most markets in the region . What 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , asset owners quite early on recognised the value of integrating these issues into investment decisions ; it was also interesting that they saw the value of competing with each other in that market .

Therefore ASEAN 's exports to China and the US will be weakened as a result of over-production in China and weakening consumer demand in the US . <p> On the other hand , China will look to expand its economic leadership through regional development under its One Belt , One Road initiative , and will likely try to move ahead with its own regional free trade deal -- the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership ( RCEP ) -- which excludes the US . <p> How can ASEAN countries take advantage of new trade , urbanisation , technology and sustainability trends ? <p> ASEAN countries have established a platform called ASEAN Economic Community ( AEC ) . The purpose of establishing an integrated economic community is to accelerate economic growth , enhance trade development in the region , and allow freer movement of goods , services , skilled labour , and capital . <p> ASEAN is strategically located at the intersection of global flows . Intraregional trade in goods is likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the global economy will augur well for overall economic growth in the ASEAN region . <p> Economic integration provides opportunities to boost economic stability in the region . This would likely turn ASEAN into a more competitive region within the world economy . A stronger regional economy will help to improve living standards of the ASEAN population by reducing poverty through economic development . <p> ASEAN member countries expect to achieve greater economic cooperation in the areas of financial policies , trade , and human capital . AEC integration will also serve to promote goods and services , investment , labour mobilisation , and mobilisation of capital . The ASEAN region could potentially become a highly competitive economic union operating as a single market . ASEAN also intends to improve regional agricultural and industrial utilisation , as well as expand trade , and improve transportation and infrastructure . <p> Does corporate behaviour and governance impact a nation 's brand ? <p> A powerful and good reputation , or " nation-brand , " is important for the sustainability of a country 's economy in the long run . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , investors , and immigrants . <p> In the context of nation branding , corporates have greater influence on a country 's brand than just the export of goods and services ; it makes a significant difference to perceptions of a country like Germany when it comes to cars , or Japan for electronics . <p> Consumers are slowly recognising South Korea as one of the most important beauty trendsetters , not only in Asia , but the world . South Korea is now recognised for homegrown skincare and cosmetic brands . There are many companies in Korea that have attained world-class standards in this sector , including AmorePacific which expanded overseas and marketed a positive brand name for the country . Samsung too has had a similar positive impact on the nation brand equity of Korea due to its rapid global rise as a brand , influencing the way global stakeholders view Korea . Singapore Airlines has added lots to the success of Singapore and its global brand equity . The passengers on Singapore Airlines use Singapore 's Changi Airport as a transit hub . <p> Japanese manufacturers such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of their brands , have gained world recognition in quality . Business leaders must have the courage to move from a volume-based manufacturing paradigm towards a customer-value driven purpose . <p> How is ASEAN positioned from an international perspective to boost foreign direct investment ( FDI ) ? What are some of the tax exemptions and incentives the member countries are putting in place to attract it ? <p> FDI is needed in order to boost ASEAN 's domestic driven economy . ASEAN relies heavily on FDI due to the technology gap between ASEAN and North Asian countries . North Asian countries like Japan , Taiwan and Korea are very advanced in terms of technology . Furthermore , ASEAN lacks funding to start mega projects , and therefore relies on FDI . <p> Infrastructure is one of the main attractions to lure FDI into the ASEAN region . ASEAN requires more than US$2.1 trillion in infrastructure spending by 2030 , due to expectations of its urban population rising by more than 90 million . However , the current spending trend would cover only $910 billion ( Source : HSBC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Development Bank in its 2015 ASEAN Investment Report on Infrastructure and Connectivity estimated that the region needs $110 billion per year until 2025 in infrastructure spending ( Source : Forbes : July 8 , 2016 ) . <p> ASEAN countries have also taken measures to improve English language skills , health and safety regulations , as well as intellectual property rights in order to attract FDI . <p> Many ASEAN countries are adopting two types of tax incentives to attract FDI . The tax incentives can be either statutory tax incentives or discretionary tax incentives . For example , discretionary tax incentives such as tax allowance incentives and tax holiday incentives are given to corporates . Statutory incentives , such as reinvestment allowance incentives for manufacturing companies that reinvest capital for expansion , modernisation or automation purposes , are available under the income tax . In addition , double tax deductions such as insurance premiums paid for exports or imports of cargo , R&amp;D expenditure , etc. , are also available . In the space of promoted products , which are initiatives taken by Malaysian Investment Development Authority ( MIDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textiles , basic metal products , electrical and electronics , food , medical devices , petrochemicals and pharmaceuticals , companies manufacturing these products are eligible for temporary reduction or elimination of tax or an investment tax allowance for qualifying capital expenditure . <p> Is economic inclusiveness driving the biggest story in ASEAN ? What are the implications of China 's One Belt , One Road investments in ASEAN ? <p> In a new era of growing protectionism , global trade as a key driver for economic growth in ASEAN is bound to become more subdued , and an enormous challenge in the fight for economic inclusion . <p> The opening up of economic opportunities to previously under-served social groups is integral to development . If people are given a chance to succeed , they are more likely to participate in the workforce , pursue education , or engage in other activities that lead to economic growth . This , in turn , will increase spending power and generate wider public support for economic reforms . Steps must also be taken to ease the use of technology , finance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the free movement of skilled labour . <p> There are many ways of increasing intra-ASEAN trade . Measures are needed to generate greater complementarity in ASEAN economies and boost trade in services . Governments must take further steps to dismantle non-tariff barriers and other hindrances to trade in goods . The ASEAN region also needs to do more to facilitate e-commerce . ASEAN retail internet sales are only 1%-2% of total sales , against over 10% in developed economies . <p> China 's One Belt , One Road ( OBOR ) development agenda to boost connectivity between mainland China and 65 countries in Asia and Europe by building infrastructure ties fits well with the 2010 Master Plan on ASEAN Connectivity . ASEAN countries will be able to tap more than $200 billion in financing resources from policy banks , including the $100 billion China-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank ( AIIB ) , and China 's $40 billion Silk Road Infrastructure Fund ( Source : Business Times : August 12 , 2015 ) . <p> How big a part of the business is RHBAM 's Islamic business , and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> RHBAM 's Islamic business is still small compared with the conventional business . RHBAM 's total assets under management ( as of April 30 , 2017 ) were RM43.4 billion ( US$10.07 billion ) , of which Islamic business constitutes about 15.2% , or RM6.58 billion of total assets under management . <p> Reflecting the demand for Shariah-compliant financial products , the Islamic capital market ( ICM ) in Malaysia grew by a healthy 10% CAGR compound annual growth rate in the last five years , amounting to RM1.7 trillion at end-2016 . Out of this , 64% represented equities while the remainder was accounted for by sukuks or Islamic bonds . The RM1.7 trillion ICM accounts for over 60% of the domestic total capital market , with the proportion set to increase further as demand for Islamic-compliant products rises ( Source : Website of Securities Commission of Malaysia Islamic Capital Market : March 9 , 2017 ) . <p> Assets under management for shariah investment in Malaysia of RM149.6 billion only constitutes 21.5% of total assets under management . Therefore , there is still room for further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Website of Securities Commission of Malaysia Islamic Capital Market : March 9 , 2017 ) . <p> The initiatives of government-linked companies ( GLCs ) such as the Employees Provident Fund ( EPF ) and Kumpulan Wang Persaraan ( KWAP ) to set aside part of pension monies for shariah investment will spur Islamic business in Malaysia , especially the asset management business . For example , EPF has set aside RM100 billion as initial investment in shariah-compliant companies ' stocks with effect from January 1 , 2017 . RHBAM 's Islamic business is a growing segment of the asset management business ( Source : The Star : June 5 , 2016 ) .

The event was presided by Ireland 's first consul general to Hong Kong &amp; Macau , Peter Ryan , who generously co-sponsored the event . <p> Investment opportunities <p> Mr. Chua introduced the background of AWC to the audience -- an organisation established about four years ago for family offices in Southeast Asia to help with their key concerns : generational wealth transfer , tax matters , and charity structures . In support of the Singapore government 's effort to make Singapore a major fintech hub , AWC formed a fintech club to connect investors with start-ups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consisting of experienced industry professionals in Singapore , Hong Kong , Shanghai , and Jakarta . <p> Family offices in Asia have mushroomed with the fast creation of wealth , and AUM of private wealth in Asia has surpassed Europe . Many such family offices are set up to manage the wealth of first-generation entrepreneurs as the trend evolves towards wealth preservation and generational transfer . Compared to their Western counterparts , they take a more hands-on approach in managing their wealth , and increasingly make direct investments in real estate and companies . They have also become more open to non-traditional asset classes -- investing in fintech start-ups which could potentially be highly rewarding in terms of greater financial returns and developing useful technologies for society . <p> The new digital economy 2.0 will present interesting investment opportunities for those who are willing to take risks and also have the financial wherewithal . Worldwide , we are seeing major financial institutions taking a more serious approach to fintech and investing millions to build modern technology capabilities in-house . <p> Meanwhile , there is an increasing number of start-ups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimise the operation and delivery of financial services , such as FinFabrik , DriveWealth and Saxo Markets . " We are living at an exciting AI and robotic age where the advancement of technology will continue to push boundaries and create new investment opportunities , " Mr. Chua said . <p> Investing in start-ups <p> To inform event participants on how to invest in fintech start-ups effectively , Mr. Ban had prepared a presentation about his firm OurCrowd -- one of the world 's largest equity crowdfunding firms based in Jerusalem , Israel , but still a relatively new name within the Asian investor community . <p> OurCrowd was founded by well-known venture capitalist Jon Medved in 2012 to invest in promising Israeli start-ups . It has grown rapidly since then , forming co-investing partnerships with many prominent angel investors , including Eric Schmidt of Google , and multinational corporations such as GE , Honda and UOB . OurCrowd hosted its third investment summit in Jerusalem in February this year , and attracted more than 6,000 attendees from 82 countries , making it the largest equity crowdfunding conference in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2016 , the top five US companies in terms of market cap were all in the technology sector ( Apple , Alphabet , Microsoft , Amazon and Facebook ) -- a very different scene from a decade ago when traditional firms such as Exxon and GE still dominated such ranks . Moreover , for the younger US tech firms , private market returns have far exceeded public market returns ( see chart ) , thus there is a strong case for investing in the private market . <p> OurCrowd seeks to take advantage of this trend by being in the game early , that is , investing in highly promising tech start-ups before they are listed in the public market . For some high net-worth individuals who have the risk appetite but are deterred by the disclosure and regulatory requirements of the public market , this is an attractive alternative asset class . <p> Compared to traditional venture capital firms such as Sequoia Capital , which typically require a high minimum investment amount ( in millions of US dollars usually ) , OurCrowd requires a minimum of only US$10,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investors . However , it is professionally managed and has access to many high-quality potential deals : it reviews over 2,000 companies a year in many areas including AI , cybersecurity , medical technology , etc. , and selects only the top 1%-2% most promising companies after a rigorous due-diligence process . <p> Mr. Lloyd pointed out that while Israel has become an important tech hub in Central Asia , China is the clear fintech leader in Asia Pacific . A 2017 fintech report by KPMG puts five Chinese firms in its list of top ten most innovative fintech firms in the world , including Ant Financial ( 1 ) , Qudian ( 2 ) , Lufax ( 4 ) , ZhongAn ( 5 ) , and JD Finance ( 10 ) . <p> China has one of the most , if not the most , advanced digital payment systems in the world , where its digital payments account for nearly half of the global total . Mr. Lloyd further stressed that it is consumer demand that has driven such advancement in China . Chinese banks have traditionally focussed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paying less attention to the needs of their retail customers . Thus , this created an opportunity for online retail service providers such as Alipay and WeChat Pay to thrive . <p> With their success in the domestic market , some of these Chinese fintech firms with global ambitions are now expanding to overseas markets , and they are eyeing less developed economies with less advanced banking systems where , again , the unfulfilled needs from retail consumers are likely to be substantial . For example , Alibaba 's affiliate Ant Financial made an investment in Philippines-based Mynt , a mobile money provider , earlier this year . <p> It is indeed a great time to be in Asia , a region that is witnessing high growth in both private wealth and fintech development . While the former is forever on the lookout for more interesting asset classes to invest in , the latter is seeking more smart capital for developing technology solutions that could improve the lives of millions of people . An effective matchmaker for the two will ensure that smart money is channelled efficiently to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wealth accumulation and technology advancement will create a golden century in Asia where we will experience many new improvements in our business and social lifestyles . <p> *Dr .

@@18989235 <p> China 's sweeping new Cybersecurity Law ( " the Law " ) came into effect on June 1 amid widespread anxiety from the foreign business community . Many in the private sector were concerned by the Law 's stringent requirements , ambiguous language , and unclear implementation plan . <p> To allay these concerns , the Cyberspace Administration of China ( CAC ) modified the language of certain parts of the Law , and delayed implementation of cross-border data localization provisions until the end of 2018 . While the last minute changes add a degree of clarity to the Law , and give additional time for companies to organize compliance , many of the fundamental issues that concerned foreign companies remained unchanged . <p> As a result , companies with operations or customers in mainland China should review the Law . Professional advisors can help determine whether your business needs to make changes to its business structure to comply with the new Law . <h> Data localization delayed , security reviews reduced <p> Prior to June 1 , rumors circulated in the business community that the authorities would delay the implementation of the Law . Despite the concerns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the authorities , the Law ultimately came into effect on June 1 , 2017 ; the CAC stated that it would publish all supporting implementation guidelines and regulations within a year . <p> However , in a meeting with representatives of foreign businesses and governments , the CAC offered a 19-month grace period for companies to comply with the cross-border data flow requirements . Companies now have until December 31 , 2018 to comply with that part of the Law . <p> The other aspects of the Law , including the controversial security review requirements , are still effective as of June 1 , though authorities removed the provision for automatic security reviews of overseas transfers of 1,000 GB or more by a network operator . The revised draft Measures also state " internal company data transfers will not be subject to a security review if the company does not use its network to commercialize data externally . " This suggests that companies who solely use their networks for internal purposes might not be subject to security reviews . <h> Scope of data localization clarified <p> A Q&amp;A posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ data localization requirements only apply to personal information and/or important data collected or generated by critical information infrastructure ( CII ) operators . This was the language used in the original Law that passed in November 2016 . <p> The draft Measures for the Security Assessment of Personal Information and Critical Data Leaving the Country ( " the Measures " ) , released on April 11 , 2017 , appeared to extend data localization requirements to " network operators " in addition to CII operators . Since an extremely wide swathe of companies could be considered " network operators " with the broad definition used in the Measures , the CAC 's confirmation that the data localization requirements only apply to CII operators is a relief for foreign companies who may have been affected . <p> It should be noted that this clarification appeared in a Q&amp;A posted by the CAC , but does not constitute an official amendment to the Law or the Measures . As such , those who could be considered network operators should await further official updates and announcements before making a final determination about whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions . <p> Although the CAC responded to the confusion surrounding network operators , it did not narrow the vague definition of CII operator . According to the Law , CII operators are entities providing services that , if lost or damaged , could endanger China 's national security , economy , or public interest . <p> Examples provided in the Law include public communications and information services , energy , transportation , water conservancy , finance , public services , and e-government , among others . The State Council will release measures to further define CII operators at a later date . <h> " Important data " and " personal information " clarified <p> The CAC clarified that " important data " will be assessed as data important from the perspective of the state , rather than the perspective of a company or individual . <p> In the draft Guidelines for Cross-border Transfer Security Assessment released on May 27 , 2017 , " important data " is broadly defined as data that can " influence or harm the government , state , military , economy , culture , society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Relevant bureaus are required to further clarify the specifics of what is " important data " within its industry . <p> The expansiveness of this definition , though slightly more detailed than before , does little to allay fears over government access to critical information , such as propriety data and source code , since it leaves considerable room for the government to define " important data " . <p> The revised draft Measures also clarified that " personal information " can be sent outside of China with implied consent , such as by sending an email abroad . Previously , it was unclear whether express consent to export personal data abroad would be needed . <h> Proactive compliance recommended <p> Although businesses have until the end of 2018 to comply with the data localization requirements , and many supporting regulations and guidelines have yet to be finalized or issued , it is recommended that companies proactively take steps to review their exposure to the Law . <p> The CAC recently shut down dozens of celebrity news and gossip accounts on Chinese platforms , such as Sina Weibo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provisions included in the new Law as the basis . Further , the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection criticized the CAC soon after the Law came into effect , stating that it had " for a period not carried out general secretary Xi Jinping 's important instructions and requirements resolutely and promptly enough . " <p> As CAC regulators have already taken steps to enforce the Law , and may be under pressure from higher authorities to swiftly enact them , companies are advised to take proactive steps to comply . Although many of the exact steps to take are unclear thanks to the Law 's ambiguity , a proactive approach demonstrates a willingness to comply with regulators . <p> In the meantime , businesses with operations and customers in China are advised to monitor for further clarifications and supporting measures to the Law . <p> AboutUs <p> China Briefing is published by Asia Briefing , a subsidiary of Dezan Shira &amp; Associates .

The founders of Latize talk about what AI can do today . <h> Right Side Sticky Menu <h> When organizations do n't keep up with marketers <p> Doing marketing today is tough work . After all , modern marketers are expected to play a more direct role in sales , effectively reach and engage customers across multiple traditional and digital channels , and at the same time meet their sky-high expectations despite their fickle brand loyalty . <p> And this is merely the tip of the iceberg , as CMOs and marketing executives grapple to learn and adapt to an ever-evolving landscape awash with new tech-centric tools , metrics and marketing paradigms . <p> Digital competence <p> While training and a positive attitude to change can help , the real solution to getting ahead may entail changing one 's mindset , according to Otto Ruijs , the managing director of Hyper Island in Singapore in an earlier interview with CMO Innovation . <p> Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is for professionals -- and especially marketers , to develop a heightened level of comfort with digitization and experimentation , not just a limited skillset that may become obsolete a few months down the road . <p> " We firmly believe you need a new way of thinking , a new way of problem solving to survive if you want to be a digital marketer , or digital innovation person , " said Ruijs . " If you are able as a digital marketer to kind of change your activities , pivot quickly and in an agile way , that will serve you well , and have that mindset that ' I will not have all the answers ' .

And repeating the problem to yet another company representative at a local outlet . Does this sound familiar to you yet ? <p> Do similar gaps exist within your organization ? What are you doing about them ? <p> The transformed organization <p> The unvarnished truth is that even the best marketers have their hands tied if their organization continues to function as it always had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive outcome without change , going by the popular quote in which Albert Einstein defined insanity as " doing the same thing over and over again , but expecting different results " . <p> Of course , it is easy to point to the CEO or others senior executives for not enabling the needed digital transformation within the organization . Given their unique vantage point and deeper understanding of what digital transformation really entails , however , it would also be irresponsible for marketers to not lead the charge to initiate change . <p> This first appeared in the Q1 2017 issue our CMO Innovation Guide titled " Initiating Digital Transformation " .

@@19372238 <p> An aircraft carrier is whatever a particular navy defines one as . When the Liaoning began her life in a Ukrainian construction yard , the Soviet Navy intended to classify the ship as a " heavy aviation cruiser . " This was done to bypass the Montreux Convention , which prohibited aircraft carriers approximately four times her weight from transiting the Dardanelles ( the straits that separate Europe and Asia in Turkey ) because the ship was clearly an aircraft carrier . For reasons that are not entirely clear , the Japanese have also just built the Hyuga " helicopter destroyer . " <p> Photo : Carrie Lam , via Facebook . <p> Is there anything nefarious about this visit ? <p> While the local PLA Navy garrison has been known to sail through Victoria Harbour during politically tense times , I would not read this port call as having ulterior motives . One of the highlights of my childhood was the yearly air shows held at a nearby naval air station , and I am surprised the PLA does n't open their doors and show off their ships , helicopters , and other hardware more regularly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male ) who love looking at stuff like this . It 's good PR to show off the navy meant to protect Hong Kong . <p> How does the Liaoning compare to other aircraft carriers ? <p> You can compare weight , length , technologies , and how many aircraft the ship can carry side-by-side for comparisons . Many people often compare the Chinese aircraft carrier with the US Navy " supercarriers , " represented by the ten ships of the Nimitz-class and the new Ford-class coming online . By numbers , the Nimitz-class is almost 10 per cent longer , carries 70 per cent more aircraft , and weighs almost twice as much . <p> But these figures are somewhat irrelevant because nobody makes carriers as large as the United States does . The Liaoning is an average-sized modern aircraft carrier by international standards , roughly equivalent to the carriers operated by France , Italy , and Brazil . Except for one French carrier , the United States is the only Navy that uses CATOBAR " cats and traps . " CATOBAR-equipped aircraft carriers use the steam generated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kg from zero to 260 km/h in about a second . <p> Like most non-American carriers , the Liaoning uses the Short Take-Off Arrested Recovery ( STOBAR ) system because its turbine engine ca n't produce steam as nuclear-powered carriers can . STOBAR carriers are identifiable by the ski-jump ramps at the front of the ships . Because aircraft carriers are 1/6th the size of a standard runway , they catch a hook on a wire laid out at the back of the ship . <p> What are the advantages and disadvantages to using ski-jumps instead of catapults ? <p> Using ski-jumps instead of catapults comes with a few advantages , mostly in the form of being cheaper to build and maintain . Theoretically , STOBAR carriers can launch more aircraft more quickly because steam catapults need time to " recharge " after each launch . Ski-jumps also put less wear and tear on the airframe than catapults do , which is one reason US Navy aircraft are more rugged than their US Air Force counterparts . <p> After that , though , there are only disadvantages . A US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load of fuel and weapons , up to 15,400 kg , on either a carrier or a runway . The J-15 can take off with 15,500 kg on land , but can only get 68 per cent of that weight off the Liaoning 's ski-jump . So while the J-15 might an excellent modern jet , to operate it at sea means crews must fly it with less fuel and fewer weapons than they could on land . <p> Photo : Carrie Lam , via Facebook . <p> STOBAR set-ups also mean there is a limited number of aircraft types that can be deployed on a carrier . Though the diversity of aircraft in the US Navy inventory is falling , two decades ago you would see the F-14 interceptor ( shooting down bombers at long range ) , F/A-18 fighter , S-3 Viking anti-submarine aircraft , A-6 Intruder and A-7 Corsair bombers , E-2 Hawkeye AWACS , C-2 Greyhound transport , plus helicopters . These aircraft provide a carrier battlegroup ( CVGB ) better protection and more versatile roles . In contrast , the Liaoning carries only the J-15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an AWACS platform should most concern the PLA Navy . An AWACS , a type of plane with a large radar on top which feeds data back to the strike group while acting as air traffic controller and lookout for threat hundreds of kilometres away . Putting a giant radar on its back and fly it up to look around is a good idea for a carrier battlegroup because radars ca n't see over the horizon . The PLA 's solution is to put a smaller radar on a helicopter , with significantly less altitude , and endurance . <p> Why does China want aircraft carriers ? <p> The Liaoning would not be long for this world in a head-to-head fight against an American carrier battlegroup because the J-15s on the Liaoning would fly into battle with fewer numbers , limited fuel and weapons , and less information about where their enemy is . But is also likely that the PLA never intends to use the Liaoning for combat operations . So why did they build it and why is it in Hong Kong ? <p> The Liaoning in Hong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is threefold : learning , prestige , and projection . Pilots who land on aircraft carriers describe it like landing on a postage stamp in the middle of the ocean . It becomes orders of magnitude more difficult -- and dangerous -- at night and in bad weather . A carrier flight deck is also a dangerous place , with jet engine intakes that can lift an inattentive seaman up and suck him into the turbines when the jet is throttling up for takeoff . All of this takes an enormous amount of training . The Liaoning is commissioned , but it is still conducting what are known as sea trials . Pilots and crews are learning from scratch how to do what the US Navy has been doing for generations . <p> The PLA is also learning how to build aircraft carriers . They started with a rusty hulk of an incomplete ship in a Ukrainian shipyard to find out how the Soviets did it and then improved on many systems . Their second carrier , the unnamed Type 002 , is the first attempt to build a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carriers and are already experimenting with a sort of mag-lev catapult that uses electricity instead of steam . <p> Limited as the Liaoning is , she makes an impact wherever she goes . Depending on the circumstances , carriers can be used to signal prestige or projection . China is building and sailing aircraft carriers now in no small part to signal to the world , " see , we can do that too . " That there was little scientific value in sending taikonauts into space was no reason not to do it . It was a good look ! With military hardware , China is acquiring the trappings of a great power . When the US began mass-producing stealth jet fighters , the PLA built two prototypes of their own . The military potential of the Liaoning is arguably less useful than the " Made for TV " images of seamen put into a deck formation that reads " China Dream , " or " Hong Kong , Ni Hao ! " <p> Finally , there is the issue of projection signalling . The South China Sea today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the US presence often being the most powerful . A three month tour of the sea would make the Liaoning and her escorts the largest force there ( unless a US carrier battlegroup shows up ) . Projecting pretence like that has a measurable impact on how those other navies behave there . The Liaoning is also a card to play to signal possible escalation when other countries are " hurting the feelings " of the Chinese people . <p> Photo : Carrie Lam , via Facebook . <p> Consider the US Navy 's Freedom of Navigation ( FONOP ) exercises . Much to the chagrin of China , they have been sailing destroyers around China 's man-made islands in the South China Sea . It signals US intent and resolve without firing a shot . Sailing the Liaoning into the South China Sea before a FONOP might make the US Navy decide to stand down for a few weeks . It would signal to the US that they might want to bring more ships in because things might get hostile . To which their answer is only to escalate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't deter anyone from getting into a fight with the PLA , but its an important card to play during conflict escalation . <p> Is the Liaoning distracting us from anything else ? <p> Yes , her escort fleet . The PLA Navy has been modernising at an incredible pace . The Liaoning arrived in Hong Kong with two escorts , the most notable being the Type 054D destroyer Yinchuan launched only last year . Overshadowed by the much larger ship , the Type 054D is as well-equipped as the US Navy 's multi-role Arleigh Burke-class destroyers . A formidable anti-aircraft platform , they will make striking the Liaoning and future carriers almost as difficult as hitting a US carrier . <p> The Liaoning in Hong Kong . Photo : Trey Menefee . <p> The Liaoning will soon be sailing with an escort fleet at least as powerful , if not more powerful , than what the Royal Navy will have escorting the HMS Queen Mary .

Results are based on interviews with a regionally-balanced sample of 75 agency-side strategists and executives . Its key findings are : <p> Strategy 's influence has been growing <p> 61% of respondents to the survey said the planning discipline had gained influence within their agency over the past year . 46% said they were becoming more influential for clients . Half also said that their planning teams had grown in headcount in the past year . <p> Joseph Clift , Business Analyst at WARC and the report 's author , said : " The responses to WARC 's global survey suggest that a major driver of the growing influence of planning is the increasing complexity of the marketing landscape . As marketers are faced with an ever-growing number of channels and approaches , strategists are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Fragmentation is a major challenge for the future <p> The survey suggested strategy teams are increasingly made-up of specialists rather than generalists : digital , social , and CRM strategists are on the rise . As a result of this trend , there is a sense that the traditional ' brand planner ' is under threat . Some see the trend as a positive , as it brings more skillsets into planning teams . But some mourn the loss of ' big picture ' strategy . <p> Gareth Kay , Co-Founder of Chapter SF , said in his commentary contained in the WARC report : " We are specialising ourselves into irrelevance . All of this fragmentation in the core role of the planner is creating brands that are fragmented into a million little pieces . " <p> ' Upstream ' opportunities ; ' downstream ' pressure <p> When asked for planners ' biggest future opportunities , the most frequent answer ( cited by 72% of the survey ) was the opportunity to move ' upstream ' by helping clients solve business problems rather than only focusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respondents cited the growing pressure from clients - cost-cutting and the desire for strategists to be involved ' downstream ' in tactical , short-term work - as representing a major threat to the planning discipline 's future . Management consultancies are also increasingly offering strategic marketing services : a trend cited by many survey participants as a threat to the agency planner 's future . <p> Guy Murphy , Worldwide Planning Director of J. Walter Thompson , commented : " What is key is for planning to add value to a client 's business . Planning 's future value will depend upon its ability to show that planning matters . " <p> The strategy team of the future <p> Strategy teams are likely to be hiring and growing , with 53% of survey respondents at creative agencies saying they had increased their team 's headcount in the past year . The skills that respondents say they are looking for are not new - they want intellectually curious people able to distil complex thoughts into human insights . <p> But the survey responses suggest planning teams are increasingly expected to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more quickly than ever before , and collaboration with other teams within the agency , particularly creative teams , is becoming more important than ever . <p> Summing up , David Tiltman , WARC 's head of content , said : " The Future of Strategy report uncovers a discipline that is gaining influence , with marketers increasingly in need of sound advice in a fast-changing industry . But strategists face many future obstacles , including the fragmentation of skillsets , tightening budgets and a growing threat from consultancies .

@@19925239 <p> Companies in China with soon-to-be outdated certification would be wise to put the Five-in-One business license amendment on their upcoming agenda . <p> China 's Five-in-One system combines a business ' tax registration certificate , organization code , business license , social security registration certificate , and statistical registration certificate into a single document with one social credit code . This has made setting up a business in China faster and easier for foreign investors . <p> Businesses without an integrated business license under the Three-in-One or Five-in-One system should now upgrade . The deadline for converting to Five-in-One certification is December 31 , 2017 . Beyond this date , all five certificates held by the company , now encompassed by the Five-in-One system , will be deemed as invalid and cancelled . <p> Companies who hold business licenses under the previous Three-in-One system , which did not include the social security registration and statistical registration certificates , need not worry . According to the State Council , companies registered under a Three-in-One business license will automatically have their information submitted to related departments for amendment . This means they do not need to submit any Five-in-One amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Liaoning and Jiangsu provinces have piloted a Six-in-One license in several counties , which also includes a company 's seal carving approval certificate . Yangzhou prefecture city in Jiangsu is currently mulling the possibility of integrating a ' Twelve-in-One License ' . Shenzhen and Zhejiang provinces both launched a Five-in-One license for WFOEs early when the Three-in-One license was first announced . <p> Despite these regional differences , the key requirement to have a combined business license and unified social credit code carries the same State Administration for Industry and Commerce ( AIC ) deadline . Notably , some local AICs , such as that of Shenzhen , have not separately issued deadlines . It is possible that some local officials will give very short notice before the reform is fully consolidated . It is therefore highly advisable for businesses to play it safe and amend their certification and license sooner rather than later to avoid being caught of guard . <p> Businesses in all areas are advised to employ the assistance of an advisor so as to successfully navigate local conditions . Amendment may be easier in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vary wildly in their ability to exchange information . This means that what could be a very simple amendment process in one city may turn out to be more complicated in another . <p> Many businesses may already have been required to change to the Five-in-One business license . For example , in Shanghai , businesses making changes to their registered information , such as their business scope , legal representatives etc. have already been required by the government to register for a Five-in-One business license . Businesses who have had their organization code expire within the last year have also been required to update their certification to be included under a Five-in-One license . <h> Difficulties of amendment and consequences of failure <p> Amending certification to combine all five components into a single integrated license is no easy task . The process can be divided into roughly two parts , requiring both complex legal and tax related amendments . <p> Many businesses in Beijing have recently received warnings from the local tax bureau , reminding them to finish updating the tax-end of the Five-in-One license as soon as possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Dezan Shira &amp; Associates in Beijing , summarizes the consequences of not doing so : " An invalid tax license might influence fapiao issuance from a taxpayer to its clients and other tax affairs such as tax refund applications , input VAT deduction etc . Additionally , banks might also create obstacles in transaction execution if a company does n't update valid licenses at banks . " <p> Several tax bureaus have imposed unofficial internal deadlines earlier than the official date . For example , the Suzhou local tax bureau has asked companies to complete Five-in-One amendments as early as the end of 2016 , warning that a failure to do so would mean they could no longer issue invoices . <p> This is largely due to the fact that tax-end amendments can take an additional four to five weeks once legal amendments have been completed . This means that there may be insufficient time remaining to complete tax reforms if enterprises submit legal amendments too close to the December 31 deadline . <p> The matter of tax is complicated further by the fact that tax amendments do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Regional Director for Dezan Shira &amp; Associates explains : " What 's misleading is that tax registration consolidation into the Five-in-One does n't mean you 're done with the tax bureau . Before beginning business , a company will have to have its accounting firm ( or accountant ) visit the tax bureau to be assigned an in-charge tax official , and will have to make a number of electives related to VAT tax rate and potentially other tax elections . What the Five-in-One tax registration does is just get you a tax bureau number . " <p> This means that when a business applies for a Five-in-One amendment to tax registration certification , it will also have to go through the steps associated with initial tax registration consolidation again . <p> After a company has updated its certificate , its tax code will have changed , so it must re-complete the following steps : <p> ( re ) Activate its online tax filing system under its name ; <p> Sign three parties agreement ( company-bank-tax authority ) so tax can be deduct automatically ; and <p> Legal matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senior Associate for Dezan Shira 's &amp; Associate 's Business Advisory Service , re-stresses the severity of all five certificates at the company end being deemed as invalid and cancelled automatically past the deadline . Additionally , she emphasizes that : " it 's still not clear whether or not there will be any remedial measures or ways to amend certification once failing to meet the Five-in-One deadline in time . " To avoid unnecessary WFOE operational obstacles , businesses are highly advised to avoid this situation if possible . <p> Song elaborates : " Difficulties in the legal Five-in-One is mostly caused by the loss of any one of original or duplicate business licenses , enterprise code certificates , tax registration certificates , or statistic registration certificates , as they all need to be returned to the AIC in exchange for a new business license , together with proof of the enterprise 's uniform social credit code . In the instance of loss of documentation , an ' original certificate loss announcement ' in city-level newspapers and an explanation letter signed by a legal representative are required as supplementary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do not have a Three-in-One or Five-in-One license , the legal and regulatory complexity required to update certification , as well as the consequences of improper implementation , mean seeking a professional agent 's assistance for the process is highly recommended . <p> The need for amendments may be inconvenient and troublesome in the short term .

@@20961232 <h> After the Umbrella movement : healing a divided city must start with truthfulness <p> Three years ago this week Hong Kong witnessed the start of the largest and most sustained protest in its history . Occupy Central with Love and Peace , and the resulting birth of the Umbrella Movement , will most likely be remembered around the world as a uniquely orderly and peaceful mass protest . Yet for many in Hong Kong , all it represented was inconvenience and intransigence . <p> One of the most iconic images of the protests is of a student standing beside a lone policeman in heavy rain with two umbrellas , one of which he holds above the policeman 's head . For me this image is especially touching as I was there , a few metres away under the bypass , as it happened . What the picture did not capture , but what I remember clearly , was the way this simple act of respect completely changed the man in uniform . <p> When the students first approached the barrier at which he was stationed , his face and body froze . You could almost sense the adrenaline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear . However , discipline compelled him to stay . <p> When the student reached out with the umbrella so he might stand in its shade , there was a moment when it looked as if the calm might be broken and the policeman might lash out . Instead he remained , and his discipline held firm . <p> It was this discipline that would relieve suspicion and mistrust . Eventually , after a few minutes , and once the policeman realised the innocence of the student 's gesture , his face turned . I saw him smile , and in his look I sensed two further feelings , that of surprise and also pride . <p> Never was there a better demonstration of what so many of us know in our hearts : the almost unique innocence and good nature of so many of Hong Kong 's youth . Idealism and politics could not hide this from the world . <p> However these were not the only images , and to their great discredit , there were many who for reasons of politics choose to see only what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence that presented a very different view of the protests . <p> Standoff between police and protesters during the clearance of the Occupy protest site in Mong Kok .

This idea never took hold . Events quickly proved that there was no middle ground . <p> It also became increasingly clear what the majority took the blue ribbon to mean : rather than solidarity , blue became the colour of the CCP establishment , and a sign of opposition to the protests . <p> Although they were heavily outnumbered by pro-democracy protesters and police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of violent acts reported -- against protesters , civilians passers-by , the police and journalists . <p> Documentation , an exercise in objectivity , had become a target for the blue ribbons who labelled the presence of international media as foreign interference and international opinion as both biased and an intrusion on Chinese domestic affairs . These are the types of allegations that would once have been considered unbecoming of an international city of Hong Kong 's standing . <p> During Occupy we witnessed the best and the worst of Hong Kong . And the line is by no means clear . <p> Students showed a passion , invention and determination that surprised many . We witnessed student protesters erect homework stations and arrange classes and lectures . They drew flowers on the road surface , and planted them in the cracks between road sections . <p> They plastered the space with poetry , design and reminders to those visiting to follow the protest rules .

Their very good nature meant that when viciously condemned and slandered , their reaction was to be ever more bold in their sense of righteousness . <p> When hurt , emotionally and physically , our sheltered youth became recalcitrant . All these traits were sadly and increasingly evident as the protest drew on . It is therefore unsurprising that many reasonable minds turned from their cause . <p> Then there was a leadership that epitomised the generational gap . Even having made a point with support bleeding each day a divided leadership failed to call time . Older , wiser and more moderate voices whispered too quietly , crippled by their own fears that they may lose their young audience . <p> Like overprotective parents they failed to discipline their children when events got out of hand ; and like spoilt children our student leaders found themselves unable to concede that they might be wrong . <p> Much was written about the meeting between government representatives led by Carrie Lam , and the student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and power politics in Hong Kong in general , it was little more than bad theatre . <p> The police acted professionally and generally with considerable restraint , living up to their motto as Asia 's finest . Individually and as an institution they are , and Hong Kong is right to say so . <p> However , this does not mean that they should be beyond questioning . Quite the opposite : order is kept not by the baton but by trust -- and trust is built on accountability . The manner in which the police as an institution have responded to legitimate and justifiable questioning should be a genuine cause for concern , and does represent a failure of standards and attitudes . <p> The firing of teargas on the first day of the protest must be acknowledged as a mistake and a gross overreaction . The police had clearly been briefed to expect something that did not happen . <p> Standing by the claim that teargas was only deployed to break up large crowds of protesters that posed a significant threat to police lines is to perpetuate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I was one of those hit by teargas whilst I stood on the curb with notebook in hand . <p> The canister that landed beside me , a few feet away , was fired from behind -- in direct contradiction to police statements . <p> The beating of activist and Civic Party member Ken Tsang while he was restrained and in police custody was also , sadly , not an isolated incident . It was only because it was captured on camera that a serious case could be brought . This incident and others like it bring shame to a service that had by-and-large acted with admirable professionalism . <p> What was more shameful happened after , when the force accepted tokens of support and officers accepted gifts and money from blue ribbon support groups ; and when , after the court found the policemen guilty , the force openly challenged the ruling and policemen took to the streets in protest . <p> Rather than build bridges with the community in an effort to restore public confidence , the police let themselves be perceived as politicised . What the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a political commissar . <p> Their actions , dressed either as wisdom or patronage depending on your perspective , and their values of realism and pragmatism are the evolved values of a city of immigrants . They are the values of an older generation for whom this city is but a place , and for whom home is found in their roots and filial ties . <p> It is the realism that accepts rule . The realism that allowed many to colluded with successive colonial administrations and still claim loyalty to the Party . Theirs is a pragmatism that overrode morality to first allow families to survive desperate poverty and then build empires of individual wealth . <p> The Occupy protest site in Mong Kok . Photo : HKFP/Tom Grundy . <p> These are conservative values not to be besmirched , as these values above all are very much a product of circumstance . In the right circumstances they are values that manifest great qualities : stoicism in the face of hardship ; and piety in defence of family and tradition , and those immaterial institutions of faith on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these are values I too share . <p> However these values may also absolve conscience . What the blue ribbon represents is not the considered conservatism of Edmund Burke or even Confucius , but of conservative Chinese traditions of obedience and order . <p> These people hark back to traditional Hong Kong , illiterate and often with wealth , status and face to keep . It is those Hong Kong " success stories " built on monopolies and the opportunities of history , rather than innovation , creation and ideas . <p> The Occupy protests were also a reminder that behind the veneer of order , Hong Kong remains a city in which an inordinate power still rest in the hands of the local big man . The power and influence of the Heung Yee Kuk , that represents the territory 's indigenous villagers , continues to be founded on the most base forms , as do the triads . <p> Their world remains territorial , as was witnessed in the Mong Kok occupation . In Hong Kong the veil of law and order has always lain very lightly across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Umbrella Movement acted as a catalyst that has helped highlight the complexity and more subtle traits of our community . It did not open but rather deepened divisions within the community . <p> A street sweeper at the Occupy protest site in Mong Kok .

If we can not be honest about what happened we will never be able to address the difference of perspective that do exist . <p> In this case I see only regression -- of home once again becoming merely a place , and a people once again homeless ; and this city becoming once again a colonial outpost driven by empire builders , migrants and refugees . <p> What does not give me hope , and what discredits the pro-Beijing narrative of the protests that our government feels obliged to support , is that all mention of the protests are censored in our own country . <p> All that the majority of our countrymen will hear about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all that they are allowed to see is anarchy and violence .

@@21129232 <h> Taxing times <p> As India becomes more familiar with GST , Rebecca Abraham takes stock of issues that have presented interesting challenges <p> When India introduced a goods and services tax ( GST ) at midnight on 30 June few expected the transition to be smooth . Representatives of large companies said they were more or less prepared for what is a radical overhaul of the country 's indirect tax system , but a large number of small and medium-sized enterprises across India were not . <p> Frequent statements from the government -- some more persuasive than others -- about the merits of the GST followed . A federal minister , Arjun Ram Meghwal , even compared the new tax to a daughter-in-law who takes time to adjust to her new family . <p> Be that as it may , when the first filings under the new taxation regime had to be made on 25 August , only 65% of the taxpayer base responded . <h> Impact on investment <p> The filing was the first major test for the IT infrastructure of the new regime which is managed by a non-profit organization , the Goods and Services Tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GST portal and its integrity and reliability are vital , with the typical taxpayer now required to file a minimum of 37 returns each year , up from about half that number previously . While the compliance burden for companies is set to rise as a result , the GST portal has repeatedly thrown up hurdles for taxpayers during the initial couple of months of the new tax . <p> " Banks had to go through a whole gamut of registrations and system interfaces at the initial phase and it was a fairly daunting experience , " says Mohit Shukla , managing director and legal head at Barclays India , who adds that " over time the system will settle down and consolidate , and it will result in less rather than more " . <p> A more long-term concern has been a lack of certainty that is inherent in the structure of the GST . Until its introduction most changes in indirect tax rates were announced in the annual union budget . Since 1 July , tax rates for several goods and services have been tweaked at each meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central and state governments . <p> For the GST , all goods and services are classified under the Harmonized System Nomenclature ( HSN ) code system or the Services Accounting Code system . Based on the code and the transaction value of items in question , GST is levied and collected by the centre ( CGST ) and the states ( SGST ) , at five rates : nil , 5% , 12% , 18% and 28% . The GST also has a cess ( levy ) on luxury goods and others that are considered unhealthy or harmful . <p> In a statement issued after an 11 September decision by the GST Council to hike the additional cess on mid-sized cars , Hyundai Motor India said that while the GST was expected to create a single , unified large market with a simplified tax structure for the auto industry , the recent change " has come as a setback to the industry shaking the confidence of auto manufacturers " . <p> Hyundai added that " in the absence of consistent and long-term policy , the investment for new products and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GST Council meeting scheduled for 24 October is expected to discuss reducing tax rates for 60 items . <h> Questions abound <p> A key factor is the GST is being implemented within the federal structure of India and , as such , the potential for disputes between the centre and states , or one state and another , is significant . <p> Yet , as Rohan Shah , counsel at Chambers of Rohan Shah , points out , there is no dispute settlement mechanism for situations where there is a divergence of interpretations in adjudications and appeals between authorities of different states , or between the central government and states . <p> Even though such disputes are yet to surface , the GST has already triggered action in the courts , both on account of challenges that have arisen in the course of implementation of the tax and more substantive questions . <p> In early September , Rajasthan High Court admitted a writ petition by an association of tax consultants , Rajasthan Tax Consultants Association , which told the court that the GST portal was not ready and had glitches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referred to as a " clinical trial " of the new system on businesses . <p> Meanwhile , Delhi High Court has admitted a petition by software company Aphro eCommerce Solutions , which is seeking the removal of the requirement to furnish a bond and bank guarantee for exports of goods and services when the exporter chooses to export without the payment of integrated goods and services tax . The petitioner argued that rule 96-A(1) of the Central Goods and Services Tax Rules , 2017 read with related notifications and circulars , was contrary to the provisions of the Integrated Goods and Services Act , 2017 and as such cast a burden on start-ups and small exporters by blocking working capital . <p> " The overall tax regime is moving to a system where government wants early collection of taxes regardless of the legal claims and liabilities , " says Aseem Chawla , a partner at Phoenix Legal in New Delhi . <p> Delhi High Court has also admitted a petition questioning the constitutional validity of the rate of GST for a specific product . A petitioner had filed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ napkins imposes a burden on women and affects their right to live with dignity . <p> Disputes are also expected to arise over classification of goods . The HSN code has until now been used only for determining customs tariffs and its use for all goods is expected to be a challenge for the taxpayer . In addition , on account of the multi-slab rate structure that is in place , the classification of goods will be crucial to determining the amount of tax to be paid . <h> Implications for particular zones <p> The introduction of the GST appears to have been carried out without considering laws and the existing indirect tax regime for at least special economic zones ( SEZs ) and free trade warehousing zones ( FTWZs ) . <p> Companies that provide so-called authorized services such as warehousing or refrigerated storage within special economic zones are subject to GST even when services are provided to overseas clients as the condition relating to place of supply being outside India ( under section 2(6) of the Integrated Goods and Services Tax Act ) is not satisfied . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2005 , special economic zones are considered areas outside the customs territory of India . <p> A way out of this impasse would be to amend sections of the SEZ Act , 2005 and its rules that deal with fiscal and tax exemptions by replacing previous fiscal legislation -- Central Excise Act , etc. -- with the new legislation and rules . <p> " The failure to make consequential amendments to the SEZ Act and related laws could sound a death knell for the SEZ and FTWZ schemes , " says Srinivas Kotni , managing partner at LEXport in New Delhi . Kotni says some of his clients have been paying GST on services they are providing to their foreign clients on account of what he sees as a lack of coordination between the concerned ministries and lack of concern to save these schemes from extinction . <p> Kotni believes that changes made through GST could also adversely impact exports , inward remittances and the country 's ability to generate employment . " The aspirations of India of becoming a logistics hub have taken a severe beating as pathbreaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtless and haphazard manner . " <h> Anti-profiteering provisions <p> A key pillar of the GST is its anti-profiteering provisions , which have been introduced as an anti-inflationary measure , and to enable benefits of the tax to be passed on to consumers . Details have recently emerged about a National Anti-Profiteering Authority and a four-member standing committee , which will process complaints and refer cases it sees fit to a Directorate General of Standards . <p> This has done little to allay concerns among the taxpayer community about how anti-profiteering will work in India . There is as yet no formula to determine the extent of profiteering , as there was in Malaysia when it implemented a GST in 2015 . <p> More importantly , while the Central Goods and Services Tax Act , 2017 , and the state GST acts create an obligation on businesses to pass on any reduction in tax or benefit of input tax credit by way of a commensurate reduction in prices , neither the act or the anti-profiteering rules spell out what that should be . <p> Shammi Kapoor , a New Delhi-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax practice , says that industries such as construction and food will need to realign their processes and costs to pass on the credit to the customer . But " how much they will have to pass on is anybody 's guess " . <p> " We expect the anti-profiteering provisions to be draconian for many industries , " says Kapoor . Yet the jury is out on whether this will eventually lead to increased litigation . <p> Shah says that anti-profiteering should " ideally not entail a high volume of litigation , " given that the government has indicated that the enforcement mechanism will primarily be triggered by a complaint , and that it will be examined at two stages , prior to any proceedings before the National Anti-Profiteering Authority . <p> Others are less hopeful and suggest that this is a minefield that will need careful navigation . 
@@21129234 <h> Dividing goods , services necessary under GST ? <p> L Badri Narayanan discusses the need for more clarity and less superfluous tinkering with new system <p> India 's recently introduced goods and services tax ( GST ) has brought in its wake benefits as well as a plethora of issues that still need to be addressed . One of the key benefits expected from the " one-nation , one-tax " promise of GST was that it would obviate the need for classification of supplies into goods and services . This was an indispensable feature of the previous indirect tax regime in India , which often led to litigation . <p> Introducing article 246A into India 's constitution gave the centre and states the concurrent power to levy tax on the same transaction , which reduced the need to distinguish between the supply of goods and services . However , the GST law continues to place much stress on whether the supply under consideration is that of goods or services . <p> The GST law defines " goods " as all movable property other than money and securities , whereas " services " are defined as anything other than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . Further , place of supply rules also differ for the supply of goods and that of services . Since the determination of whether a supply would attract the local state 's GST and central GST , or the integrated GST is based on these rules , correct classification of supply into goods or services is crucial . In addition , the time of supply rules , which determine when tax gets triggered , also differ for supply of goods and services , again posing the need for accurate classification . <p> Above all , businesses are required to classify supplies to determine the applicable rate of tax . One reason the GST Council gave for adopting a multi-rate tax structure was that a single rate for necessities consumed by the poor , and luxuries consumed by the rich , in a developing country like India would be regressive . However , the primary reason for having a wide a range of tax rates was the spectre of an inflationary impact of GST on the economy , and its political consequences . Rates under GST were fixed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earlier regime . <p> Owing to these multiple tax rates , the council went on to adopt a detailed classification of various goods and services . For goods , the council adopted the first schedule of the Customs Tariff Act , 1975 , which is largely based on the harmonized system of tariff nomenclature followed worldwide . This was a welcome decision as it avoids issues of discrepancies in the classification of a product when supplied domestically or when imported/exported . <p> The rules for interpretation of the first schedule , along with the chapter and section headings and general explanatory notes , are also relevant for classification of goods under GST . However , the harmonized system is riddled with issues and ambiguities . There are numerous examples of products with broadly similar descriptions falling across different tax brackets . Absence of guidance on how to differentiate between them could lead to ambiguities , mistakes , and ultimately litigation . <p> For the classification of services , the council adopted the United Nations Central Product Classification , consisting of chapters , sections , headings , and groups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was adopted for the purposes of GST , which has led to overlapping entries . For instance , entry 9966 covers rental services of transport vehicles with or without operator , which attracts a GST rate of 18% , whereas entry 9973 covers leasing or rental services with or without operator , which attracts the same GST rate as that of supply of the underlying goods . Such underlying goods may be in the form of vessels , supply of which attracts 5% GST , or motor vehicles , supply of which attracts 28% GST in addition to compensation cess . This has caused problems in the classification of leasing/rental services . <p> With various businesses and industries providing input in relation to issues being faced by them , the council has been remedying these mistakes , issuing numerous notifications and clarifications in the form of FAQs , Twitter responses , etc . Although this effort is laudable , such frequent changes in rates may prove deleterious to the business environment and may lead to compliance mistakes . As the applicable rates play a key role in business decisions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in respect to classification or applicable rates , to ensure a business-friendly tax environment . <p> GST is still new in India , and although in the long term it will do good for the economy , it is causing short-term pain and has increased compliance costs dramatically for industry . Minimizing the frequency of such changes and making the process simpler would help avoid a lot of the negativity that has built up in the system , particularly over the past few months .

@@22140234 <h> The backlash against Hong-Kong inspired BBC Three sitcom ' Chinese Burn ' is well deserved <p> Hong-Kong inspired BBC Three sitcom Chinese Burn has provoked an extreme backlash from the East Asian community in the UK , and attracted negative reviews on social media <p> On November 27 , BBC Three aired the pilot episode for the new sitcom , which was written by Shin-Fei Chen -- who was born in Taiwan and raised in California -- and Yennis Cheung -- raised in Hong Kong . They also play the lead roles of Elizabeth and Jackie in the series . <p> The synopsis reads : " Chinese Burn smashes all the stereotypes with a round-house kick ... This show 's stories are **32;98;TOOLONG , no-MSG , authentic . " <p> Chinese Burn . Photo : BBC Press Office . <p> This is a seminal moment for East Asian representation on British television , which has become notorious for its persistent lack of British East Asian ( BEA ) stories on screen and on stage , particularly when compared with the US , which has made great strides to address this . The most notable examples include the much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crazy Rich Asians and Disney 's Mulan . <p> For me , a mixed Chinese playwright , the constant setbacks and struggles come as no surprise . Like so many others , I hoped that this could change everything for the East Asian presence on mainstream British television . Unfortunately , this means the show would inevitably , and possibly unfairly , be scrutinised to within an inch of its life . <p> However , in its attempt to " break down stereotypes " , Chinese Burn does nothing more than reinforce them -- and at the expense of its female characters . This , in turn , results in a cynical , disparaging and downright miserable portrayal of the foreign experience in London . As Anna Chen states , the episode is " utterly retrograde " . <p> " Suzy Wrong " was revolutionary in tackling stereotypes satirically through comedy with serious intent . " Chinese Burn " brings us full circle back to where we were . Utterly retrograde . Do n't allow BBC gatekeepers to make u squalid . <p> The sitcom uses the traditional storyline of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who must navigate the " big , bad city " with the " twist " being that they are all of East Asian descent -- although not British born or raised . <p> According to the Guardian , their comedic influences include Benny Hill , Mr Bean , Monty Python and Hong Kong 's own Stephen Chow . During the interview the writers declare they were inspired because " Chinese women are never portrayed as ambitious . " <p> However , as Fortune has reported , " The number of Chinese women in senior management positions has recently doubled , with 51% of those jobs held by females . " Regardless , they opt to depict the millennial stereotype so favoured by modern sitcoms in their attempt to explore the ambitions of Chinese women . <p> Elizabeth , who aspires to become a sommelier , works in a bubble tea shop in Chinatown . During the episode , in an effort to win her job back she performs a sexual favour for her Chinese boss in a pub toilet . Her roommate Jackie is a frustrated actress , consistently battling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thai prostitute and " only dates white guys . " But the character Fufu , an affluent Taiwanese fashion student who dresses up as an Orthodox Jewish man ( as this is a comedy , we may only assume , " for laughs " ) is possibly closer to the truth in conveying the foreign experience in London . <p> The backlash has been swift . As reported by NextShark -- which also summarises the episode in greater detail -- East Asian and non-East Asian audiences took to social media and posted their thoughts on the series ' " extreme racism " and damaging portrayal of Asian men as bigoted and impotent . Many have already posted complaints to the BBC . <p> Most troublingly , the official Chinese Burn team has responded by removing all negative reviews from Facebook and blocking users on Twitter . As a public broadcaster with an international presence , the BBC must hold an important and open discourse on this troubling non-contemporary representation of the East Asian community . <p> An upcoming collection of plays I curated by BEA writers contain themes such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , censorship , poetic imaginings of a migrant 's journey , conflicts in defining sexuality and humorous cross-cultural tales as told by a half-Mauritian/Chinese actress . They are the stories that I wished I had read while growing up . These are the stories which change the conversation . <p> The biggest failure of Chinese Burn is not in its alleged racism , but lies in its limited and unoriginal observation , lack of sharp wit and alternative perspective . <p> But where a great opportunity has been lost , an important conversation can now be had . The rich and multi-faceted lives of the BEA community all deserve a place on mainstream British television and their story should be told rightly and right now , before it is too late . <h> HKFP Voices Writer <p> Jingan Young is a Hong Kong born playwright and journalist .

@@22180239 <h> Preventing risk in medical institution acquisitions <p> With the government promulgating a series of policies to encourage and guide social capital to develop medical and health undertakings in recent years , social capital is constantly participating in M&amp;A , reorganization and restructuring of medical institutions . Among them , non-profit medical institutions are more encouraged by the government and have gradually become a new hotspot for investment . Due to its particularity , such acquisitions are different from ordinary acquisitions of shares , and therefore lawyers should know the possible legal risks in the acquisition process as well as possible . <p> Real estate and land ownership . Many medical institutions , due to age-old problems like vague property rights , usually find that because the land-use certificate is owned by the sponsor , therefore the property ownership certificate is also owned by the organizer , or not handled due to the principle of integration between house ownership and land-use rights . <p> Moreover , in the financial account of the medical institutions , these buildings that do not have a property ownership certificate are still listed in the fixed assets and depreciated . In addition , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in use due to various problems left over by history . During the course of due diligence , lawyers should make a field visit to the real estate used by the institution , to clarify the property ownership and actively communicate with the original sponsor of the medical institution to handle the transfer of premises . <p> Ownership of medical equipment . Lawyers should obtain a list of medical devices during due diligence and sort out the ownership of each medical device : where the medical devices are purchased by the medical institution , bidding documents , purchase contracts , invoices , and corresponding configuration permits or registration certificates should be obtained ; and where the medical equipment is leased or financially leased , the corresponding lease agreement or finance lease agreement should be obtained and the lease expenses payment verified . <p> In case the medical institution occupies and uses medical devices through co-operative delivery , the lawyer should clarify the ownership of medical devices by understanding the essence of co-operative delivery through the co-operation agreements . In addition , they should verify whether the key equipment has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whether the equipment is mortgaged or not . <p> Medical qualification certificates . Since medical institutions in the actual operation should have the appropriate qualification certificates , so lawyers need to focus on verification of validity of those qualifications and certificates , including practice licences for profit-making/non-profit hospitals , hospital grade assessment certificates , qualification certificates for fixed-point hospital of basic medical insurance and related agreements , radio-diagnosis and radiotherapy licences , large-scale medical equipment disposition permits , maternal and infant healthcare technology service licences , narcotic drugs and Class-1 psychoactive drug purchase signature card , radiation safety permits , special equipment registration certificates , physician 's certificates , nurse 's certificates , special qualifications certificates to carry out specific medical diagnosis and treatments , and so on . In the process of verifying medical staff 's qualifications , special attention should be paid to whether they have multi-sited practice . <p> Purchasing process compliance . Procurement in medical institutions mainly involves drugs , equipment and supplies procurement . In the process of drugs procurement , secondary bargaining will often occur , which refers to when the medical institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the provincial bidding to determine the winning bid , but privately negotiates with the drug suppliers for a final price lower than that determined by the provincial bidding centre . This was banned by the regulatory authorities . <p> Article 9 of the Opinions on Further Reforming and Perfecting the Policies on the Production , Distribution and Use of Pharmaceuticals , promulgated by the general office of the State Council in February 2017 , proposes to improve the pharmaceutical procurement mechanism . In areas where reform of the medical insurance payment system has been fully implemented , or the standards for the payment of drugs covered by medical insurance have been formulated , public hospitals are allowed to procure at the centralized drug procurement platform at the provincial level . This provision can be interpreted as : an autonomous bargaining is allowed for medical institutions to procure medicines ; that is , the ban on secondary bargaining has been liberalized . <p> Although the policy has allowed medical institutions to conduct secondary bargaining , lawyers should still verify the procurement process of medical institutions by reviewing procurement agreements , interviews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions in the process and focus on rebates , discounts , and allowances . <p> Negative impact of litigation and arbitration . Litigation and arbitration in medical institutions usually involves hospital-patient disputes and labour arbitration , which may have a negative impact on the operation of the medical institution . In recent years in particular , medical disputes have been frequent and the social image and reputation of the institution are prone to be seriously impaired , thus greatly reducing the possibility of successful acquisitions . <p> During the course of due diligence , it is suggested that you know about litigation disputes related to the medical institution through interviews and examination of online public opinions , and determine whether the litigation has a significant impact on the medical institution or not . Meanwhile , you should investigate whether there are any pending or foreseeable major lawsuits or arbitrations related to the sponsor of the medical institution . If the sponsor is facing similar challenges , it will definitely pose a negative impact on the medical institution . In addition , examination of network public opinion should be carried out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are or have been involved in criminal cases such as bribery , so as to understand the compliance of the medical institution from indirect sources .

And you 've got to understand it to understand how the world works and furthermore , Guangzhou is the world 's centre of manufacturing for low-end globalisation . <p> I predict that when economics textbooks are written 100 or 200 years from now , the major function of China in the early 21st century will be to provide the goods of globalisation to Africa , South Asia , the Middle East and Latin America . <p> In a picture taken on August 26 , 2013 , an African man and woman walk outside a clothing wholesale market in Guangzhou .

In what ways did you find that your research contradicted such official narratives ? <p> There 's just a bunch of smaller obvious facts to be known . One fact is that you generally have to bribe Chinese immigration at customs to get copied goods through , and there 's established procedure for that . Another fact close to the ground is that an awful lot of African traders are in Guangzhou to be missionaries . They want to convert China to the word of the Lord , and that 's not commonly known . <p> Another common feature is , most African traders in Guangzhou say that they have been cheated by Chinese , and a standard line is that Chinese cheat . Now I do n't think that 's true , and I think that many Chinese traders are indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all African traders have a story about being cheated more than once . And that 's something that you do n't tend to get in the official narrative . <p> The book is about how different groups of people build informal relationships when there is no common language , culture or religion -- all based on reputation and trust rather than formal contracts . What are some common stereotypes or assumptions about other groups of people that you have come across ? <p> The Arabs say the Africans are drug dealers , the Africans say the Arabs are terrorists , they both say Chinese are cheaters . That 's a common set of stereotypes ... and there 's a grain of truth , but only a tiny grain of truth . <p> Guangzhou . File photo : AFP/Stringer . <p> The stereotype is that the Chinese cheat .

That wo n't happen . Instead , the Chinese manufacturer will say okay . But he 'll make the phone for 150 RMB and it 's garbage , it hardly works . And then the African trader will say : wait , I 've been cheated . Not quite .

And that 's because in the course of my research , the Chinese police were getting really strict . There was another Nigerian neighbourhood that was basically decimated or destroyed by Chinese police hunting for overstayers and asking people for IDs five or six times a day . So it 's become a somewhat different place than when I did this research . <p> Guangzhou .

And these Africans going to Guangzhou are trying to be the middleman -- in other words , they 're trying to buy these Chinese goods , carry them back to Africa and make the profits for themselves , but I think that many Chinese companies would rather be the middlemen themselves . <p> I think that 's the direction that China would prefer to go . And that makes economic sense , but it does mean that China multiculturalism would be a bit more tentative than I had thought at the beginning of my research . <p> Does that mean it will make life harder for the Africans who do want to make China their home ? <p> Yes , I think it 's much harder , and one of the saddest interviews I conducted was with a man from Central Africa who had been in China for many years and spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at me and said : " You know , when Chinese refer to me as a foreign friend , they emphasise the foreign and not the friend .
