" <p> The new ruling would have significance for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London as this is the first year that boxing is being included as a sport , where as it was only used as a demonstration in years past . <p> Taylor ( 25 ) , who is the favorite to bring home the gold for Ireland at the upcoming summer games , said in response to the proposed new rulings : " I do n't even wear miniskirts on a night out , so I definitely wo n't be wearing miniskirts in the ring .

@@712233 <h> Alison O'Connor : Adoption red-tape is a cruel process but a necessary one <p> Movie stars Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt with two of their extended brood : adopted son Maddox and adopted daughter Zahara . Photo : AP <p> Anyone who complains about the bureaucracy which can be encountered when engaging with the State -- be it applying for the dole , or headage payments for livestock -- should attempt to adopt a child from abroad to get matters in perspective . <p> Assessment for an overseas adoption has to rank as one of the most cruel , head-wrecking processes ever to be endured . The chances are that if you are a couple considering inter-country adoption you have been trying to have a baby for years already anyway . <p> You 've possibly spent thousands of euros on fertility treatment . Once you finally accept this is not going to work for you there is the prospect of ( a ballpark figure of ) ? 20,000 more to adopt a child from overseas -- by the time you 've sorted out all the various fees , administrative , flights etc , involved . <p> Many people want to keep this matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secrecy , compounded by the question constantly asked of childless married couples : " So , have ye any news for us ? " <p> Then there is the extended , seemingly endless , interaction with the HSE . For some it has taken up to seven years between initial contact and final approval . There is a process of approval to be gone through which is lengthy and thorough . In many aspects it is relevant , informative and necessary . In others it can be ridiculous , tedious , inconsistent and small-minded . There are some excellent people working in inter-county adoption , but also some who are a lot less so . <p> But all the way through the prospective parents just grit their teeth because this is a relationship where all the power rests on one side . There is no choice . So through out it all one must remain ( outwardly ) calm and balanced . The ever prevalent fear is that at any visible sign of stress could immediately deem you as an unsuitable candidate to adopt . <p> Once couples got that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for adoption , the next battle was to actually find a baby . <p> This involved facing the rigours of whatever process existed in their country of choice , quite varied from country to country . In the last two to three years this final hurdle became all the more complicated as difficulties arose in a number of the countries to which Irish people traditionally travelled to adopt . <p> Vietnam has received particular attention , but there were also problems elsewhere , including Russia and Ethiopia . These countries were excluded for us to adopt from once Ireland enacted a new Adoption Bill and ratified the Hague Convention in 2010 covering international adoption standards . <p> While inter-country adoption was first recognised in Irish law in 1991 and numbers had been increasing , the changes mean that it 's no surprise that the latest figures show the number of children adopted here from abroad has fallen significantly from just under 400 in 2008 to just over 200 last year . <p> Since we do not have a good history with adoption in Ireland societal attitudes can be mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of additional issues and complexities . On the face of it , the process usually involves a wealthy couple ( relative to the local population ) removing a child from their culture and bringing them back to their own country so they can fulfil their need to have a family . The flip side of this is that if you 're living in a orphanage there usually is n't much culture to be had ; there is no one to pick you up and give you a cuddle when you need it most ; and if you are not adopted you are destined to remain in state institutional care . <p> All the while when foreign adoption is being discussed the spectre of cash being exchanged for babies has hung in the air . After all , if you are dealing with countries which have a culture of corruption to begin with , or even those that do n't , things can get complicated . <p> Everyone is very well intended . It 's entirely understandable that on a human level people might want , for example , to contribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt or have adopted from . Or that , after waiting for so long a couple might wonder what harm there is in throwing in an extra few hundred US dollars , if it speeds up the process a little . <p> The danger though , as evidenced by international reports examining the situation in Vietnam , or by those recent reports from Mexico , where 11 Irish couples are caught up in an alleged adoption scam , is that an adoption ' industry ' can spring up which becomes dependent on impoverished mothers handing over babies . <p> Lately things have begun moving again here in the world of overseas adoption . Children 's Minister Frances Fitzgerald , who takes an active interest in the area , has just returned from a trip to Vietnam . It looks as if the adoption of Vietnamese babies is set to resume shortly after the two governments reached agreement on issues concerning the rights of children . The safeguards relate to consent on the part of the mother , money , and having to deal with central authorities , rather than simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just for Vietnam that things will change . Back at home the aim is that the ridiculously long assessment process will be shortened because the new legislation allows for the HSE to outsource adoption assessments to accredited agencies . <p> We have our first Hague accredited adoption agency , Arc , a mediation agency , and a second , Pathways to Adoption , to be involved in conducting assessments . <p> Initially all of these changes , overseen by the Adoption Authority , will be a further bureaucratic nightmare for those waiting couples . But in the end it will mean that when it comes to adopting a baby the process will be transparent , and to the best international practices . <p> That is in the best interests of prospective parents , and -- most importantly -- the children .

In " extreme cases " the battery could actually catch fire , which we assume could potentially see your car explode in your face ... and you certainly would n't want that now would you ?

@@824240 <p> What a revelation that was ! After ? 300m and 15 years , it found there was corruption in Ireland . Good God ! I cried , hurling the radio out of the window in disbelief . Can this be true ? Irish people not honouring their word ? <p> No , no , no : next you 'll be telling me that priests have been sexually abusing children , and nuns brutalising unmarried mothers , and why , government ministers arming and funding a militant breakaway wing of the IRA ! But thank God : such things are impossible , are they not ? <p> They certainly are not impossible if you remain in steadfast denial about what kind of people we are . <p> Tammany Hall -- the organised nexus between political favours and the ballot-box -- was Ireland 's great contribution to the US body politic . <p> Only one American president in history had absolutely no ancestors listed in the first US census of 1790 . That was John F Kennedy , for whom the political machine of Mayor Richard Daley in Chicago obligingly " disappeared " the vital ballot-boxes that would have made Richard M Nixon president . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House , courtesy of a rigged-election . <p> But if you think a trade unionist -- Connolly -- giving his 14-year-old son a revolver to shoot down his fellow-countrymen a moral act : if you think a landed Countess -- Markievicz -- murdering an unarmed policeman -- Lahiffe --in St Stephen 's Green a moral act ; if you think that a gunman -- Holohan -- chasing a helpless 14-year-old boy -- the pathetically named Playfair -- from his home in Phoenix Park , cornering him and blowing his brains out , a moral act , why , you 'll probably have no idea what I 'm talking about . <p> This is the kernel , the key : you can not have a political culture that publicly cherry-picks through the Ten Commandments ; once you tolerate that , then others will do likewise , but making different choices according to their mood . <p> Thus Charlie Dalton , one of Michael Collins 's Murder Squad ( the subject of much heathen and depraved nationalist veneration ) , later became a founder of the Irish Hospital Sweepstake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gave very little to Irish hospitals . <p> Exiles in the US gave comparable sums to de Valera 's Fund for Ireland . And guess what ? He kept most of it , issuing worthless shares to the poor idiots who subscribed , but keeping the valuable ones for himself , so creating a ruling Fianna Fail kleptocracy to rival that of the Free State Sweepers . <p> Corruption is made possible by low standards : what is unpunctuality , but a disdain for rules ? <p> The plumbers or electricians who do n't show up on time are the building-blocks that make possible the Ziggurat of large-scale corruption . <p> Moreover , the culture of the Catholic confessional , and the absolution it conferred on non-sexual misdemeanours , served as a profound contaminant in Irish life : no non-pelvic sin , from patriotic-swindling to patriotic-murder -- a mere spectrum , not a quantum-leap -- was taboo in the perverse form of Catholicism that took root here . <p> The Mahon Tribunal lasted 15 years , five years longer than it took to build the Large Hadron Collider under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seek the origins of existence , Mahon 's brief was somewhat more modest . So discovering that creatures like Flynn , Lawlor and Burke were corrupt is rather like hiring Holmes to find a Lambeg drummer banging away in a Vatican phone-box : it certainly should n't take ? 300m . <p> And as for Bertie Ahern 's improper ? 215,000 , why , that sum is ? 80,000 less than the legal costs at Mahon of just his namesake alone , Dermot . <p> Meanwhile , 17 lawyers earned over ? 1m during the tribunal 's decade-and-a-half of leisurely lucubrations , with each SC earning up to ? 2,500 a day . And you know what ? If you unleashed the Mahon Hadron Collider on any one of us , you 'd find something juicy and untoward . On me , certainly . <p> The Moriarty report found that billionaire Denis O'Brien 's Esat deal -- from which he later made ? 300m -- was facilitated by the corrupt Michael Lowry . Precisely one year on from the finding , the Taoiseach Enda Kenny was sharing a platform in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Bertie Ahern might take heart : we really do n't take the tribunals ' findings any more seriously than we do the basic rules of an orderly , law-abiding society , the violations of which brought about the tribunals in the first place . <p> No wonder that Galway City Council is now planning to erect a statue to the terrorist mass-murderer Che Guevara . They simply have n't got a clue about anything , have they ? <p> On which note , I end my career as a salaried-columnist , bidding you all a fond and final farewell . <p> Yet stay !

Sinn Fein on the other hand will be delighted . In many respects , however , it will be met with a sigh of relief by Sinn Fein . There has never been a better time for the party , Fianna Fail are at the lowest ebb in their history , Labour are under pressure in government and Fine Gael seem to be deserting the centre to become more right wing every day . <p> In such an environment Sinn Fein , untainted by government , should be ploughing very fertile ground . <p> Their failure to put daylight between themselves and Fianna Fail , or Labour , has been something of a conundrum but today they will feel that they might just have solved it . <p> When one stands back from the picture it 's not hard to understand why SF are doing well .

In an age of tribunals and perceived corruption there is a sense that Sinn Fein are not part of that culture .

Many people are very frustrated , many people are watching stories of new bills and taxes coming and they simply do not have this money to spend . SF offers a chance that something new might just be possible . During the boom ears we never wanted to believe it would end .

Again we bought it and now quite a few seem to be regretting it . <p> The problem for the electorate is that they will have to judge if they are now doing the same thing again ? SF must prove that they can and will implement their policies because right now it looks like an attempt to convince the disaffected to run to their flag by convincing them that a new alternative is possible . The electorate do love to believe that this may be the case as successive elections have proven .

There is a portion of the electorate that will always want change of any kind in the hope that it will change everything . <p> SF should be very happy , however . Despite huge opposition they have proven themselves to be genuine contenders with a message that is beginning to resonate with the public . FG will be happy enough though , despite falling in the poll their ratings are still among the most healthy in their entire history . <p> For Labour and Fianna Fail , it 's back to the drawing board . <p> Labour must establish itself in government and try to haul back that left wing vote . FF must accept that new faces and new ideas are needed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver this and as a party they must accept that meeting the standards and requirements laid down by law is not enough .

Most of all , both internally and among the nation at large , FF must start to hold people accountable for wrong decisions . Those decisions must be pointed out and proof given that FF has a new team that has learned something . <p> One thing is for sure that while all parties will wait to see if this poll is reflected by others , it is certainly a warning shot across the bows . <p> Polls like this create tensions in government and if the pattern continues we are in for a very stormy political year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @

He tells Ciara Dwyer he wishes he had more edge and how his diabetes is a life , rather than death , sentence <h> Ciara Dwyer <p> CUTTING BACK : Ian Dempsey enjoyed the Celtic Tiger years , with perhaps a few too many good nights-out in fancy restaurants , he admits . He now suffers from diabetes type two and has had to trim down his weight . Photo : Tony Gavin <p> MOMENTS before Ian Dempsey arrives in the reception of Today FM radio station , I spot Tony our photographer . He is on the phone . His eyes are downcast , his expression serious . <p> The minute he comes off the phone he tells me that a friend in England had passed away . They used to be in a band together . Just then Ian Dempsey appears . He greets me with a smile . When I explain our serious expressions , he sympathises with Tony .

Even though I meet him to talk about his work and his life and Family Day , which he launched recently , it seems that he is genuinely interested in other people and just as happy to talk about them before himself . <p> As he heads off to do the photo , I watch him chatting to Tony , trying to cheer him up . Usually it 's the other way round . <p> When Dublin-born Ian was growing up , his mother Gay gave him good advice .

" He still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how is he feeling today ? On the morning we meet I imagine that he must be shattered , having been up before dawn .

His weekday radio show on Today FM , The Ian Dempsey Breakfast Show , runs from seven until nine and for this he happily leaps out of bed at 4.50am . <p> " I often wake up before the alarm goes off and then I just get up . I do n't use the snooze button . I jump out of bed . The older you get , you start appreciating daylight , " says the 51-year-old . <p> " When you 're a teenager you could stay in bed all day long .

I ca n't do much about that now , " he says . " He 's 18 . " <p> Despite his early start , Ian does n't seem the least bit sleepy . I am impressed . He tells me that when he goes home he often has an involuntary snooze on the armchair , but there is no planned siesta . But before you think he is superhuman , he admits that if he was n't doing this early slot he 'd probably be in bed until midday , because he is lazy by nature .

That morning I tuned in to his show to hear what was going on and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fast-paced show , full of music and chat , with Ian 's cheerful voice at the helm .

He tells his listeners that he certainly does n't do it , but he wants to hear people 's thoughts on it . Within minutes Twitter is buzzing . Some people find it as bizarre as he does but then , bingo , we hear of a man who used to do just that . <p> " My ex used to carry a roll of toilet paper in the car , but then he also had a mistress there too .

That was back when he worked in 2fm , which he joined in 1980 but he has moved with the times . He joined Today FM in 1998 . <p> " I was extremely happy in RTE , " he says , " and the show was doing really well , but I was always into getting out of the institution that was RTE .

That 's why I 've never touched it . " <p> There is something incredibly normal about Ian Dempsey and that , in a way , is his appeal .

I 'd say it was down to eating out in restaurants , all that Celtic Tiger madness and lunches with sauces . It was probably gluttony to be honest . " <p> Dempsey is a happy man and you can hear it in his voice when he 's on air . " I 'd hate people to think it 's a false happiness . When I 'm on air I am quite happy . This is what I always wanted to do and I 'm lucky to be doing it . " <p> As a young boy , he and his friend were making their own pretend radio shows on a reel-to-reel recorder .

He seems to be a bit of a weirdo . " <p> Many years later , Ian met Bowie . <p> " He was very nice . He had a great handshake , which is always a good sign .

@@891239 <h> 2011/12 season review <p> Details <p> Created on Thursday , 03 May 2012 13:23 <p> The Under-19 season comes to an end this evening when Rovers visit St. Patrick 's Athletic for the 25th and final game of the season . Here we reflect on how the last eleven months panned out for the group . <p> A re-structuring of the League of Ireland by the FAI saw the end of the A-Championship and Under-20 League in favour of an Under-19 League . This meant that the club had to look at the players that had won the Under-20 League in 2010 and re-evaluate , as some now became overage in the new structure . This also meant we lost some talented individuals that had been nurtured to be replaced by a new group of players . <p> The players that remained from the Under-20 squad formed the nucleus of the Under-19 team in the 2011/12 season . Jack Memery , Donal Branagan , Garry Comerford , Charlie Kenna , Jason Murphy and Ciar ? n Byrne were all retained and the squad was supplemented by new , fresh , hungry and talented players that would add an excitement and vibrancy to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , both Club and Internationally . Just the type of player that suits a football club like Shamrock Rovers . <p> Other players from that squad have moved to different clubs in the League of Ireland and are enjoying life as first team players while Se ? n Gannon is currently a member of the first team squad here at Rovers . <p> When the new intake of players arrived at the club , they hit the ground running as some were thrust straight into A-Championship action , immediately gaining invaluable experience playing against , and alongside , senior professionals . With the European success enjoyed by Rovers last season , less first team players were made available to the A-Championship side so the new Under-19 squad effectively doubled up as the clubs ' reserve side . The young players acquitted themselves admirably to the task and were eventually defeated in the A-Championship semi-final by eventual Champions , Derry City , at the Brandywell . <p> This experience put the players in good stead for the commencement of their own season and on August 27th Tallaght Stadium hosted its ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hoops defeat Mervue United 4-1 with Dean Ebbe scoring the historic first goal . <p> Over the course of the season , the team played 22 League games and 3 Cup games that led the side to Runners-Up spot in the Division and the Quarter-Final of the Cup . Going into tonight 's game , the team have conceded the least number of goals in the Elite Division ( 20 ) and scored the second highest amount of goals ( 49 ) . 13 was the number of goals scored in the 3 rounds of the Cup the team were involved in . Of the total goals haul , Dean Ebbe contributed 19 with Se ? n Dixon on 14 . Rovers currently lie 7 points ahead of third placed Waterford United and will look to increase that to double figures tonight . The team have been actively encouraged to play an open , exciting brand of football by the team management and anybody that seen the team play this season will surely attest to this . <p> First team manager Stephen Kenny has taken a very keen interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been borne out by the team that lined out against Bohemians recently in the Leinster Senior Cup .

Indeed , injuries to Gary McCabe and Chris Turner early in that game meant Ebbe and Forrester got an extended run out in the game . The Hoops goal that night was scored by Se ? n Dixon . <p> Throughout the season , every member of this squad showed just why they were brought here . Players such as Dean Power and Karl McGrath have been powerhouses for the team all season and have been very dependable when called upon .

The experience he has gained over the years at Manchester United and at International level with the Republic of Ireland underage set-up meant that these players were in the best hands available and Declan has proved to be a vital and valuable asset to the football club . <p> The coaching staff of Shane Connolly and Tony Hession are also very experienced and have helped nurture the players throughout the campaign . Shane 's work is not just confined to the training ground as he combines this with the role of team co-ordinator and puts in many hours of unseen work in the background to ensure everything goes smoothly .

This has included many extra ' one on one ' sessions with players outside the regular team schedule . <p> The final cog in the machine has been provided by Se ? n Moran . The work Se ? n does is also unseen but is crucial to the coaching staff when analysing matches and individual players ' performances as he is the teams ' very own ' Stat Man ' . Every pass , assist , tackle , goal , etc. that a player makes during a match is painstakingly recorded and collated and made available to the management by the next day . <p> Manager Declan Hevey sums up the season as follows : " I 'd like to congratulate and thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributed to a successful season .

@@947235 <p> The Oulart-The-Ballagh club man was n't long on a Wexford panel before experiencing All-Ireland semi-finals and being part of a Leinster-winning panel . <p> Yes there had been lows with the highs but by 2004 , Rossiter had already featured in two All-Ireland semi-finals . Things were looking up ; the future was bright for Wexford and its young star . <p> But those semi-finals and seasons , as so many have since , ended badly and these days it 's about baby steps back up the stairs . <p> Both final-four losses to the eventual All-Ireland champions in each year did not signal a falling off the inter-county hurling map for Wexford but there have been few days in the sun since . Perhaps reaching an All-Ireland semi-final in 2007 marks a high point since , but that too ended in a double-digit defeat . <p> Since Rossiter began to establish himself , it has n't quite been how he would have wished . " It hurts , " he says of Wexford no longer being mentioned as Leinster title contenders . " It 's a clear fact . When I started in 2003 it was Wexford or Kilkenny , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden you are fifth or sixth position in Leinster which does n't really help and it does n't really sit well with us . <p> " But we are in that position and it 's up to the 30 players and the management to get us out of it .

" <p> Guevara 's Irish links have been traced to Galway , and one Patricio Lynch , the founder of the Argentine branch of his family , was said to have been born in Galway in 1715 . From there he spent some time in Spain before eventually settling in Argentina . <p> Galway City Council agreed to erect a statue in his honor but it has proven a highly controversial move . <p> American politicians , especially those of Cuban descent have strongly objected . <p> " The romanticized reputation of Ernesto " Che " Guevara as a liberator and freedom fighter is nothing more than a myth of the Cuban revolution .

" <p> The iconic image of Guevera worn by youth worldwide was created by Dublin artist Jim FitzPatrick . <p> " Celebrating Che Guevara glorifies oppressors and weakens democracies around the world . ... The democratically-elected council in Galway can ignore the objections of a member of the U.S. House of Representatives , but it can not ignore the truth of history .

@@1035232 <h> Woodquay in former times <p> Galway Advertiser , Thu , Jul 19 , 2012 <p> William Joseph JC Bond ( 1833-1926 ) was a landscape and marine painter of the Liverpool School who was much influenced by Turner , and in the 1850s and 1860s , by the Pre-Raphaelites . His work features in a number of museums and galleries . He came to the west of Ireland on a number of occasions , we know one of his paintings was titled " Near Oranmore " and he also painted " The Galway Coast " in 1872 . Our main image today is of an oil painting he did of Woodquay in 1850 , and the second is a detail from that painting . He may have taken some artistic licence , but his picture underlines the importance of early artworks as historical documents in an era before photography reached Galway . <p> Galway was originally known as Streamstown because it was made up of a series of islands which were surrounded by the river and associated waterways . The area of Woodquay is described as one of the earliest inhabited parts of Galway . Evidence found in the river bed suggests that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In olden times , Woodquay was made up of three islands , the largest of which was Saint Stephens Island which would contain an area roughly where the Town Hall , The Courthouse , The Franciscan Abbey and The Convent are today . On the 1651 map , it is shown as Ship Island . Both names are now obsolete . <p> The area which encompasses where Galway Rowing Club , the Commercial Club and Daly 's Place are today was largely made up of two islands , a long narrow strip of land for which I do n't have a name , and Horse Island . This island must have at one time extended as far as The Lion 's Tower , because it is given in a deed as a mearing with the Lion 's Tower . It was given as the western boundary of Suckeen and it featured on Logan 's 1818 map of Galway . The name " Oile ? n na gCapall " was still current in 1905 . <p> This view of Woodquay was painted from roughly where the bus shelter on St Brendan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance are the Abbey Church on the right which was finished in 1836 , and the friar 's residence next door which was completed in 1820 . In the centre is the old tower of St Nicholas ' Collegiate Church , a close-up of which you can see in more detail below . The branch of the river in the foreground flowed south to the bottom of Eyre Street and then swung sharp right to flow parallel to the city walls at Bowling Green , entering the main river further on . The bright green strip of land we see in the centre of picture was the long narrow island mentioned above . The land between these islands was gradually filled in and reclaimed . Jimmy Redington , who was mayor of Galway over 60 years ago , could remember the river coming up Woodquay . He remembered stepping stones across the end of Abbey Lane , and how a woman named Melia fell in there and drowned . <p> The area we see on the left of the painting is the end of what we now know as St @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head towards Eyre Street .. It was marshy and boggy and shown on early maps as ' liable to flooding ' . The slated house behind the mast on the left was probably at the top of Eyre Street and the tall house we can just see on the extreme left would have been at the top of Prospect Hill . There are an interesting number of trees in the painting . Looking at the thatched cottages and church buildings is like looking at the old and new Galway of 1850 . <p> Our second image is a detail from the painting showing the old tower of the Collegiate Church with its viewing area near the top . This tower was rebuilt in 1883 , which is probably when the ' town clocks ' were installed . The tall buildings we see to the right on the horizon were put there by the artist to break up the skyline . The houses in the foreground are those leading in to Daly 's Place . @ @ @ @

And not just by those who cite ' natural law ' as their ultimate guide in the matter . There is evidence that both sides need to put their hands in the air and say : ' mea culpa ' -- I 'm not thinking . <p> What is it about this issue that makes people -- normal , sensible , kind people -- so sure , so absolutely convinced beyond all rational discussion , that it is their side , their view , their interpretation that is right ? <p> Why is it , at the very mention of the word ' abortion ' every politician in the country would do well to run screaming in the opposite direction , as indeed they have always done -- fingers crossed that the issue can be kicked so far into the future ( coalition review group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Admittedly as , what I suppose some Fine Gael TDs might call a ' radical feminist ' , I would have been in one of those righteous camps at the time the X Case ruling was pronounced 20 years ago . <p> Then , I had no scruples about declaring my support for the legislation of this case ; I mean , who could argue with a suicidal young girl being entitled to a termination of her pregnancy if it saved her life ? Only religious reactionaries , I thought . Or misogynistic blokes who wanted to maintain control of female fertility . Or old women with 15 children and rosaries wrapped around their fingers and their ovaries . Or pathetic , young Youth Defence types . <p> And I still think that in that specific context , the right decision was made .

Nor have I been brainwashed by some of the more militant members of the pro-life lobby . I 've just lived and listened and tried to learn . I 've had to admit to doubts . <p> Perhaps it 's because I 'm now a mother with two early birth children , perhaps it 's just age , or perhaps it 's watching the joys and sadnesses that pregnancies -- wanted and unwanted , those that come to term and those who do n't -- bring to friends and family which has made me eventually realise there is no one answer , there 's no easy way ; if ever there was a human conundrum with as many right and wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the area of abortion . <p> Both sides , I believe , in this debate , have behaved unfairly and dishonestly . <p> On the one hand , to argue that the use of the contraceptive coil , for instance , is on a par with a late abortion is obscene and grossly offensive to human dignity . To refuse to allow women , whose much-wanted child will never live outside the womb , to end their pregnancy in their own country with dignity and love , is a cruelty beyond comprehension . <p> But on the other hand , to insist that a woman has the right , in ALL circumstances to end the life of a 32-week-old foetus if she so chooses -- this must also be wrong , surely no cases can be that black and white ? <p> Let 's be honest here .

And if we are living in a country where the only reason that an abortion , even at an early stage of pregnancy , is allowed is if there is a risk to the life of the mother , well then . . . need I spell it out ? <p> Will we see a rise in suicidal Irish women that corresponds to a drop in the numbers who traditionally travel to English clinics ?

All I know is that creating a situation where women are forced to deceive the State is n't good for any of us . <p> Pretending that abortion is a black-and-white issue is n't the right way to go about things either . <p> Recently , as I 've seen an ever-increasing presence of pro-life posters and then listened to opposing rhetoric , I 've felt that what is good and right for women and children is the last thing on anyone 's mind in this debate . I remember once , soon after undergoing what in medical terms is called a ' missed abortion ' , ie a foetus dying in the womb , being confronted with obscene posters of dead babies carried around by Youth Defence-types and having no way to avoid walking right past them . <p> At the time if I 'd had the choice , I 'd have had all of them jailed for their ignorant cruelty .

There are so many people who fervently believe that they are right -- no matter what the circumstances , the complexity of the case , the human doubts that we all should have . <p> In preparation for the autumn debate it would , perhaps , be wise to remember the words of the 13th-Century Afghan poet Rumi and attempt to put them into practice : <p> " Out beyond ideas of wrong-doing and right-doing there is a field .

That 's also true of , say , Billie Holiday , who could persuade you that a trifle like These Foolish Things was a masterpiece , but throughout her career Billie also recorded many of the undisputed pearls from the great American songbook , and it is through these hundreds of recordings that we can acknowledge her exalted place in the pantheon . <p> Winehouse was n't so fortunate ( if you can attribute good luck to the unfortunate Billie ) , and with little more than a handul of recordings to her name , she 's largely to be mourned on the basis of extraordinary promise . <p> That promise was beautifully captured in the 2006 sessions for RT ?

" <p> Well , as one of those responsible for Other Voices , he would say that , but as Philip has long been a truly inspirational figure in the musical life of this country , I forgave him his occasional forays into the verbal stratosphere , even when he suggested that when she came to Dingle the 22-year-old troubled London singer " used her gift to still her trembling soul " . <p> In fact , he seemed to be right .

" They gave me the name but I had n't a clue who the lady was , " he recalled .

For these few weeks , they do n't just get to compete against the best in the world but they also have commercial opportunities that -- like the Games -- only come around once every four years . <p> And while Team Ireland do n't have any blue-chip athletes with the global appeal of Usain Bolt or Michael Phelps , there is a domestic market our stars can target . <p> Derry McVeigh is co-owner of Silverhatch Sports , a company which represents a lot of the Irish athletes currently in London . The likes of Paul Hession , Deirdre Ryan , Melanie Nocher and Rob and Marian Heffernan are all under the Silverhatch umbrella . <p> Along with Hugh Cafferky , McVeigh set up the company in 2008 , originally looking after triathletes , taking care of all avenues of their sponsorship from bikes to clothing to travel and accommodation partners before widening the net somewhat to other sports and athletes . <p> McVeigh 's background @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the Emerald team . From this he was exposed to the competitive and commercial side of sport and gained experience in both . <p> An Olympic cycle for an athlete in terms of commercial preparation is similar to their race preparation cycle .

So developing his image was the first step in the process . <p> Pictures were taken of the athlete in a tuxedo with his singlet protruding and they formed a big part of the presentation that was put to companies . He had a corporate appeal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hession 's ' content ' when talking about him .

They have found it very effective to use some of that content as part of their campaigns , " explains McVeigh . <p> A website was then set up , with a blog , videos , and links to Hession 's social media accounts like Facebook and Twitter . <p> McVeigh met with the Olympic Council of Ireland to see what brands had aligned themselves with the London Games . Having this information was vital as there were only a limited amount of brands that Hession could be associated with at the Games . Big-name companies like Electric Ireland , Proctor and Gamble , Coca-Cola and Cadbury are all either official partners or official supporters so McVeigh made presentations to several on Hession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get on board with Paul , so once we knew we were dealing with them we did n't want to go anywhere else , we wanted to get that over the line .

That opinion could n't be further from the truth . <p> According to McVeigh , an appearance fee for an athlete more often than not just pays the electricity bill . Hession 's Cadbury sponsorship was used for him and his coach John Coghlan to travel to South Africa and America to prepare for the Games , it was n't for luxuries . <p> Since joining Silverhatch Sports , three-time Olympian Rob Heffernan and his wife Marian have captured the interest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competing in London -- Rob in the walk and Marian in the <p> 4x400m relay -- and have been branded as one entity .

But I thought the story is Rob and Marian , it 's unique and a cross-section of society can tap into it and relate to the struggle of juggling training , life and kids . And a husband and wife going to the Olympics is very interesting . By the time they joined up with us , a lot of the big companies were a closed shop but Electric Ireland have used them for media days , Kinetica came on board for nutrition and Mizuno came on board as Marian 's kit sponsor , " explains McVeigh . <p> With regard to commercial appeal , qualifying for the Olympics is vital .

They regularly tweet how they 're feeling before or after a race and this helps them connect with their followers . <p> McVeigh has put plans in place for any athletes who podium at these Olympics so that everything is set up for them .

Hitler , you might answer . Wrong . It was Konrad Adenauer . It was August 1932 and Adenauer , later the first postwar West German chancellor , was mayor of Cologne . <p> " This is how the roads of the future will look , " he said , opening Germany 's first crossroads-free motorway between Cologne and Bonn . It was only 20km long , but offered four straight-as-an-arrow lanes , no traffic lights and an eye-watering speed limit of 120km/h -- a considerable challenge to boy-racers in an era when most cars could only manage half that . <p> It was the birth of a legend that , within a year , had been silently subsumed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against further motorways as a prestige project Germany could ill-afford , a racing route for " rich aristocrats , Jewish big capitalists and their interests " . <p> It was a widespread political view since the first autobahn test route -- the Avus -- was built in Berlin in 1921 . But attitudes changed when an explosion in motorised traffic left towns choked with traffic . In 1929 alone , nearly 6,000 Germans were killed in road accidents . <p> The situation was particularly critical in the densely populated Rhine-Ruhr region in western Germany where , in 1926 , plans were devised for a motorway with the less-than-catchy name " only-automobile-street " . A second name , proposed by a lobby group for a car-only route from Hamburg in the north via Frankfurt to Basel , was the " HaFraBa " . <p> In the end it was Robert Otzen , head of the Stufa car lobby group , who is credited with " autobahn " -- a modern take on the word bahn , German for railway . <p> The motorway plan was given a lukewarm reception by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After banning private companies from building motorways , the minister agreed to co-finance the Cologne-Bonn route as a public works project . To have the maximum positive effect on the high dole figures , the planners were forbidden from using any kind of hydraulic diggers . The first autobahn , costing nine million Reichsmarks and employing 5,550 construction workers , opened on August 6th , 1932 , as a twin monument to motoring and manual labour . <p> The new route was a sensation , and 2,000 car-owners arrived on the first day , grappling with new traffic rules : no stopping , no parking or turning and no transport of animals . <p> Five months later , Hitler was in power . He soon reversed Nazi opposition to autobahns after learning the influence -- and popularity -- offered by road building . The Nazis were just weeks in office when , in February 1933 , Hitler announced a massive autobahn-building programme . Soon the freshly elected chancellor could be seen , shovel in hand , digging out autobahn foundations for the press cameras . <p> Two years later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Adenauer , downgraded the first autobahn to a " regional route " . <p> With this bureaucratic trick , Hitler had now established himself in the history books as the father of the first autobahn , a myth that survives to this day . <p> It 's not the only autobahn myth . The notion that there is no speed limit is only partly true . Autobahns have many speed limits -- for instance at intersections and construction sights -- while , overall , a " recommended speed limit " of up to 130km/h applies . <p> A recent poll found 80 per cent of Germans opposed to mandatory speed limits . A hard core of drivers view any attempt to make them travel slower than 200km/h as an infringement of their human rights .

@@1092230 <p> Scroll down and you 'll find Oscar Pistorius , the South African double amputee runner who made athletic history by competing in the 400 metre relay final in the London Olympics last week . But move over Messrs Ford and Pistorius because Simon Baker is making his mark . He lives and trains in Limerick - and he 's Irelands first and only Blade Runner . <p> By his own admission , Simon Baker was an entirely different person eight years ago . He had moved from his native London to work as a plasterer . Work was plentiful and the living was easy . He started up a successful sub contractors business in Limerick and built his own beautiful home . <p> He rarely exercised , smoked 30 cigarettes a day and drank socially at the weekend . Early in 2004 his entire existence was turned on its head . A relatively innocuous fall from a scaffold resulted in a very serious multiple and compound fracture of his right leg with 32 individual bone fragments visible on X-ray . <p> Simon underwent eight separate operations in eight months , none of which were successful in achieving a return to normal function . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stays and general anaesthetics for the next 18 months , Simon asked the surgeon to amputate ? the leg instead . <p> " I was asked to think about it , " he recalls . " I replied that I 'd had over eight months to think about it . I wanted control of my life back and once I made that decision I felt better about my situation . " <p> However the transition period that followed proved hard and dark days followed . <p> " I basically hit rock bottom . Drank too much . I was n't coping well at all and became very depressed . I could n't work . My finances were not good . Lots of crazy thoughts were going through my head . " <p> It was around this difficult time that Simon met his partner Gillian . " Gillian was my saviour . So supportive , so understanding . But I was still a real mess . I did n't have cancer or another terrible disease but I could n't handle the fact that I had lost my leg . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A long drawn out High Court case relating to the accident was settled . He decided to commit permanently to Limerick , where he had started a new job in community employment scheme . He joined a gym , and explored options such as wheelchair basketball and soccer . And he decided to enter the Dublin City Marathon . <p> " I had received a Guinness Book of Records for my birthday . I set myself the goal of getting myself into it by completing the whole 26 miles on crutches . " He raised funds for the Bubble Gum Club , a charity which helps grant wishes to children with serious illness . " I was invited to a birthday party for a 16-year-old girl with terminal leukaemia . She was a beautiful young girl and was so happy to be just having a big party . Her parents had n't told her she was dying . I got a serious wake-up call . It put my last four years into perspective . It dawned on me how selfish I had been and that I had never realised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer . " <p> When he crossed the line his time was 6 hours and 42 minutes , a record for an amputee which stood until 2010 . <p> Simon decided to set himself a new challenge every year in aid of charity . He got lucky with his next choice , because it led to him to Jason Kenny , a well known strength and conditioning coach , and the co-founder with Blue Shinnors of Forever Fit Promotions , the organisers of Limerick White Collar Charity Boxing . <p> " They had n't had an amputee box before but said I was welcome . No one treated me with kid gloves during the eight weeks of boot camp . I loved the training , and I was in awe of Michael Carruth when he visited St Francis to train us . I felt normal again . I came to the realisation that exercise is the best medicine . It can help with lots of problems . You do n't have to run a marathon either.Hop on a bike . Go for a walk . You are going to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I remember Jason saying to me , ' Well done . ' We talked and he a crucial mistake because he offered to help me out with my next challenge ! " <p> That was a journey from Dublin to Limerick on crutches . Jason designed a tailor made conditioning programme for Simon . Paddy Power came on board with a five-strong support team . A circuitous 257 km route was successfully completed in aid of the ISPCC but already Simon was planning his next project , one that was going to raise the bar considerably . <p> " You 're not disabled by the disabilities you have . You are able by the ability you have . " - Oscar Pistorius , 2008 <p> For those who have n't been paying attention over the past few weeks , Oscar Pistorius is a South African 400 metre runner making athletics history by being the first disabled runner to compete at the Summer Olympics using two carbon fibre artificial limbs or blades . At first he was prevented from competing against able-bodied athletes , but a Court of Arbitration for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now the South African is a genuine superstar with a string of blue chip sponsors . <p> Jason Kenny takes up the story . " Simon had definitely been influenced by the Pistorius story . He had immersed himself reading and learning about the carbon fibre blades , the technology available and the possibilities it created . <p> " We discussed the project at length and came up with the idea of running the Dublin City Marathon using a blade . It had n't been done here before . As well as that , no Irish amputee athlete had ever competed in a track event in the Paralympics and no centre of excellence exists in this country for amputee athletes or disability sports in general . " <p> Jason and Simon got to work quickly , contacting Alan Ward and Dave Mahedy of the University of Limerick , to set the ball rolling in autumn of 2011 . " They were very enthusiastic , supportive and excited about the whole idea from the outset . We were immediately offered full use of the universities facilities . " <p> Simon approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too promised their full support , as well as sponsorship . Meanwhile an inter-departmental team was assembled in UL to co ordinate the project . Jason became the overall project manager as well as personal trainer to Simon . <p> " What was vital from the outset was that that we straight away achieved credibility . Our short term goal is to get Simon to run the Dublin Marathon in under three and a half hours . But our long-term goal is to set up a template for a future centre of excellence in this country so that Irish track and field amputee athletes can compete in future Paralympics with the best possible support system . " <p> Quickly the assembled team got down to business . Extensive baseline data for Simon was recorded , measurements for his new blade were taken and retaken as his leg and entire body shape began to change . The long hours and days of training commenced and still are not without constant challenge . <p> Jason admits there is a steep daily learning curve : " Simon had never walked properly , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do just that . Change his posture . Alter his stride pattern . Retrain his brain 's muscle memory . His right leg had turned almost outwards since the accident . His left side of his body dominated his right side . So we had to break him down to start again and build him back up , block by block . " Simon and Jason 's rapport and friendship is obvious and Simon says he could n't have arrived at this point without Jason 's huge input and also that of his sports injury therapist , Orla Smyth . <p> Through intensive training involving specific running and posture exercises and brutal core work , Simon and Jason had succeeded in turning his right leg back to its proper alignment . <p> Jason says it was a pivotal moment in the project , which is now called Out on a Limb : " I never doubted the man 's determination . I had walked alongside him from Dublin to Limerick in hailstones . I had seen him get into a boxing ring time and time again . I had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him complain - almost ! But now all these scientists and experts could see that determination and the subsequent results for themselves . " <p> " We all keep on telling each other that if we can learn and achieve this much in nine months , imagine what we can do in four years , in time for the Rio de Janeiro Paralympics . The sky really is the limit . " <p> Simon cut in as the interview draws to a close . " Just make sure to put this down , " he says . " I really do n't think I 'm an inspiration . A lot of people have been dealt a lot worse hand in life than I have been and dealt a lot better with it than I have . <p> " Sometimes you can not see other people 's disabilities.You can see mine .

August 2007 was the month that the growth of world economy began falter and fail , exposing the weakness of Ireland 's banks , bursting the construction bubble , hammering the State 's finances , escalating unemployment and bad debt levels , and undoing a generation 's worth of economic growth and development in a country just starting to believe that the bad days of the 1980s were well behind it . <p> Five years . It is a good moment to look back on the past five years and ask : just what happened ; and what , if anything , can we learn ? <p> What happened ?

More than a fifth of the Irish workforce was employed building houses , contributing to an oversupply that will take decades to reduce . <p> Once the mirage began to fade and ordinary people realised that ? 400,000 for a two-bedroom apartment in the southern suburbs of Dublin was insane , everything came crashing down rather quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the subprime mortgage crisis and the subsequent collapse of the bank Lehman Brothers . On August 6 , 2007 , the American Home Mortgage Investment Corporation ( AMICO ) filed for bankruptcy . <p> At the time it was the 10th-largest retail mortgage lender in the US . AMICO was not a subprime lender , but it had been forced to close because of the difficulty . The AMICO filing sent shockwaves throughout the financial system . Credit between banks began to dry up , meaning banks would n't lend to one another at previous levels . The system began to collapse . <p> Despite the best efforts of the US authorities , a credit crunch happened where banks became unwilling to lend to one another . The main Irish banks , with some of the most over-extended balance sheets in the world , were extremely vulnerable to this credit crunch . <p> By February 2008 , when UK bank Northern Rock was nationalised , it was clear Ireland 's banks were in deep trouble . Ireland 's unemployment rate began to climb in early January 2008 , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unemployment rate jumped from 6pc to 14pc . <p> The Irish authorities claimed nothing was particularly wrong . The economists of major banks bombarded the airwaves throughout 2007 and 2008 with talk of soft landings . <p> By September 2008 , as a result of the international economic and financial turmoil , there was a run on Irish deposits and a collapse of Irish bank shares . The Irish Government stepped in to guarantee the assets and liabilities of the banking sector . It was a bold move . It was the wrong move . The state ( and by implication the taxpayer ) was on the hook for the catastrophic losses of the banking sector . <p> The state 's overreliance on stamp duty and capital gains taxes was exposed when these funds no longer came in once the property boom collapsed . <p> Coupled with the increasing cost of rising unemployment levels and a drop in domestic demand , for the first time in years Ireland needed to borrow seriously from the international bond markets to plug the hole between government expenditure on goods and services and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an annual national output of around ? 130bn per year was on the hook for a banking system worth over ? 400bn , the bond markets who lent to the state got worried we would n't be able to repay our debts . <p> Relative to the cost of buying German government debt , the cost of Irish borrowing sky-rocketed . <p> Despite two hairshirt Budgets in 2009 , by the autumn of 2010 Ireland could not borrow on the markets . Ireland applied for a programme of assistance in November . <p> Everything , every policy decision , and every major action the Irish state taken since the night of the banking guarantee has been geared toward relieving the burden of this debt . <p> Nothing , not the immolation of Fianna Fail and the Green Party at the last election ; not the frequent flights to Europe by the new Government ; not the many summits ; not the burgeoning long-term unemployment problem ; not the NAMA architecture for bad commercial debt instituted by the old government ; not the increase in sovereign debt to pay off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the economy by the banks Ireland 's taxpayers helped save -- nothing has helped to alleviate the debt burden imposed since 2008 's banking guarantee . <p> It is from this point that the modern Irish economy must start . September 30 , 2008 , was our singularity -- the point at which it all began . Everything prior to 2008 is , honestly , a footnote . <p> The parameters from the night of the guarantee were quite simple . First , Ireland must avoid any default on its debt of any kind because we were sure we would need to borrow from the international markets sooner rather than later . <p> This constraint held above all others . Ireland would not default . Second , relations with Europe must be restored at all costs . Everything , including the various treaty referendums , has proceeded from the position of needing to be within the good graces of those whose largesse we rely upon . <p> Ireland has a banking problem , a fiscal problem , a debt problem , an unemployment problem and a political problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banking problem first , and has ended up with several zombie banks-banks that look alive but do n't lend into the real economy . <p> The fiscal problem is in the process of being solved , through austerity . Essentially , spending on government services has to drop and taxes of all kinds have to rise to make government expenditure coincide roughly with taxation revenue . <p> Long term , austerity is a good thing because it will reduce our reliance on external borrowing . Short term , it will increase the suffering of the innocent in our society who rely on these services , and decrease the level of demand in the economy , which is key to helping to reduce unemployment . Austerity combined with sluggish growth means that unemployment over 10pc will continue for the foreseeable future . <p> Ireland 's debt problem has had a few passes at it . I 've already mentioned NAMA , the National Asset Management Agency , designed in 2009 to purge the banks of their bad commercial debts ( over ? 71bn worth ) . NAMA is working to recover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It will be a decade or more before we can judge NAMA as a success or a failure . <p> Another aspect of the debt problem is the household mortgage problem . Many of the households who borrowed during the boom can not repay . A new Personal Insolvency Bill is attempting to address the stress this causes the people in debt , as well as the impact their default might have on the already weakened banks . <p> Again , it is far too early to tell whether this legislation will succeed or fail , but my opinion is the legislation wo n't be sufficient , as I argued in the Irish Independent on July 3 . <p> Ireland 's unemployment problem is monstrous . We have well over 450,000 people unemployed in Ireland today , almost 15pc of the workforce , enough to fill the Lansdowne Road stadium more than six times over . More than 200,000 of those unemployed have been unemployed for more than a year . <p> There are no certainties in economic research , but when it comes to long-term unemployment -- those unemployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have done shows that it damages the life time earnings of those who experience it , as well as damaging those around them . <p> Where is our retraining apparatus ? Some of those construction workers made unemployed in 2007 could have master 's degrees by now . The ordering of our masters ' priorities when it comes to solving our problems lets us understand our own priorities when electing them . <p> Remember that we elected the current Coalition on a platform of no default and European solidarity . <p> Our political problem is that those in power are in fact powerless . Ireland 's political system will not change , despite the valiant efforts of a few to do so . The stakes , now , are just too small . <p> Ireland 's politicians are constrained in every way . Only a solution to our debt problems at the European level will result in a recovery of the Irish economy . But a recovery to what ? Our best hope is for a solid return to the bond markets , already under way , to continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned that those in power who fail will be rewarded but dismissed . The corrosive effect on our society of the impunity of those who helped cause the collapse can not be estimated . <p> We have learned that even an existential crisis can not unseat official Ireland . <p> We have learned that change is treacle-slow , but that it does come . <p> We have learned that no pain is too great for the Irish people to bear without protest . <p> We have learned that we can recover and move on from the property crash , but that it may take five more years with modest growth and high unemployment to do so . <p> The cost will be incalculable . <p> Stephen Kinsella is a lecturer in Economics at the University of Limerick

@@1094237 <h> More from Mag <h> Keep Calm and Stay at Home <p> It seems to me that impatience is some kind of global pandemic , sweeping across our iWorld where everything is new , glittering and instantaneous . <p> This was a thought that struck me as I made my way to dinner in Ranelagh early on Friday evening . Heading for the Luas just as it pulled out of its stop , I knew I would n't make it and did n't bother running , but others did . With the sun baking down , commuters contorted themselves into positions any Olympic gymnast would be proud of in an effort to avoid being shut in the doors of the tram . Some made it . For those who did n't ? Disaster . Pandemonium . A guy next to me , panting slightly and with a shiny brow from his impromptu workout , cursed at the bells of the train pulling away and cursed more loudly still on discovering that he 'd have to wait all of three more minutes before he could make his way home for his takeaway . <p> Our obsession with the Veruca Salt , I Want It Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we get home in the evening . It would appear that it 's infected our education , and there 's little that can be done to stop the contagion . Once upon a time , when leg warmers were deemed a social necessity , many had difficulty in seeing past the need for anything beyond second-level education . A good Leaving Cert was all that was required , providing the perfect platform from which the jump into the employment pool could be made . For many , third level was something that could only be achieved by going into a moderately tall building and stepping into a lift . <p> Then , something amazing happened . In an economic yarn that is by now so well told that to do so again would be to insult the intelligence of any reader , Ireland reached new heights of prosperity , and suddenly going to a third level institution was The Done Thing . Anyone that did n't was seen as some sort of miscreant , afraid to take on their future , while the Lord Alan Sugars of this world ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) became tr ? s chic , hailed rightly as heroes of the point that college is n't for everyone , but success can be . <p> Changing economic circumstances have seen Irish people once again put a high value on education , and university would appear to be no different . Today , you have to stand out from the crowd . Today , you have to show that you understand the difference between pancetta , panna cotta and Peter Pan . In the same way that going into Starbucks and ordering tea is seen as tremendously ordinary , going to college without doing an Erasmus year is seen as unquestionably , unflatteringly dull . Now , you have to go away . You have to order the Vanilla Rooibos tea . <p> I 'm not so sure that that 's fair . I myself examined Erasmus closely , but circumstances meant I could n't take part . Now , it 's a decision I 've learned to be happy with . True , it seems that my once thriving social circle is now so diminished that any question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing tonight ? ' will likely be met with ' Dinner for one , wine for two ' as an answer , but in my experience these things have a habit of working themselves out . I 'm not sure too that the fact I ca n't slap down a year spent at the University of GodKnowsWhere on my CV is putting me at an immediate disadvantage , in terms of life experience or employability . Life is what you make it , not where you are located . <p> I 'm equally unsure that Erasmus is of much benefit in the medium term either . This is , at the end of the day , a decision to spend twelve months of your life in a foreign country , where the food will be weird , the customs will be unfamiliar and the lectures ( even those through English ) may be completely unfathomable . Law ? History ? Business ? Through French ? ! I 'd rather not . Even modules available in the host university may not meet the standards of the domestic university , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long finger of fourth year . And lest we forget that in many cases , all this upheaval takes place against a backdrop of the Junior Sophister year accounting for as much as 50% of the final degree result . Bonne chance . <p> Costs . Blips . ' Dolla ' , apparently . It is an inescapable reality that we must mention money , but I do n't think it 's fair to nullify a debate on the pros and cons of Erasmus with a subjective , kill-all argument like cost . Given how nobody in this country can afford focaccia anymore , it would be remiss of any article like this not to at least advert to the thorny issue of money in some way , but it should n't be central to a debate like this . Costs of living are incurred everywhere , even if they vary from place to place . <p> All of these flaws in the jar of Erasmus ointment though can be overcome , and to those setting off on what will undoubtedly be a fabulous year abroad , I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every year and benefit greatly from the experience . Inevitably , you will clog our news feeds with pictures of you and your bronzed new friends with names that to us will be unpronounceable , and you 'll come back with a million stories and the European equivalent of a stick of rock . You 'll probably settle in brilliantly and achieve your academic potential and make us all jealous in the process . <p> No , none of that is the big issue , or at least not for me . I worked hard to get to TCD . I chose Trinity over any foreign university because it was where I wanted to spend four years . That was always the objective and the dream . Sure , I intend to study abroad for my postgrad , but as we stand , Trinity is home , and I 'm not that impatient to get away . <p> Good article , well done .... although Erasmus is a bloody good experience , I know myself that it provides little to no benefit in the long term , unless you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a year long drinking holiday . Which is fine , although hardly constructive . Having said that .... best year of my life ! <p> ben <p> This article does just seem like a bitter rant about how he is not in fact on erasmus himself .... <p> Yurt <p> Well written article but I must agree with the above comment ! Sounds like a bitter student who is n't on Erasmus for whatever reason ! <p> There 's a difference between running for a Luas and letting one just pass you by . <p> Glen Rogers <p> I hardly agree with the premise that Erasmus third years are " The Done Thing " . <p> Emma <p> Wonderful article . I definitely do n't think an Erasmus is the be-all and end-all of our college lives . My course does n't offer an Erasmus program so I do n't feel the pressure as much . I think they are an excellent idea if you can afford both the effort and money but they definitely do not define us as students or potential employees . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@1145239 <h> Gene Kerrigan : A sensational and startling case in a time of innocence <h> As Malcolm Macarthur is released from jail , Gene Kerrigan explains why we remember his crimes so vividly <p> Malcolm Macarthur was an appalling person who killed two people because he could n't think of anything better to do . He had a plan , it was a stupid plan -- and the killings derived not from some inbred desire to kill but from a willingness to do whatever was necessary to get what he wanted . <p> The reason we of the older generation remember him so vividly is that the Macarthur case was a sensation at a time of relative innocence . The scandals that would undermine so much of public life had n't yet been found out . The circumstances of Macarthur 's arrest made the case startling -- although the crimes themselves were quite straightforward . The reasons he murdered two people were shatteringly banal . <p> Malcolm MacArthur was from a wealthy background and had inherited a large amount of money in the Seventies and had grown used to a life of leisure . He liked swanning around Dublin , drinking pints and portraying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an air of what he seemed to believe was sophistication . <p> However , by 1982 his inheritance had been squandered and he was running out of money . He and his partner had been on holiday abroad , with their child . He came back to Dublin alone , determined to get his hands on cash , and stayed at a guest house in Dun Laoghaire . He decided on a robbery . <p> Better get a gun , he thought . He bought a pistol crossbow and cut off the crossbow bit , but it was n't a convincing gun . Then he saw a newspaper advert , shotgun for sale . The seller lived down in Offaly , so Macarthur decided to steal a car , to drive there . <p> Now , today and back then , all over this country there are kids who can get into your locked car , and start the engine , using little more than their big sister 's nail file . Lacking such skills , Macarthur bought a heavy hammer , to hit someone , to kill them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since he could n't leave the body lying around , alerting the police to search for the stolen car , he also bought a shovel . To bury the body . <p> On 22 July , 1982 , he went up to the Phoenix Park and found Bridie Gargan , a young nurse , sunbathing near her car . He made her get into the car and he hit her with the hammer . Then , his stupid plan went wrong . Driving away , he was spotted by an ambulance crew , who thought he was a doctor bringing an accident victim to hospital . They insisted he follow them as they drove ahead , the siren moving traffic aside . <p> The scene inside the car was horrific . Macarthur eventually abandoned the car , leaving behind the dying nurse . <p> A couple of days later he got a bus down to Offaly . If he 'd thought of that in the first place he need n't have tried to steal a car . In which case , he would n't have killed Bridie Gargan . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling the shotgun . They took the gun to a quiet place , to test it . Dunne wanted ? 1,100 , which Macarthur could n't afford . Macarthur shot him dead with the shotgun , and drove the farmer 's car back to Dublin . <p> So far , to get a car which he later decided he did n't need , he had killed Bridie Gargan . To get a gun to carry out hold-ups , he killed Donal Dunne . Now , armed and ready for a life of crime , he went to a house in Killiney . He vaguely knew the man who lived there , an American named Harry Bieling . He pointed the gun and demanded money . Bieling ran away . <p> And that was the end of Macarthur 's career as an armed robber . <p> By now , the police were searching for a killer in Dublin , who used a hammer .

He asked Macarthur along to an All-Ireland hurling semi-final at Croke Park , where they sat in the VIP box . One report said that as the police scoured the city for the killer , Macarthur was shaking hands with another VIP at Croke Park , the Garda Commissioner . <p> Having attempted to rob a man who might identify him , Macarthur had the bright idea of ringing the police to inform them that the attempted robbery at Bieling 's house was a joke , a prank , a jolly jape . This , and some other dodgy behaviour , led police to concentrate on the Dalkey area . <p> One night , Paddy Connolly was returning to his flat in his State car , driven by a garda , when he was stopped from entering -- the police had it surrounded . A bemused Connolly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the shotgun , and some papers that suggested to them that Macarthur had been planning to electrocute someone , possibly his mother . Perhaps , in his search for an easy life , inheritance -- rather than armed robbery -- was more in his line . <p> Macarthur pleaded guilty to Bridie Gargan 's murder , which spared the State a trial , and in return there was no trial for his murder of Donal Dunne . <p> Two brutal , stupid , killings ; a case made memorable by the fact that a hunted killer was found in the Attorney General 's home ; the attachment of Charlie Haughey 's name -- causing a wave of unfounded gossip -- all ensured the case would be remembered .

@@1165233 <p> A CLONAKILTY-based Labour councillor is calling for action from the Government to deliver a state insurance scheme for flood-risk areas such as Clonakilty , Skibbereen and Bandon . <p> Cllr Aidan Pendlebury said , " The necessity for such a scheme here in West Cork after the devastation of Clonakilty , Bandon and Skibbereen over the last few years can not be highlighted enough . <p> " The current government stance on the issue is less than acceptable and it is only through pressure from both media and public that they will be forced to re-examine the issue , " he said . <p> A motion passed by Clonakilty Town Council in August and sent to the Department of Finance called for " a comprehensive programme of flood preventative works as a matter of utmost importance " . <p> Cllr Aidan Pendlebury <p> The motion went on to state : " while there is a need to carry out repairs to structures following the floods , this Council supports the idea that the focus of the programme is on major preventative works rather than necessarily the provision of flood relief " . <p> The motion also called for the government provision of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and residents in flood danger areas who are unable to avail of insurance cover from the private sector . <p> Despite the urgency of the call the Department responded that the approach " is not considered financially viable " because over time it runs the " serious risk of incentivising the insurance industry to discontinue the provision of cover in medium and high risk areas thus making the cost of such a scheme prohibitive " . <p> Cllr Pendlebury said , " There are numerous points that must be made to highlight the invalidity of such a stance . <p> " Firstly , the insurance industry have shown no intention to continue the provision of cover in medium and high risk areas , the motion itself was a product of that fact . <p> " This has been proven through a survey carried out by Deputy Kevin Humphreys of 1,000 homes in Dublin and is backed up by the irrefutable struggle of people in Clonakilty to claim on current insurance policies , along with the absolute rejection for any future cover .

" he said . <p> He added , " There will be degradation of commercial infrastructure leading to a drop in attractiveness for investment from companies both home and abroad . <p> " In Clonakilty for example , we have constantly striven to lead the way in the tourism industry , contributing to Ireland 's glowing reputation in this area throughout the world . <p> " If an insurance scheme is not provided in this area , it is almost a certainty , and not a probability , that we will no longer be able to offer the same high quality services to those that visit our town " . <p> He concluded , " The key point of my motion was that this government insurance scheme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scheme would expire at the same time these works are completed . <p> " Therefore on work completion , this would provide the private insurance sector the security they needed to once again provide a product for people in these areas which is viable to both parties .

I was at a friend 's house having lunch when her daughter burst through the kitchen door breathless with panic , dressed in her best clothes . <p> " Quick ! Brangelina are at the Swan ! " <p> " Damn , I knew we should have had lunch there today , " said my friend , pushing aside her roast chicken in disgust . <p> " Oh come on , " I said .

Of course we were . <p> She insisted we take her vintage Bentley , and the dogs , perhaps in a vain attempt to lord it over The Brangelina entourage and assert that this was our territory . <p> We need not have bothered . The Brangelina entourage was too much for anyone to try to take on . Huge , black shiny people carriers with privacy glass were pulled up across the entrance . <p> Inside , an entire wing of the gastro- pub was cordoned off . <p> The golden couple were only just visible in their hidey-hole . An eager crowd of women were distractedly trying to order drinks while peering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her broad shouldered , pony-tailed husband . <p> Number one , she has Brad Pitt .

Number four , she has very long , very thin legs , which she is prepared to flaunt by poking them provocatively through long dresses slit to the waist . <p> And she does this at a time when Poor Jen is struggling to get her latest useless boyfriend to propose to her . Has she no shame ? No mercy ? No modesty ? No , I tell you , she has none . <p> Number five , she flaunts her role as a UN goodwill ambassador , wearing saintly h e a d s c a r v e s when visiting displaced or starving peoples . <p> Only Princess Diana was allowed to wear a saintly headscarf in this way . <p> We are not prepared to allow a Hollywood actress , particularly one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saintly headscarf when on celebrity humanitarian missions . <p> Nor are we prepared to overlook the fact that whilst she wears this headscarf , there are adverts of her posing with Louis Vuitton bags in glossy magazines , referring to the fact that she really is a saint , because she has adopted children from places like Cambodia . <p> No , no , no . We will not have it . She is too much for us . She is too saintly , too successful , too clever ( she has a pilot 's licence ) too compassionate , too " wonderful inside and out " , as the comments on her YouTube videos for Louis Vuitton make clear . <p> Above all , she is just too much woman . There is something primal in us which tells us that in a battle for any man , including our own , Angelina would win hands down . <p> No man could resist those lips , those legs , those mysterious tattoos , the lure of the suggestion of a teensy bit of bondage , somewhere in her dim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queue for a lifeboat , the captain would tip out every single woman in order to rescue her . <p> By contrast , we women love Poor Jen , who despite being glamorous and beautiful , would be a team player and a good girl pal , we imagine . <p> The rule is this : There are women women like and women men like and the women men like , we women do not like . <p> The overly sensual-looking , earth-mother types are the most terrifying . <p> Take Christina Hendricks , the star of ' Mad Men ' . When the British Lib Dem equality minister Lynne Featherstone said women should aspire to look like her , instead of being too thin , she failed to grasp that telling women to look Hendricks was just as body fascist as telling them to get stick thin . <p> If you are a normal woman how , precisely , are you supposed to go about acquiring an hourglass figure as exaggerated as Ms Hendricks 's ? Presumably , one eats oneself fat then has a plastic surgeon chisel away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to put too fine a point on it , not only look too sensual but actually spell out the fact explicitly that they really , really enjoy sex . <p> Goodness , they scare the bejesus out of me . <p> Take Naomi Wolf , who is currently traumatising womankind with her latest book , ' Vagina : A New Biography ' . <p> Ms Wolf is one of those new-fangled ' third wave ' feminists who fret that there is no single feminist ideal . <p> In her first book , ' The Beauty Myth ' , which became an international bestseller , she argued that beauty , as a normative value , is entirely socially constructed and dictated by the patriarchy with the goal of maintaining its hegemony and exploiting women . <p> In her latest book , she worries that her orgasms are n't much good any more . <p> That 's a very short summary , I know . But reading extracts of the book were really challenging and I had to keep stopping in order to curl my entire body into the foetal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no , make it stop ... " because it was so embarrassing . <p> This is sad , because broadly speaking , I want to agree with her more , especially on body fascism . I feel she and I would see eye to eye on the Hendricks issue . <p> " The more legal and material hindrances women have broken through , the more strictly and heavily and cruelly images of female beauty have come to weigh upon us , " says Wolf . Hear , hear . <p> So why in the name of all that is holy does she have to start talking about her vagina ? I would n't mind if she were talking figuratively , but actual , physiological description of her plumbing ? Really , even ' third wave ' feminists who seek to empower us with knowledge can give us too much information . <p> We humdrum women who think sex is fair enough on high days and holidays but a bit of a kerfuffle when it comes down to it , just end up feeling threatened and nauseous when confronted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how much the ' third wave ' feminists try to get us to enjoy our sexuality , most women just do n't want to think about it . <p> Madonna is another offender on this score . <p> Having won our undying admiration for pushing back boundaries and reinventing herself over three decades , she then makes us cringe by rolling about on the floor and sticking her bottom in the air whilst cavorting to the strains of ' Je T'aime ' at the ripe old age of 54 . <p> Speaking of body fascism , women have also had enough of those celebrities who pose with what has now universally become known in the tabloids as a " postbaby body " . <p> One of the Kardashian women ( I ca n't remember which one , they 're all the same to me ) seems to be forever doing this . <p> No sooner have these women given birth , live on TV , obviously , than they are parading around their post-baby bodies , or PBBs , as they will surely come to be abbreviated , wearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parade around their baby bump . Demi Moore started the craze back in 1991 when she bared her bump on the cover of ' Vanity Fair ' , and it remains a deeply annoying trend today . <p> Friends tell me -- I can only imagine this having never given birth myself -- that if you are sitting at home in your velour tracksuit with a huge , non-celebrity pregnancy bump , the kind that is spreading down the backs of your legs and up into your neck and face , the last thing you want to see is an A-lister like the Kardashian woman ( I still ca n't remember which one ) posing with a perfectly shaped bump standing out of an otherwise perfectly svelte and chiselled body . <p> And there seems to be an arms race for the best baby bump now too . Someone called Raffaella Fico showed off her baby bump in a bikini on a catwalk at Milan Fashion Week the other week , for heaven 's sake . <p> Anyone with a wacky diet and exercise regime is also infuriating , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the sometime macrobiotic enthusiast and Evangalist Gwyneth Paltrow . <p> We would n't mind if she kept her love-hate relationship with nuts and seeds to herself but to foist it on the rest of us , insufferably self-satisfied cookbook and all , is beyond endurance . <p> Meanwhile , Eva Longoria was busy displaying her " perfect posteria " , which is to say posing on a bed partially covered by a sheet with her naked bottom to the camera in a shot described as " arty " -- I think we 'll be the judge of that . <p> Alienating , too , are the professional glamour-pusses who seem to have no occupation other than swanning through life in a series of perfect outfits and who never suffer a bad hair day or even the most minor wardrobe malfunction . <p> Liz Hurley falls into this category . I once went to a party attended by Ms Hurley and the second she walked through the door I realised that the dress I had thought was the most knockout thing in my wardrobe was , in fact , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shop . <p> " She 's probably been getting ready for five hours , " said a friend , trying to make me feel better . The only way one could like Ms Hurley would be if one could look like Ms Hurley , even just a little bit -- but as one ca n't , one really has no choice but to hate her . <p> She falls into that category of women who are out of most women 's league as a role model . Though we do n't like to admit it , we all like to aspire to look like celebrities , a little bit , and when we ca n't we turn on them with a vengeance . <p> Those who have the girl-nextdoor quality that makes us think , perhaps deludedly , that we can mimic their style have our unswerving devotion . Poor Jen , Amanda Holden and lovely little Cheryl Cole are examples of girl-next-door types who are beautiful but do n't alienate women . <p> Of course the other reason we ca n't like Ms Hurley is her new beau , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the former Australian cricketer , La Hurley has ventured into the shark-infested waters known in the tabloids as " muscling in on another women 's kids " . <p> Photographs of Hurley and Warne having a jolly time with his children , while rumours of the ex exwife 's discomfort abound , are lethal . <p> Anthea Turner has also fallen foul of this stricture . Ms Turner is by all accounts a devoted stepmother to the daughters of her errant husband Grant Bovey by his first marriage . <p> But there is such a thing as being too good a stepmum . Nothing , but nothing , is worse than a headline saying that you are " playing happy families " with someone else 's kids . <p> Ms Bleakley has ITV insiders entirely flummoxed because whichever show they put her on , she alienates female viewers . Her stint on ' Daybreak ' came to an undignified end after research showed that women did n't take too kindly to waking up to a girl with an enormous grin who had just got engaged . <p> I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She looks like she 's breaking those teeth in for Shergar , " said one , cattily . " She looks like the cat that 's got the cream , " said another . <p> The perception of smugness is the problem here . It 's fine to get engaged to a Chelsea player , per se , but when you ca n't stop smiling about it , and when you 're photographed playing happy families with his kids , it 's a problem . Jennifer Aniston would never , ever , play happy families with another woman 's kids . She is a woman 's woman , you see . She would put her girlfriends first . I have every faith in her , in that respect . <p> Political wives are rarely liked by women either . Carla Bruni was too glamorous for her own good , and did herself no favours by insisting on strumming the guitar and huskily reciting poetry . <p> Successful , beautiful women you can like are a rare breed indeed . Being unlucky in love is the main ingredient if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not cavorting in a basque , is mainly likeable now in so far as she has terrible trouble with men . <p> Ms Aniston , obviously , has us entirely on her side . No wonder Justin Theroux proposed in the end . If he had n't , he would probably have been lynched by an angry mob wearing T-shirts bearing the legend Team Jen . <p> Now that she 's happy , however , I wonder whether it is n't time for me to move on and make my peace with Angelina . I 'm worried that it really is a bit silly bearing this grudge . <p> Perhaps I should get over it and realise that even Angelina is just a woman struggling to cope with the expectations put upon her . <p> Maybe even she has off days when she gets out of bed looking like a scarecrow . Watching movie clips of her , I am struck not just by the wooden acting but by a strange vulnerability in her big brown eyes . <p> " What have I done to make you hate me so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the film ' Alexander ' . Oh dear , I feel guilty now . <p> In a spirit of reconciliation , I offer this sisterly olive branch : Ange , if you come to the pub again , and do n't sit in the cordoned off bit , I will buy you a glass of mineral water . I ca n't say fairer than that .

The only danger appeared to come from the over-zealous tackles committed by the home side , whose enthusiasm bordered on the reckless , with the cynical Brazilian , Felipe Melo , a repeat offender . <p> Despite his mastery of the dark arts , though , Melo is also a player capable of firing up his team-mates and it was his intervention early in the second half that pre-empted Galatasaray 's breakthrough goal . <p> With news of Cluj 's commanding lead at home to Braga being flashed on the stadium 's big screens , Galatasaray knew that they simply had to raise their game in order to remain in control of their Champions League fate . <p> And Melo summoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to crank up the decibel levels another notch with a display of fist-pumping after his powerful header had been tipped over by Lindegaard on 53 minutes . <p> The crowd responded and , from the corner which followed Lindegaard 's save , Yilmaz outjumped the static Powell to claim his fifth Champions League goal of the season to put Galatasaray ahead . <p> United attempted to respond , with Javier Hernandez and Anderson both having shots blocked , but their fightback seemed half-hearted . <p> They did not need to win , they were not fuelled by the same desire as Galatasaray , and it showed . <p> Only one team was pulling out the stops for another goal and it was Galatasaray , who were denied a second when Altintop 's 20-yard strike was tipped onto the bar .

Below , Courtney gives a very brief glimpse at the film , which , let 's be honest , is n't exactly going to be mindblowing in terms of plot at this stage in the series , but is still going to feature Bruce Willis covered in blood . Pretty sure that 's in his contract for every film he 's in . <p> There are also new posters and stills from the flick , informing us that we 'll be seeing a lot of things go boom in Russia while the father/son duo get beaten and carry heavy firearms . So nothing new in the Die Hard world then . And you only have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14th . Yes ladies , prepare to make a sacrifice for your men next year . They 've put up with enough Rom-Coms , let them have their one year yeah ? <h> Log in to leave a comment <h> Disclaimer <p> The opinions expressed in the comments section are those of the viewer and do not reflect those of Entertainment.ie .
