Even Nicole Kidman seems to be enjoying herself , devouring her role as the Aniston 's shallow frenemy . Sandler 's German-accented sheep-resuscitating sidekick Nick Swardson makes one bizarre character too many , and it 's 15 minutes longer than it needs to be , but with a believable romance and some great plastic surgery jokes , it 's actually not that bad .

@@4099233 <h> Sex and the older woman <h> Aida Austin <p> For many women , the realisation that their youthful sex appeal is gone comes as a shock . Aida Austin looks at this pivotal moment in time , when women have to face up to the reality that looking good for your age is as good as it gets . <p> ' I looked in the mirror one morning and saw the face of a stranger . Who was she , this haggard , bun-faced woman with the softening jawline , the downturned mouth , the world-weary air of a woman who has n't had what she wanted from life , and knows she is n't going to get it now ? Why , it was no one else but me , myself and I. ' <p> When I read these words , which come from Jane Shilling 's new book , ' The Stranger in the Mirror : A Memoir of Middle Age ' , I remember my own ' mirror moment ' , which came at age 40 , on a beautiful afternoon on a beach in Greece . <p> It suddenly dawned on me that being petite and having a sun-tan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's being worked way too hard . Age , I realised , had caught up with me and given me too many indignities for a bikini to forgive . <p> Shilling 's warm and honest account of the shock of finding herself suddenly middleaged is full of moments that many women of a certain age will gasp in recognition . <p> At 47 , she describes looking in the mirror one day and noticing that " instead of a delicate violet smudge , there was a livid indigo semi-circle beneath each eye . I gazed at myself in the mirror , and the image that looked back reminded me of a dismayed tortoise " . <p> On the morning I turned 45 , an old friend arrived with an Australian acquaintance to wish me happy birthday . The elderly Australian lady began to talk in earnest about ageing , how reaching her 50s had been about loss , a succession of bleak moments in which she realised her beauty was running out of steam . <p> " It 's hard to age when you 're beautiful , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just ca n't come to terms with what I see . I mourn the loss of my looks . " <p> She also spoke about how women suddenly " disappear " when they enter their fifties . The wisdom and calm that is supposed to come with age had offered her little in the way of compensation for becoming " invisible " . <p> It is a theme that Shilling returns to often . In her 30s , she had grown used to seeing herself reflected in the popular culture . But once she turned 50 , she noticed that " all of a sudden , there was apparently no one like me at all " . <p> Middle-aged women are under-represented in art , ignored by fashion and an easy target for comedians . Men , who had once paid them attention , now look over their shoulders at 18-year- olds , whose breasts and hips are padded to perfection and whose skin shouts " youth ! " at the top of its voice . <p> Shilling embarks on a bold exploration of what being middle-aged means . Like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an older woman with whom she can identify . The slippers and housecoat caricature of middle age is depressing and the artificially prolonged alternative unconvincing , never mind painful . <p> Shilling considers 50-plus fashions and is outraged . Style advice is limited to what is no longer allowed : knees and upper arms must remain out of sight , long hair ought to sit above the shoulder , sparkly eyeshadow should be used with extreme caution or , God forbid , we find the ' mutton ' tag attached . <p> What is recommended is even more depressing : Spanx pants and ' sharp tailoring ' . <p> She looks towards France , where midlife is regarded as a stage of intriguing maturity instead of a pitiable state , where attitudes to older women are less punitive and women grow into their skins with unapologetic panache . <p> For every woman who simply looks in the mirror and gives up , there are many sexually confident women who somehow manage to reconcile themselves to ageing and dismiss the tired ideology peddled by the media that being sexy equals being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bared all for our cover shot , has decided not to go gently into that good night of middle-age . " I was talking to my doctor and was blowing my own trumpet about how I was not really suffering with the menopause at all , " says Celia , who has no problem with admitting that she has turned 60 . <p> " I have mood swings and I 'm cross half the time anyway . My doctor got slightly annoyed with me and said ' Women really suffer with menopause ' and that I should be down on my knees with thanks that I was n't having hot flushes and other symptoms , so I really do appreciate how lucky I am . " <p> Celia rails against the idea of ' age-appropriate ' dressing , particularly when on holidays . " I wear my short clothes , low necklines and I enjoy myself because I am in a holiday mood and more adventurous . I think I 'm 20 again and I lose the run of myself . " <p> However , she tones it down somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Holman-Lee Modelling Agency in Limerick -- but still finds that other women applaud her youthful style . <p> " When I go around the country , women come up to me and say , ' Please darling , keep flying the flag for us older women , keep it up . ' They compliment me if I wear a low neckline or if the skirt is a bit shorter . They say it 's fantastic because you are being told to be ' ageappropriate ' but you can have a bit of fun too . " <p> " I have a good body shape . I 'm kicking myself that I only started to do weights and exercising two years ago . There is no way you can get away without exercising when you reach a certain age . I 'm reasonably confident about my body . I 'm not saying I 'm fantastic . I do a small bit of weights for my arms mainly and I do a bit of weight-lifting for my thighs as well . <p> " That 's how it is . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They did n't come from any exercise -- God gave me those . My legs are okay , but they would not be my best feature . I 've never had any work done . I 've did n't have a boob job , so I need plenty of help . " <p> If Celia is a model of pragmatism ( " I 'm very aware of the cold light of day , " she says , " I love soft lighting , soft lighting is my best friend " ) , she is also a model of confidence . <p> " I had no problems doing this shoot , " she announces . <p> But for other women , the ageing process can be more traumatic . Kate is a 56-year-old nurse . She 's tall , slim and , by any benchmark , attractive . She describes the gap between how she feels and how she looks . <p> " I had a kind of watershed moment last week at work . I overheard a patient refer to me as the ' old blonde one ' . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between how I see myself and how I look . It 's not that I think I look young , it 's just that I 'd thought other people might be able to see past my age , like I can . <p> " I 'm aware that I 'm transiting from one age to another . It 's weird having a body I 'm not quite sure I like that much any more . Sometimes I have this weird sensation of hardly being able to recognise it . " <p> Although her appearance is changing , this has negligible impact on her sexuality . " I feel odd about the fact that my body is softening , but this has got nothing to do with sex . One hundred per cent , I feel sexier now than I did in my 20s , " she says . <p> " You get better at something by doing it a lot . And women have practised sex for a long time by the time they hit their fifties . I know what I like , I know what my partner likes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every ageing woman , there 's an ageing spouse . <p> The loss of sexual allure , that moment when you suddenly become " invisible " to men , is a potent fear for women in their 50s . Holman-Lee , for instance , describes feeling an urge to shout " Remember us ! " when the photographers look set to overlook her in favour of twentysomethings at a red-carpet event . <p> Yet sexual attraction does not depend solely on firm flesh and shining hair . With age , women become more sexually adept and more at home in their own bodies , according to relationship psychologist Susan Quilliam , co-author of ' The New Joy of Sex ' . " There 's plenty of research that shows sex gets better for women as they get older . It 's one of the best-kept secrets of women 's lives , " she says . <p> " There 's a pressure to stay at a certain stage of development and not grow any older , " she adds . " It 's in the culture everywhere -- not just in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit , I think . Not everything about ageing is fantastic . No one loves every wrinkle . But it 's a part of life . " <p> For most of us , finding a way to carry femininity through midlife -- to preserve some kind of feminine vibrancy -- is part of what the ageing process is about . We might find some inspiration from Shilling who , at 53 , is closer to finding what she 's looking for . <p> " As it continues , the ageing process seems to me to be more about what remains than what is lost , " she writes . <p> " The bloom of early adulthood is bound to fade . But allure need n't necessarily vanish . It 's just that at 50 , it has less to do with the firmness of your flesh and more to do with the firmness of your sense of self . " <p> Her words reminded me of another inspiring role model for older women , the late Sarah Henderson , Aussie cattle-rancher , author and mother of five . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she once wrote . " Do n't wait for a light to appear at the end of the tunnel . Stride down there and light the bloody thing yourself . " <p> This quality of composure to which Shilling refers seems evident everywhere . Celebrities such as TV chef Nigella Lawson and broadcaster Marian Finucane appear to have a lovely audaciousness that suggests they have cracked a few of life 's secrets . <p> And when I consider my peers and friends , most of whom , like me , are too old to be young but too young to be old , there is scant evidence of the kind of excessive " mourning " that my Australian guest laid bare . <p> What registers most is not just the firmness of their sense of self but the firmness of their purpose , a purpose that 's defined by energy and optimism . <p> Women 's fears surrounding the ageing process are , more than likely , mostly paper tigers . Getting to the point of unambiguous middle age is a bit like jumping off the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit the water , but lovely once you 're in . And in one respect , middle age is the same as any other -- exactly what you make of it . Jane Shilling 's parting advice might be worth remembering : " A great pair of shoes and a good concealer makes life seem better at any age .

@@4166237 <h> After a bad accident left her flat on her back , Danish musician Oh Land found creative freedom in music . It saved her life , she tells Ed Power <p> Looking as if she 's wafted out of a glossy shampoo commercial , Nordic pop sensation Nanna ' Oh Land ' Fabricius sits in the back of a dingy tour-bus winding its way through the outer suburbs of Amsterdam . <p> The contrast between the glamorous singer and her dowdy surroundings is so stark as to be almost comical . With to-die-for cheekbones , immaculate hair and a smile that splits the difference between Claudia Schiffer and Brigitte Bardot , she more closely resembles a Hollywood actress playing a pop star than a real-life musician en route to a gig at a pokey rock club . <p> It 's hard not to be cynical . In fact , Oh Land is the antithesis of the manufactured starlet you might at first take her for . A self-taught multi-instrumentalist , the 26-year-old has lifted herself up by the bootstraps as surely as any plucky indie underachiever . Far from being groomed by a manipulative record label , her career is a story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal after moving from Denmark to the United States , hustling for gigs in a country where she knew nobody and , by her own admission , barely spoke the language . Back home she had been a ballet dancer of some promise until a serious back injury left her bed-bound for a year , a trauma that casts a melancholic pall over her music . <p> Most surprising of all , perhaps , is her friendly , unassuming demeanour . Scandinavian pop singers have a deserved reputation for ice-princess imperiousness . But , despite being more physically striking and musically accomplished than many of her rivals , Oh Land radiates the sort of earthy self-effacement that is impossible to fake . <p> Right now , she is swigging a bottle of mineral water and , apropos of nothing , holding forth on her favourite topic of the moment , Darren Aronofsky 's balls-out bonkers ballet horror Black Swan . It is a subject to which Oh Land has evidently applied a considerable degree of contemplation . <p> " A lot of ballet dancers were very critical of the film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she says . " But , really , ballet is a tradition built entirely on clich ? s . What could be more clich ? d that standing on your toes in a tutu ! In the film , they did a good job . However , there is definitely a fine line between the character you play in a ballet and your own personality , and it 's a division that can get blurred . " <p> She speaks from experience . Before damaging her back at the age of 18 , ballet had been Oh Land 's entire life ( the stage alias , incidentally , is a Anglicisation of her middle name , ? land ) , when she suffered a slipped disk and had to spend 12 months recuperating , she was forced to reassess not merely her professional ambitions but her entire sense of who she was . <p> " In losing dance , I was n't only losing a hobby , I was losing part of myself , " she says . " I struggled with an identity crisis . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are dedicated to something , you think of it as the one aspect of your life you can rely on . When it goes , what do you have left ? " <p> Oh Land describes ballet as an addiction and means it literally . If you dance for nearly 40 hours a week through your entire adolescence , your body develops a taste for that adrenaline , she says . <p> " To have that supply suddenly cut off can be wrenching . " Bed-bound and in shock , she turned to music because it was the only way she could truly feel free when the future she had spent years working towards was collapsing around her . <p> " It 's not just a job that you have lost . It 's your body also , " she says . " I had to deal with going from all that training every week to suddenly nothing . It was a very bad time for me and I was struggling with a lot of issues . I could n't move basically . What I could do was sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying completely still is a great freedom . It saved me in many ways . " <p> Charming , glamorous and with an arsenal of glittering cyberpop , for Oh Land pop global fame would appear a foregone conclusion . If there 's a speck in the ointment , it 's that her timing might be better . Released this month , new mini-album White Nights sees her chasing a bandwagon that , arguably , chugged out of the station a good 18 months ago . Already on board are Florence and the Machine , Bat for Lashes , La Roux , Lykke Li and dozens of others . With the female synth warrior genre moving from bleeding edge to passe , Oh Land could be accused of being a straggler rather than the outlier she clearly regards herself as . <p> Happily , such misgivings wilt when you listen to White Nights . Transcending its one-woman-and-her-Moog origins , the record attests to Oh Lands gifts as arranger , composer of melodies and lyric writer . What 's especially striking is the intense sadness that clings to the project like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , the LP sets upbeat melodies side by side with a keening sense of regret . Listening closely it sounds as if her first year in the US was a baptism of angst . <p> " The songs were written at a time when I was moving away from everybody , " she says . " From family , friends , my culture . There were language barriers . <p> " Everything was new and exciting -- as it always is when you are chasing something . At the same time , there was a lot of loneliness and a sense of not belonging . I turned up in America not really knowingly anyone . I went there because I had heard there was this festival called South by South West which got a lot of attention . I got there without any contacts and arranged my own tour . It was a strange time for me . I came out of it a lot stronger , I think . " <p> Statuesque and striking , Oh Land is often assumed to have graduated to music via the fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though she 's been asked -- sometimes begged -- to go into modelling , the profession has never held any attraction . For one thing , her family is famous within Danish classical music circles and would probably be aghast were she to do so . More than that , however , the thought of working as a professional clothes horse horrifies her . <p> " I used to be requested to do it when I was younger . I was busy with a lot of other things . Plus , I 've always been very opinionated and wanting to create my own little world . I do n't think I would be very suited to that sort of career . " <p> She 's halfway through her first European tour and has been selling out dates since the start . Having been generally ignored in this part of the world the media , too , is finally paying attention ( she 's had no such difficulty in the US , where glossy titles such as Vogue , Interview and Black Book have lined up to interview her ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will truly shift into the fast lane when she goes on tour with Katy Perry . The risque pop princess apparently hand-picked Oh Land for a string of support slots after stumbling upon one of her videos on YouTube . Though the two have never spoken , Twitter salutations have been exchanged and Oh Land is psyched about a face to face meeting . <p> " I 'm not snobbish about music , " she says . " If people can connect with a piece of music and get something out of it , then good for them . " <p> It is , of course , impossible to discuss an exotic new female pop star without conversation straying towards the ' G ' word . We would be overstating the case to claim Oh Land is strongly influenced by Lady Gaga . Still , there are parallels . <p> On stage , both like to dress extrovertly and if the Dane has never arrived at an awards ceremony in a lamb-chop skirt she has certainly pushed boundaries in her own way . For all that , she is visibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm not really affected by Lady Gaga , " she demures . " I grew up listening to Bjork . To me , what Gaga does is not original . "

There was me , a slippery log and a river that I had to cross somewhere deep in the in the Catskills Mountains in upstate New York . How had Jennifer Grey made this look so easy ? <p> My three friends had each skipped across the wooden log with the agility of a tight rope walker . But now I stared at the tree trunk , which to me looked like it had been coated in crude oil , my feet cemented firmly in place . <p> Like a parent trying to talk their child through unlocking themselves from the bathroom , one of my friends offered words of support : " Go on Molly , it 's just one foot in front of the other , it 's not that slippery , come on baby steps does it . " In a not so encouraging manner my other friend decided to capture the entire thing on video . <p> Much like a tree 's branches blowing the wind I stood there , my feet glued to the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? <p> It had all started a few weeks prior , over dinner in Brooklyn someone mentioned camping and a few of us squealed in excitement at the prospect . The wheels of motion were set in place , what better way to escape the chaos and blinding lights of NYC ? <p> The promise of rain did n't dampen our spirits as we hit the road early Saturday morning . Speeding over the GW Bridge leaving Manhattan behind , we were satisfied we had made all the necessary provisions . <p> Just over two hours later we were weaving through the winding roads of Columbia County . A dirt road led us into the campsite in Livingston Manor , our home for the next 24 hours . <p> City folk strike one- we realized the place did n't accept credit cards , as the four of us pooled our limited cash together hopeful we had enough . <p> Heidi , the owner of the campsite greeted us with a concerned face and friendly manner . Inside the reception area , which doubled as a shop , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I immediately thought of collecting cip ? ns ( firewood ) from the cow shed as a child . <p> " Did it rain a lot where you all came from last night , " Heidi asked with a concerned look on her face . <p> " It rained a hell of a lot here , the site I was going to put you in is flooded now , so maybe have a walk over to this other spot and check that out , " she told us . <p> We set out with a map and careful instructions on how to get to our site . Regardless we went the completely wrong way , walked up a hill as water tickled down and only stopped when one of us pointed out the absence of any tents or people . <p> Retracing our steps , we found our spot .

But I have been building fires all my life ... so it 's easy for me . " <p> I felt the need to interject and explain that I too had grown up on a farm and was schooled in the ways of the wild . My friend shot me a deserved look of disgust . I sounded like an idiot . <p> After pitching our tent on the softest piece of ground we could find ( it was pretty damn hard ) we set off on our hike to sample the surroundings . <p> City folk strike 2 -- never leave the trail .

A decision which would later lead to my blundering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midway through the hike ( which was if anything more of a leisurely stroll ) . We were soggy and uncertain of our direction , but the river offered the only guidance we needed . <p> Back at camp , despite feeling like we had completed a full days activities , the little hand on my watch pointed to two pm . Time really does faster in the city I reflected . <p> With the day stretching before us like an unfamiliar road , we all decided a trip into the nearby town was a splendid idea . <p> Livingston Manor is small town , with few amenities and a unique charm . After taking care of our cash-flow problem at the local bank we hit up the grocery store . At the check out the cashier saw right through my manicured nails and Irish brogue . <p> " You guy 's camping ? " she asked . Someone mumbled in response and she paused for a brief second before a smile spread across her face ; " Nice weather you 're getting !

The five guys at the bar turned to look at us when we walked into the local . Three young boys struggled to see over the pool table as they attempted a game and I am almost sure the jukebox screeched to a halt to announce our arrival . After proving we were above the drinking age the female bartender handed over a few watery beers and we made our way outside into the sunshine . <p> Mid way through our beers the rain reappeared and we agreed it was time to head back to base camp .

At the end of it we barely made it the few steps to the tent to pass out . <p> The next morning we rose at the crack of dawn and made our way back into the town for breakfast . <p> Who needs Starbuck 's when the local diner sells the " World 's Best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white haired lady old enough to be our grandmother took our order from the handwritten menu .

This had been one fast and furious camping trip . <p> Growing up in Ireland my aunts and uncles spoke fondly about summer time in the Catskill Mountains , a mecca for the Irish . I had always imagined it to be some exotic place ; to be honest up until a few years ago I was pretty sure it was a ski resort . <p> Satisfied I had finally made the journey myself it dawned on me why the Irish loved the place so much .

@@4256238 <h> Ten ways to access extra milk quota for your farm <h> Farmers interested in increasing the amount of quota they can fill need to know the rules <h> Aisling Meehan <p> It 's not so long ago that dairy farmers were told that quota was a thing of the past . How times have changed . Almost every co-op in the country is over quota at present , and supplies still show no sign of letting up . <p> Dairy farmers are now wracking their brains to see if there is some loophole that they can exploit to maximise the volume of milk that they can supply . <p> The following are the 10 key ways to access additional quota and the rules that apply . <p> 1 Transfers of quota with land -- This can be done by either the sale or lease of land and quota . In the case of the former , a producer may sell quota with land to the highest bidder . If the amount of milk quota that attaches to the land exceeds 12,500l/ha , ministerial consent is required prior to the sale . In relation to the latter , a producer may only lease land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is defined as ' a person 's parent , grandparent , spouse , sibling , child , grandchild , aunt , uncle , nephew , or niece or a person related within the same degree to his or her spouse ' ; <p> *A company in which he or she holds a majority shareholding ; <p> *Or a company in which producers hold a majority shareholding . <p> Remember , a farmer can sell land used for milk production and retain the milk quota . There are no provisions governing how long the producer must have owned the land before he/she can transfer it while retaining the quota . <p> Consequently , it should be possible for a producer to purchase land and quota , and dispose of the land almost immediately while retaining the quota for production on the producer 's remaining milking platform . <p> 2Purchase of milk quota by lessee -- A person who leases land with the quota which attaches to it for at least 12 months , or a person who has inherited the lessee 's interest in such a lease , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lessee before 1 April , 2000 can buy out the quota with or without the land on the expiry or earlier termination of the lease . <p> 3Purchase of milk quota from a ' qualified relative ' -- A producer may acquire milk quota without land from a ' qualified relative ' . <p> 4Purchase through the Milk Quota Trading Scheme ( MQTS ) -- The MQTS is operated by the Department in advance of the relevant milk quota year and is run on a co-op area basis . Each year , two exchanges take place with application closing dates under the 2011/2012 MQTS of November 5 , 2010 ( first stage ) and January 28 this year ( second stage ) . <p> Under the scheme , a maximum of 30pc of the quota offered for sale is made available to priority category producers at 5c/l . The remainder is traded on the market exchange at a Market Clearing Price , which under the last scheme ranged from 5-35c/l . <p> 5Lease through the Milk Quota Temporary Leasing Scheme ( MQTLS ) -- The MQTLS is operated during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease , through their milk purchaser on a temporary basis , all or part of their milk quota to other producers in the same milk purchaser area . To be eligible , the producer must first supply at least 20pc of his/her milk quota unless the minister consents to temporary lease of 100pc due to force majeure or other duly justified cases . <p> Successors and producers with Lost Lease Entitlements who have unfulfilled entitlements under the MQTS have priority to lease quota from the MQTS . In the 2011/2012 first stage , which closed on June 24 , the price was set at 2c/l . The second stage of the scheme , which will close on January 13 next year will have a fixed price of 1c/l . <p> 6Flexi-milk Scheme -- This scheme is administered after the end of the milk quota year and allows smaller producers to have a moderate level of over production covered by the milk purchaser and/or national unproduced milk quota . Ninety per cent of all unused milk quota within a milk purchaser is to be made available to producers with quotas less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to producers with quotas greater than 350,000l . <p> 7Allocations from the National Reserve -- Applications on the grounds of hardship and animal disease are assessed by the Milk Quota Appeals Tribunal , which makes recommendations to the Minister for Agriculture . Allocations of up to 45,000l may also be made to certain organic producers who hold an organic licence and are , at the date of application , delivering milk to a recognised organic milk purchaser or selling organic milk products directly . <p> 8Milk Production Partnerships ( MPPs ) -- MPPs allow farmers to pool resources , most specifically quota which can be produced from a single herd and milking parlour while retaining individual access to milk quota through the MQTS and the MQTLS . <p> 9Scheme for the Allocation of Milk Quota to New Entrants -- Under the terms of the 1pc milk quota increase over the period 2009 to 2013 , 0.25pc is being allocated to new entrants to dairying . The scheme provides for a maximum allocation of 200,000l of quota to two New Entrant Categories namely : <p> *Category A -- Brand new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dairying through the MQTS . <p> In order to be eligible for consideration for the scheme an application must be submitted with a closing date under this year 's scheme of April 8 . <p> Under this year 's scheme , 84 new entrants were allocated milk quota , 53 of which were ' brand new ' entrants who had not previously held quota . <p> 10Cow or milk facility leasing -- Producers may make arrangements with other producers who are unable to produce milk up to the full amount of their milk quota due to insufficient cow numbers to lease some or all of their cows in order to produce their full quota entitlement be that north or south of the Border . <p> Disclaimer : While every care is taken to ensure accuracy of information contained in this article , solicitor and tax consultant Aisling Meehan does not accept responsibility for errors or omissions howsoever arising .

Figures released this week show that the programme , the first of its kind in Ireland , has had a huge impact on reducing cardiovascular disease ( CVD ) and that the outcomes achieved at the end of the 16 week programme were maintained by the time one year follow-ups took place . The launch of the results was attended by presidential candidate Michael D Higgins who acknowledged and commended the great work of Cro ? as a charity dedicated to the fight against heart disease and stroke . <p> This evidence based programme was launched in Galway in collaboration with Imperial College London with some support from HSE West Primary Community and Continuing Care Department and MSD Ireland .

@@4335239 <h> Official hits out after draw between relegation rivals <p> The PRO of Drumlane Sons of O'Connell has expressed his disappointment at the outcome of the league after his club 's senior team were relegated . <p> While Drumlane were beaten by Killeshandra ( who were also relegated ) last weekend in the final round of the league , a draw between Killygarry and Cuchulainns was sufficient to secure both of those teams ' Division 1 status , regardless of the Drumlane result . Meanwhile , Lacken , who were also in relegation trouble , defeated a weakened Castlerahan team by 20 points . <p> Had Drumlane beaten Killeshandra , they would still have been relegated thanks to the draw between Cuchulainns and Killygarry , who both finished on 11 points but with a superior score difference to Drumlane , who finished on nine points . <p> However , either Cuchulainns and Killygarry could have been relegated had they lost and Drumlane won , while a draw was sufficient to keep both up in any event . The Cuchulainns match , which was played at the same time , proved academic as Drumlane lost their match . <p> " I went to the Killygarry-Cuchulainns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , " said PRO Brian Seagrave . <p> " It has been a fantastic league , with 15 rounds , and I 'm disappointed that it finished in this way . " <p> Seagrave , a well-known official who is also chairman of Bord na nOg , stated that had Drumlane won , the other results could have been crucial . <p> " Drumlane were beaten but the other two clubs got the draw they both needed , " he said . <p> Killygarry secretary Noel McHugh , however , refuted any suggestion that the teams played for a draw . <p> " There 's no question about the result ... It was only with three or four minutes to go that a draw appeared likely . The teams were even , nobody wanted to risk anything . Players know what 's at stake , " he said . <p> " It was done and dusted without us , I 'm not great on the permutations myself which shows how good I 'd be at rigging things ! But the result in Killeshandra meant that it would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very hard to rig a 1-9 apiece scoreline . Cuchulainns were four points up at one stage so it was n't as if it was tit for tat . " <p> Cuchulainns PRO Paul Taite stated that , infact , Cuchulainns had to battle to earn a draw in the match . <p> " I was n't at the game , I know it was a draw , 1-9 each , Killygarry got a goal in the second half that got them two points up , " he said . <p> " It was n't pre-arranged , definitely not . My brother was playing and he said Cuchulainns had the upper hand and seemed to be going well , then Cathal Keaney , who is a cousin of ours , came on and got a goal and Killygarry went ahead and Cuchulainns had a bit to do to get back and get level and that 's the way it ended . <p> " Killygarry nearly scored a second goal , again I was n't at it but I heard that Mark Clarke , our goalkeeper , made a really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the county board last week stressed that no re-scheduling of fixtures was permitted for the final round . <p> With a county final in two weeks ' time , Castlerahan fielded an understrength side against Lacken , who won by 1-21 to 0-4 , in Crowe Park .

We know now that the first 1,000 days of life is the most sensitive period for determining lifelong health . " <p> Barker believes that there are a series of critical phases involved in turning a male sperm and female egg into a fully developed baby , and if conditions are not perfect at every phase -- say if the father smokes or drinks excessively , or if the mother is stressed or obese -- then the ' build quality ' of that child is compromised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is perfectly healthy but who nonetheless may grow into an adult who is predisposed to chronic illness in later life . <p> " All diseases may be expressions of key developments in the womb , " said Barker .

" <p> For mothers who are undernourished or who are eating too little of the right things such as vitamin D , or too much of the wrong things such as sugary cakes , then the structure of the organs of the developing baby may be affected , Barker says . <p> " Growth has a pattern , " said Alan Jackson , Professor of Nutrition at Southampton University . " Everything has a time and place and if that gets interrupted then you can catch up , but there are consequences .

There is growing evidence that diet and lifestyle choices affect paternal lines too , with the genetic information in the father 's sperm thought to be susceptible to outside influences . <p> Such theories may explain why some fathers who smoke are more likely to have children who develop childhood cancers , even if they quit the habit before their child is born . <p> " You are what your dad ate , " said Professor Anne Ferguson-Smith of Cambridge University . <p> For would-be parents , the news that the future health of their child may have already been determined by the actions of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerve-wracking time . <p> But experts such as Prof Barker warn that all is not lost and that eating well , and enjoying a healthy lifestyle -- preferably long before you decide to conceive -- will still ensure that your child , and possibly their future children , will enjoy long and healthy lives to come .

Sin City , 300 and Road to Perdition all punched well above their weight at the box office . <p> One of the most powerful writers in this vein is Frank Miller , the man behind Sin City , 300 and some of the best Batman graphic novels . He may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Occupy protesters -- " a pack of louts , thieves , and rapists , an unruly mob , fed by Woodstock-era nostalgia and putrid false righteousness . These clowns can do nothing but harm America " -- in a vindictive piece on his blog that would perhaps be more suited to the streets of Sin City . This is unlikely , though , to diminish him in the eyes of the people he has made the most money out of -- Hollywood . <p> Frank Miller -- not a happy chappie <p> This point was made by Rick Moody in the Guardian , in a piece where he also attacks Hollywood 's output as " a mindless , propagandistic ( or ' cryptofascist ' ) storytelling medium " -- no argument here . Where Moody goes off the rails is where he claims " comic books themselves are so politically dim-witted , so pie-in-the-sky idealistic as to be hard to take seriously " . That 's a mighty big brush he 's tarring with . <p> Perhaps Moody draws a distinction between comic books and graphic novels , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthwhile film , and what is merely a piece of Hollywood cryptofascist propaganda . <p> Graphic novels are every bit as powerful and engaging as their wordier , pictureless colleagues . They bring a cinematic edge to literature , create an accessibility that it would be foolish to dismiss as puerile , and open up good writing to a much wider readership who might otherwise not engage with a straightforward novel . They also allow a writer a whole other level of creative freedom and offer a collaborative process where writers , illustrators , inkers and letterers are working in tandem to create something complete , satisfying and deeply meaningful . <p> If novels are the standout solo acts , with a little production help from editors and trusted advisers , then graphic novels have the potential of a full band , playing out of their skins towards a common artistic goal . <p> When I was a teenager -- Miserable music ! Miserable clothes ! Long hair and scowly looks ! -- few books had a greater impact than those of Neil Gaiman , and his Sandman series in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with characters that dwelled in the shadowlands between the mystical and the gutter . The kernel of his plotline , that the universe ticked along nicely thanks to seven Endless beings who were neither humans nor gods but simply were , felt revolutionary . The characters themselves -- Death , Destiny , Dream , Destruction , Desire , Delirium , and Despair -- seemed more accurately drawn , in the figurative and emotional sense , than nearly any other characters I had encountered in mainstream novels . <p> It did n't hurt that Death , rather than being a grim reaper , was an effortlessly fun hip and cool goth girl that every grunge or metal-loving teenager would want as their friend . Teenagers are obsessed with death , so Gaiman took the concept , personified it and made the result sunny , bright and attractive , removing the morbidity and some of the mystery , especially in his spin-off edition , Death : The High Cost of Living . It 's uplifting and considerate , and will strike a chord with most people struggling to understand themselves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time . <p> Gaiman is not afraid of big ideas , and in the series , and his other works , he introduces elements of philosophy , theology and history , and while he uses magical realism , there is a real heart to this writing . Art Spiegelman 's work is more direct , and proof incarnate that you do n't need to use a words-without-pictures format to deal with the most serious of topics . <p> Maus is one of the finest books ever written about the Holocaust . It is the biography of Spiegelman 's Polish father , starting with his life at home , the time he spent in concentration camps , and his later years in New York . In it , the Nazis are depicted as cats and Jewish people as mice . It took 13 years to write , is the only comic to ever win a Pulitzer prize , and was published in two volumes , in 1986 and 1991 . On the 20th anniversary of its publication , Pantheon Books released a companion to the books called Meta Maus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Spiegelman interviewing his father . <p> Maus is not an important graphic novel -- it is one of the defining works of documentary art of recent decades . <p> The impact of Maus has been far reaching , but there is another graphic novel that , even if you have never read a comic in your life , you may still have seen its influence in recent weeks , without quite realising it . It is on the pages of newspapers and magazines , and on nearly every television news bulletin -- and it leads us neatly back to the Occupy protesters who have so enraged Frank Miller . <p> One symbol has come to tie together the Occupy protesters across the world , and it 's an image that , as newspapers start churning out their year-in-review articles to fill the empty pages between Christmas and New Year , editors will no doubt turn to in their droves : the elegant , eerie white mask that hundreds of thousands of Occupy protesters have adopted . It 's a strange and odd symbol , seemingly blank of meaning but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to crack its knuckles in a leering way ; looking at that mask on droves of people , with its unflinching , intimidating stare , there is only one conclusion -- change is coming , but quite what will happen next is anyone 's guess . <p> Many commentators have linked it to Guy Fawkes , and that is its original inspiration . But the mask is a key piece of symbolism from one of the most vital comic books of the last few decades , one that drew on the ideas in books such as George Orwell 's singular Nineteen Eighty-Four and took them a step further , a comic book that envisioned a police state in Britain , controlled by an authoritarian government that is overly reliant on surveillance and a central computer system to keep a check on a largely passive populace . <p> V for Vendetta by Alan Moore was made into a terrible film , but do n't let Hollywood 's destruction of its ideas dilute the potency of the original book . The book was published between 1982 and 1985 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many of his outlandish ideas have become almost everyday realities , and secondly , how the imagery he created , together with illustrator David Lloyd , have leaked into today 's culture of protest , dissent and upheaval , of a demand for change and a better way of organising society . <p> The Anarchist Cookbook <p> Moore gave a recent interview to the Guardian , but rather than appear to rush to the barricades , he comes across as someone quietly pleased that a book as profound as V for Vendetta is making its presence felt in a way that perhaps neither he , Art Spiegelman nor Neil Gaiman could ever have imagined . <p> Have to disagree with your comments on the film version of " V for Vendetta " . Obviously , given the nature of the medium , there is no way it could capture the depth , complexity and subtlety of character in the original novel . But given the limitations and constraints imposed upon him by the producers in Hollywood -- and the inevitable dumbing down that was to be expected -- I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What came across to me at least , was an adaptation by someone with a genuine affection for the graphic novel and the concepts of liberty and freedom it conveyed . And the scenes of Evey 's imprisonment and subsequent redemption still bring a lump to my throat and tear to my eye . But I 'm just an old-fashioned , romantic anarchist at heart , so what the Hell would I know ? ! <p> V for Vendetta was actually quite an enjoyable film . It was never going to match up to the book . Protesters can be idiots , but the world constantly needs somebody to agitate , question and rebel , even if it is ultimately futile it at least shows a willingness to try .. . <p> Sean May , Phiste -- Maybe I need to give it another shot . I 'm just such a fan of the book that I thought a really stunning film could have been made out of it that stayed true to the book . Sure it probably would n't have been a massive box-office smash but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Alan Moore wanted his name taking off the end result , you know it 's fallen short . <p> Laurence , in your piece you mentioned Neil Gaiman 's Sandman series and V for Vendetta , which were two of my favorites when I was young . Like you , I came up in the time of grunge and heavy metal , and went through a faze of wearing black and reading vampire ( Anne Rice ' s Vampire Chronicles ) and dark other dark fantasy novels . When my daughter turned 13 Neil Gaiman 's Sandman , along with his Graveyard Book were given to her straight away . What always strikes me as interesting is the distopian view of the future that is showcased particularly V for Vendetta . In that regard , I have something to share that is in this vain , I recieved an e-mail asking that I please write to my Senator and member of Congress ( I live in Philadelphia ) to kill a bill currently up for a vote , that would allow the indefinate detention of American citizens on US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat . I am not making that up . The 1st thing I thought about was Natalie Portman 's friend in the film version ( he was a journalist ? ) being taken out by police in his home with her hiding under the bed . Watching the crackdown on the Occupy Wallstreet movement in Philadelphia and around the country , we are now realizing how much of our own liberty we have given up in the name of security and the unfortunate startling reality in this country of police brutality . George Orwell is now required reading in High Schools , it is terrifying to see the future he predicted become reality . Here in the States , Big Brother is definately watching . We have cameras everywhere ( security , street cameras in Baltimore , traffic cameras , etc ) . Interesting piece Laurence . <p> Fairly written , Laurence ; though distinction between comics and graphic novels is really aimed at the issue of page count . <p> And the marketing thorn : well , it 's all about narrative . Miller 's works are primarily about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about crap . V for Vendetta caught on more rampantly because it 's also about consensus . A far more empowered driver for authors and readers . It lends a greater community function . <p> *Obligatory plug for my comic about life with epilepsy -- online for the reads* <p> Jennifer -- The parallels between Moore 's , Orwell 's and others ' dystopian views and what is happening right now are frightening . There are dozens of examples in the West ( not a term I like ) <p> Andy -- I do n't really make a distinction between comics and graphic novels . Would I be right in thinking that , as you are I think saying , comics are merely the individual issues and when collected together into a volume they magically become graphic novels ? I 've used the terms intentionally interchangably in the piece . <p> I think the article is correct in how it interchanges between the term ' comic ' and ' graphic novel ' . I would have always associated the term graphic novel with US sequential artists of the 80s who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Spiegelman and other contributors to publications like RAW . Also the term allowed this new breed to escape associations the art form had with the dominant superhero genre , which widely entertained the notion that self-governed censorship of the medium was necessary , through bodies like the Comics Code Authority . <p> There is a distinction however made in the francophone bande desine ? tradition , in that they use the term ' album ' to describe when the entire comic is collated into one publication , that may once have featured elsewhere episodically in publications like Journal de Tintin , ( A Suirve ) and Spirou . <p> Enda -- He took his name off it but he made money from the films . Or as Moore says : <p> " Well , I do n't own the baby anymore , Heidi ! referring to V for Vendetta The baby is one I put a great deal of love into , a great deal of passion and then during a drunken night it turned out that I 'd sold it to the gypsies and they had turned out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would send me increasingly glossy and well-produced pictures of my child as she now was , and they would very , very kindly send me a cut of the earnings .

@@4487239 <h> Reviving Religious Knowledge <p> By Charlie McBride Galway Advertiser , Thu , Dec 29 , 2011 <p> EIGHTEEN YEARS after it was first performed , Eamonn Kelly 's uproarious comedy Religious Knowledge is returning to The King 's Head for two reunion performances featuring the original cast of Gerry Conneely , Tommy Tiernan , Gary McSweeney , and Phillip Sweeny , directed , as before , by Fiona Kelly . <p> Religious Knowledge premiered at The King 's Head in June 1994 , and was the quintessential runaway success - playing to packed houses for a series of extended runs over the next two years . <p> Set in a school classroom in 1970 , in the aftermath of Dana 's Eurovision victory , the play gleefully sent up the Christian Brothers ' educational methods and had a sensationally cathartic effect on Galway audiences of the time . <p> There had been plays and short films about the Christian Brothers before , but they were always dark and brooding , whereas Kelly and co were out for laughs . Reviewing the play at the time for the Galway Advertiser , Jeff O'Connell found it to be " a side-splittingly funny excursion into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the textbook in pounding knowledge into reluctant heads " . <p> As Religious Knowledge prepares to make its eagerly-awaited return , author Eamonn Kelly met up for an afternoon coffee to reflect on the remarkable impact the play had on its audiences . <p> " It soon became clear to all involved that the show 's effect seemed far greater than the sum of its parts , " he observes . " A cult audience developed . Religious Knowledge had hit a raw nerve in its audience 's psyche . Or more accurately , a raw funny bone . <p> " The response was phenomenal . People came to see the show time and again . One man , a regular , came in one day and said , almost apologetically , ' This is my 15th time . ' Another group of regulars were Grow , the group for depression sufferers who regarded the show as the best therapy in town . " <p> During the show 's run , the cast would often drum up business by doing pre-show walkabouts in character on Shop Street - an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . <p> Kelly recalls : " I saw them in Easons one day , the ' schoolboys ' reading the comics and Gerry Conneely as the Brother hunting them out . Another day a group of American tourists saw them on the street and one of them yelled ' There they are ! ' They had a tourist magazine from America with a photograph of the cast taken by someone the summer before . " <p> Even though Religious Knowledge was a comedy first and foremost , it still connected powerfully with many people 's painful memories of their own schooldays and experiences of abuse , and the play was also being performed around the same time the clerical sex abuse scandals were beginning to break . <p> " Looking back it seems to me now that Religious Knowledge had somehow ' bumbled blindly ' into the zeitgeist , delivering laughs rather than outrage , " Kelly suggests . " It 's almost a clich ? in theatre circles to say that the audience cried with laughter . But in this case it was true , the audiences really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwent some form of gasping laughter-induced release of painful memories in the unlikely setting of The King 's Head . After each show stories of the Christian Brothers ' experience were told and retold . Occasionally an audience member would sit stony-faced , empathising with the ' pupils ' and reliving their own anger . <p> " It was not uncommon for an audience member to come backstage after the show to meet and thank the actors . One man , from Australia , broke down crying in the dressing room as he recounted his experiences . " <p> Kelly admits there was a measure of personal indignation behind the writing of the play . <p> " I remember we had a Brother who did teach us ' All Kinds Of Everything ' at school and he was crazy so I drew on that to an extent , " says Kelly . " But I also think the culture tends to concentrate on the extreme abuse cases and ignore the more casual putdowns that everyone endured . <p> " Being withered by sarcasm on a daily basis in your formative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I see a line from this to a general national lack of confidence to the role of alcohol in Irish society . Put simply , I believe the entire culture was left a little bit twisted , in both senses , by the church 's power . <p> " In that sense Religious Knowledge is a response , through ridicule , to the type of nonsensical madness I experienced as a child . I guess it 's this mild form of abuse , if you like , which so many people could relate to . " <p> The show 's audiences occasionally even included a Christian Brother or two , as Kelly recalls ; <p> " A Christian Brother who had kindly loaned us his soutane for the show came along one day and said ' It was a bit close to the bone . ' But a few days later he was back with another two Brothers and they all enjoyed it thoroughly . I remember when he came the second time , he sat side-on to the stage not really watching the actors , he just wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> One of the show 's most ardent fans was The King 's Head 's own Paul Grealish - he and three of the pub 's barmen once did their own rendition of the play at a house party , having memorised the lines from seeing it so often . It was Grealish who set the ball rolling about putting the play on again . <p> " It happened out of the blue really , " Kelly explains . " Paul rang me a few weeks ago to suggest it , he 'd already talked to Tommy and Tommy was very keen to do it . So we all got together and at the first rehearsal it became apparent that everyone still remembered all their moves and deliveries due to the show having been performed so frequently all those years ago . <p> " It feels like a school reunion ! Hopefully we 'll be joined for the reunion production by many of the ' regulars ' who contributed to making the show such a joy and success back then , along with people who may not have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea of the pure craic we knocked out of one of Ireland 's darker episodes . " <p> Religious Knowledge is on at The King 's Head on Monday January 9 and Tuesday January 10 . Tickets are ? 10 and available from the venue .
