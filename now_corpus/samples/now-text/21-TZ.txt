@@62721231 <h> Slow-motion horror stories ruining African nations <h> Thursday March 11 2021 <p> All the hullaballoo that one hears about the various development agenda in Africa ring an awfully familiar bell -- that yet more leaders are betting their nations ' futures on the outcomes of their political and economic experiments . <p> The storyline goes like this : ' All I -- there is always that ' I ' -- want is development , ' some leader would declare , ' so we will ignore all the best practices and follow this new path , ' And that would become the basis for some remarkably bizarre political and economic decisions . At the end , that becomes a slow-motion horror story that turns a promising nation into ruins . <p> One of the nations that fit that profile is Ivory Coast . While Tanzania achieved the low middle-income nation status in 2020 , Ivory Coast attained that 40 years earlier . By 1980 , the nation had sustained an average growth rate of above 7 percent for 20 years , something hitherto unseen neither in amplitude nor width in Africa . Back then , the Ivorians enjoyed better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could only dream of . <p> Blessed with neither mineral nor oil wealth , Ivory Coast relied heavily on coffee and cocoa production . Despite the tumultuous economic times of the 1970s , the Ivorians went through almost unscathed . Cocoa production soared , and Ivory Coast commanded over 25 percent of the global cocoa market . <p> Then F ? lix Houphou ? t-Boigny , the nation 's founding father , started to embark on his ' development projects ' . He chose to move the capital from Abidjan to his hometown , Yamoussoukro , where he also decided to build the then biggest church auditorium in the world , the Basilica of Our Lady of Peace . An eerily familiar storyline , is n't it ? <p> When Houphou ? t-Boigny died in 1993 , his successor , Konan B ? di ? , having rigged the election , started to marginalise his opponents , and followed an undemocratic path . The gains which the nation had made in its early years were undone , and the seeds of the 1999 coup d'etat that would end B ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war that would ruin that beautiful nation , were sown . <p> Advertisement <p> Again , a familiar and very predictable outcome . <p> Ultimately , the Ivorians , previously destined to be enjoying ' un-African-like ' living standards , remained only marginally better than the rest of their African neighbours . <p> A decade or so later after B ? di ? was deposed , yet another African nation -- Angola -- was going through a similar path . Back then , Angola was the nation that was on every investor 's lips -- oil prices per barrel had tripled and its economy was booming . Full of confidence , the powers-that-be decided to spend some of the dough on fancy projects . Very African , huh ? <p> In Luanda , Angola 's capital , and home to 6.5 million Angolans , the government embarked on large-scale real estate development projects . Thousands were uprooted from their settlements to pave the way for new construction without any compensation . Who needs compensation if people are going to get new apartments instead ? <p> For years that Black African @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ god-forsaken part of the world -- became the world 's most expensive city ! Yawn . Nothing wrong , it was going to be turned into a Dubai after all , they said . <p> Then the bubble burst . In 10 years , GDP growth plummeted from above 10 percent to below zero in 2019 . The government 's cash reserves dried up , construction projects were brought to a shuddering halt , and everybody was left wondering what had happened to the oil riches . <p> Once again , the poor remained poor , as yet another pointless African experiment came crashing down . <p> The lesson , then and now , has never changed -- to lift people out of poverty , leaders have to do it the right way . Quick fixes never work . <p> While Ivory Coast could have transitioned its economy by choosing to add value to its exports , but , as it happened so often in Africa , it continued to rely on exports of raw materials to Europe and America . As a result , even though it has over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes less than 5 percent of the $100 billion made from chocolates globally . <p> Similarly , while Angola could have chosen to learn from nations such as Norway by establishing a fund which would have insulated it from future economic shocks or could have chosen to learn from gulf nations such as United Arab Emirates , which have been investing in their people and alternative revenues sources , it chose the path of least resistance and paid the price . <p> A review of post-colonial African history usually leaves one with a very sombre feeling . Just when you think that Africa has turned the corner you get yet another leader who thinks he does n't have to follow the best practices . Starting with brushing off democratic processes , they usually embark on fanciful projects that do n't benefit the poor directly , ultimately it is the poor who end up paying for their leaders ' profligacy . <p> One is left wondering what Africans ' ancestors did to anger the gods so much .

She has to collect enough revenues that will see her delivering on the ruling party 's campaign promises but that should not be done at the expense of the health of the private sector . <p> This is exactly what she said during an event to swear-in the new Chief Secretary and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told Dr Nchemba that it was about time the Finance Ministry thought of raising revenue collections without strangling businesses . <p> " Mr Finance Minister , you have been issued with a target of raising tax revenue to Sh2 trillion but that should be done through expanding the tax base , " she said . <p> Collecting Sh2 trillion per month could be a toll order for Tanzania Revenue Authority ( TRA ) which collected an average of Sh1.43 trillion per month during the financial year 2019/20 . <p> That was an increase of about 12 percent from an average monthly collection of Sh1.28 trillion that was registered during the financial year 2018/19 . <p> The only time that tax collection had gone close to the Sh2 trillion-mark was in December 2019 when a total of Sh1.92 trillion was garnered and in December last year ( 2020 ) when the taxman garnered Sh1.983 trillion . <p> President Hassan said she was unhappy with the current trend by tax collectors which was strangling businesses . <p> " You are killing businesses . You use more force than knowledge in your tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was unhappy with a tendency of milking some taxpayers dry and that of going to the extent of seizing their working tools and confiscating their bank accounts . <p> " Though the law allows you to do that , once it happens , someone decides to close the business and move to the neighbouring country . By so doing , you are reducing the number of taxpayers , " she said , insisting on the need to expand the tax base . <p> " Anything that reduces taxpayers ' morale to pay tax must be worked on accordingly , " she said . <p> Presenting the 2017/18 budget in Parliament in June 2017 , former Finance and Planning Minister , Dr Phillip Mpango , said the government recognizes the role of the private sector in Tanzania 's economic growth endeavours , noting that it would conduct several measures to ensure that Tanzania becomes an investment destination of choice . <p> He said the government was discontented with the closure of 7,277 businesses at Kariakoo in Dar es Salaam and across the country , saying the trend was discouraging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the phenomenon was only common to Tanzania . <p> It may not be surprising therefore that on Sunday , President Hassan made yet another new appointment that is directly linked to the Finance Ministry . <p> She picked Mr Alphayo Kidata as new TRA Commissioner General to replace Dr Edwin Mhede , who was appointed to head the tax body in June 2019 . <p> Mr Kidata had previously worked as Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Land , Housing and Human Settlements Development . <p> A native of Bunda in Mara , Mr Kidata studied Economics during his first Degree at the University of Dar es Salaam . <p> After completing his BA Degree in Economics , he was employed by the government under the Ministry of Lands , Housing and Human Settlements Development , working in the Ministry 's Economics and Planning Department . <p> He later enrolled for a Master 's Degree course at in Japan where upon his successful completion , he returned home and worked in a number of positions and rising to become the Permanent Secretary in the Ministry and before being appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was during his first few weeks as TRA Commissioner General that revenue collections rose from Sh1 trillion in December 2014 to Sh1.3 trillion in December 2015 . <p> Since then , monthly collections have never again gone below the Sh1 trillion-mark but whether that record will be maintained and further improved to meet the Sh2 trillion goal while simultaneously working hard to prevent strangling businesses remains anybody 's guesswork.

On my mind today is a long list of measures that need to be taken to expand the tax base . Tax base expansion is a result of creating an ideal environment for new businesses to prosper and existing ones to flourish . Tax base expansion is not an easy endeavour -- it is earned , and it is give-and-take.Tax base expansion base is a process , and not something that can be fully achieved overnight , or within a single financial year . It ca n't possibly yield results within a short time to match the government 's needs to collect more and do more to satisfy political hunger zones . Tax base expansion is granting hope for the future and that business prospects will be certain.Tax base expansion is creating a positive relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is making tax payment easier . Tax base expansion is tapping untapped potential and opportunities.Yes , tax base expansion happens when and where there is truth and trust on the part of the collector and businesses alike . Tax base expansion happens when new businesses are given breaks to break even , and that profit to tax is realised . Tax base expansion happens when the tax collector gets its head out of the thick clouds of business as usual attitude . Tax base expansion happens when money remains in the private sector 's stewardship to produce more . Tax base expansion happens when money changes hands , putting the wheels of the economy in motion.Tax base expansion may not happen when there is an excessive shift of resources from production patterns to political spending patterns that stifle the private sector . Tax base expansion may not happen when there is no innovation on the side of the collector . Tax base expansion may not happen when existing tax laws are not harmonised with what are outwardly good intentions because the fact is that the tax collector enforces the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one should not expect changes on the modus operandi of the tax collector . To get it done , throwing out of the window not-so-good laws seems to be an option at hand . Tax base expansion may not happen if the tax collector does not care if businesses go under when tax is collected . It can not happen when businesses are terrorised either.No , tax base expansion may not happen if the tax collector does n't take into account the externalities affecting businesses . Tax base expansion may not happen if there are no deliberate efforts on the part of the government to support strategic sectors of the economy in which the country holds a competitive edge over other economies . Tax base expansion may not happen if the same old scripts are used to dance to new rhythms and expect different results.In this regard , if one were to expect any difference , unpacking the pack is inevitable , and so is the courage to take a risk and brace for setbacks.Tax base expansion may not happen if the government falls short in taking a cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promote private sector growth and prosperity . As for new businesses , incubation is key in tax base expansion . Tax base expansion may not happen if our education system is not overhauled.Not much in terms of new taxpayers can be produced by our current education system which prepares them to be dependent instead of independent . In this regard , judging the main judgement is inevitable.We need to go back to the drawing table to find out how to get out of the current vicious circle . Our education system must meet the needs of the markets in these fast changing economic times by making it the source of enterprise.Lastly , tax base expansion may not happen if there is no transparency and accountability on how taxpayers ' money is spent . The government is duty-bound to ensure that public resources are expended prudently , and delivery of public goods is seen by taxpayers to give them reason to feel obliged to comply and pay taxes . <p> Thomas Akonaay David Maqway is a policy analyst based in Dar es Salaam , he can be reached email protected

Tanzania Business Community 's communication director Stephen Chamle said the just passed 2021/2022 Budget still had some major challenges even as he expressed optimism on the directives issued to the Bank of Tanzania ( BoT ) and commercial banks to reduce interests on loans . <p> " This was a huge stumbling block for members of the business community who have to access loans from time to time to expand their businesses , " he said . <p> On the challenges , he said small traders , famously known as Machinga , have continued to be a challenge to registered businesses in major cities by selling the same products as the businesses that are placed in front of their premises . <p> " The small traders only have to pay a total sum of Sh20,000 annually for identification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as rent , " he observed . <p> Asking : " How can registered traders compete with Machingas who place the same products in front of their shops ? " He further noted that the passed Budget did not take into consideration the valuation of customs duty on goods . <p> Explaining , he said they had made their recommendations to a committee of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning on how the decision to give full mandate to the commissioner for customs duty to decide the valuation of goods was opening doors to corruption . <p> " This has not been taken care of and continues to prove a challenge to traders importing goods for business , " he said . <p> An economist from the University of Dar es Salaam ( UDSM ) , Dr Abel Kinyondo , said levy on sim cards was counter-productive especially for a country which is dreaming of becoming an industrialised economy come 2025 . <p> " We need to be keen on where to introduce tax or levy , or we will retard economic development , " noting that mobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a catalyst for economic development . <p> He was of the opinion that the government should tax more on luxury goods and spare necessities . <p> Dr Kinyondo added : " It could be wise if we think of broadening a tax base , instead of milking a few . " <p> A bodaboda rider , Mr George Lewis , seemed to have been reading from a different script . <p> " Sim card levy deducted on recharge vouchers is a good initiative that will ensure the government has enough resources from different sources for the development of the country , " he noted . <p> He was also pleased with the Budget because among other things it had taken into consideration the huge sums of fine they had to pay for traffic offences . <p> However , he was of the view that the government needed to review its decision on the property taxes that will now be deducted from prepaid electricity meters ( Luku ) . <p> " Not everybody living on a property is the owner and if the government continues with this , it means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> Business expert and economist Donath Olomi said the government was doing well when it came to improving the business environment . However , he challenged that more needed to be done . <p> For that to happen , the government should mend the way it was implementing the blueprint , a document established in 2018 with a view to setting a stage for a raft of amendments to laws and regulations governing the conduct of businesses . <p> " Yes , the government has been improving the business environment but at a low pace , low level of accountability , monitoring and without being organised " he said . <p> He also said the government had not expressed bold strategies to enable them to employ themselves .

@@63065233 <h> Digital transformation much faster , owing to covid 19 pandemic <p> A just-released yearly report about news audiences ' consumption patterns and attitudes shows that even though the demand for trusted and reliable information grew during the Covid-19 pandemic , the news industry faces significant business challenges . <p> This is the tenth edition of the Reuters Institute Digital News Report , an annual treasure trove of data and insight for anyone interested in the news industry 's business and audience trends . <p> We highlight a few major themes that emerge from the wide-ranging report : read on for a summary of its main findings on trust , business models , digital subscription trends , news consumption on social media , and the news habits of the young . <p> Trust in news up almost everywhere <p> Reversing the downward trend of previous years , trust in news is growing : 44 per cent of survey respondents said that they trust most news most of the time -- an increase of six percentage points from last year . <p> Additionally , 50 per cent said that they trust the news they consume themselves , up by four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ markets , with Finland having the highest levels of overall trust in news ( 65 per cent ) , and the US the lowest ( 29 per cent ) . <p> On the other hand , the relatively low levels of trust in news from search engines and social media continues , meaning that the trust gap between news in general and news found on social platforms is widening . <p> Declines in print deep , digital growth slow <p> Print publications were hit particularly hard by Covid-19 almost everywhere , as lockdowns hampered physical distribution . Some of the steepest declines were in countries such as Switzerland and Germany , where circulation levels have traditionally been high . <p> On the other hand , the German newspaper publishers ' association BDZV reported that print REACH in the country actually increased by 5 per cent last year , so perhaps in some markets the story on print readership declines is not as clear-cut as it may seem . <p> The switch from print to digital subscriptions continues , and a handful of wealthy countries with a history of strong print @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> But despite a few positive examples , it still remains the case that the great majority of news consumers choose not to pay for any online news : only 17 per cent of respondents said that they had paid for online news in the last year . <p> The number is growing , but slowly : it 's up by 2 percentage points from year before , and five since 2016 ( 12 per cent ) . <p> The direction of travel is clear , however : many major publishers started paywalls during the pandemic , and publishers are increasingly turning to different forms of reader revenue -- subscriptions , membership and donations -- to reduce their reliance on advertising , which online mostly goes to Google and Facebook . <p> Digital subscriptions : few big brands dominate <p> The report also surveyed the number of online subscriptions that news consumers take out , the results showing that a large portion of digital subscriptions go to a few big national brands -- reinforcing the winner-takes-most dynamic in the digital subscription space . <p> The pattern is fairly consistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscribers pay for either the New York Times , Washington Post or Wall Street Journal . <p> In Finland , almost half of subscribers pay for just one publication , Helsingin Sanomat .

@@63508237 <h> Wednesday November 03 2021 <h> Summary <p> Dar es Salaam . Tanzania 's aviation sector ca n't find its wings even as the truth is once it takes off only the sky will be the limit . Tanzania 's aviation sector has been tied to the same challenges since the collapse of the East African Community in 1977 . <p> Up till then the sector was under the auspices of the EAC , starting with the East African Common Services organization and then the East African Directorate of Civil Aviation . The three countries--Tanzania , Kenya and Uganda--also formed and jointly ran the East African Airways . The directorate had an oversight role on civil aviation technical activities and air transport economic issues including market access matters , provision of air navigation services . The only responsibilities left to individual states were aerodromes management and maintenance work . But the area control centre for air navigation services and air traffic control for aerodrome control was in Nairobi . <p> The collapse of the EAC damaged Tanzania 's aviation sector . The government had to start from zero in everything except the airports and aerodromes . To get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to depend on the Nairobi area control centre until 1998 when the government established its own in Dar es Salaam . The problems that still bedevil the sector now include inadequate investment in hard and soft infrastructure , shortage of skilled labour , inefficient regulation as well as unfavourable and rigid policy . Operators are also concerned with multiple , exorbitant fees and charges that make operational costs extremely high . <p> Domestic aviation holds the key <p> The aviation sector is sophisticated , capital and technology intensive , characterized by too much competition and slow return on investment . This is why government efforts to improve the infrastructure in the aviation sector are commendable taking into consideration the state of the sector post-1977 and the fact that the state has many priorities and limited financial resources , stakeholders say . <p> Advertisement <p> The importance of the sector in bringing into the country the coveted foreign currency and in its potential to transform both tourism and pan-territorial transport , however , makes it worth every dime invested in it , stakeholders add . <p> To enable the growth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the economy , Tanzania must focus on the domestic aviation industry . While investing in the international air transport is necessary to provide travellers direct access to the country , still Tanzania , like the US , is lucky in that it does n't have to depend on the international routes to reap the full benefit of air transport . Domestic aviation is already dynamic . <p> As Tanzania embarks on the journey towards the next 60 years the government must put forward both long term and short-term strategies to develop the local aviation market . <p> The government is clear on what is to be done in the long term , which includes construction of new airports in strategic locations , expanding and deepening aviation training centres and attracting as many operators as possible in the domestic market to increase efficiency and slash airfares . <p> It is in the short-term strategies where the government seems hesitant to take bold and immediate steps due unknown reasons . Stakeholders say that taking immediate actions to rescue the domestic aviation industry is important to save it from total collapse due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Foreign tourists depend on domestic airlines to move around the various destinations . Saving the domestic market from collapsing is tantamount to saving the tourism industry that is trying to shake off the effects of the Corona virus-induced slowdown in air travel . <p> Tanzania Air Operators ' Association ( Taoa ) executive secretary Lathifa Sykes says what the industry needs is short term low interest loans to assist companies to bring up their operation capacity back to preCovid-19 period as well as waiver of not only fines and penalties by the Tanzania Revenue Authority . <p> " Banks should also waive interest rates accumulated during the pandemic when members could n't service their loans , " Ms Sykes says . <p> Swissport CEO Mrisho Yassin says the government should foster the country economic growth in order to increase number of Tanzanians using air transport ; investing in airport infrastructure ; invest in technology to lower operating costs such as in self-checking systems and self-boarding ; enhance regulatory framework ; invest in training of pilots and aircraft engineers ; and making flying cheaper to accelerate mass flying . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic aviation market is so huge , " he says . <p> Taoa further says that the government needs to relook into the multiple fees that hinder the growth of the sector . Some of these fees include the radio frequency licences ( $75 per frequency for Aviation and $500 per frequency for aircraft operators ) . " These rates are uncompetitive with the rest of the region and duplicative in nature . Thus , the reform proposed was that the radio fee be amended to mirror the regional average while also recommending that the aviation fees be reformed into an annual registration fee for aircrafts , " Ms Sykes says . <p> The taxes are also prohibitive , especially the direct taxes . They include : withholding tax ( at 10% ) on non-resident aircraft rentals ; withholding tax ( at 10% ) on non-resident loan repayments . indirect taxes include value added tax of 18 per cent on aircraft sale , value added tax of 18 per cent on aircraft maintenance , value added tax of 18 per cent on sale of aircraft parts among local firms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " The main concern surrounding the incidence of taxation is that it is primarily centred on the usage of aircrafts .

What Keynes taught was counterintuitive- that in a time of an economic downturn the answer was to prime the pump . Spend more . ( The opposite of what a family should do when in debt . ) That would revive an economy and increase the growth rate . The increased growth would provide more tax revenue which could be spent on aid for the poor , new infrastructure and the health services etc .

As some economists have said it 's almost " free money " . Keynesian economics , intellectually derided by the Chicago school , in particular by the Nobel prize winning economist , Milton Friedman , and politically rubbished by Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan , needs a comeback . <p> President Joseph Biden obviously believes in it , judging by his actions , but he needs to publicly credit and explain Keynes . Keynes 's principles of finance and economics are not hard to understand . Then it will be easier to carry doubters along . Even more so with Prime Minister Boris Johnson . The new UK budget seems orientated the Keynesian way , but he could go much further , not least in lowering taxes . In Germany , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic debate . Until very recently , Chancellor Angela Merkel has believed in balancing the books . The result has been a brake on both German and European growth and , in the case of Greece , an imposed contraction that ruined the lives of millions of Greeks . <p> Just before the end of the Second World War the Western powers decided to rethink the international financial system . Meeting in July 1944 at Bretton Woods their top experts , including Keynes , representing the British government , discussed a new world order , convinced that the global system could not be left to the mercy of unilateral action by governments or to the unregulated workings of the international markets . Thus emerged the IMF and the World Bank . It was at the one and the same time a great achievement and a great disappointment . Over the last eight decades both institutions have been invaluable , but this success only begs the question what they might have done if Keynes ' original vision had not been cut down to size . <p> Keynes proposed an IMF whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In practice the IMF today controls liquidity equal to only a very small proportion of world imports .

The IMF can issue so-called Special Drawing Rights , a minor but important step towards achieving this- they amount to a very small percentage of world liquidity . These SDRs can be exchanged for other currencies that in turn can be used to buy goods and services such as vaccines , medical equipment and food . <p> Advertisement <p> Besides more available public liquidity we are in urgent need of some sort of braking system when the private liquidity system spins too fast .

The government 's intention to build local sugar processing capacity could be in jeopardy if barons are left to re-emerge , analysts say.During the past few years , investors have injected colossal sums of money into sugar production in an effort to meet the government 's goal of ensuring that Tanzania becomes self-sufficient in the product by 2025 . These includes the approval of a Sh571.6 billion expansion project for Kilombero Sugar ; Said Salim Bakhresa 's $300 million ( about Sh690 billion ) Bagamoyo Sugar Ltd , and the Mkulazi Sugar Company in Morogoro which is being implemented by the National Social Security Fund ( NSSF ) .

NSSF 's Mkulazi Sugar project is expected to add 50,000 tonnes of sugar to the domestic market.The projects are enough to fill Tanzania 's sugar deficit.But , what came up during a business meeting that was attended by President Samia Suluhu Hassan and her Ugandan counterpart , President Yoweri Museveni , points to the possibility that sugar imports could persist.President Hassan said she was informed that members of the business community in Uganda had surplus sugar which they wanted to export to Tanzania but that they were discouraged by a statement by the minister ( for Agriculture ) , who said no imports would be procured . " That was nonsense . Honourable President , we are going to buy sugar from Uganda , " President Hassan told her Ugandan counterpart in a live televised event.But , yesterday , the Kilombero Sugar Company board chairman , Mr Ami Mpungwe , said in a confirmed tweet that " It is clear President Museveni misled/misinformed our President . Certainly , all sugar companies imported sugar from Uganda this year , including the one still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least price-competitive in the region . Kilombero Sugar bought 4,300 tonnes . " Contacted to speak on the matter , Mr Mpungwe said there were three businessmen who controlled the sugar business in the past - and that the three could be struggling to regain their status after the government and producers ' deal to manage the sugar industry . " They are doing that after stabilisation of the sugar market that was in the past saturated with subsidised sugar imports , making the local product less competitive , " he said over the phone.Mr Mpungwe , who is also a former Tanzanian ambassador to South Africa , said in order to manage the industry , local producers and the government agreed to establish the country 's exact sugar deficit - and import at the right time.He said they also agreed to import at the accurate tariff and provide import shares at the pro rata , or proportionate allotment among local sugar producers.According to him , the agreement saw the increase of trust among investors , including the Kilombero Sugar Company that injected $238.5 million in its expansion plan.Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced Tanzanian importers to procure sugar from Uganda virtually next-door . " I stand by those behind the maintenance of the current sugar import procedures that have stabilised the sector after years of arbitrary importations , " he said . " Importations priority will be given to regional markets that will help us to cut supply chains after providing us with competitive prices . " But , sugar import and export traders said they were supportive of an environment that did not confer a monopoly of any kind to a section of the society . " The sugar import business as we know it has currently been monopolized as sugar producers take advantage of the fact that they are the only ones allowed to trade in the essential commodity , " one of the traders told The Citizen in a telephone interview on a condition of anonymity.Another trader said those who had been playing in the sector and individual investors have been targeted for exclusion from the trade by Tanzania 's main sugar importers for fear of competition . " The sugar trade protectionism in the country is not helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " noted the trader , adding that dealing in the import of the commodity was now almost paralleling the war against narcotics.They support and welcome President Hassan 's stance that Tanzania should import sugar from Uganda and other regional markets to fill in the deficit in local production . " For fair competition - and for consumers to benefit - we advocate that sugar producers be stripped of the monopoly they are enjoying . It is surprising that local sugar producers would fear competition from a member of the East Africa Community ( EAC ) despite the applicable common customs tariff regime , " said the trader.Contacted on this , the director general of the Sugar Board of Tanzania ( SBT ) , Mr Kenneth Bengesi , declined to comment . " I travelled out of the country and , therefore , am unfamiliar with the new developments .

" The business is like narcotics that have forced some ministers to quit in the past .
