I have done everything to make a living , but I made a bad choice . I chose a woman who has five children to be my partner . <p> She smokes weed and drinks . When she gets drunk , she lies down anywhere and exposes herself . When she gets sober and people tell her what she did , she calls them liars . We were doing some farming together , but we could n't make it , so we broke up .

The children do n't keep the place tidy , and even her daughter has not learned to wash her own clothes . She does not pressure me for money ; that is one thing I love about her . I do n't know what she has in the bank . I do n't ask her , but she is always asking me how much money I have put away . She asks me if I have enough money for my funeral should anything happen to me . <p> My brother 's wife is an insurance agent .

Give me your advice . <p> A.P . <p> Dear A.P. , <p> You should encourage this woman with whom you were living , if you are on speaking terms , to seek professional help . It is very sad when folks are addicted to certain drugs that they allow to destroy them . Many times , I have seen young girls get hooked on smoking marijuana and they appear unable to stop . Marijuana has its uses . Some people seem like they always have to use it to get high and it has destroyed them . Nobody in their right mind should condemn a person who drinks occasionally , but we know that some people have also destroyed themselves by becoming alcoholics . It would be better for a person to abstain totally from alcoholic beverages , but people who spend so much time in the pubs and can not do without liquor are in trouble and need professional help . Therefore , your former lover needs to be encouraged to seek help . I am not saying that you should take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you should try everything to help her . <p> Concerning this woman with whom you are living . Perhaps she is trying to be very careful about how she operates with you . It is not wrong for her to ask about your finances . After all , both of you are living together . She should have asked that even before you moved in together . So do not be annoyed because she is questioning you about that . On the other hand , she should be willing to tell you what she has . Life is not a one-sided game . So if you see a future with this woman , do n't allow her to ask you again about your account . Tell her what you have , and go beyond that ; show her what you have . It does not mean that you have to put her name on your account . Show her that you have nothing to hide . I wish you well .

@@87485236 <h> Can you quit smoking with hypnosis ? <p> Sunday , June 13 , 2021 <p> DESPITE not having any success so far , local hypnotist Sean Davidson believes , if the conditions are right , people can quit smoking with hypnosis . <p> Davidson , more popularly known as Sean Michaels , uses hypnosis -- which he describes as an altered state of mind characterised by high suggestibility and relaxation -- to help people with every day or deep-rooted problems , excluding clinically diagnosed disorders or mental illnesses . <p> Among his clients at Kaizen Hypnotism are individuals looking for a way to kick the smoking habit . <p> " If you can be serious and have the open willingness , you 'll stop smoking in no time , because it is a bad habit , " Davidson told the Jamaica Observer in a recent interview . <p> Smoking , a leading cause of cancer , increases your risk for lung disease , heart attacks and other health problems . Studies have shown that , for some people , hypnosis can help with smoking cessation . <p> According to Mayo Clinic , " Hypnosis can be used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you cope better with anxiety or pain " . Describing it as a trance-like state in which you have heightened focus and concentration , Mayo Clinic said hypnosis is usually done with the use of verbal repetition and mental images . The non-profit academic medical centre pointed out , too , that although you 're more open to suggestion during hypnosis , you do not lose control over your behaviour . <p> " It starts with the conscious consultation , meaning I am asking you , while you are conscious -- not in a trance or anything -- about your current mental state , how many cigarettes or spliffs you are ingesting daily , how smoking is affecting your life , and why you smoke , " Davidson said about what a typical session for smoking cessation would entail . <p> " Then , based on the answers , I would revisit them while you are under hypnosis because , consciously , we all try to portray ourselves a specific way to try and conform to social correctness or not necessarily telling the truth about ourselves , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , would be the ability to reassociate clients with better coping mechanisms , since under hypnosis , " anything I tell you , at that point , you are going to accept it more readily " . The suggestion , therefore , becomes an instruction , he said . <p> " So , whatever I say , that is what the person starts thinking about , " he explained . <p> Davidson , who has hypnotised more than 280 people to date , said the clients he has seen for smoking cessation have not been consistent with their sessions . <p> " Every client I have ever had in relation to smoking , it is either they have had financial constraints ... or they come to one or two sessions , see the results , but then ca n't continue , " Davidson said . <p> One of his clients , who has been smoking for more than 10 years and has tried " countless " methods to break the habit , said in a testimonial last October : " Initially , I was sceptical of using hypnotism as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe in hypnotism ... During the session , although in a trance , I felt comfortable and the suggestions he gave me took immediate effect once we were done . I was offered a smoke , and my body actually felt repulsed by the idea , something that has never happened since I started smoking . <p> " With only one session I can still feel the effects to this day , but with the time and amount at which I smoked , unfortunately , I have relapsed twice since then . But , it is still extremely good as it 's been forever since going three weeks with just two spliffs , as well as during the relapse I actually did not enjoy smoking like I usually do , " the client , who is now looking to resume sessions with Davidson , said . <p> ? <p> Must be willing to accept change <p> ? <p> Davidson , who has been offering his services to the public for the past three years , said for hypnosis to work for those who want to stop smoking , they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " A client can not simply ask a hypnotist or a hypnotherapist to eradicate smoking from their lives because that drive and willingness is what the person doing hypnosis on them anchors the suggestion to it , " he told Your Health Your Wealth . <p> He said the hypnotist , as part of preliminary work , would also have to find out why the individual is smoking to effectively help that person . <p> " You ca n't just jump in and say , ' Stop smoking ' , because if it is the environment , we have n't allowed them to process and interpret the environment differently , " Davidson said . " Basically , you would be removing the emotional attachment and the association they have with smoking , and to do that , they have to come in with the drive to want to stop doing this . <p> " So , if you still do not see smoking as a problem , you can not then simply come to one session and expect to stop smoking ; it is not magic , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is slow and developmental . " <p> Emphasising that the number of sessions to get results varies from client to client , Davidson said it is also important to replace the bad habit with something else . <p> " You ca n't just eradicate something and not put anything in its place ; you have to make them start doing something else , like exercise , to take the place of what you are removing , " he said . <p> ? <p> Consistency is necessary <p> ? <p> Insisting that consistency is key , Davidson said , too , that sometimes people can no longer feel the urge to smoke after one session , but they risk relapsing or replacing smoking with another bad habit . <p> " You come to one session and you have this great feeling and the first time you are offered a cigarette you are like , ' Oh , I actually do n't want it ' , think you are fine and then do n't come back . Afterwards , you relapse and you are wondering what happened , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to remove it and change your habits in your everyday life . " <p> He said this potential risk could be avoided by fulfilling the sessions and continuing until the problem is fixed . <p> Davidson has also done a series of videos on YouTube , featuring people who smoke marijuana , to demonstrate that , through the use of hypnosis , they can stop smoking if they wanted to . <p> Now you can read the Jamaica Observer ePaper anytime , anywhere .

@@88192232 <p> LEIGH-ON-SEA , England ( AP ) -- Leaders from across the political spectrum came together Saturday to pay their respects to a long-serving British lawmaker who was stabbed to death in what police say was a terrorist-related attack . <p> His death has reopened questions about the security of lawmakers as they go about their work . <p> The slaying Friday of the 69-year-old Conservative member of Parliament David Amess during a regular meeting with local voters has caused shock and anxiety across Britain 's political spectrum , just five years after Labour Party lawmaker Jo Cox was murdered by a far-right extremist in her small-town constituency . <p> " He was killed doing a job that he loves , serving his own constituents as an elected democratic member and , of course , acts of this are absolutely wrong , and we can not let that get in the way of our functioning democracy , " British Home Secretary Priti Patel said after she joined others , including Prime Minister Boris Johnson , to pay tribute to Amess at the church where he died . <p> Patel said she has convened meetings with the Speaker of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to make sure that all measures are being put in place for the security of MPs so that they can carry on with their duties as elected democratic members " . <p> On Saturday , in an echo of the political unity that emerged after Cox 's murder , Johnson of the Conservatives , the leader of the opposition Labour Party , Keir Starmer , and the non-partisan speaker , Lindsay Hoyle , arrived at the church where Amess died and laid flowers . <p> Amess was attacked around midday Friday during his constituency meeting in a church in Leigh-on-Sea , a town 40 miles ( 62 kilometres ) east of London . He suffered multiple stab wounds . Paramedics tried without success to save him . Police have arrested a 25-year-old British man for the attack . <p> The Metropolitan Police has described the attack as terrorism and said its early investigation " revealed a potential motivation linked to Islamist extremism " . It did not provide details about the basis for that assessment . As part of the investigation , officers were searching two locations in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and five children behind and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 2015 , died doing an important part of his job -- helping out residents in his seaside constituency of Southend West , which incorporates Leigh-on-Sea . <p> Under Britain 's parliamentary system , lawmakers have direct links with their local voters , often hosting open meetings , or " surgeries " . The meetings often take place in local facilities such as churches and community halls , and are publicly advertised . Amess himself posted online where he would be hosting his surgery on Friday . It was open to all . <p> " The reason he wanted to use the church was because he wanted to be where the people were , " said Rev Clifford Newman at the Belfairs Methodist Church where Amess was killed . <p> " And if you come to somewhere which is in the locality like Belfairs , as opposed to some ivory tower somewhere , people are more likely to feel easier , freer and more likely to open up to him , " he added . <p> At the meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government 's handling of the coronavirus pandemic to more mundane issues such as requests for speed bumps on busy roads or a dispute over a neighbour 's fence . While members of Parliament do n't necessarily have the power to fix the problems directly , they can pressure officials at the national and local levels to get things done . <p> " I feel as if I have lost a family member . I feel that he was the family of Southend , he was the leader of Southend , " resident Erica Keane , 69 , said . " And he was everywhere ! He was at the football pitches , he was in the choirs , he was in the pubs . He was everywhere and he was Southend . " <p> Amess was clearly a popular lawmaker , winning 10 out of 10 elections since he was first sent to parliament in 1983 . He was a social conservative on capital punishment and abortion . While never serving as a government minister , Amess was considered a fixer , a lawmaker able to forge alliances across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern about the risks politicians run as they go about their work representing voters . British politicians generally are not given police protection when they meet with their constituents -- unlike the high-security measures that are in place in Parliament . <p> But the vitriol directed towards them has escalated in recent years , with many blaming the more polarised atmosphere on social media and the political divisions stoked by Britain 's recent departure from the European Union . <p> " As members of Parliament , we want to be accessible and approachable , but recently there has been more and more violent abuse , " Labour lawmaker Tanmanjeet Dhesi said . <p> Tobias Ellwood , a leading Conservative lawmaker who gave first aid to a police officer stabbed at the gates of Parliament in 2017 , said face-to-face meetings with voters should be temporarily halted and replaced with online interactions . <p> Veteran Labour lawmaker Harriet Harman also said she planned to write to Johnson to ask him to back a non-partisan conference to review the safety of parliamentarians . <p> " I do n't think anybody wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constituents who come and see us , but I 'm sure there is a safer way to go about our business , " Harman told BBC radio . <p> " Since Jo Cox 's tragic killing , we 've had changes in our home security , we 've had changes in security in Parliament , but we have n't looked at the issue of how we go about that important business in our constituency , but do it in a safe way , " Harman said . " I think we must do that now . " <p> Last year , in his own book " Ayes &amp; Ears : A Survivor 's Guide to Westminster , " Amess wrote about how Cox had been murdered " in the most barbaric fashion imaginable " and how security issues could spoil " the great British tradition " of voters ' easy access to their elected leaders .
