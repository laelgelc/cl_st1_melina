Someone who could combine overseas buying experience , retail experience and online experience . <p> " The board has been preparing the company for a different set of circumstances . We have a lot of projects that will become evident over the next few months . They will need a lot of input , particularly from Mary . Big projects like getting new systems , maybe some building , direct marketing and the internet - although we have been in direct marketing for a long time , it has been an adjunct to the business .

Mystique is a tricky concept to define , but there seems to be a kind of lasting mystique about the store , its history , its part in Christchurch life . <p> Richard Ballantyne has a go at defining it . " The customers build their mystique around its privacy . There is not a lot known about it , yet it 's been around as an institution for more than 150 years .

" <p> It might sound prosaic but a very liberal returns policy is part of that - one way of creating loyalty . Ballantyne suspects that eight out of 10 customers become lifelong shoppers as a result . <p> " What the business has done over a long period is look after people , " Devine says . " You look at the long-service staff and generations of families that have been involved in the business and are made to feel part of the business . As a retailer , it 's all about the customer and that 's been inherent in the business . " <p> Yes , she knows this is the kind of thing every business says about its customers but , for her , that returns policy is an example of going the extra mile . <p> Loyalty is legendary . You hear stories of Ballantynes shoppers following its daily ads on page two of The Press so closely that , on the rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ store to check everything is OK . <p> Richard Ballantyne talks of customers who have wanted their ashes spread in the store , others who have had their Ballantynes account cards buried with them . <p> For outsiders , there is another , less positive version of that Ballantynes mystique . You do n't have to search hard to find people using Ballantynes to summarise their wider feeling about Christchurch - their suspicion that the city is conservative , elitist and past-obsessed . <p> In 2005 , Wellington comedian Raybon Kan wrote a piece about Christchurch that had him drifting into Ballantynes : " Think snooty cosmetics , the hush of a library , the repressed sex appeal of saleswomen dressed in white lab coats " . <p> A year earlier , an Auckland women 's magazine journalist jetting south for a travel story witnessed a well-dressed older woman hide her Farmers purchase in a " carefully folded Ballantynes bag " . This was supposed to speak volumes about appearance and status in Christchurch . In reality , both events could as easily describe Smith &amp; Caughey or Kirkcaldie &amp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wellington . <p> Given the reputation of Ballantynes in some circles , the surprising thing is the store tends not to be a posh or intimidating experience these days . Those layers are there if you want them , but it is telling that Richard Ballantyne cites the British chain John Lewis - " It aims at the middle market " - as the model for Ballantynes . <p> " We 've always realised that in a market as small as New Zealand and with the socio-economic make- up of the country , and particularly Christchurch and Canterbury , if you get too far away from the middle ground , you get yourselves in trouble . You would never compete with the big box retailers - the Warehouse and so on - and if we move our merchandising offers too high up the value chain , we lose too many customers . " <p> The older , starchier Ballantynes world was described in Gordon Ogilvie 's commissioned history , Ballantynes : The Story of Dunstable House 1854-2004 . As recently as the 1970s , there was a rigid dress code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all times in public view ; three- piece-suit wearers could lose the coat if the waistcoat was fully buttoned-up . <p> The same guidelines also had maintenance personnel forbidden from wearing overalls in public - overalls were for cleaners - and even tradespeople working in the store must be neatly dressed , which was " not always easily managed " . Those who came up with such rules might look with horror at the store 's Contemporary Lounge , one of the innovations that came out of a recognised need to respond to younger shoppers . <p> The 1980s were tough , in New Zealand generally and Christchurch especially . It was the era in which many of Ballantynes ' rivals disappeared and also one of the points at which the board considered a shift to the suburbs - Riccarton was mooted . Crucially , the store opted to stay put in town . <p> When asked why Ballantynes survived when others failed , Richard Ballantyne is adamant that the narrowed horizons in the decades after the 1947 fire are , paradoxically , one of the reasons why the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its knitting because it had to , because it was literally rising out of the ashes . It had to be very , very careful and very , very good at what it did . Others got tempted out to the suburbs , found that the critical mass was n't right or had to invest too much out there in stock relative to the return or revenues . Others tried to go to the North Island and failed . <p> " Some were public companies and became takeover targets for whizz kids , the Brierleys of this world , and were asset-stripped and closed . " <p> He remains convinced that a Riccarton or Merivale branch would have been a mistake . <p> " The expectations of the customer are such that if you ca n't replicate what you do in the city in Riccarton , they get disappointed . So they come into the city anyway . You find you have created a dead duck out in the suburbs . The more you replicate it , the more difficult it is to manage . A lot of companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be fair to say that a privately-owned , family firm engenders a kind of conservatism that is increasingly rare in business circles - a long-term thinking . " Most of our decision- making is very long-term , " Ballantyne agrees . " More Oriental than European in our outlook , probably . " <p> As for that hard-to-define Ballantynes mystique , the fire might have had a part to play there , too . It was that sense of a shared tragedy . <p> In his history , Ogilvie cites an " excellent " University of Canterbury history thesis by Lucy Johnston on Ballantynes in the two decades after the fire . Johnston wrote , " The loyalty of the staff of Ballantynes was of huge importance . Despite the magnitude of the tragedy that occurred around them , virtually all staff stayed . " <p> Customers stayed too . The store was rebuilt in stages . As that happened , different branches operated in different parts of the city - the beauty department ran out of rooms at the old United Service Hotel on Cathedral Square , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makeshift fitting rooms , " Ballantyne remembers . " Customers would n't put up with it today . <p> " The example of my father and his brothers and cousins really inspired me and I always feel when I go through a difficult time , or the firm has been going through a difficult time , nothing could be as bad as what they had to handle after the fire . What we 're handling now is just peanuts . " <p> The present might be tough , but the future ? " We 've managed to trade well through difficult circumstances and continue to do so , " Mary Devine says , " so it shows there is a heart to the inner city . We think it 's important that we can anchor future activity . " <p> As a major city retailer , Ballantynes is often read as a barometer of commercial health more generally . Across the stores in Christchurch , Timaru and at Christchurch Airport , the firm employs 430 staff , going up to about 470 at Christmas - down a little from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ballantyne talked of retail spending being volatile since the global financial crisis hit in 2008 , and said the words no retailer usually wants to say or hear : " There has definitely been a big switch in consumer mentality . I think they 've learned they can do without . " <p> Earlier , he said that the inner city has been " getting more fragile year on year " . But if the past three or four years have been flat , there was some encouragement in the brief period between the September 4 earthquake and the Boxing Day aftershock , thanks to spring promotions and Cup and Show Week . <p> Then , more disaster . After the Boxing Day aftershock , Ballantyne estimated that $500,000 had been lost in sales across the previous two days , given how crucial Boxing Day is on the retail calendar . But the recent , successful restaging of the Boxing Day sales will have recouped at least some of that . <p> Six weeks on from Boxing Day , how is foot traffic more generally ? This is where things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two- hour free parking has made a tremendous difference in terms of perception and people coming into the city . I keep saying to the council that has done more to revitalise the centre of the city than anything anybody has ever done in the past 50 years . And it was so simple . And you do n't need a huge team of people to do it . " <p> The problem is parking fees go into the consolidated fund , which affects rates . But he believes that is an opportunity cost worth risking , as far as the council is concerned . <p> And what does he make of architect Ian Athfield 's suggestion that the central city 's pedestrian malls and one-way systems have made it offputting for many ? <p> " Athfield is a very , very astute observer . And he 's quite right . People would do well to take note . " <p> Cashel St became City Mall in 1982 , which coincided with a decade of decline for retail in central Christchurch . Within 10 days , the Ballantynes board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and over the years it became " very tatty , run-down and almost dangerous " , Ballantyne says . <p> Yes , the recent renovation of the mall has been " world class " and the tram should deposit tourists into the store - tourists are responsible for about 15 per cent of turnover - but Ballantyne says it is " debatable in hindsight " whether the mall was the right way to go . <p> Globally , pedestrian malls were a generic response to central city decline . " We supported it at the time . I think we 've been quietly ambivalent since because we knew how valuable the drop-off in shopping was . " <p> While Ballantyne has talked publicly of forming an advisory panel to assist in the post-quake revamping of the central city , he has no official capacity yet . He has put forward a group for consideration . His new position as Ballantynes executive director means that the board " has decided that if the council or whoever wants my help , it 's there " . <p> " Councillors and council officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christchurch or the city will follow the demise of many cities in the US , " he says . " On the other hand this is a great opportunity that must not be squandered . Co-operation and decisive leadership are the keys to this stage in the city 's history . " <p> Of course , this is not simply benevolence . Anything that benefits the central city in general benefits the store in particular . <p> His early thoughts : pockets of retail are scattered across the central business district in a way that is off-putting for shoppers . Who can be bothered trudging between Victoria St , High St and City Mall ? <p> The city 's hotels are in a focused area but retail and business are not . The trick might be to reduce the size of the central city , which is where things really will get political - " There is going to be sacrifice and hard decision- making , inevitably . " <p> Plans should also emerge in coming weeks or months about developments within the business . If there is building , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mahoney drew up plans for additional floors in 1985 . But a question about the controversial closing and quiet reopening of the haberdashery department - in Ballantynes terms , equivalent to mentioning the war - shows the ways the business is thinking . <p> " You would n't say it was a great moneyspinner but some customers find it useful , " Ballantyne says . " You need to look at a company like this as a bit of a resource . What more should we be providing the customer , so they do n't have to traipse all around the place . <p> " If they wanted a bolt or a nut or a can of CRC if they 're a bloke , if we had a little hardware department Devine grimaces I 'm not saying we should do it . We 've looked at things like florists or chemists . We would hope a lot of those things build around us , but there is a place for specialist shops .

@@4035235 <h> On the Simon Power resignation <p> Reportedly , the decision by Justice Minister Simon Power to quit politics at the next election has stunned his party , and " flabbergasted " the Prime Minister . The event it most closely resembles is the decision by his friend and former colleague Katherine Rich to quit politics at the last election . Rich would have been in Cabinet . Power could well have become Prime Minister when John Key finally tires of the job . What is wrong with these people ? <p> The answer ? Not much . In fact , Power 's departure is further proof that Parliament is such a toxic environment that any sane person would ( or should ) be constantly weighing the possible rewards , against the day to day costs . Quite rightly , a lot of media coverage of Parliament focuses on the perks of office . Cabinet Ministers and backbenchers get paid a lot , directly and indirectly . For the laziest and stupidest MPs , Parliament is a goldmine . It sure beats working on a farm , or in a classroom . <p> That 's the irony . The downsides of being in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardworking members . The long hours of being penned up with people who detest each other , the poisonous atmosphere of conflict , the dog eat dog competition ... and that 's merely in your own caucus , let alone across the floor of the House . For most of the able MPs , the compromise achievements possible from being in Parliament are relatively minor , when weighed against the time and energy such victories commonly entail . Former Green MP Sue Bradford for instance , finally got an acceptable version of her plans for reducing violence against children through the House , plus the scrapping of youth rates . Genuine gains , but worth ten years of her life ? Eventually , she decided to get out , and get some fresh air for a while . <p> At least Power and Rich have had options . They could return to private life with some expectation of carving out reasonably challenging , reasonably well-rewarded careers . Unfortunately , their departures have removed from the National caucus two individuals with exceptional ability in their areas of expertise . ( Rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tolley . ) They were also among the very few individuals in Parliament who seemed like reasonably well rounded human beings , with a life beyond politics . ( A fact confirmed by their resignations . ) National will really struggle to replace them . More and more , it will be the party of Murray McCully , Nick Smith and Gerry Brownlee , of Judith Collins , Paula Bennett and Anne Tolley . Yikes . <p> Lets not get too misty-eyed though . I 'm not meaning to suggest that what Power has done in his justice and commerce portfolios should be endorsed . Far from it . This column has been consistently critical of Power 's extension of state power in the criminal justice arena , entirely at the expense of the rights of the accused . His search and surveillance legislation is an appalling piece of Big Brother -- let alone Nanny State -- legislation . And one will be left wishing in vain that the Commerce Commission had been given fresh powers to go after price fixing and cartel behaviour by corporates . Quite the contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission has lost the head of steam it had built up under Paula Rebstock . <p> More than anything , Power 's departure underlines just how transient political careers now tend to be , for the best and the brightest . Surely John Key could have been surprised for only a millisecond about Power 's resignation . After all , Key himself has said he will retire from politics if he loses the next election . For him too , Parliament is merely one stage in his career -- a rich man 's hobby on which he will expend a certain amount of time and energy , but no more . Obviously , there are drawbacks about taking such an approach to political life . Politics may be the art of the possible but one likes to think that political life also entails some commitment to enduring values , beyond a rational cost/benefit analysis of personal gain . Yet for better or worse , there is a growing tendency to treat politics like a general 's tour of duty in Iraq -- get in , get stuff done , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intact as you can , before the inevitable costs begin to outweigh the rewards . <p> Certainly , the perks system has n't caught up with this trend towards transience , and the cut and run nature of political careerism . By and large , the perks system is still based on compensating MPs for the allegedly life long sacrifices they make in entering public life . Around Parliament , that may be true only for its deadweight .

Howell had always denied the charge . <p> Judge Kevin Phillips remanded Howell in custody to July 28 for sentence . <p> Howell , who stood passively in the dock as the verdict was delivered , looked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court and a woman mouthed " I 'm sorry " . <p> Judge Phillips thanked the jury and told jurors that , based on the evidence , their decision was the only one open to them . <p> The jury , 35 minutes earlier , had stopped deliberations to ask Judge Phillips whether a verdict could be reached with 11 from 12 jurors . <p> Judge Phillips said the preference was for a unanimous decision , but given the time lapsed since they began deliberations , he would allow a majority verdict if the remaining 11 jurors were unanimous . <p> During the five-day trial , the jury had been told how Harry was found face down and unconscious on his bedroom floor on May 31 , 2009 . He was taken to Southland Hospital , where an urgent CT scan revealed a collection of blood on his brain . <p> He was later transferred to Christchurch Hospital , where he underwent lifesaving brain surgery , and then Auckland 's Starship children 's hospital . <p> Howell was in a relationship with Harry 's mother , Jess Wates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wates told the jury the boy went to time out on May 31 because he stood too close to the television after being repeatedly told not to . <p> Howell had walked him to his bedroom , which was the designated " naughty room " , she said . <p> He was gone only long enough to leave the boy in the room .

Even if our farmers are n't meeting them yet , they can say , ' This is what we 're aiming for , this is what we see as important , what motivates us ' . <p> " That looks a lot better than , ' Oh , it was just an act of God and we ca n't do anything ' .

As farmers we look for silver bullets , but in reality nothing makes up for good stock management and animal husbandry . " <p> Of the many small changes needed to improve survival , Prof Hickford picks out three - shelter , genetics and stock management . <p> In Canterbury , he has seen shelter trees and hedges disappear from flat land as dairy farming has taken over . The sheep farmers who have hung on to their finishing land have felled their trees and hedges to fit in irrigators . Others have not bothered to spend money in tight years on maintaining their shelterbelts . <p> " The irony is that when they put in great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on cultivated flat land and part of a bloody great wind tunnel . " In the hills , the sheep are also exposed to the elements without a lot of shelter . <p> The ideal shelterbelt allows some wind through to stop wind being diverted over the top to dump on the ground behind . Care should be taken to stop animals setting up camps beneath trees that turn to mud in the wet and dust in the dry , bringing health problems . <p> " Agencies are working on getting this information out to farmers but we need to keep stressing it . A weakness is that we do n't have ministerial farm advisers out on the land whose job is to make sure best practice is happening . We have consultants , but you have to pay for them . " <p> Changes to the national flock genetics have gone too far in recent years , he says . <p> " The emphasis has been on fertility - getting more lambs - but if those lambs come at the expense of survival then we 've got a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the nutrition to keep them big inside their mothers , have them come out at a decent size and then feed them and grow them out . " <p> When lambs drop below 2.5kg at birth their likelihood of dying increases , those who weigh more than 4kg have a better chance of survival and those at 7 to 8kg will grow rapidly . <p> THESE higher weights need not be singles . " They can be twins , but with triplets the weights are likely to drop below 4kg . It 's a separate issue , but triplets are also more likely to die getting tangled up in each other on the way out . " <p> The goal of a minimum of 4kg birthweight can be reached through a combination of genetics and feeding pregnant ewes well . <p> However , it is unlikely any commercial farmers and only a handful of studs would know what their lambs weigh . <p> He says he is not suggesting that every lamb be weighed , just enough to get some indication of what the average birthweight is . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " There are other breeders who say , ' We just leave it to the ewes and if they come back in with a lamb we know they 're tough and are going to survive ' . <p> " In a cold wet year that 's probably correct , but the problem in the good years with warm springs and no storms they all come back - there 's no natural survival and selection for the hardier animals . You 're getting animals that are n't up to a hard year . " <p> Weighing alerts the farmer to that danger . <p> Getting the right amount of quality feed is crucial , he says . " We know the importance of good ewe condition going into mating and of maintaining that condition through pregnancy , to lambing and to weaning . But we 're not putting it together into a neat package . Nationally recognised targets for ewe condition are needed . <p> " If you do n't get the feed into the ewes before mating they 're less fertile , in early pregnancy the placenta is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later pregnancy the birthweight comes down , risk of metabolic diseases rises and the ability to produce colostrum and milk suffers .

Included in my list is my elegant Emile Henry tagine . It is made from black earthenware , with a 30-centimetre circular base and a matching cone-shaped top . When it is not sitting on the stove , it takes pride of place in my kitchen , to be admired by all . <p> The tagine is an ancient cooking vessel traditionally used by the nomads of North Africa -- part of a portable oven designed to fit over a charcoal burner .

You can build the meal around the use of them to provide intensity of flavour . The first is ras el hanout ( head of the shop ) , a spice mix that is as individual as the person who makes it -- the number of spices used is reputed to reach 100 in some cases .

I can give you a lecture on Garokk the Petrified Man or an insightful debate on the Age of Apocalypse series . Naturally when I first heard about X-Men : Destiny , I was pretty excited . The concept of customising my very own mutant before fighting alongside my super-powered chums sounded like a dream come true . Sadly though , and this is probably compounded by my aforementioned love of the comic books , X-Men : Destiny fails miserably in nearly every department . <p> The premise of the story borrows from the strongest on-going theme from the X-Men universe ; the conflict between mutants and normal humans . In fact this gene-war has now escalated and an extremist organisation of humans calling themselves the Purifiers are out to detain or kill mutants . <p> Following the death of former X-Men leader Professional Charles Xavier , this rivalry between homo superior and homo sapiens is now at a crucial breaking point . Never one to miss out on a nice healthy riot , the enigmatic Magneto is also taking full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own means of the Brotherhood . <p> Anyone , like myself , hoping to create their own avatars and place themselves in the game will be disappointed as X-Men : Destiny revolves around three predetermined playable characters . I should add , three heavily stereotyped characters that include ; a smartass jock who always carries a football around when he 's not chatting up girls , a cute-as-a-button , short-skirted Japanese girl trying to win her daddy 's affection , and some other guy who 's completely forgettable . I 'm pretty sure they all have names , but chances are anyone who 's played the game ca n't remember what these one-dimensional shells are called either . <p> Thankfully the supporting cast in the game is a lot stronger . Throughout you 'll come across a multitude of recognisable characters from the X-Men universe including Caliban , Colossus , Gambit , Mystique , Northstar , Surge , Wolverine , Cyclops , and dozens more . Each appear in costume lifted from the comics ( and the excellent 90 's cartoon TV show ) and generally , the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gambit seems to unleash his inner-black man , rather than a husky Cajun accent . <p> He also seems to run the lamest nightclub in existence that comprises of nothing but 4 tables and a door . The massive queue of people you see waiting outside are going to be damn disappointed when they finally get in . This scene ends in a pathetic showdown between you and Gambit over what appears to be an empty cardboard box . <p> The downside of being able to fight alongside the likes of your favourite mutants like Iceman and Nightcrawler is ... it just makes you wish you could play AS them instead . You 'll find yourself fumbling around with your whacky powers as your heroes dash around on the battlefield with skill and finesse . <p> Many times I found myself waddling up to an enemy only to have someone like Quicksilver rush in , beat him up and leave me looking like a chump in his dust . For nearly every battle scene with allies , you 're better off sitting down and making a sandwich rather than trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . On paper , a lot of the ideas conceived in this game sound brilliant . You 'll be able to choose your set of powers , with the option of Density Control , Energy Protection , and Shadow Matter on offer . Density Control is a fancy term for super-strength , Energy Protection has your ranged attacks that are n't as powerful but faster and allow you to keep your distance . Lastly , and the more interesting of the lot , Shadow Matter allows you to hit multiple opponents by forming limbs or blades out of dark energy . <p> As you progress you 'll even be able to upgrade your abilities and gain additional powers by collecting X-Genes . Most of the time these X-Genes will be from other famous mutants , so finding Iceman 's X-Gene gives you a full-body ice shield or Wolverine 's will grant you healing . <p> But when the gameplay is this disappointing , all this customisation pales in comparison .

Or even the plot for that matter . <p> The amount of fanfare in X-Men : Destiny is equally poor . Unlike Batman Arkham City , that had unlockable 3d model renders of characters , this game produces a simple sketch and brief biography on each . Granted the game is full of unlockable costumes , which are fun to collect and try out . But the costumes are only inspired by their counterparts , for example Wolverine 's costume is just a one-piece body suit , but in blue and yellow . The worst thing is , it does n't matter whether they are male or female , both genders can wear any costume . I do n't think I 'll ever get over seeing a full-grown man dressed in a skin-tight Psylocke outfit . Why would they have that in by default ! ?

Although the character models and animations are bordering on average , the game does feature some stylish comicbook-esque graphical overlays . The game also does an impressive job of handling 50+ enemies on screen at once . But when the combat boils down to button mashing against complete morons , having 50 enemies on screen actually becomes more of an ' anti-feature ' . You 'll constantly see enemies disappearing into the ether or popping out of walls too - and no before you say anything , they 're not mutants .

Numerous boss battles are bordering on retarded , featuring boring rinse and repeat strategies and painfully scripted weak-spots . Just to really rub salt in the wound , players will often need to replay the same sections over and over again due to unforgiving checkpoint saves . <p> Blind people wo n't enjoy this game much more either . At one point the soundtrack sounded like a guy tapping on a microphone for ten minutes . I 'm sure it was left in by accident from a mic check in the studio . The storyline , despite the plethora of plot to draw on from the Marvel universe is lackluster and fails to explore any proper character development . <p> The worst thing about X-Men : Destiny however is the complete lack of any multiplayer whatsoever . A game like this screams for at least 2 player co-op , along the lines of far superior games like X-Men Legends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain with someone else . <p> This blatant slap in the face just reinforces how rushed and unpolished this game is .

@@4425231 <h> Worms : Ultimate Mayhem <p> On:PC <p> Worms : Ultimate Mayhem is the latest in a 16 year old ( ! ) series from old-school developer Team 17 . These guys have been operating under that label for more than 20 years , and are most famous for making - you guessed it - Worms games . <p> This particular title is n't strictly a new game , per se , but instead it combines content from Worms 4 : Mayhem and Worms 3D , with some extra maps and miscellaneous tweaks that are intended to bring it up to date . <p> I played a lot of both of those earlier games ( I still have them , in fact ) , so I was very interested to see what Team 17 had done to fix the numerous issues the transition to 3D had brought to the series . Before we go into them , though , a quick explanation as to what 's going on here for people who are new to the series ... <p> Worms is a turn-based strategy series , in which players take control of a worm from their team of four and must use any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposing team(s) . This all plays out in a physics-based world in which a lot of the fun comes from unintended consequences ; accidentally hitting your own guys , sending a worm flying onto a mine which then explodes and causes some more chaos - etc . <p> With fully destructable environments and physics-based weapons , no game plays out the same way and you have to use your brain to it 's maximum capacity and leverage every aspect of a weapon 's ability if you want to succeed against tougher opponents . It was , quite simply , rather good . <p> Originally , the Oligochaeta-themed activity was enacted on a 2D stage , which you observed side-on - like so : <p> With Worms 3D and Worms 4 , however , Team 17 took the action into the third dimension , which mean that you now had an extra axis to consider when firing your weapons . Given each is affected by gravity and wind , this increased the complexity by an enormous factor and made it frustrating to try and hit distant enemies with all but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case in Ultimate Mayhem . <p> Another problem introduced by the shift in perspective is trying to see what 's going on in the first place . In the 2D games , you could track the path of a projectile simply by panning left and right , with maybe a little up and down thrown in occasionally . Here , it 's automatic ( with some override ability ) and almost never manages to show you what 's going on at all . It 's quite simply one of the worst implementations ever seen of a tracking camera in a 3D environment . <p> This compounds the aforementioned complexity of actually hitting your targets in the first place , as you ca n't even learn from your previous shot so as to tweak your technique - you simply do n't get to see what happened to it . <p> It 's also got a terrible user interface which completely ignores the standard implementations for such things and requires time and experimentation to understand . Yes , you 'll get there , and no , it does n't take that long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratching your head wondering why they went in this direction . <p> It has a single-player campaign which , in addition to providing fairly standard matchups against AI opponents , also crafts a number of unique scenarios in which you are required to heavily leverage certain techniques ( like jumping or using specific weapons , etc ) . These missions are fun , for the most part , and really do help to hammer home the skill set necessary to fully leverage the techniques in question . It 's a good inclusion and is a great way to prep yourself for the real purpose of the package : multiplayer . <p> Multiplayer makes things more fun in the usual ways ( there 's nothing quite like shooting a real person 's worm off the edge of a map and into the water ) , of course , but it also helps you to forgive some of the more inane aspects of the execution . After all , everyone else is struggling against the camera and weapons too - unlike the **30;457;TOOLONG AI that do n't have to force their will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Overall , Ultimate Mayhem is a disappointing experience . Third person camera issues were solved long ago , so a revisit to the days before developers solved this problem is a retro hit we could do without . Similarly , cookie-cutter user interface designs are one-a-penny on any platform you care to name , so to see something so cumbersome - even at a budget price - is another disappointing throwback to a part of gaming history that 's best left buried . <p> Ultimately , if you 're looking for some Worms mayhem , we 'd recommend sticking to the 2D variants - the recently released Worms Reloaded , for example .

Her three older children , aged 12 , 11 and five , were also by the pool . <p> Hannah drowned in the brief time she was left alone on the family 's rural property in Marton on January 2 . <p> Ms Illston appeared in the High Court at Wellington yesterday , flushed and tearful in the dock as she waited for Justice Forrie Miller 's decision on her plea for a discharge without conviction .

@@4425240 <p> The Government needs to lead the way if stricter rules on earthquake strengthening are to be enforced , a royal commission has heard . <p> The Canterbury earthquakes royal commission yesterday considered the merits of raising the requirement for strengthening quake-prone buildings from 33 per cent of the building code to 67 per cent . <p> Under the Building Act 2004 local authorities can encourage building owners to meet 67 per cent , but can not force them to . <p> Local Government New Zealand ( LGNZ ) chief executive Eugene Bowen said councils were powerless to act further without a Government endorsement . <p> " We would welcome a stronger national expression of interest , which would enable those councils with an appetite to pursue a higher standard to do so .

" <p> Auckland Council special projects officer Patrick Cummuskey echoed Christchurch Mayor Bob Parker 's comments that the extra cost of raising standards was a problem .

It came with loads of popular songs and different ways to play them , and aside from some dodgy menu navigation and a bit of inaccuracy when reading movements , was a really fun party game . But Dance Central 2 is more fun , more social , and packed with extra game modes . <p> Kinect games may be aimed at children , in general , but Dance Central 2 is not , as evidenced by the mix of songs and dance moves . Kids can play , sure , but there 'll need to be a bit of parental control over the song choices with songs like Rihanna 's Rude Boy available . That said , the mix of music is great , and includes both new and old songs of many different genres ( a full list of songs is at the bottom of this review ) . There should be something for everyone here , unless you 're a militant metalhead . <p> The campaign in Dance Central 2 is quite different from its predecessor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unlock stuff . Instead , there 's a bit of a backstory ( albeit a very weak one ) involving you showing off your moves to different dance crews so you can dance for them . You do this by earning stars - your performance is ranked out of five stars , so the better you do , the quicker you 'll impress the crews . As you twirl , shuffle and roll your way up the street-dancing ranks , you just happen to unlock extra dancers , as well as hidden outfits for your existing dancers . <p> You can take on the campaign mode alone , or co-op with a friend . Co-op works surprisingly well , although you do have to be careful not to hit each other if you do n't have a whole lot of room to move around .

The only choice of language is English ( US ) , which means that Kinect will only listen to your voice commands if you put on a ludicrous fake accent . Particularly bad is the word ' dance ' , which is the most-used command . <p> The other thing that still is n't great , more than a year after Kinect 's launch , is the accuracy of the device . there are times when you 're sure you 're getting a move exactly right , but the game swears up and down that your leg is in the wrong place , or your head is slightly too far to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> If you 're interested in dancing games for fitness , Dance Central has a couple of different options for you .

However , if you want the game to choose your exercise regime for you , there are a number of ready-made playlists in the fitness section that will get you really moving ( and sweating ) . <p> Dance Central2 is a solid party game , if nothing else .

@@4427233 <h> What is the best sci-fi show right now ? <p> Last updated 08:00 18/11/2011 <p> If I asked you to name your favourite sci-fi show of all time , I 'm guessing the answers would be fairly predictable : Stargate SG-1 , Battlestar Galactica , Star Trek ( or one of its spinoffs ) , maybe a few calls for Firefly or Lost ... you get the idea . But these shows all have something in common : none are currently in production . <p> To me , the more interesting question is : What is the best science fiction show being made right now ? <p> I think two factors make this question a little harder to answer . First , the range of sci-fi shows available on Kiwi channels is fairly limited : we do n't have a dedicated science-fiction network ( like SyFy in the USA ) and , aside from Prime , none of the channels are airing sci-fi in primetime . <p> To get a proper sci-fi fix , you 're almost forced to go online - which is troublesome for any discussion of the genre , since some viewers wo n't have seen this or that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on . ( This seems like a good time to remind you : this is a spoiler-free blog , so please refrain from posting key details of episodes/shows that have n't yet aired in NZ . ) <p> Second , the definition of sci-fi is used pretty loosely these days . Since so many shows incorporate elements of science-fiction , it 's impossible to say where the line is between drama and sci-fi . For example , is Supernatural a sci-fi show ? It seems more like a fantasy show to me . What about something like The Walking Dead ? It has the post-apocalyptic vibe going for it , which is generally associated with the sci-fi genre , but it 's more like a dramatic horror* show than anything else . <p> While it 's interesting to figure out the distinctions ( especially if you 're a TV dork like me ) , for the purposes of today 's blog we 'll allow anything that the commenter considers a sci-fi show . <p> So , with all of that in mind , what is your favourite sci-fi show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a sci-fi , but bear in mind that it has to be in production as of November 2011 . Post yours in the comments section below - and while you do that , here 's my Top 5 list ( in no particular order ) : <p> Doctor Who : The classic show got a new lease of life in 2006 and has gone from strength to strength since , with latest doctor Matt Smith proving the best so far ( in my opinion , anyways ) . The most recent season was perhaps the best since the reboot , making Doctor Who one of my favourites ( and I 'm sure one of yours too ) . <p> The Walking Dead : I 'm still not sure if Dead should count as a sci-fi or a drama , but I 'm putting it here anyway . The second series is returning to TV2 next year and takes on a much more dramatic tone than the hit first series . It 's still absolutely riveting though . <p> Fringe : The fourth series of the **29;218;TOOLONG show from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Kiwi screens next year ) and better than ever , with a fantastic cast ( led by Anna Torv and John Noble ) and clever storytelling making Fringe a must-see show for any sci-fi fan . <p> Misfits : The only comedy on my list , Misfits has a wicked sense of humour and sets the action in London , where a group of kids on community service are granted super powers after a freak storm . The third season is due to air on Four sometime next year . <p> Falling Skies / Alphas : I 've lumped these two together as both are American shows which aired this year , though only Falling Skies has any chance of airing in NZ ( TV2 have plans to show it at some stage ) . Both shows boast a strong cast , both are a nice twist on established formulas - Falling Skies an alien-invasion story set after the invasion , Alphas a superhero story about a collection of reluctant heroes - and both are fantastic viewing . <p> So go on - share your favourite sci-fi shows in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now ? <p> ( * ) If a drama-comedy is a " dramedy " , what would a dramatic horror be ? Drarror ? Horrama ? Also , would a dramatic thriller be a driller ? Also , how much fun is it to make up these portmanteaus ? Also , how much fun is it to say " portmanteau " out loud ? <h> Sponsored links <p> Just finished watching Season 3 of Fringe and was excellent - I think this series has got better and better . The trick will be not getting too cheesy with the next series as it is best will each episode has has some story in itself as well . I would hate to see it jump the shark anytime soon . <p> Only one better would be Walking Dead but to be honest I do n't think of it as a Sci-Fi Show - though it 's close to the best show at the moment . <p> peter #2 08:20 am Nov 18 2011 <p> I was a late convert to Fringe , My wife was hooked from the first episode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , she loved from the get go , and I really on started watching it after the " Dod Calm " episode . <p> jackryan #3 08:26 am Nov 18 2011 <p> I think it 's the tweed jacket , just works so well . <p> Terra Nova started off with a good premise , but after 8 episodes I think they have lost direction . Maybe I was expecting something different . <p> Falling skies was quite good , looking forward to second series . <p> Rach #4 08:38 am Nov 18 2011 <p> Stargate would definately be up there on my list of all time Sci-Fi shows . I never really pictured Lost as a sci-fi , but it 's a bit hard to put it in another category . <p> Currently I 'd have to say Doctor Who and Fringe , closely followed by Torchwood . <p> The Walking Dead I see more as a horror - though it is more drama-y than most Zombie films . <p> Unfortunately none of these are currently playing on our screens . Season 2 of SGU is back - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't stack up with SG1 and Atlantis . <p> Jim #5 08:39 am Nov 18 2011 <p> Really enjoying watching Warehouse 13 and Terra Nova with my kids . Dr Who has been buried by Prime , which is a real mistake . I do n't understand their reasoning for this at all , as my eldest loves it and it is simply on too late for him to watch it any more . They 've put SGU on in the same slot which also precludes enjoying that show together . <p> I 'll have to dig Babylon5 out and watch that with them . Story arcs that span series are something seriously lacking from current Sci-Fi TV shows , though Warehouse 13 has a reasonable stab at it but the premise better suits an encapsulated format . Having said that , expanding the team through the latter half of SE02 and into SE03 has allowed seperate , concurrent storylines within one episode . <p> Leon #6 08:39 am Nov 18 2011 <p> I 'd go in a slightly different direction , and say that Primeval is a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of technology , and the occasional person being eaten by either a dinosaur or a creature from a twisted future . <p> Whilst like many shows it started out brilliantly , and has been watered down over the years as the original cast have mostly left to get a more stable gig ( the show has been on the edge of cancellation pretty much from day 1 ) , even in the newest version it 's still very watchable . There are good plot arcs over a series , characters you can relate to , complex characters , and a cute flying lizard called Rex . <p> I will merely comment ( in a spoiler free way ) that if you like Jurassic Park , and extremely hate Home and Away , you should avoid the forthcoming eventually to NZ series " Terra Nova " . It is a ghastly show , and has not nearly enough people being eaten by dinosaurs , and far too much boring . <p> Tash #7 08:39 am Nov 18 2011 <p> I am really enjoying Dollhouse . <p> ben #8 08:42 am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fringe ( #1 ) , Misfits , The Walking Dead , Supernatural and could Game of Thrones be considered ( after all they have the Wight Walkers and Wildings , north of the Wall ) .... <p> Mark Chiddicks #9 08:46 am Nov 18 2011 <p> Doctor Who , no contest . Its made with a sense of fun and experimentation thats unmatched on TV today , and the current cast and crew are the best the show 's ever had . Watch this last season 's " The Doctor 's Wife " and tell me there 's anything approaching it . <p> If we move beyonf SF to fantasy , then " Game of Thrones " is utterly fantastic too , and the genres have very similar fanbases <p> Joanna #10 08:48 am Nov 18 2011 <p> Walking Dead for sure .

@@4455240 <h> Contact buys Whirinaki power plant <h> Relevant offers <p> Contact Energy has acquired a government-owned power station -- for just over a fifth of what the company was paid to commission it in 2004 . <p> NZX-listed Contact struck a deal to acquire the diesel-fired Whirinaki peaker plant , which operates only when electricity prices are high , for $33 million , after a competitive tender . <p> Contact was paid $150m to build the plant and operated it under contract for the Government . The plant was built as " insurance " against dry weather limiting hydro power production . <p> One energy market expert said the Whirinaki plant in Hawke 's Bay was a panicked response to a power shortage in 2003 and was built in the wrong place . <p> Although analysts said that the price Contact paid was " attractive " for the company , the discount to Whirinaki 's build price was a reflection that the plant should never have been built there . <p> Contact chief executive Dennis Barnes said Contact was " happy " with the price , but insisted it reflected market value . <p> " We must have bid more than the next bloke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barnes said . <p> " We feel it 's an appropriate price for its future use , recognising the plant wo n't run very often .

" <p> Ewan Gebbie , executive officer of the Energy Management Association , said the location of the plant , away from major population bases and the bulk of New Zealand 's gas supplies , was not ideal . <p> " In an ideal world it would have been built in Auckland , but there was a lot of time pressure . <p> " The Government needed to be seen to be doing something to reduce our exposure to dry years .
