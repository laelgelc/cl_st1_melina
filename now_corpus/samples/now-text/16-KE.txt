Nonetheless , avant-garde may spring to mind when observing the context of both the African and International scope . Together they have brought innovative expressions to nearly every approach of disco , afro -electronic and even rap . <p> What may have set them apart is their ability to eloquently capture raw , fresh and old addictions in a sociably enjoyable way . Not to mention their unique and evolving efforts in visual storytelling , which helped catapult their music all the way to globally recognised platforms . <p> Just a band finally announced their two year break and bid their farewell at the Blankets &amp; Wine festival last Sunday . Before they did though , they left us with their priceless memoir published into a picture book wittingly titled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the Blinky Bill ( Bill selanga ) , Nairobi Dhobi ( Daniel Muli ) and Dj Ricky Suede ( Mbithi Masya ) . <p> Jim chuchu who also deeply contributed to their success left to pursue solo projects in film and music . Though they met during their studies at Kenyatta University , they all had amazingly rich pasts that reveal the origins of their eclectic sound . <p> As told in their book , Nairobi Dhobi is a migrant and designate of a Nubian brotherhood . He ended up studying Fine Arts having already learnt how to play the Misenkora ( a six stringed desert lyre ) whilst on his travels with a touareg caravan . Blinky Bill went on to study Sports Science where he began his artistic ambitions on the guitar managing to be a constant addition in local bands such as Digibell Kudamm and Conga -- O-Matik . <p> Jim 's history spans all the way to Kilgoris town of Narok County where he was a waiter . Here , he studied sound synthesis under the mentorship of Daoussa Debu . The rest became history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Volkswagen van for some instruments . <p> Iwinyo Piny ' emerged as their first , well appreciated audiovisual achievement in 2008 which reflected their interests in house and trance music . By then , a conscious effort to mix disco-orientated music with some local identity was increasing visibly . This became part of their first studio album Scratch to Reveal that also featured exciting hits such as Hey ! That quickly made them a favourite to many at live concerts and fests within and outside the city . <p> Two years later comes Kenya 's first viral meme Makmende , a fictional 70 's styled action hero with a quest for vengeance . The music video of which Makmende plays a central character sky rocketed Ha-he , a single from the album 82 which failed to disappoint with even more successful hits such as Tingiza Kichwa and Usinibore . <p> The 15 track Sorry for the Delay album later came through as the most dynamical , with even further and high quality innovations . By this time , Jim 's large shoes had been filled by Mbithi Masya who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being produced with the likes of Stan , Lisa Oduor and Octopizzo . Singles like Probably for Lovers and Dunia Ina Mambo proved their growth in pop lyricism and alternative compositions with the appearance of horn sections and more masterful instrumental performances on voice , bass and guitar . <p> Local directors , photographers , graphic designers , actors , dancers and stylists as part of JAB 's collective helped breathe this movement to life ever since the label revolution that they co-formed during their genesis . Despite their thrillingly awaited fourth studio album that teased us with Winning in Life , the band attached a CD with their book titled Light Speed that contains their previously unreleased music . <p> As they invite some time to re-settle and re-discover themselves through their growing solo projects , their legacy promises to push further boundaries and distill powerful energy into the hearts of many across the globe .

@@8344234 <h> Weak laws stimulating ... trade in Kenya <h> share <p> Recently , French MPs passed a law that makes it illegal to pay for sex and imposes fines of up to Sh400,000 for those buying sexual acts . <p> Those convicted would also have to attend classes to learn about the conditions faced by prostitutes . Those found guilty for paying for sex will pay a first time fine of Sh165,000 , which will more than double for a repeat offence . The move , unpopular as it was among sex-hungry men and women as well as sex workers , offers lessons for many countries grappling with the growing prostitution problem . <p> As expected , sex workers protested the law . It will of course kill their business , but it will also help fight trafficking networks and restore some level of moral purity . France had tried to fight prostitution way back in 2003 when it passed a law that penalised sex workers for soliciting but that did not slow down the trade . <p> In Kenya , sex business has become as big as even tourism . Every single day Kenyans -- mostly men from low-earners in the slums and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex in whatever form . Nairobi and other big towns are full of brothels which remain busy even during economic slowdown . <p> With technology , prostitution has gone high-end and sex workers are getting clients through Facebook and WhatsApp , where the daring ones have created their own groups . It 's not unusual , by the way , to see female purveyors of flesh posting their ' sexy ' photos on Facebook , including their phone numbers to solicit partakers . <p> Sex trade remains illegal in Kenya . But the enforcement of the law has been as weak as the many hearts of men who oil this business . Sometime back the police would conduct swoops but that stopped when it was discovered that the officers would also ask for sexual favours to release the culprits , thus promoting the business rather than curtailing it . <p> Perhaps Kenya should go the France way to reduce prostitution since it appears impossible to eliminate what 's often referred to be the world 's oldest profession . Sex trade creates a fertile ground for crimes such as sexual abuse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thievery and immoral acts like adultery , pre-marital sex and so on . <p> Sweden , which was the first country to criminalise those who pay for sex rather than the prostitutes , is reaping the fruits . Swedish authorities say the number of women on the streets in the prostitution area in Stockholm has fallen since the legislation was introduced . <p> If that happens in Kenya , the men and women who buy sex can channel the billions into improving their families and more productive investments . <p> The writer is the managing editor of businesstoday.co.ke Twitter @mulunda email : email protected

@@8695235 <p> The news that ... memorandum of understanding ( MoU ) signed by Cord leaders Raila Odinga and Kalonzo Musyoka is no longer honored due to frustrations is being received from all corners of the country with different and funny reactions . <p> As we wait for his comment , some Wiper affiliated leaders have already started demanding and advising Mr Kalonzo to ditch the coalition and join the Jubilee . <p> They hold that , Raila and his ODM party are playing monopoly . If not well thought of , it will leave a politician and his followers wandering in the coming general elections . <p> A leader can show his/her wisdom in making rational choices if those surrounding him have the people 's interests and nation 's spirit at heart and , who can do away with their personal interests and positively advise the leader in the tunnel leading to light . <p> Ditching Cord is not a big deal ; the issue is the option of joining Jubilee . The leading coalition is already packed . <p> The 2017 , 2022 and maybe 2032 aspirants are already known . Everyone knows that President Uhuru Kenyatta can not step down in 2017 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ruto , who has played the better part of contributing and publicizing the leading coalition , will go for it in 2022 . <p> It should be remembered that other Jubilee leaders including the Nairobi senator Mike Sonko have publicly made their 2032 ambitions . Conceding to joining the ruling party is like a come-we-stay relationship that will not fulfil Kalonzo 's presidential ambition . <p> Jubilee is already taking and using the Machakos Governor Dr Alfred Mutua , an issue that Kalonzo should unearth . He started with Maendeleo Chap Chap movement . <p> Recently , he was at the state house with 11 MPs discussing the development issues of the region . Mutua is already dividing the region . He should try to reconcile with Mutua to maintain the Ukambani Wiper votes region . <p> Kalonzo stands a chance of being a Cord flagbearer than of Jubilee . The Cord coalition is yet to publicly make it clear of who will be the overall aspirant . <p> Launching his presidential bid does not mean Mr Wetangula is the overall candidate . Announcing being still in the race does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Anyone eligible has the right to run for the top leadership position in Kenya . Let him come out and seriously voice his interest . Doing so will mandate the coalition to endorse the overall candidate who will be accepted by all through nomination . <p> Fearing to be defeated is like fearing challenge which is not the right way to make it in politics . Fearing that Raila will clinch it should show the Wiper leaders that their man needs to pull higher his socks as it is an indication that his game is weak and can neither scare nor floor the Jubilee party . <p> Going it alone or joining Amani coalition can at least but not really work . If he wants to win the next presidency , then Jubilee vehicle will take other people to the statehouse but not him . <p> In Jubilee , the pasture is not greener for him ; he will be a frustrated man until his political retirement . If Wiper feels mistreated in Cord , then it will look for a right word since humiliation will not fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We do n't want to see the ' napita katikati yao ' Kalonzo , we want to see a rational leader in Kalonzo.

@@10341237 <h> Our Judiciary must reclaim the respect it once enjoyed <p> The death of US Supreme Court judge Antonin Scalia this week has made me reflect on the role of the Judiciary generally but more particularly , that of the Supreme Court in contested democracies like ours . In the US , the Supreme Court is such a pre-eminent institution , that the question of the appointment of Justice Scalia 's replacement is now the most critical issue defining the race between the Republicans and Democrats . Our Constitution assumed that the Kenyan equivalent would play the same role that the US Supreme Court and indeed other similar courts play in resolving deeply contentious political and social issues . <p> It is for this reason that the Court was allowed by the Constitution to handle only those matters serious enough to have national interest consequences including those revolving around critical constitutional questions .

In an ideal world the Court would have grown in credibility and earned the trust of Kenyans before it adjudicated severely contested issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test was the Presidential election petition which in a place like Kenya where everything is seen through politically biased lenses left it grievously wounded . It did not help that due to constitutional timelines and its own positivistic approach to resolving procedural issues , some protagonists were left with a credible peg to hang their grievances on ; in their view , the Court had sacrificed substance for form in rejecting evidence presented after the procedural timelines . The injury to the Court 's reputation suffered some more when it entered into the fray of other election petitions . It is clear from a literal reading of the Constitution that it was never intended for the Court to resolve election petitions as a standard appellate court . But because the Constitution allowed the Court to resolve " issues arising out other interpretation of the Constitution " appellants were able to frame every petition in terms that raised constitutional interpretation issues . <p> The problem with election petitions is that like elections , they thrive in the realm of " murky extremis " and anyone who wrestles in that arena stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Court actually produced some good jurisprudence in the election petitions , but because of the murkiness of political contests , the grime that has arisen in the Kidero petition may , unless well handled , sound the death knell of the young court .

If however the Judge chooses not to appear before the tribunal , the JSC must find ways to lay to sleep the implicit allegations against the other Judges .

As Theresa May and , most likely , Hillary Clinton join Angela Merkel at the leadership of three major world powers , women 's leadership in politics is on the ascent . <p> Unfortunately , improvements in political representation have not been accompanied by improvements in the material conditions of ordinary women 's lives . <p> As the National Honorary Ambassador for the United Nations Population Fund ( UNFPA ) Kenya , I am well aware of just how far women in Africa still have to go not only in their quest for access to political participation , but also in the fight for the basic rights that will enable them to live healthily and safely . In fact , the advancement of women 's sexual and reproductive health and rights is key to achieving their full and equal participation in the social , political , and economic realms . <p> The good news is that this is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not just an abstract ideal , but a prerequisite for human progress . <p> Throughout the world , UNFPA has been working to change the narrative about the role of women . UNFPA 's message has been that the roles that men and women play in society are not biologically determined , but socially constructed . This means that these roles are man-made and can be changed when circumstances call for it . <p> That is why UNFPA is working to change the circumstances of marginalised and vulnerable women such as the four in every 10 women in Kenya who report being physically assaulted by people known to them . There is a need to change the circumstances of the nine in ten women in the north eastern parts of Kenya who undergo female genital mutilation ( FGM ) , almost all of whom have never gone to school . <h> READ MORE <p> A lack of education severely restricts a woman 's access to information and opportunities .

When a woman can effectively plan her family , she can plan the rest of her life . Protecting and promoting her reproductive rights -- including the right to decide the number , timing and spacing of her children -- is essential to ensuring her freedom to participate more fully and equally in society . <p> In its effort to change mindsets and include women as equal partners at the social and political table , UNFPA Kenya has become a key voice in the national discourse , engaging people across both the public and private sectors and mobilising for more resources to be invested in broad gender equality programmes . <p> I have particularly enjoyed working with the current UNFPA team led by Siddharth Chatterjee , an indefatigable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Nations , in some of the most unstable and risky parts of the world , has exposed him to the suffering that conflicts and disasters bring to communities , with the worst affected always being women and children .

I have been amazed at the tenacity of schoolgirls in Baringo who stood firm and convinced their fathers of the harmful effects of FGM . These powerful success stories come out of the activities of UNFPA Kenya , whose leadership has been determined to succeed even in the face of entrenched cultures that deny women any agency . <p> The task at hand , then , is not to give women strength , but to give society new eyes to perceive the strength that they already possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

I do agree that Kenyans could do better at saving , but that is certainly not the whole story . <p> While in most African countries savings rates are low , standing at 17 per cent of Gross Domestic Product , Kenya 's rates are lower at around 14 per cent of GDP with Tanzania and Uganda being cited as having crossed the 20 per cent mark with a lower per capita income . <p> Poor countries save less than richer ones , obviously , because they have to prioritise basic needs such as food , shelter , healthcare and education .

While experts argue between high growth explaining high savings or the other way around , whichever way you look at it the two concepts create a virtuous cycle . <p> Unfortunately , the kind of focus and institutional leadership required to achieve such strides are what we are so lacking in .

In the same way that we have to evaluate which projects give us the best ROI within the shortest payback period in organisations , the same principle applies to nations . <p> And just as firms have to evaluate low-hanging fruit that we can start to reap from versus a more fastidious approach toward larger investment projects , we owe it to our population to conduct the same meticulous engagement before we make commitments .

The most notable is the Nigeria-S ? o Tom ? &amp; Pr ? ncipe treaty . We can draw lessons from this treaty to see how the Kenya-Somalia dispute can be resolved amicably . <p> The Kenya-Somalia conflict is about what direction the boundary should take in the Indian Ocean . Somalia insists that her 1960 border stretched diagonally south-eastwards . Kenya says the boundary should move eastwards . <p> The clash is of course over the resources within and below the sea floor . It is estimated to hold substantial oil and gas deposits . Kenya has already licensed seven oil blocks for oil exploration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somalia . <p> The dispute is both complex and simple . Complex because , maritime boundaries are never clearly demarcated . Worse , Somalia has no stable government to conclusively settle the issue . Simple because there are already international frameworks for resolving such disputes . <h> READ MORE <p> In 2009 , Kenya signed an MOU with Somalia , agreeing that the boundary runs eastwards , the way it is with Tanzania . Kenya had prompted her war-torn neighbour to an agreement in order to beat the May 2009 deadline given by the United Nations ' Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf ( CLCS ) . The commission had required coastal states to submit data over limitations and directions of their maritime boundaries . CLCS required states with shared maritime boundaries to agree on their territories , exclusive economic zones and continental shelves beyond 200 nautical miles . Upon these three , it is possible to craft a win-win agreement between states . <p> However it is not all conflict .

The country is a former Portuguese colony and dirt poor . So there was excitement over the oil find . But Nigeria was also salivating at the discovery . <p> With foresight , in 2001 , the two countries signed a treaty under a Joint Development Plan framework . The MOU was grounded on the international conventions , which allow countries sharing disputed maritime boundaries to create Joint Development Zones ( JDZ ) . The Nigeria- S ? o Tom ? &amp; Pr ? ncipe JDZ covers about 34 , 470 sq . km in the Atlantic Sea . <p> This kind of arrangement is anchored in the December 1982 United Nations Convention of ' the law of the Sea ' ( UNCLOS ) .

@@15125230 to know the goings-on in the Judiciary until you read the report of the judicial tribunal that investigated the conduct of Justice Joseph Mbalu Mutava -- and which recommended his removal from office recently . <p> How the Judiciary , or rather Justice Mutava , allowed the architect of the Goldenberg scandal Kamlesh Pattni to get off the hook -- and to peacefully live among us had been the untold story for quite some time . <p> Also , it was the tail-end of a saga that dates back to 1992 when the then 25-year-old Kisumu trader took advantage of the government 's export compensation programme and pulled off one of Kenya 's biggest thefts from public coffers . <p> When the judicial inquiry recommended his removal from office , its conclusion was that Justice Mutava was not " an innocent bystander " in the circus that saw Pattni off the Sh5.6 billion hook . <p> Before it came to an end in 1995 , the Goldenberg scandal had cost taxpayers more than $600 million -- and is still the single largest fraud in Kenya 's history . <p> Interestingly , the Goldenberg scandal , 21 years after it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far nobody is in jail over it . <p> Some of those who were facing trial have since died including former Treasury Permanent Secretary , Dr Karuga Koinange , former Special Branch head James Kanyotu , and former Central Bank of Kenya Deputy Governor Eliphaz Riungu . <p> Before we come to Justice Mutava , a brief look at Goldenberg International and how it came into the scene to take advantage of an export compensation scheme would help . <p> Initially , the export compensation scheme had been put in place with good intentions or , as Saint Bernard of Clairvaux , once said : " The road to hell is paved with good intentions . " <p> It was supposed to lure businessmen into earning the country some hard currency after bilateral donors followed cue from the International Monetary Fund , and the World Bank and denied the President Daniel Moi regime crucial funding . <p> After studying Finance minister George Saitoti 's Export Compensation Scheme , Pattni had seen a loophole . <p> All that was required from a precious mineral exporter was paperwork . <p> If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth Sh100 million , the government would pay you Sh20 million or 20 per cent of the remitted currency . <p> And so , Pattni would buy as much foreign currency as he could from the local market , complete his paperwork and get compensated . <p> SUCCESSFUL DECEITAll that an exporter required was an official stamp on the export forms and confirmation that all the foreign exchange relating to the exports had been received and sold to the CBK . <p> Pattni 's plot was simple . He would register a company , bring in Mr James Kanyotu as his director , and purport to export gold , silver , diamonds , precious and semi-precious stones . <p> He would then buy foreign currency locally , deposit in another account at First American Bank , and seek export compensation from the Treasury . <p> It is now known that Pattni never exported anything but , through paperwork and with the help of government officials , he managed to get more than he bargained for initially . <p> When some officials from Central Bank and the First American Bank started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own bank -- Exchange Bank -- in August 1991 with a proposed capital of Sh40 million , which was deposited with Transnational Bank Ltd , owned by the Moi family . <p> As money poured into his coffers , Pattni sought and was given a monopoly to export gold and diamonds on the promise that he would earn the country $50 million . <p> And instead of the legal 20 per cent compensation , his company was granted 35 per cent , which was concealed in the budget as " customs refund " . <p> That is how the corruption network was put in place . <p> Some of the money was sent overseas and deposited in Pattni 's Exchange Bank nostrum accounts and later transferred back , earning 35 per cent compensation . <p> Finally , Goldenberg breached all the exchange control regulations and the agreement it had signed with CBK and Pattni used his connections to get his compensation paid after the claim was processed by the Customs and Excise Department . <p> Finally , and amidst lots of pressure from within and without , Pattni and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This only opened a civil and criminal circus that was played out in the court rooms over the years until 2003 when President Kibaki appointed the Bosire Commission of Inquiry to investigate the scam . <p> The Bosire Commission rendered its report in August 2006 and described Pattni as a " thief " and called for his prosecution . <p> As a result , the State lodged criminal case No 518 in 2006 , Republic vs Kamlesh Mansukhlal Damji Pattni and others over the stealing of Sh5.6 billion . <p> There was also a civil case of Sh2.1 billion arising from the tussle over Grand Regency ( now Laico Regency ) between CBK and Pattni 's Uhuru Highway Development Company . <p> MUTAVA 'S ENTRANCEWorried that the noose was tightening on him , Pattni wrote to Attorney-General Amos Wako requesting to enter a plea agreement and had been told to provide a full disclosure . <p> But with the new Constitution and the prosecution aspect removed from Wako 's office , the Director of Public Prosecutions rejected Pattni 's proposal . <p> That was January , 27 , 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . <p> It was this time that Pattni sought leave to quash the DPP 's direction . <p> The other order was to prohibit the chief magistrate from hearing or proceeding with Pattni 's case and to further prohibit the Attorney-General , DPP , the Commissioner of Police and chief magistrate from " arresting , charging , prosecuting , suing or commencing proceedings " against Pattni or his associated companies including Goldenberg in relation to the Goldenberg affair . <p> At first it looked like a long shot . But it was n't . It was a well calculated move . <p> The matter was filed some four days before the High Court judges broke for their August vacation and there was no certificate of urgency as is the practice . <p> This would be filed on August 10 by Pattni 's long-time lawyer Bernard Kalove along with an application that the matter should be heard during the vacation . <p> Although Justice Mutava was the vacation duty judge in the Commercial and Admiralty division , the case found its way to him -- even though it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hear the case as Justice Florence Muchemi was the vacation duty Judge . <p> But Justice Mutava granted the right to seek judicial review without hearing the other side . As a result , a judicial review was filed on August 28 , 2012 . <p> Mid-September , Pattni 's lawyer requested the Deputy Registrar that the matter be mentioned before Justice Mutava " for directions " since it was " part-heard " by him . <p> In another letter , Mr Kalove said there " is some clarification required by all parties ... in respect to the orders issued by the Hon Judge " . <p> It was a misrepresentation and Mr Kalove admitted later that this was an " oversight " . <p> The idea was to have Justice Mutava hear the matter and the Deputy Registrar of the Judicial Review Division , where the file was , naively allowed for its removal . It was delivered to Justice Mutava , ostensibly for mention -- although Justice Muchemi was the vacation duty judge for the Judicial Review Division . <p> Although Justice Mutava claimed he had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division , that was not the case since Korir was not the duty judge . <p> As it emerged later -- and the tribunal said as much -- it was Pattni 's lawyer , Mr Kalove , who " schemed to have the matter placed before the judge ( Mutava ) " and later have the matter placed before him after the vacation . <p> MUTAVA 'S ORDERThat is how the matter was listed for hearing on September 24 , 2012 disguised as Civil Case CC 305/012 and rather than identify Pattni by his name , it was listed as K. Damji v Attorney-General . <p> This , again , was a deliberate move to disguise the nature of the suit and to conceal Pattni 's identity as the applicant . <p> Interestingly , the Judge did not raise concern why a file that was not from his division was brought to him or why it was written K. Damji . <p> As he would say later , there was nothing special with the name Pattni -- although he saw the disguised manner in which it was listed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer James Warui , representing the DPP , appeared before Justice Mutava and agreed that the matter be determined on the basis of written submissions . <p> The Judge agreed and was also not bothered that this was a matter from another division . <p> Also , the " clarification " that was to be sought from him was never raised and that other parties to the suit were not present . He fixed the matter for hearing before himself . <p> At that time , the International Centre for Policy and Conflict led by Ndungu Wainaina sought an order in the Judicial Review Division seeking to restrain the AG and DPP from withdrawing Pattni 's case unless he paid Sh5.8 billion . <p> But by that time , Justice Mutava had granted an order staying all proceedings relating to Pattni and the Goldenberg affair . <p> Thus , Mr Wainaina 's ICPC could not be heard but was allowed in later as an interested party . <p> A protest by ICPC lawyers that the matter should be heard in the Judicial Review Division failed and Justice Mutava reserved his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had already been transferred to the High Court in Kericho . <p> In a judgment delivered on his behalf on March 23 , 2013 by Justice Havelock , Justice Mutava allowed Pattni 's judicial review to the extent that he allowed the AG and DPP from continuing to prosecute Pattni and his companies . <p> The judge then started taking submissions from Pattni 's lawyers and sought for the file to be taken to Kericho for him to write the judgment . <p> The file was put in a cabinet in his former chambers , from where he collected it and took it to Kericho . <p> Although the Judicial Service Commission had directed that this particular file be kept under safe custody , Justice Mutava , " eager to clear his pending work from Nairobi " , went with the file and wrote a judgment that stopped any further prosecution of Pattni . <p> " The facts point to a clear determination on the part of the judge to deal with the matter irrespective of the damage that action could cause . " <p> GUILTYIn his ruling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pattni ( was ) a perjurer , a forger , a fraudster and a thief ... impaired the applicant 's presumption of innocence " . <p> He noted that his right to fair trial had been infringed and that that made any further prosecution to be unconstitutional . <p> Justice Mutava knew that his ruling would elicit criticism . <p> " The discharge of a judge 's constitutional mandate is never easy . It is not meant for the faint-hearted . <p> " Any reaction arising from a decision made by a judge should be seen as one of the many vagaries of the calling , as long as the judge 's appreciation of the law and facts , his analysis and conclusions and , above all , the judge 's conscience , remain sanctified . I am , therefore , comfortable and well prepared for any such reaction . " <p> That reaction came .

He literally stirred a whole spectrum of emotions in the hearts of the people . <p> His fans were motivated to follow him because his message was so compelling that they felt like they had to " drain the swamp . " Donald J. Trump 's words were descriptive and therefore stuck more . He spoke using imagery but Hillary kept it abstract and logical . <p> Hillary , on the other hand , did not craft a message that was memorable . Her phrase , which I ca n't remember , was lacking in energy and enthusiasm . It was not compelling enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Secondly , even though the Hillary team focused on painting Donald Trump as a monster , they forgot to tell the American people what she was going to do for them if she was elected . <p> ' Trump is bad . Trump is unstable . Trump does n't have the right temperament for the white house . Trump this ... Trump that ... <p> The audience rarely remembers what Hillary stood for except her attacks of Trump . This strategy , to paint him as an ogre failed badly . <p> On the other hand , Donald spoke about building a wall . He spoke about deporting immigrants . He spoke about the economy and returning jobs back to Americans . He spoke about tax cuts and repealing the Obama care . <p> His policies , though viewed as outrageous by a section of the populace , appealed to his core group -- the white conservatives . Hillary 's strategy failed because she focused so much on discrediting the opponent that she forgot to sell her agenda . <p> As a guru salesman , Donald Trump was looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was a matter of life and death . You do not go to war with a master negotiator and not be prepared . Hillary played civil politics that can never get anybody out to vote but Trump won because he employed guerilla tactics . <p> Marketers and communicators must burn the midnight oil to study Trump as a master salesman and an excellent communicator . He literally tore the rulebook and decided that he was going to have fun with the elections . That paid off because from being dismissed as someone who was a joke to winning the GOP title and now the presidency , surely this man had a plan . <p> The Media <p> In the history of US elections , the media has never been this biased . All the mainstream media stations were supporting Hillary Clinton . But that worked perfectly well for the narrative that Trump was perpetuating . He packaged himself as a man who was not tainted with the Washington powerful men bureaucracy . He packaged himself as a layman who was simply tired of the career politicians messing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Knight in a shining armour . <p> So when the media joined in the frenzy to back Hillary , his point was cemented ; the ' dirty ' Washington system wanted to retain a puppet in the person of Hillary Clinton , with the help of the media . <p> But just like in classical movies and the art of storytelling , once you get a villain , the hero story becomes very captivating . To ordinary people , Donald Trump was the villain . However , in the eyes of the majority white and conservative voter segment , Hillary was their villain and Donald Trump their hero . <p> Through his controversial statements , he had mastered the art of getting prime slots in news without paying for it . The media was awash with his words . He dominated the digital landscape . Everybody was talking about him . <p> Complacency <p> Obama 's endorsement of Hillary might have worked against her . Obama 's charisma worked for him . He could n't transfer it to Hillary . Plus , he was on the verge of making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recessions . After Bush , they needed someone to inject hope and rescue America . Obama was the man . <p> But now , he is an incumbent . While Obama is leaving the white house with one of the highest approval ratings in US history , he was n't popular among the conservative whites . Endorsing Hilary irked this group . They might have interpreted the endorsement as an attempt for the Democratic Party to extend Obama 's rule through Hillary . <p> That was a double fodder for them to get out in large numbers and stop Hillary . For them , it was a matter of life and death . They were n't going to stand another 4 years of the Democratic rule . <p> Obama being the incumbent , those who opposed him saw him as a clown and a soft guy who was more interested in pleasing the world than making America great again . <p> However , the nation was thirsty for a strong man who could be trusted to build a wall , deport illegal immigrants and stand against the powerful ' Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He talks tough though sometimes his words appear to be offensive , he usually compartmentalises them . His target audience understands him . <p> She appeared too confident and she did n't want it so bad . Being backed by powerful forces and having the Clinton name might have played a part in putting slowing down her campaign wheels . She appeared too comfortable because of a perception that she was going to win . She might have trusted the pollsters who predicted that she would win . <p> Her ' winning ' the debates might have also played a part in getting her to be relaxed because the elections were for her to lose .

However , he discovered that for him to fully realise the profits that he intended to in the property market , he needed to pursue it as a full-time career . <p> " I decided to quit my job as a patent officer in the Ministry of Science and Technology and formed a real estate company , " Mr Ojijo recalls .

Develop a niche and know it well <p> According to Mr Ng'ang'a , people often fail in real estate because they enter the field when they are still not sure about what to specialise in . Consequently , they fumble about in the dark attempting to be Jacks of all trades , only to end up frustrated . Real estate , the Granite Capital CEO says , has several areas such as dealing in vacant land , wholesaling , real estate investment trusts ( REITs ) and flipping . A potential investor needs to carefully select one niche and pursue it .

" <p> 4 . Develop good networks <p> All successful realtors , Mr Ojijo says , build around themselves a network of high-value individuals in the industry . Since he served as the founding chairperson of the Kenya Property Developers Association ( KPDA ) , Mr Ojijo realises the importance of realtors working together even though they are in competition with one another . He says that he has been able to build a large investment portfolio because acquaintances in his circle often ask to partner with him . <p> " One of the reasons why I started the Kenya Homes Expo was to help the different players in the sector interact and forge affiliations , " Mr Ojijo says . <p> Meanwhile , Mr Ng'ang'a attributes the successful run of Granite Capital to partnerships with established real estate companies . <p> " For example , we have partnered with Cytonn Investments , for whom we market property . The partnership with Cytonn has given us access to its huge client ? le base , thereby catalysing our growth , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a company before performing a thorough background search on it . He says it is important to conduct such a search to avoid getting into a partnership with a dubious organisations that can sully one 's reputation . <p> 5 . Know when to consult professionals <p> According to Mr Wanjala , many people who venture into real estate initially want to do everything by themselves , without engaging professionals such as realtors , lawyers , property valuers and building contractors . This is usually in a bid to save costs , as the common perception among average investors is that professionals charge a lot for their services . <p> However , Mr Ng'ang'a argues that this perception could not be further from the truth and goes on to give the example of a person looking to sell their home . If such a home owner chooses to bypass professional realtors and decides to engage the potential buyers on their own , they not only risk being conned , but also selling the house at a price that 's far much lower than the current market prices .

Be honest and ethical <p> During the State House Summit on Land that was held on Monday this week , an issue that was said to be a sore point by many stakeholders was the high level of deceit when it comes to land dealings in the country . It seems con men have been having a field day selling land whose titles are either forged or non-existent . This has made Kenyans generally sceptical when it comes to trading in real estate . <p> " When one joins the real estate field as an investor , opportunities to make an easy buck under the table will surely arise . Honesty is such a rare virtue in this field that the few of us who possess it stand out as giants and market leaders , " says Mr Ng'ang'a . <p> Meanwhile , Mr Ojijo says high ethical standards are crucial ingredients for his success . <p> " I have always tried to put the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has helped me retain clients for years , as I have clients whom I did business with 20 years ago calling to thank me . When you 're honest , word gets around fast and people keep referring new customers to you , " he says . <p> 7 . Embrace technology <p> That technology evolves rapidly is common knowledge but what Mr Ojijo has learnt is that it is up to the investor to adapt in tandem with the technological changes or let their business sink . <p> " We have stayed above the competition because at Villa Care and Homes Universal , we are always looking to infuse the latest technology into our operations . For instance , we use a cloud-based system of management that can instantly be accessed anywhere by our agents , clients and home owners , " he reveals . <p> Meanwhile , Granite Capital channels almost its entire marketing budget to social media platforms . Digital marketing , Mr Ng'ang'a points out , is the future of real estate marketing because the majority of their buyers fall between the ages of 30 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Develop good communication and negotiation skills <p> The property industry is all about communicating with potential clients and convincing them to sign along the dotted line . Both Mr Ng'ang'a and Mr Ojijo aver that clinching a deal relies heavily on the art of conversation , which is not usually an easy concept to grasp . <p> " I always asses people 's communication skills before entering into any business partnerships with them . Real estate is all about selling , and selling needs superb communication skills that sometimes can not be learnt in school , " Mr Ojijo says . <p> " I have seen deals worth tens of millions collapse just because of a mere Sh100,000 . This points to poor negotiation skills on the part of the realtor , who is supposed to be the link between the seller and the buyer . A realtor should have an inborn ability to bring two opposing parties to the table and make them reach a common ground , " adds Mr Ng'ang'a . <p> 9 . Keep your emotions in check <p> A serious error that Mr Wanjala @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices simply because they 've " fallen in love " with it . <p> " I ask my clients to make purchases based on facts and figures , not emotions , " he says . <p> He further advises that before one buys property , they should seek expert valuation and never pay a cent above the valuation price . When entering into a joint venture partnership with others , they should do so based on the other party 's competence in handling real estate matters as opposed to appeasing close friends and relatives . If possible , avoid getting into deals with close relatives . <p> 10 . Keep yourself informed <p> In order to adapt to the ever-changing political landscape and economic trends , one needs to constantly keep abreast of new developments in real estate . Mr Ojijo confesses to being an avid reader of property magazines and a voracious consumer of political news . <p> " The decisions that politicians make always end up affecting the property sector in one way or the other , he says . <p> Being constantly informed also helps one to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emerging trends .

" <p> Lancet Kenya guidelines on avoidance of mosquito bites in children , indicates that Mosquito repellents containing DEET ( N , N-diethyl-3- methylbenzamide ) , are useful for protection during outdoor activities . These repellants should be applied to exposed skin surfaces and repeated after 4-6 hours , according to the manufacturers ' instructions . <p> In infants and young children , insect repellents should be applied to exposed skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large body surface area compared to the body weight in this age group . Long ( preferably light coloured ) clothing should be worn to minimise the amount of exposed skin . <p> Yellow fever vaccine is also one of the considerations that those intending to travel to endemic countries in Africa and South America should consider . <p> PREGNANT WOMEN <p> It is commonplace for pregnant women to take care of their health at all times to ensure that both the mother and child are in tiptop health . And like everyone else , pregnant women too want to enjoy the festive season . <p> For starters , reproductive health expert , Dr Joachim Osur , says less alcohol , consumption of lots of water and proper diet are the basic mantras for staying healthy . <p> " If you have to travel , try and avoid malaria endemic regions and avoid having food poisoning , " advises Dr Osur . <p> " Give your body the chance to digest smaller meals . That way , you will be able to enjoy festive food without suffering from indigestion or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much pressure on your body , says Dr Osur . Instead , accept offers of help by letting other people carry the shopping and do the cooking . <p> It is easy to forget to keep your fluid levels topped up when you are rushing around or are out of your usual routine , something that should not happen . It is therefore advisable to always have some water at hand . <p> " If travelling long distances , pregnant women should make sure that they travel smart by keeping adequate snacks , fruits and water with them , as traffic snarls during festivities can test one 's patience and hunger , " explains Dr Osur . <p> It is also important to avoid crowded places , as the crowd can be boisterous and unruly during festivals and one needs to protect themselves from any unnecessary harm . <p> " Avoiding noisy events is necessary because extremely high decibel of sound can be dangerous for one 's pregnancy . " <p> He , however , notes that if the pregnancy is in its danced stages ( above 34 weeks ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ROAD SAFETY <p> If you are traveling alone as an adult , any time is road trip time . However , if you have children and have not hit the road by 6 pm , postpone the trip to the next day . Anthony Mwangi , Red Cross Society of Kenya 's spokesman , highlights that travelling during the day helps you monitor the child or children at the back of the car . <p> " While driving at night , the light in the car is often switched off for a better view of the road ahead . But in so doing , the child will not be attended to . Therefore , as a parent , always intend to arrive at your destination by 6 pm , " advises Mwangi . <p> Further , all children above three years should be in a baby seat and strapped at the back seat . <p> " A child held by a parent or guardian at the front is highly exposed to fatal accidents as opposed to those strapped at the back . It is a law commonly broken by many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's seat , which is wrong , " he adds . <p> Mr Mwangi also says that stop overs during the journey should be exercised with caution . " At no point should a child be left strapped and locked in the back seat . Change in temperatures inside the vehicle where windows are rolled up can cause suffocation that can either result in fainting or death . " <p> Finally he says that there is need to have a well-equipped firstaid kit with basic first aid equipment in your vehicle . <p> " Ensure that there are gloves , bandages , scissors , safety pins , over-the- counter pain killers , antiseptic among other essentials needed to do a first aid . In addition , ensure there is sufficient water for rehydration for people in the vehicle , " advises Mwangi . <p> THE WATER YOU DRINK &amp; FOOD YOU EAT <p> When the year begins , resolutions such as to lose weight are top on the list of most people .

Therefore , you are likely to take larger portions of ugali , fatty roasted meats with fewer vegetables or fruits on the plate . <p> Such heavy meals can lead to indigestion . Further , more energy is required to digest the food which may in turn cause fatigue and drowsiness . <p> As you prepare to travel upcountry , confirm that you either carry water treating tablets or have the water that you will be drinking boiled to avoid waterborne diseases like cholera and typhoid . <p> And while at it , make sure that you always eat freshly prepared food to avoid food poisoning . <p> While it is common place for residents of urban places to store left overs in the fridge , many may not have that luxury when at their rural homes and therefore , to avoid having stomach upsets and diarrhoea , Dr Osur advises that people should be keen on what they eat at all times . <p> " Cook enough food that will be eaten and finished in one day because food can easily be contaminated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only thing Kenyans will line up on their tables .

Two large glasses of wine for instance , are equivalent to around six units of alcohol . This is five times alcohol more than the body can process . <p> For those who will drink during the holiday season , they can surpass the eight glasses of water so as to keep hydrated , advises the National Authority for the Campaign against Drug Abuse ( Nacada ) . <p> " When you drink , your body loses water quickly this could be through sweating or urinating a lot .

Alcohol is like a poison with harmful consequences to the body , " he says . <p> People who should stay away from alcohol include expectant women , individuals taking prescription or over-the-counter medications that can interact with alcohol , people with conditions such as liver disease or pancreatitis as well as other chronic illnesses . <p> SWIMMING <p> The World Health Organisation has ranked drowning as the third leading cause of unintentional injury death worldwide , accounting for seven per cent of all injury-related deaths .

However , for patients with Non-Communicable Diseases ( NCD ) like diabetes , hypertension , sickle cell anaemia among others , there is always a temptation to cheat ones way to try out different types of food . <p> But doctors advise that there is need for this category of patients , especially those with diabetes , to strictly adhere to their prescribed diet . Most importantly , and like everybody else , you should try as much as possible to avoid food poisoning . <p> " Food poisoning will affect the blood sugar control in diabetics .

The toxicity might cause it to fail . Do n't take anything without discussing with your doctor . Do n't assume you can take anything , " says Dr Twahir . <p> A patient is asked to stick to a regular schedule of taking drugs , keeping in mind meal times as well . For instance , taking drugs on an empty stomach results in higher absorption of any key component of the drug and consequently , the levels go higher .
