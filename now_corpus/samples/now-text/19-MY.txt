It revolved around the importance of integrity in life and in an organisation 's corporate culture . <p> My participation seemed awkward at first . This was still Old Malaysia , where dissent was not tolerated , and it was just slightly more than a year following the suspension of The Edge , ironically for trying to tell its readers the goings-on at 1Malaysia Development Bhd ( 1MDB ) and for stressing the need to get rid of corruption and uphold integrity and governance in corporate Malaysia . The Edge was then seen as an anti-establishment media organisation , but maybe the EPF wanted someone with a contrarian view . <p> Another panellist was government apologist of the day and staunch supporter of ex-prime minister Datuk Seri Najib Razak -- Ahiruddin Attan aka Rocky Bru , whom I refer to simply as Din . <p> Din was a college mate of mine and we both spent many years as journalists with The Business Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( M ) Bhd and the country 's first and , at that time , only financial daily . We might differ in our political leanings but remain good friends . Our favourite band is The Beatles and we have every single one of the Fab Four 's albums . ( I wonder if Din bought the White Album 50th anniversary edition , which was released in November ) . <p> The third speaker was well-respected academician , writer , national laureate and wise old man , Professor Dr Muhammad Salleh . He has a poetic way with words and wrote these lines : " Ask for a leaf , and a leaf I 'd give you ; In the leaf the veins concourse ; Ask for a pantun and a pantun I 'd give you ; In the pantun there is a discourse . " <p> During our discourse , the moderator reminded us while we were free to present our views , it would be preferable to avoid contentious issues like 1MDB . This was October 2016. after all . But the discussion veered towards that direction when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to defend The Edge 's position , and today , we have been vindicated for every story we have written on the issue . <p> My definition of integrity , I told the participants , is not the typical dictionary meaning of the word , such as honesty , truth or uprightness , but rather , a simple understanding of it as " doing what is right , and when we know that it is the right thing to do , then we must also be brave enough to say ' no ' " . And if everyone , from the janitor and tea lady to the CFO and CEO practised this , then the organisation is in safe hand . <p> It should have been management philosophy for dummies but in Old Malaysia , it was easier said than done . As the old Umno-led Barisan Nasional fell this year , we now know for sure that there were many who did not do what is right , let alone be brave enough to say " no " to their superiors . They included secretaries-general of ministries , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man running the country -- the prime minister . <p> In cases like 1MDB , FELDA , Tabung Haji , Mara and the many inflated construction and infrastructure jobs , some of which were unnecessary , the chairman , board members , CEO , CFO , senior management , internal auditor and external auditors , including the multinationals , failed us Malaysians big time . The janitor and the tea lady have bigger hearts and more honour than some of these highly paid professionals . <p> To give the younger audience at the panel discussion a better perspective , I related how the government , after the racial riots on May 13 , 1969 , decided to be an active participant in managing the economy so that it could restructure society and Corporate Malaysia in a more equitable manner . <p> The government then created off-budget agencies and non-financial public enterprises -- the precursor to today 's government-linked companies . To manage these organisations , many of which have a strong social responsibility component , the government seconded some of the best professionals in the civil service . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private sector salaries , but paycheques that were just a bit more than they had been receiving . <p> They were the right choice then , especially for a nation that was facing a dearth of talent , notably among bumiputeras , to manage government companies and organisations . But these civil servants knew and believed in the national agenda . They served with integrity . That was how Petronas was started way back in 1974 , and steadily bloomed into a Fortune 500 company and the oil and gas multinational it is today . <p> In the meantime , to fill the managerial gap , the government spent billions of ringgit to send the best students to top universities in the UK , Australia , New Zealand , the US and Japan so that they would one day take over from the civil servants . Many of these government scholars were allowed to work and gain experience in Wall Street and City of London before they were recalled to serve the nation . <p> And when these professionals came back in droves to serve Corporate Malaysia in the 1980s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualified but were paid private sector salaries , a whole lot more than the civil servants they replaced . Today , many of the CEOs and CFOs earn more than RM100,000 a month , with a few taking home as much as RM500,000 . <p> However , I pointed out , they may be qualified and well-paid but some of them ca n't even do a simple thing that an organisation requires -- to have impeccable integrity , be brave enough to do what is right and say " no " to what is wrong . <p> I would rather have someone with an SPM qualification , who did not go to university but can say , " Sir , this is not right lah " . We do n't need a spineless manager with an MBA to run a company . <p> New Malaysia must not fall into the same trap . New Malaysia should allow healthy discourse to prevail . New Corporate Malaysia and new politics must do what is right and have the ability to say " no " when things are wrong . <p> Seven months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indications that old habits die hard . We must not let this nation backslide into the wrong moral path once more .

@@40449237 <h> MySay : No bold strategy for PH , no real reform for Malaysia <p> The long-awaited change in government in Malaysia is now a fact , but the question to ask now is how committed to across-the-board reforms can the new ruling coalition be , led as it is by a 93-year-old prime minister who is scheduled to leave within two years , and given the internal distrust that is natural to expect from a government made up of four parties , one of which is only three years old , and another that is just two years old . <p> More to the point , are the disparate leaders in Pakatan Harapan able to imagine the New Malaysia well enough to believe in realising it , and do they possess enough political and strategic skills as well as cohesion to force the pace and stay the course ? <p> Although bringing down the Barisan Nasional was practically not imaginable until it actually did happen , reforming Malaysia into an economically vibrant and politically solid nation is showing itself to require a cohesion in policymaking and a boldness in strategy that appears to have already pushed the PH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of how the PH can be expected to fare in coming months , one has to acknowledge that the time for reforms in Malaysia was long delayed by the effective measures in ethno-populism , systemic manipulation and draconian intimidation undertaken by the long-serving BN government . <p> Change delayed for too long ? <p> The crucial question now is , has the ailment of rampant identity politics infected the marrow of the nation ? Was the patient able to get into the emergency room for surgery only after the cancer had reached a critical stage ? <p> As with all critical diseases , the cure relies both on the potency of the medication -- meaning the efficacy of the new government -- and the condition of the body 's immune system that is the strength of the belief that Malaysian society still has in the viability of its cultural pluralism . <p> Indeed , it is only when its leaders and its people feel that the country is still meant for bigger things that a New Malaysia can be perceived in practical and strategically effective terms . Lacking that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slogans and changes developed over the last few elections to defeat the BN , all expressed in the PH election manifesto for effect . <p> Without a properly developed process of reform , knee-jerk statements and quasi-policies , noteworthy more for their ad hoc nature than for being integrated , are to be expected from a government searching for direction . These measures will fail to inspire and will prove easy for the conservatives to counteract . The ICERD fiasco comes to mind . <p> A reform movement is nothing if it is not able to inspire its followers . <p> It is in this context that PH and DAP strategist Liew Chin Tong , who is also the deputy minister of defence , has cried out for a national narrative to be properly formulated and concertedly proliferated . Given that the election was won to a significant extent on socioeconomic dissatisfaction among voters , such a narrative will need to build on the struggle against the ample gaps in income , in information technology , in education and in entrepreneurial spirit existing in the country today , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2020 meet Reformasi <p> With Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad and Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim leading PH , one would think that their ministries would have enough brain power and strategic sense to work together to merge ideas from Vision 2020 ( functional between 1991 and 1998 , Malaysia 's economic golden age ) with those expressed so excellently by the Reformasi Movement ( effective in 1998 to 2018 as the backbone of the country 's re-democratisation process ) , to create such a narrative . <p> Six decades of BN rule fuelled by a popularly embraced agenda of identity politics and ethnic divide-and-rule " nation building " has left scars that only a bold and insightful micro-surgeon can mend . For the PH government to be that surgeon , it needs to show humility and openness even as it asks that the public show it patience and understanding . <p> There is much public goodwill for the new government to draw upon as yet , but public goodwill unmatched by inspiring leadership ( or worse , met by petty and confusing infighting within the ruling coalition ) soon turns into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there is no viable alternative to turn to leads to despair , cynicism and anger on a grand scale . <p> Recognising key areas where reforms must first take place , and putting all energy and resources into these chosen priorities , are basic to any agenda for real societal and institutional change . Much resistance will come from within the ranks of PH , either for fear of losing votes or for lack of the imagination needed to understand the comprehensive nature of societal change . <p> For each of the four PH parties , putting the most promising and most competent persons in the right positions appears already compromised by the wish to follow party hierarchies and to reward those who had fought hardest or longest against the old regime . Winning the war is , of course , not the same thing as winning the peace , and a good general may make a bad minister . <p> The sorry past naturally also lives within the PH , thriving as long as the eagerness for reform is stymied by a lack of a sanctioned list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow . <p> If PH should fail in reforming the nation , then one has to draw the conclusion that the time for reform was delayed too long , and the damage done has gone too deep to be remedied by a coalition government made up of the fragmented parts that the divide-and-rule politics of 60 years of BN created , and led by equally disjointed leaders .

The group is putting in efforts and investments to establish a solid foothold in the downstream segment of the food industry , including aquafarming . <p> The group has embarked on an ambitious expansion plan laying ground for it to feed the region 's growing appetite for protein-rich food . <p> MFM is investing RM1.1 billion over the next two to three years to build its integrated food complex in Lumut , Perak , where there are existing poultry farms , aquafarms and poultry processing plants . <p> Consequently , the group needs to raise fresh capital to finance the expansion , so that it would add financial stress to the group while raising its game . <p> Capacity constrains a happy problem <p> The group 's primary processing plant has currently reached its bottleneck . <p> Its existing plant is slaughtering about 80,000 birds a day , which is already the maximum capacity , according to its managing director Teh Wee Chye , who is also a substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " One main reason why we want to expand our poultry processing plant is because this is a 30-year-old plant ; we have maxed up the capacity a couple years ago , so we ca n't slaughter more chickens . If we do not have capacity constraints , we can easily have customers line up for 120,000 birds , " Teh told The Edge Financial Daily in an interview . <p> " As we speak , we have to turn customers away because we can not slaughter fast enough . Yes , we have the happy problem , but people do n't realise that . It is not a demand issue ; it is more of a supply constraint we have that is limiting our growth , " he added . <p> Teh estimated that the domestic poultry market is worth between RM8 billion and RM10 billion . However , the industry is not expanding swift enough due to a lack of investments to meet the growing domestic demand . As a result , the country is importing chicken meat from time to time to feed any spike in demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these imports of food and agriculture products , " said Teh . <p> MFM produces about 60 to 70 million chickens a year , of which 50% to 60% of them are sold to the live bird market partly because of capacity constrains . <p> If without capacity constraints , MFM will rather sell less live birds to the middlemen supplying to the wet market . The prices and profit margins of the live bird market are a lot more volatile compared with processed chickens . <p> More importantly , Teh said any additional capacity will help the group go further downstream in the food processing business , such as chicken nuggets or sausages , which offer wider profit margins . <p> To expand capacity , said MFM chief financial officer Cheang Kiat Cheong , the new primary procession plant will cost about RM550 million . On top of that , the group 's aqua feed mill costs up to RM70 million , while jetty expansion will cost up to RM60 million . <p> " We also need to build more farmhouses , which cost about RM1.2 million each for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RM1.1 billion . <p> " We are actually fully integrated , but what we want to involve in is to really become a food company that focuses on processing chicken meat , going downstream , " he said . <p> Recovering from a dismal 2018 <p> The year 2018 was not a good one for MFM , which slipped into the red for the third financial quarter ended Sept 30 , 2018 ( 3QFY18 ) , posting a net loss of RM5.19 million compared to a net profit of RM23.51 million a year ago . <p> For the nine-month period ended Sept 30 , 2018 , its net profit plunged 98.2% to RM1.18 million from RM64.57 million a year ago , although its revenue dropped by a marginal 3.1% to RM1.75 billion . <p> MFM 's annual earnings for FY18 are likely to be the lowest since FY15 , when it posted a net profit of RM20.55 million . <p> One reason for its dismal performance was a fluctuation in live bird prices . Furthermore , its Indonesian flour mill suffered from a weak rupiah , which depreciated to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September last year , the rupiah fell to as low as 15,400 to the US dollar , which was worse than during the 1998 financial crisis ; 80% to 85% of our flour milling business cost is in US dollars for wheat , " Cheang explained . <p> " We can not pass on the cost to consumers because the biggest player in Indonesia , which has a 50% market share , refuses to increase prices to protect its market share . As such , for the first nine months of 2018 our Indonesian operations were not making money because while cost went up , our prices did not , " he added . <p> Revenue from MFM 's Indonesian joint ventures was equivalent to 41% or RM994.54 million of the group 's total revenue of RM2.4 billion for FY17 . <p> Nonetheless , Cheang pointed out that things have been improving since the fourth quarter of 2018 . <p> " The exchange rate of the rupiah over the past couple of months has been coming down against the US dollar , and flour prices have also seen a slight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everyone is losing money , " he said . <p> Additionally , Cheang also said live bird prices have been increasing after September last year , hence management is optimistic about MFM 's upcoming financial performance for 4QFY18 . <p> Teh is confident that FY19 will be a better year considering the new capacity coming on stream . <p> The second phase of the primary processing plant will ramp up MFM 's daily capacity to slaughter 240,000 birds compared with 80,000 currently . <p> The group is also building a new aquaculture feed mill , which will be commissioned by next month , as well as a jetty catering to a Panamax vessel . The jetty will be up and ready by June this year to facilitate the import of wheat for its flour milling operations . <p> Should things pan out as planned , MFM 's prospects seem promising .

@@40514238 <p> It seems like we are all just an active part of the neoliberal reform agenda for a new round of capital accumulation and development , writes M Nadarajah . <p> A development expert once commented that the UN Sustainable Development Goals or SDGs seem like " a high school wish-list for how to save the world " . <p> More seriously , I am more and more convinced of what the UN SDGs are really all about -- giving the capital accumulation process another global fillip and saving capitalism from being transformed . Ironically , it is supposedly a global ' transformation ' programme to remain on the same track ! It will certainly not be business-as-usual but it will be business-as-always . <p> As I realise the true character of the 17 goals and 169 targets , I am more worried for humanity , which is consumed by a genuine desire to transform the world by implementing the SDGs . <p> The saddest part of the whole episode is how the UN SDGs have been able to harness all our genuine desires , compassion and the passionate energies behind them , for a better , safer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed persons , national communities , universities and foundations from around the world backing it to the core , almost with a religious fervor . <p> We all so much want a better world and it seems that the supposedly neutral international body , the UN , has finally given us a blueprint for our complete individual and community wellbeing , and sustainable future . The UN seems to have taken on the role of a non-violent revolutionary vanguard aiming at trans-forming the world . But is it really promoting transformation through the SDGs ? <p> Despite the growing output of sporadic and systematic criticisms of the UN SDGs , we have all been seduced so much that we really do n't care about the criticisms and are ready to defend the SDGs at any cost . It is so focused , convenient and easy to report . The system has ways to push aside and silence critics or demonise them . We seem to have put on a collective blinder . <p> Let 's halt for a while , reflect on the SDGs in totality and see what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we should also ask what hegemonic and/or meta-'stories ' govern the UN SDGs : is it the same or different ? It is certainly not an innocent , objective technical process . <p> Let me share some critical comments at length . Anthropologist Jason Hickel analysed it like this in " The problem with saving the world " , published in the Jacobin , a voice of the American Left : <p> Yet despite this growing realization , the core of the SDG program for development and poverty reduction relies precisely on the old model of industrial growth -- ever-increasing levels of extraction , production , and consumption . And not just a little bit of growth : they want at least 7 percent annual GDP growth in least developed countries and higher levels of economic productivity across the board . In fact , an entire goal , Goal 8 , is devoted to growth , specifically export-oriented growth , in keeping with existing neoliberal models . <p> What does this really mean ? Hickel explains : <p> The SDGs ' contradictory relationship to growth extends to its approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main solution to poverty , but this relationship is highly tenuous . Of all the income generated by global GDP growth between 1999 and 2008 , the poorest 60 percent of humanity received only 5 percent of it . Given the existing ratio between GDP growth and the income growth of the poorest , it will take 207 years to eliminate poverty with this strategy , and to get there , we will have to grow the global economy by 175 times its present size . This is terrifying to contemplate . ( Emphasis mine ) <p> The SDGs are a paean to consumption-driven economic growth . Everything they claim to be able to eradicate -- from poverty to violence -- can be addressed by GDP growth , they tell us . They want at least 7% GDP growth per year in least developed countries and higher levels of economic productivity across the board . In fact , an entire goal , number eight , is devoted to this . It 's bizarre : we 're all acutely aware of the need to dethrone GDP growth as the measure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is n't even an issue . ( Emphasis mine ) <p> The SDGs are indeed highly significant but not because they may appear at first glance as an inclusive , empowering and ecologically sustainable agenda . Rather , based on a close examination of the SDGs , I draw the following conclusion : If implemented in its current form , the SDGs will most likely result in further impoverishment and inequality . Rather than committing to guarantee universal entitlements necessary to live dignified lives , the agenda aims to entrench highly contested neoliberal policies . <p> What is the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) doing in the UN SDGs ? Weber points out : <p> There are some goals , which determine the processes through which others are to be realized . For example , in the UN resolution on the SDGs , the section on the ' means of implementation ' identifies the centrality of SDG 17 and emphasizes the importance of implementing the rules and regulations of the World Trade Organization ( WTO ) . To frame a development agenda through the WTO is to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more explicitly a neoliberal variant of capitalist development -- is the solution to inequality , poverty and ecological crisis . ( Emphasis is mine . ) <p> SDG goal number 17 ? SDG goal number 10 ? ( No other alternative frameworks in the world of almost 8 million people ? ) Weber continues : <p> The significance of SDG 17 for the overall agenda can not be over-emphasized . Goal 17 has been written to include specific references on the need to ensure that member states commit fully to the WTO agreements . In addition , some indicators intended to measure progress on realizing the goals ( some of which are also country/region specific ) , are explicitly based on , or linked to countries ' membership of and entrenchment in rule-based frameworks such as the WTO . For example , the commitments anticipated under SDG 10 , encompass obligations to maintain membership of key multilateral development organizations ( such as the World Bank , IMF , WTO , Regional Development Banks ) specifically for those countries categorized as ' developing ' , singled out here by comparison to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SDG agenda , therefore , is highly significant but also contested because for critics it presents causes of deprivation as the ( ostensible ) solution . ( Emphasis mine ) <p> Are we really part of a transformation process ? It seems like we are all just an active part of the neoliberal reform agenda for a new round of capital accumulation and development . Seems like ' late capitalism ' is metamorphosing to take another form by getting us all involved . Weber adds : <p> The UN declaration on the SDGs explicitly refers to the goals and their associated targets as ' aspirational ' ( UN 2015 : 13 -- point 55 ) , and to the fact that realizing the agenda is contingent upon the commitment of member states . However , as we have seen , not all goals are equally ' aspirational ' or contingent , given that those referring to the ' means of implementation ' comprise concrete commitments to neoliberal policy prescriptions . Particularly the ' means-of-implementation ' - goals are linked to a wider policy environment in which developing ( and developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the entrenchment of neoliberal reforms . <p> So the meta-story we live by is the same old one , from individuals to nations to the UN : " Liquidate Earth " ( but ' pretend ' that we are working very hard for the greater common good ) . I simply see a fa ? ade of seemingly ' clean ' targets and technical processes carefully hiding ' the driver ' behind the 17 goals and 169 targets . It is ' same old driver ' who drove us into the mess we are now in , in the first place . Now ' he ' pretends to be able to take us forth to a sustainable utopia of clean , safe and impact-less , endless growth . We have becomes his cheerleaders . <p> The ' meta-framework ' that animates the SDGs is an extremely clever device to harness the world 's genuine concerns for a better future for all to further the cause of capitalist development . This is done with a language of concern for transformation and sustainable development . ' No one will be left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all buy the UN SDGs , no questions asked . This is a classic case of cultural hegemony of one class over the rest , mobilising us for sustained capitalist development . <p> We genuinely believe that SDGs are going to deliver that world we prefer . The only thing is that we are not really going that way . <p> In 2030 ( or much before that ) , if most of us survive the climate crisis and are around , we will have UN SDGs Version 2 ( or some other name ) , which will start with a very comprehensive criticism of UN SDGs Version 1 . It will follow the same routine as how the UN MDGs were critically evaluated . <p> We would have spent trillions of dollars doing all that . That 's okay . It is all good for the economy anyway with positive impact on GDP eventually ! Capitalism needs problems to solve , so that it can record meaningless and at times dangerous growth . Of course , somewhere along the way , at least some of us would start to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It really does not have to be that way . We have other ways to nurture a better , safe , just and sustainable future . But we have to genuinely transform the way we live or build the world . <p> The assumption on which UN SDGs is based is framed by a neoliberal worldview . It is based on and guided by a strong market-centric and endless growth meta-story . <p> Now , we are going through the fourth industrial revolution , with the fifth around the corner , and the UN SDGs seems to be poised to open the markets for the full-blown growth of a cybernetic world with smart cities and smart villages . It is the world Capital wants to have the complete control of . <p> Critically addressing the UN SDGs , and the knowledge produced around it , is also living an anti-colonial moment . <p> The UN SDGs framework makes no engagement with indigenous frameworks or sustainable cultures . Heterodox or radical economics traditions -- and initiatives based on this -- have not been taken up or explored or engaged with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , what the UN SDGs is teaching our children is that there are no other , alternative ways or stories to live by . We have 17 goals and 169 targets to educate and to socialize us to believe in TINA ( there is no alternative ) . <p> We just have to move our attention and action elsewhere . Pope Francis ' encyclical Laudato Si : Care for Our Common Home is far more true and honest to the agenda of global transformation to a better , safer , just and sustainable world -- and , of course , leaving no one behind . It is certainly far more radical . As Hickel says : <p> The pope , on the other hand , tackles the irrationality of endless GDP growth and consumption head-on , and he does so from the understanding -- absent among economists -- that the economy and the environment are part of the same system ; that endless extraction from one to feed endless growth of the other is not just a physical impossibility but ultimately self-defeating and immoral . Fixes like carbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have to confront the core of the problem , which is an economic model that relies on ever-increasing consumption . <p> The UN SDGs are not going to get us to the world we desire . At the least , not by itself . For me , the concern of ordinary people for the Other -- ie our compassion for the world -- is in grave danger : it is being hijacked . Will we wake up ? Can we stop and turn back ? Can we re-look ? Can we re-imagine ? Can we let go ? As I urged in an earlier article : <p> We look at causes not just symptoms . We look at being not just having . We look at maximum wage , not just the minimum wage . We look at affluence not just poverty . We look at people not just profits . We look at culture not just the economy . We look at service and volunteerism not just what's-in-it-for-me . We look at sustainable livelihood not just careers .

We look at our compassionate foundations not our competitive spirit . We look at spirituality not just religion . We look out for all , not just our kind . <p> You and I have a lot to give up and sacrifice . We need to change our taken-for-granted ways .

Instead , they are only using cloud storage services such as Dropbox to store personal documents , pictures and videos . <p> The white paper was based on a survey of 2,033 SMEs in the country . The study also found that while 35% of SMEs have deployed IoT solutions , these are primarily isolated building security and surveillance and fleet tracking solutions -- not those that could be sold as a service to the market . <p> More than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were using some form of data analytics .

About half of the SMEs surveyed mentioned that financing was their key hindrance , with 60% claiming not to be aware of the possible financing options . <p> Additionally , many SMEs think that information and communications technology is expensive . Therefore , the white paper suggests that there is a need to educate and inform SMEs about the funding options available for them to drive their digital transformation , as well as to make them aware of the fact that cloud computing has made business improvement applications , data storage and analytics more affordable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right employee skillset as a major challenge to digitalisation . According to these enterprises , the top three skillsets they needed help developing were sales and marketing ( 15% ) , IT technical skills ( 10% ) and business management ( 7% ) . <p> Many of the SMEs surveyed were not familiar with how social media marketing , e-commerce and other digital tools could benefit their businesses . They added that they need proper guidance on how to use digital technologies to reach more customers , automate their business operations and secure their company information . <p> To spur more SMEs to embrace digitalisation , the report recommends a three-pronged approach -- innovate ( make SMEs aware of the computerisation trap and encourage them to adopt a digitalisation outlook ) , facilitate ( help SMEs get over the initial financial barrier and change their mindsets towards digitalisation ) and accelerate ( providing SMEs with access to digital technology as well as the knowledge to use them ) . <p> The white paper 's suggestions for " innovate " include conducting regular workshops to increase SMEs ' awareness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop a long-term digital transformation strategy based on their industry sectors and helping them to hire chief information officers or digital transformation units to oversee their company-wide digital transformation efforts . <p> Meanwhile , for " facilitate " , its suggestions include providing tax relief or financial rebates that could help SMEs get started on their digitalisation journey , providing financial support to successful SMEs for their overseas market expansion and introducing policies that would reduce red tape for SMEs to introduce new services , such as simplifying licensing and permit requirements . <p> For " accelerate " , the white paper 's suggestions include leveraging on the 11th Malaysia Plan to prioritise SME connectivity and realising the goal of 100Mbps for all urban areas and 30Mbps for half the rural areas . While the national intent for this is present , there needs to be a push to make it happen , says the white paper . <p> SMEs can not undertake digital transformation on their own , it adds .

@@40548237 <p> KOTA KINABALU : The Borneo Rainforest Law Conference 2019 held here recently brought some of the excitement and issues affecting the Orang Asli being played out at the current election for Cameron Highlands . " The Orang Asli are the first peoples of West Malaysia but they have yet to enjoy their constitutional fundamental liberties as Malaysian citizens on their lands . <p> " For example : The right to life and the right to earn a livelihood , the freedom of movement and of association and the freedom to practise their religion on their customary lands . " <p> Lawyer Lim Heng Seng revealed that the first people who settled in Malaya are not considered as " Bumiputras " . The question on every disbelieving mind in the audience was reflected in a question asked later : " Why are Orang Asli not Bumiputras ? " <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> " Unlike Malays and the natives of Sabah and Sarawak , Orang Asli are not included in the category of " Bumiputras " , which would grant them a special position in certain areas of the economy , education and public services . " The indigenous people of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They belong to three major tribes , namely the Negrito , the Senoi and the Proto-Malay . <p> Making up about 0.6 per cent of the country 's population , Orang Asli are categorised as the most impoverished ethnic group in terms of income and standard of living in Malaysia . <p> Lim deemed the non-Muslim natives in East Malaysia lucky not to suffer the fate of the Orang Asli and hoped that collectively the indigenous people would struggle together for their rights , although many in East Malaysia claimed to have been marginalised or in cold-storage . <p> " While the Aboriginal Peoples Act 1954 is enacted for the protection , wellbeing and advancement of the Orang Asli , it is more commonly associated with the failure to do so . <p> " This is particularly so in relation to the protection of their customary land rights . As with indigenous minorities worldwide , Orang Asli have a close affinity with the customary lands and are relentlessly dispossessed of their lands . " Earlier , Chief Justice Tan Sri Richard Malanjum praised the High Court judgement by current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who ruled in a past judgement that native lands are a defining part of the natives . Likewise , Lim stressed , " Orang Asli 's close affinity with and total dependence on their land and the resources yielded their livelihoods . <p> " Orang Asli are also faced with serious infringements of their rights to the use , occupation and the resources of their lands . The Aboriginal Peoples Act 1954 merely provides a modicum of recognition of the right of the Orang Asli to occupy State land as mere tenants at will and does not make it mandatory for their customary lands to be declared as aboriginal areas or reserves . " <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> Lim showed a representation pleaded by an Orang Asli : " We want a type of development which brings benefits to the Orang Asli community ... but the kind of development that we have received has mostly resulted in losing our land . Needless to say , all types of development require land , be it the airport or whatever . <p> " And as we are citizens of Malaysia , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand on clouds , then we surely would n't need land . " <p> Lim said faced with the gradual extinction of their lands , aggrieved Orang Asli are beginning to assert their rights , not only as Malaysian citizens but also the first peoples and true sons of the Malayan soil . <p> This is a significant underlying cause of their being trapped in poverty and marginalisation with implications on full citizenship and fundamental rights . <p> " They rightly demand for a just resolution to their claims , basing them on moral , historical , legal and constitutional rights . " They assert their demands through political avenues , invoke their rights in media . Sometimes , they are put in a position where they have no choice but to resort to self-help measures in defending their lands which can result in grievous consequences . " <p> Lim said over the years , judicial decisions have established that Orang Asli have common law rights over their customary lands which are protected by the Federal Constitution . <p> " Further , the established jurisprudence enunciate that the Federal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " However , the legislative and executive arms of the government are slow to give full effect to these rights . <p> " Even when Orang Asli are able to secure legal services and court challenges are mounted , they meet with resistance by the past Federal and some State governments every step of the way . " <p> Lim said another serious concern is the minimal extent to which Orang Asli are granted access to the full range of fundamental rights guaranteed to all citizens under the Federal Constitution . <p> " These include the rights to life and personal liberty , to equality and non-discrimination , to religious liberty , and to education . <p> " Their lack of rights to access to education , as compared with other Malaysian children , came into sharp focus in light of the disappearance of several Orang Asli primary school children from their hostels and the subsequent tragic deaths of five of them .

@@40571236 <h> Trending Now <h> RenTech created the ultimate , tax-free IRA account for employees <p> WASHINGTON ( Feb 1 ) : Renaissance Technologies , the giant hedge fund founded by billionaire Jim Simons , looks like it has created the premier , tax-free retirement account for its employees . <p> A deft maneuver back in 2012 enabled employees to invest in RenTech 's storied Medallion Fund via individual retirement accounts , or IRAs , which provide tax benefits for millions of ordinary Americans savers who are putting money aside for their golden years . <p> The difference : ordinary people do n't have access to Medallion , one of the most successful hedge funds of all time . A recent filing with the Labor Department provides a glimpse into the staggering tax-free wealth Medallion has generated within RenTech employees ' IRAs . As of late 2017 , the IRA assets exceeded $660 million , representing an eight-fold jump in roughly five years . <p> The gains stemmed from Renaissance 's ability to capitalize on a key rule change involving a type of retirement account known as a Roth IRA , where assets can appreciate tax-free after an initial levy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are deferred until retirement , a structure that permits the government to take its cut on decades of potential investment gains . <p> ' A Slam-Dunk ' <p> By paying the tax upfront through a Roth , Renaissance employees could then fully reap Medallion 's astronomical returns tax-free from then on . This was particularly valuable in Medallion 's case because the fund 's profits are often generated through short-term trading and thus subject to top tax rates . <p> " It was a slam-dunk investment for all the employees , " said Josh Lichtenstein , a partner in tax and benefits at Ropes &amp; Gray . <p> Jonathan Gasthalter , an outside spokesman for East Setauket , New York-based Renaissance , declined to comment . <p> Renaissance 's strategy , designed to maximize returns that employees received from Medallion , had several moving parts : <p> The firm initially terminated its 401(k) plan for employees in 2010 , a step that permitted them to roll the savings into traditional IRAs .

The fund has historically averaged annualized returns approaching 80% before fees , but such gains can slump when it gets too big . Even employees face annual investment limits , and Medallion also typically distributes its profits every six months instead of reinvesting the gains . <p> In addition to the tax benefits , Renaissance employees who invest in Medallion through their IRAs are spared fees that the fund imposes on their taxable accounts . The fund charges a 5% management fee and a performance fee equaling as much as 44% of gains . As a result , employees are increasingly shifting their annual Medallion allocations into their IRAs , according to the filings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US$87 million that employees initially allotted to the company IRA plan in 2012 swelled to US$664 million by the end of 2017 , including US$574 million in Medallion , the filings show . In turn , the IRA money -- held by about 250 employees -- grew to more than 4% of Medallion 's gross assets from about 1% five years earlier . <p> " Roth IRAs are hugely tax advantaged , " said Len Burman , a co-founder of the Tax Policy Center , a joint project of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution . " If you are expecting to earn a rate of return of 20 percent or higher , it turns out to be a really good tax shelter . " <p> People with US$100,000 or less in annual modified adjusted gross income could long convert traditional IRAs into Roths through a one-time tax payment .

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the move would generate US$9.2 billion of revenue from 2011 to 2013 , as wealthy individuals jumped at the chance to pay an upfront tax to convert their traditional IRAs into Roths , thereby eliminating taxes on future gains . <p> Americans switched US$64.8 billion of pretax IRAs to Roths that year , with 79% of the assets belonging to people with incomes of US$100,000 or more , according to the Internal Revenue Service . <p> If the funds were taxed at the top federal rate of 35% at the time , that would have generated about US$23 billion in receipts -- far more than the budget office had anticipated .

At the start of the New Year , devotees and families are invited to visit Fo Guang Shan Monastery to pray and bring peace and fulfillment home . <p> Every Chinese New Year , Fo Guang Shan hosts the New Year Festival of Light and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while its branch temples around the world host the latter , all in hopes of providing all the opportunity to light up their own light of compassion and wisdom . Fo Guang Shan 's founder , Venerable Master Hsing Yun explains that one should " Use wisdom to dignify one 's place of practice " . Fo Guang Shan 's New Year Festival of Light and Peace unifies the wisdom and strength of all its devotees , monastic community , and Buddhist College students to , using traditional lantern making techniques , create Peace Lanterns that radiate a sense of religious blessing . Festival goers may experience the peaceful and serene ambiance as they make light offerings . <p> Venerable Master also says , " Even though a person may lack material belongings , as long as one has compassion , and wisdom , one will lead a life of abundance . " <p> Buddhism 's light and peace lantern offering represents the light that provides energizing and illuminating warmth . Hence on the first day of the first lunar month of every year , we have peace lanterns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights . Some parents offer lanterns on their children 's behalf in the hope that they will be blessed with intelligence and loveliness . Some children offer lanterns on their parent 's behalf , praying that they will be blessed with health . Some people offer lanterns for themselves hoping for a better future . There are also those who offer lanterns for the wish of world peace and happiness for humanity . <p> The Venerable Master once said , ' the Buddha is like the light that can overcome darkness , the light that can provide warmth , and the light that ripens . Similarly , the Buddha 's light can eliminate one 's afflictions of greed , anger and ignorance , which have inevitably darkened the mind . It can warm our hearts and bring about our success in lives and in our future ; and fulfil our character and virtuous merits . ' Ultimately , through the offering of light , we wish to bring light and peace upon the world , so that nations may peacefully coexist , and all ethnicities live harmoniously together .

@@40645238 <p> The three branches of government in a democracy are generally recognised to be the executive , the legislative and the judiciary , not the Dewan Rakyat , Dewan Negara and the Yang Di-Pertuan Agong . The writer uses the term " power " instead of " government " but the thinking is faulty and it is not semantics . <p> He says that MP Nazri Abdul Aziz , in a roundtable discussion , suggested that the more populated states should have more representatives in the Dewan Negara . Firstly , has he ever looked at the US which also has a senate and house of representatives ? <p> There , both houses are fully- elected but only the representatives follow the one-man-one-vote principle i.e. constituencies all over America have , or ought to have , approximately equal numbers of the electorate . The Senate , however , does not follow this basic principle of representative democracy . <p> The American senate allows for two senators per state and the constituencies are distributed accordingly . The American founding fathers had the idea that they wished to balance the decision-making power among states i.e. all states to be equal as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So how do we accomplish this here , with our fully-nominated senators ? I propose we take the formation of Malaysia as one variable . At the time , Sabah , Sarawak and Malaya joined this new federation as equal partners . But Umno-ruled Malaya gradually whittled down the position of East Malaysian states until they are but two out of 13 states today . <p> Using the US principle of equal weightage plus the need to assign a heavier weight to Sabah and Sarawak in recognition of the 18-point and 20-point agreements , we could agree to give a 60/40 weightage of West/East Malaysian states , six senators for each West Malaysian state and 18 senators for each of the two East Malaysian states . <p> This results in 66 senators from West Malaysia and 36 senators from East Malaysia for a total of 102 senators in the Dewan Negara . For the West Malaysian states , they will carry equal weight with six senators each and for Sabah and Sarawak , they will be glad to hold heavier political representation with 18 senators each . <p> All senators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizes within each state . <p> The next question is , what powers will this newly-elected senate have ? I think the idea of " distinctive " roles for any senator to be repulsive . Any senator should be able to raise issues that are felt by his constituents and to be chucked out , if he was thought ineffective , at the next elections . <p> Next , the US senate re-elects one-third of its senators for a six-year term , every two years . This gives rise to the mid-term elections which the US last held in November 2018 . This way , there is a continuous renewal of the senate composition while giving them a sufficient duration to effect substantive changes as needed . <p> The US had excellent minds that shaped its formation following a revolutionary war against Great Britain 270 years ago . They modified and improved things as they went along and now are indisputably the strongest nation in history . <p> Their system of governance has stood the test of time . In contrast , British Malaya in 1957 had a Federal Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British system and incorporating a number of ideas based on racial and religious ascendancy which may have outlived their usefulness and look a little odd today . <p> We shall do well to look widely elsewhere and not limit ourselves when we think to reinvent ourselves and maybe make ourselves more fit for this new millennium in which we find ourselves and which will inexorably present us with more challenges as well as opportunities . <p> Certainly , systematically marginalising any group of citizens should not be one of the things in our toolbox . Neither should we systematically elevate any group of citizens .

@@40679234 <h> Politics and Policy : Deliver or be dumped <p> THE Pakatan Harapan government needs to address income and cost-of-living issues facing ordinary folk as a matter of urgency if it hopes to last beyond its first term in office . <p> It is the " perut economy " -- bread and butter concerns -- which is still hurting people , says Datuk Wira Dr Rais Husin , the chief strategist of Parti Pribumi Bersatu Malaysia ( Bersatu ) . That is what the government must attend to right away in order to retain their support . <p> To contain that looming risk , he suggests three measures to be implemented as a priority : <p> * Tasking a panel of experts to alleviate the economic pressures on the poor ; <p> * Presenting an economic white paper on these issues and their solutions ; and <p> * Setting up a monitoring committee on the implementation of the PH 's election promises . <p> The effect of economic hardship on eroding voters ' support for the government was underscored when Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad announced the setting up of the high-powered Economic Action Council on Feb 11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key economic functions , is mandated to act on just those issues which Rais raised in an interview with The Edge a few days before its formation . <p> " No matter what , issues of the perut economy will dominate people 's lives , " says Rais , who runs a political , economic and social research consultancy . <p> " We must find ways to bring down the cost of living . Stabilising oil prices is part of it , but it is also about creating jobs to address unemployment and underemployment . " For him , however , one responsibility stands out above all else -- delivering on the promises that Pakatan made in its manifesto for the 14th general election . That is hardly surprising because Rais had headed the four-member committee that drafted the 150-page Buku Harapan . <p> He notes that the manifesto has two parts . The first has the " 10 promises in 100 days " tagline . Of these pledges , five to six have been delivered , he says . <p> The second substantive part has the " 60 promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutional reforms , of which 32 have been achieved . <p> " We 're working very hard on the rest , " he asserts . <p> The new government has blamed the gap between promises and their delivery on the incomplete picture of public finances given by the previous government . This explanation , says Rais , has a limited lifespan . <p> He feels that voters would have made allowances for that predicament in the months following the watershed GE14 , but that will no longer wash since the new year rolled in . <p> " For how long do we want to say that our problems are inherited ? " <p> In his view , the importance of delivering on the manifesto promises can not be overstated . <p> Not surprisingly , he had suggested in the first PH presidential meeting after GE14 that a manifesto monitoring committee be established . <p> " The committee must track all promises and publish a report on which ones have been achieved , which ones are delayed and how long the delay will be , and which ones are not going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must be frank and honest . It is better to offer credible solutions on why we can deliver on some promises , and why we can not deliver on others , " he explains . <p> Unfortunately , he says , the manifesto appears to be relatively forgotten . <p> " We have to recalibrate the manifesto because it was written on the basis of a certain political and economic landscape , " he remarks , referring to the impact of depressed prices of commodities and the US-China trade war on the Malaysian economy . <p> To counter the effects of low commodity prices on rural incomes , he says some form of subsidy is needed to help communities cope in difficult times . <p> " We should also explore new markets , and find ways and means to expand the uses of these resources , " he adds , citing Russia , the Middle East and eastern Europe as having potential for growth in this area . <p> " Are we doing a good job with soya bean lobbyists , for example ? " <p> Another major adjustment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agriculture . <p> Rais notes that the portion of arable land in Malaysia used for growing food is just 2% , one of the lowest ratios in the world . <p> This has important implications for the nation 's food security , he points out , since it has a supply buffer of just two weeks . <p> " Obviously , we should promote agriculture as a way to create jobs , " he says , citing Vietnam and Scandinavia as examples of countries where the sector is promoted as an important contributor to the economy . <p> " Let us bring back the glory to the agrarian economy , " he adds . <p> With an annual food import bill in the region of RM50 billion , Rais says the impact of imported inflation on the people 's well-being is clearly significant . <p> " Agriculture will not only generate employment , it will encourage the use of extra land , address cost of living issues and result in import substitution . " <p> These aims tie in with the Ministry of Agriculture and Agro-based Industry 's newly launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2019-2020 , released on Feb 14 , focuses on food security , rural economic development , private investment and international trade , and is aimed at taking farmers , fishermen and livestock breeders out of the poverty cycle . <p> Turning to political developments that the Pakatan coalition needs to address , Rais says that the Malay angst about PH is , to a certain extent , due to perception . <p> This sense of unease had contributed to Pakatan 's defeat in the Cameron Highlands by-election in January , which had been exacerbated by the choice of candidate , bloopers by some leaders and the non-delivery on promises , according to him . <p> " As far as the protection of Malay rights , promotion of Islam and the position of the Rulers is concerned , remember that Pakatan had signed a declaration of its commitment to these principles . <p> " However , it is not as good as its opponents in telling narratives and keeps blaming the other side , " he says . <p> This shows that the coalition 's strategic communication efforts are not effective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications is party-based or coalition based , but not government-based . This needs to happen immediately , yesterday . " <p> To maintain the people 's support , says Rais , Pakatan needs to get better at telling the new Malaysian narrative . In doing so , it must celebrate diversity and democracy as the hallmark of its rule . <p> " Pakatan can not wait anymore but must address this . Otherwise , it will have an impact on the outcomes of by-elections , and even on the 15th general election . <p> " Semenyih will be a challenge , because the electorate is 67.7% Malay , and the Malay angst against PH is there , " he points out . <p> " In terms of the Malay narrative , PH has n't done enough . On top of that , there are the concerns of the perut economy . " <p> As for Bersatu , in which he is a member of the supreme council , Rais says its image as a party that lacks experienced leaders is not as important as whether these leaders can deliver the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of work to be done to set the country on the right track , " he says , referring to the past existence of a plutocracy outside of the cabinet deciding on national matters . <p> Bersatu , he states , needs to improve its branding , and to explain its moves a little bit more . <p> On whether it is worrying that the coalition has yet to get on top of economic issues , in addition to questions about the stability of coalition and intra-party tensions , Rais responds , " I sleep well , because we have got rid of the kleptocrats . " <p> " The focus should not be on the eighth PM , which has already been determined , but on delivering results . " <p> On the challenge of weaning the civil service from the culture of corruption that has pervaded the administration over six decades , he responds : " We must be very serious about combating corruption ; if not , there is a possibility we will be a one-term government .

What a jerk ! <p> You know , all I see is Copy Paste forumer just copy-pasting , with some minor changes in details , what you and your troll personas were BS-ing all over Perodua newspiece earlier in the week , ( see " Perodua sold 37,400 units in first two months of 2019 -- 7.3% YOY increase , Aruz bookings at 13,000-unit mark " ) . <p> You know , if you do n't like others ( especially Copy Paste ) to throw it back at you , then do n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been informed . <p> I can never fathom what 's so great about RV . I do n't look to buy a car just to sell it , I buy it to use it . If it 's the same car that I wanted but at 30-40 thousand less but with potential bad RV , why should this be a problem ? I 'm able to save 30-40 thousand bucks ! Can the other car potential RV be higher than the savings of 30-40 thousand ? No , and I can roll that 30-40 thousand savings I 've got for something else or put into an investment which eventually can pay for the car itself . So I ca n't understand what the importance of RV . I buy the car to use now , not to worry about a future that may or may not happen . <p> Kunta somehow do n't realised that February is a short month and from YOY sales improvement of 37% , this indicates that consumer confidence in Proton has jumped 37% within a year . Yes , this figure never lies , consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PLs bear in mind X70 has very little taxes.IF CRV or Mazda suvs were stripped of high duties , X 70 might not achieve so much sales . Anyway , looking at overall sales .... the bread and butter Sagas , personas , iriz are not performing well . Without x70 , the sales of P1 is only 2460 units ! ! X70 sales comes mainly from those who forgo X Trail , CRV AND MAZDA SUVS ... due to price difference . Give it another 9 months ... if X70 still can maintain this tempo , then ... we take our hats off to DR.Li and Co ... not the bunch of dudes who goyang kaki at DRB . <p> What are you babbling nonsense about ? The X70 is a CBU car from China , so import and excise duties plus AP fees applies unlike the CRV or most of the Mazda SUVs that are CKD here which you referred to . It is the CKD cars that should get very little taxation due assembler tax rebates , zero import duties as CKD parts and the same exemption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't parity with CBU X70 was because of greedy Japanese bosses that hiked up the declared CKD kit prices when they are n't even paying a single sen of taxes for them , this is so the final selling price as determined by MITI is n't too far off from the declared cost of CKD importation . Geely came in and straight broke this Japanese cartel of fixing their car prices so much higher than reasonable just to make more profits . Now they are stuck in this self-made quagmire of price fixing which they ca n't escape . If they 'd start dropping prices just to compete it will anger their existing customer base and the authorities will become suspicious . If they 'd continue their high prices , X70 and the coming X50 will continue to eat up their SUV segment marketshare . Geely had at last given us a fair deal , to jolt the Japanese automakers from their dream to con us customers . <p> Geely is the game changing company that john said it will change Proton 's game . Now it 's proven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can sell Geely cars and bring all Proton cars to the " Museum of Game Over Cars " . Habisla Proton ! <p> Copy paste : " Better to buy Proton Geely cars like Boyue/X70 at least got reliability of 600,000 cars on the road and high technology . Geely and Proton makes such good partners , unlike Perodua which is just a dumping ground for Toyota cars not fit for sale in Japan or any other First World countries . <p> Buy Proton cars then money will flow to Proton . Everyone will profit . Buy Perodua cars , only Japan profit because all profits goes back to Japan . Buy Proton cars , and profits will be used to expand their R&amp;D hub . This will benefit the country and help to give more employment to our researchers , scientists and engineers . " <p> what a joke man . you guys openly showing the world that you know nothing about what you 're talking about , its embarassing. if what you say is true .. why is SEAT still selling SEAT cars for so many decades after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why is skoda still selling skodas the same as SEAT ? why is volvo still selling volvos ? simple answer is ... technology can be bought , but brands must be built , and that takes a lot of time , and a lot of money , and no guarantees .. you guys might hate the truth , but the truth is .. geely bought proton for proton. they see the value of proton , and its brand recognition in malaysia , and its extensive networks of sales , service , parts plus its manufacturing and R&amp;D facilities including a ready workforce . the last thing they want to do is to get rid of the proton brand . and if you still ca n't see it .. millions has already been spent to prop up the brand even further . Proton is and remains , a malaysian brand . <p> Copy paste : " what kind of bodoh statement is this . What is the difference between both ? Both owned by foreigner one being a Japanese the other is China . So what 's with the tax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have slight advantage over Perodua in terms of taxes incentives etc .. Toyota is actually taking more money back to Japan instead of keeping it in Malaysia lol ... " <p> Proton is having good news again ? ! We ca n't have that ! Quick , we need to dispatch a team of highly trained monkeys to deal with this situation . If they get caught fabricating lies again , send them our regards as we will disavow any knowledge of peanut donations . <p> Copy paste edited for context : " Aruz success you must thank Japan . Japan has done well . Toyota has done well . Past 30 years , Perodua could not survive without donor cars from Toyota museum , now owned by Toyota and Japan , and doing so well but the best performance was Nissan . <p> That foreign CEO have done what Japanese CEOs like those in Nissan could not do in 20 years . <p> We need more foreign in all GLCs in Japan .

Ask you this , how many SUV sales did all the Japanese brands made last month ? <p> 2 ) X70 so expensive , then the other cars all no technology , just basic cars , how people want to buy la ? -it takes time to implement the techs gained by rebadging other people 's product . take the lotus ride and handling for example . -on the other hand , what have Perodua implement to all of the models rebadged from big brother Toyota and Daihatsu ? 1st gen Passo has rain sensor and auto wiper , and yet 1st gen Myvi is an empty shell . only when competitor implement , they have to follow . For example , when Preve and Suprima implemented DRL , Myvi suddenly have Myvi FL with DRL. same goes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few . -where is the logic when company that asked for bail out can come up with techs while company that makes profit still give sub-par products ? where does the profit go ? -that is when pathetic boasts sales figures and RV , they get laughed at . <p> On the contrary of what you 've said about " 95% of the world rejected Geely ..

Like I posted on the other article , my recent bought from Perodua was a Bezza and I only receive my car in the middle of Jan 2019 while the loan was approved since end of Oct 2018 . When I asked showroom said wait 1 month . Later I call perodua call centre said 2 months . After exactly 2 months , I call again and they said " 3 months but nevermind I will help you raise a case . After that wait for 3-5 working days and someone will call you . " After 3 days , Perodua SA called and said my stock is " arriving " , now still in courier , ETA 1 week some more . <p> Proton potential buyers have their loan rejected more than Perodua . Proton 's target market are at the lower side of the society with lower education , older and rural . Perodua appeals to newly young urban grads with full potential ahead . <p> But our banks have told us that most of the loan rejects are from fresh grads or students applying loan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the same time they confirmed that most Proton buyers are working class citizens up to upper middle whom do n't face any problems to repay their loan hence the higher loan approval rates for Proton customers compared to Perodua . I believe our banking sector more than an anonymous commenter . <p> Yes different class . Proton is targeting the middle upper classes , so volume is no longer important . Let Perodua scrape the bottom market , since they are just a poor brand selling poor cars for the poorer folks . BTW , why is n't Perodua sales figure matching to kapcai sales ? Both are targeting the same class segment of consumers so Perodua sales should been doing much , much better otherwise they are yet another failure . <p> this is actually not something for proton to be proud . the ate selling a Chinese made car and who gets the 90% of the revenue ? China Geely. merely assemble and low class car is not achievement . how many IRIZ or PERSONA or actual proton cars matter not this imported low brand SUV @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are jumping up and down about Aruz with 15 years old Avanza chassis and power train . The Japs are laughing to the bank exactly because of people like you would lap up anything as long as it 's Japanese . <p> Copy Paste bro is on a roll ! Yeah bro , shove it back at the basher ! He keeps saying ur me becoz u keep repeating my comments and others . So what now ? Will he now say that ur him since ur copy pasta many of him and his dupe comments ? Perhaps his rogue dupe thats unhappy with all the bollocks he keeps vomiting ? Lolz ! <p> This segment before was dominated by international brands and people do n't have any choice only to buy those brands and the cheapest will also will be as part of car selection . Now , Proton have this segment and those buyer are now shifting to the local brands which preferring the cheapest which come with hi tech spec of car . It 's also attracting the rich guy to own it . Good for Proton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment . Honda , in particular , will probably feel the pinch with their CRV sales.Overall , I see this as a good thing . <p> I mentioned back in August/ September last year , that if the X70 had a positive release and was priced competitively , then it would be a good thing for the overall SUV market buyers in Malaysia . For too long we have been treated like fools and idiots when it comes to pricing and what we get for our money , in particular all the features that get removed in the Malaysian market compared to what the majority of the world get for their money . <p> The X70 package will certainly have companies like Honda start to think in a different way . If they do n't , they will suffer from reduced sales . <p> No matter what people think of the X70 , it has certainly changed the landscape of the SUV market in Malaysia , which is a good thing . <p> Other brands have to change their old habits .... and quickly , in my opinion . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think 7,000 X70s sold over 2 months is very respectable , especially considering the X70 's RM 100-120k price tag and non-Japanese origins . Still , it must be said that the X70 had a very long promotional build-up , and there is also the issue of delayed car prices which many companies have been facing . <p> Anyway , the X70 's promising initial reception bodes well for the new Proton-Geely partnership , and it should pave the way for upcoming models , most notably the CKD X70 and the more sophisticated X50 . However , it is still early days , and it 's too soon to draw conclusions . Good luck to Proton &amp; Geely moving forward . <p> To those who are complaining about Proton is not really " proton " or local anymore . Like it or not , the new management achieved quite a good result ever since the 1st launch . Ask yourself , what has the previous management brought to the table and achieve anything in past 5 years ? <p> Hello brother you all should be proud cuz malaysia got own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car ? ? we are 3rd world country and have own car industry and you short minded ppl keep comparing to 1st world country international car industry pfttt sad adult . <p> You can either post as a guest or have an option to register .

@@40719232 <h> How many times has Najib 's trial been delayed ? The answer might surprise you . <p> Without some of us realizing it , it 's already March , meaning that it had been almost a year since the Pakatan government took over Malaysia . There had been a lot to look forward to back then , and one of them was Tun Dr Mahathir 's promise to clear Malaysia of corruption . Among other things , he had pledged to arrest the infamous " Malaysian Official 1 " and other sharks , as well as getting to the bottom of the 1MDB scandal . <p> We 're pretty sure by now everyone knows that Malaysian Official 1 is really the former Prime MinisterNajib Abdul Razak , but almost a year on , if you have n't been paying close attention , there seems to be no real progress in that department . Some on social media have been getting antsy over it , and are wondering if Najib and his lawyers are intentionally dragging out the case for as long as they can . Recent news of the appeals being delayed because Najib 's lead counsel had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't help . <p> With all the hullabaloo about Najib 's trial delays , you might be surprised to know that there has technically been only one actual trial delay on record , but probably not for a lack of trying . We 'll get to that later , but with news about Najib being in court popping up in no particular order , we would n't blame you for thinking it 's one HUMONGOUS court case , but in actuality ... <h> Najib is facing up to 5 separate trials for 42 charges <p> If you remember Anwar Ibrahim 's sodomy case ( the sequel , aka Sodomy Part II ) , you probably have an idea of how long court cases can take , especially if it 's a high-profile one . Anwar was charged in 2008 , tried in 2010 and 2011 , acquitted in 2012 , de-acquitted in 2014 , and jailed in 2015 . That 's a total of 7 years from charge to jail ... for a single charge ( Section 377B of the Penal Code ) . <p> Najib 's got 42 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for now it seems that they will be taken care of in five separate trials : <p> The last one was initially charged on 28 Jan , but it was discharged and charged again on Feb 7 . Najib 's pic from Coconuts . <p> Anyways , none of these charges had been around for even a year , so we can expect some more time until any of them matures . Still , you might have noticed that the trial dates for the first one had already passed ... <h> Despite several appeals , the actual trial for SRC had only been postponed once <p> Before we get into it , a little background on the case . Basically , what happened here was sometime in 2011/12 , SRC International took a RM4 billion loan from the Retirement Fund Inc ( KWAP ) , and to get that loan it needed a government guarantee from the Cabinet . Najib allegedly used his position to provide that , hence the power abuse charge . The three CBT charges are for the RM42 million Najib allegedly got in return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mil and RM10 mil . <p> These four charges were brought against him in July last year , and in August three charges of money laundering was added to the RM42 mil transfer , bringing the total to 7 . The trial dates were set back in August to be from Feb 12 to 28 , and Mar 4 to 29 . So between July and December last year , Najib 's team had put forth three applications , which is fancy lawspeak for requests . The first one is for a gag order on the case to prevent the media from speaking about it , the second one is for the discovery of documents and statements , and the third is a challenge to the appointment of a certain lawyer to be the lead prosecutor in the trial . <p> We 're not going to elaborate on the latter two , but we did write about the gag order some time back . Check it out ! Img from SCMP . <p> All three have been dismissed by the court at some point , and Najib 's team had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one month to go to the trial , Najib 's team had asked for the trial to be postponed , as the three appeals had not been settled yet . This request had however been rejected by the court , but Najib 's team did not appeal the decision as both sides agreed that whatever the outcome of the three appeals will be , if Najib wins the main trial it wo n't cancel out the win ( a nullity ) . So they decided that the three appeals can go along with the main trial . <p> One thing you should know about this case was that the charges were initially brought against Najib at the Sessions Court , and were later transferred to the High Court , like many other cases . To do that , Tommy Thomas , acting as the public prosecutor , applied for something called a certificate of transfer that will move the case from the lower Sessions Court to the higher High Court . This was a background detail in the beginning , but on February 7 , a few days before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw his certificate of transfer . <p> Basically , what Thomas tried to do was let the court do the transferring instead of him as the public prosecutor , in light of cases from the past two years that sort of empowers the courts . Despite the transfer by certificate being the accepted practice for a while now and Najib 's lawyers never having said anything about it , Thomas decided to be careful anyways and pre-emptively withdrew them to prevent Najib 's team from using it against the prosecution in the future . <p> So the High Court judge had then decided that the public prosecutor can do that without affecting previous proceedings up until now . Since the certificates have been withdrawn , the case technically fell back to the Sessions Court , so the judge transferred it right back to the High Court using Section 417 of the Criminal Procedure Code . <p> Najib 's team did not agree to that , and they argued that the public prosecutor went beyond his powers regarding the withdrawal of the certificates , and if they do n't sort out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ High Court are before the main trial , the results could be nullified if it turned out that the Court of Appeals agreed with their argument , leading to a retrial which is a waste of the public 's time and money . <p> They also later noted that every case decided in Malaysia becomes a legal precedent under common law ( something that judges can refer to in future similar cases ) , and Najib 's case would ' without a doubt ' create new laws in Malaysia , so the decision is pretty important . <p> " If we do n't get this right , and the law is put in the backseat just for purposes of rushing this case , other future cases , maybe even people you personally know could be affected . And that would create a rather sad situation towards the Rule of Law , " -- Muhammad Farhan Shafee , one of Najib 's lawyers , as reported by the Malay Mail . <p> So on Feb 11 ( one day before the trial ) , despite protests from the prosecution , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the main trial on hold until this issue got sorted out . They also found that there 's no evidence of delaying tactics by Najib 's lawyers , so for now things will probably be on hold until this appeal ( plus the three others from earlier ) are heard at the Court of Appeals on Mar 11 and 12 , and while three had been heard , the fourth had to wait until Friday due to recent circumstances . <p> Aaaaaaaaaand there 's still another four trials to cover . Wah , so exhausting leh . Anyhoo ... <h> Although there 's pressure to bring Najib to trial , it needs to be done right <p> Still edible , same ingredients , but very disappointing . Img from me.me <p> In light of the trial postponement , Tun Mahathir had asked Malaysians to be patient in spite of the delays in Najib 's proceedings . <p> " Supposedly , by now we should have seen those who were charged with various offences involving the 1Malaysia Development Berhad ( 1MDB ) and SRC International Sdn Bhd brought to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule of law , we respect the court 's decision to postpone the case ... We respect the court even though the rakyat has been asking why those who were clearly guilty of corruption are yet to face trial . And although we ( government ) have tried our best , we have to respect the law , " -- Tun M , as reported by The Sun Daily . <p> While some may see the statement by Najib 's lawyers as nothing more than a masked attempt to delay the trial , there 's something to be said about not sacrificing the sanctity of the judicial system in favor of a faster conclusion to the Najib saga . The people 's trust in the Malaysian judiciary system has been eroded for the past few years , in part due to their alleged manipulation by the people in power and allegedly being used for money laundering , among other things . <p> While there had been attempts at improvement since last year , the judiciary still needs to restore the public 's trust in them , and a high-profile case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so . <h> About Us <p> Here at CILISOS , we believe that the only way to consume information is with a serious dose of flavour .

The tweets were circulated by alt-right journalists calling for Gunn 's dismissal . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> In a surprising turn of events , Gunn has now been rehired by Disney/Marvel Studios to direct Guardians of the Galaxy 3 .

@@40735234 <h> Frankly Speaking : Avoid bailouts via better governance <p> From a written reply to a question in parliament last week , we know that the government effectively gave RM19.9 billion for RM10 billion worth of assets from Lembaga Tabung Haji ( TH ) . Paying twice the value of the assets transferred to a special purpose vehicle looks like a bailout , although it may be called by some other name . Yet , that should not come as a surprise . After all , the government guarantees depositors ' savings with TH , just as it does savings with the Employees Provident Fund and Bank Simpanan Nasional . While the total of RM863.6 billion in deposits ( as at end-2017 ) held by these three entities is a huge sum , the government will only have to step in if they can not fulfil their obligations . <p> The sizeable guarantee is why these entities must have proper governance and the right checks and balances . Having the right people run these institutions will also reduce the likelihood of a bailout as well as maximise the chances of growing depositors ' savings . <p> That is important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money that can be put to better use . <p> The government guarantee means depositors can be assured their deposits are safe . Allowing numbers to be artificially inflated to pay generous dividends to keep the electorate happy , however , is a different story . <p> Based on the parliamentary reply , TH would not have been able to pay dividends in some years if it had been prudent in its writedowns . It can only pay dividends if it is profitable and has more assets than liabilities . <p> The extra RM10 billion provided to TH may look small compared with the total deposits guaranteed , which stood at RM70.21 billion as at end-2017 . But that sum could have been put to better use if TH did not need it .

However , when certain main contractors do not keep their end of the bargain , subcontractors may no longer wish to participate , never mind consider mergers and consolidation . <p> The payout may be small relative to the main contractor 's finances , but it is critical for small and medium enterprises . Halting payment amounts to tightening the cash flow -- the lifeblood of a company . <p> The national oil and gas company is cognisant of the problem . " We are pretty conscious ; we know about the cash flow issue faced by some of our service providers , " Wan Zulkiflee said at Petronas ' FY2018 results briefing last Friday . <p> " On our part , we do take this into account in our selection of main contractors based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Petronas does intervene in some contracts . <p> However , sometimes its hands are tied . <p> " The main contractors are our single point of contact , and there are certain terms in the contract that sometimes restrict us from full intervention . So , it is kind of on a contract-by-contract basis , but we are fully aware of this issue , and we have taken initiatives . " <p> Separately , last year , Petronas initiated a matchmaking scheme , called the Vendor Financing Programme , under which seven financial institutions have been roped in to provide vendors easier access to financing . <p> " Essentially , all these efforts are to ease the cash-flow problems faced by subcontractors , " Wan Zulkiflee says . <p> The industry executive confirms that Petronas has intervened in the past and that certain small vendors managed to bypass the main contractors to be paid directly by Petronas and its partners . <p> " We also understand the grievances ... for main contractors , the rates are still low .

Fewer than 50 are listed on Bursa Malaysia . <p> Previously , Petronas had said it would leave industry restructuring and consolidation to market forces as less capable SMEs are expected to drop out and the more capable ones emerge stronger in the long run . <p> This year , Petronas expects to allocate RM15 billion out of " slightly over RM50 billion " in capital expenditure for the domestic upstream segment , up from around RM12 billion last year . <p> But if the issue of non-payment of smaller players persists , O&amp;G SMEs -- including the better ones -- may end up adrift due to cash-flow concerns , preventing the successful implementation of Petronas ' agenda to build a stronger O&amp;G industry for the future .

That 's a staggering jump from the M2 Competition 's 410 hp and 550 Nm mark , which in itself is capable of a century sprint time of 4.2 seconds . <p> If the M2 CS were to be as powerful as it is tipped to be , then expect the zero to 100 km/h time to dip below four seconds . The spy photos here do n't reveal much , but word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as a redesigned bonnet with a central bulge . Of course , the CS version will get better aerodynamic performance , which materialises in more aggressive-looking front and rear bumpers , and a larger rear spoiler . <p> To manage all that power , expect the brakes to be upgraded . Other mechanical tweaks could range from stiffer suspension , improved exhaust system and larger intercoolers . As for the transmission , a six-speed manual transmission is almost a certainty at this point , although a fast-shifting seven-speed M dual-clutch transmission may also be available . <p> As for the cabin , there could be new trimmings , although the black leather/Alcantara upholstery seems to be the only option on offer . Other possible additions include Alcantara-wrapped steering wheel with programmable M1 and M2 buttons , Alcantara-wrapped gear shifter , as well as carbon-fibre inserts . What do you think of the M2 CS ? Comment , below . <p> An ardent believer that fun cars need not be fast and fast cars may not always be fun .

Granted , there are differences between the two phones which you can see with our comparison tool , but the Nokia 6 does have the same display and more memory , so the differences in performance should be negligable if not better . <p> The newly announced ASUS ZenFone 2 and ZenFone Zoom smartphones are making waves around the world as ASUS have opted to make one really good ZenFone instead of a new version for each of the three previous original ZenFone smartphones . Due to the 5.5-inch display ( which hits a very nice sweet spot in our opinion ) the closest original ZenFone in terms of size would be the ZenFone 6 , so we 've used our tech comparison tool to compare all three smartphones . Key features that the new ZenFone 2 and ZenFone Zoom bring to the table are 64-bit Intel Processors , 5MP selfie-ready front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LED flash and for the ZenFone 2 , rear volume controls . While there are no Malaysia release dates yet , we expect the ZenFone 2 and ZenFone Zoom to reach us in the next few months or so as the original ASUS ZenFone smartphone range was launched regionally in April 2014 . <p> Local Malaysia price details for the ASUS ZenFone 2 or ZenFone Zoom are also unknown still but based on the current US price of $199 ( RM707 ) we expect the 2GB RAM ZenFone 2 to be priced around RM699 . This would result in a drop in price for the existing ZenFone 6 and other previous ZenFone smartphones . Rumours indicate that AnTuTu benchmarks for the new ZenFone 2 could be around 39000 to 41000 , which is a huge jump over the previous ZenFone 6 which scored 19661 on AnTuTu .

With the licence application process being cumbersome and expensive , ride-hailing companies foresee between 20% and 50% of their drivers quitting , primarily part-time drivers , as The Star reports . <p> Registration for the licence , which involves sitting for a six-hour training course at a cost of RM200 , began on April 1 at authorised e-Hailing Operator ( eHO ) driving institutes and training centres . Drivers also need to pass criminal background and medical checks , contribute to Socso , purchase add-on car insurance and equip their cars with safety equipment , including fire extinguishers . <p> Vehicles to be used for ride-hailing duty that are less than three years old will also need to be converted from an individual private vehicle to an e-hailing private nehicle , while cars over three years old must be inspected at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is estimated that a driver will need to spend around RM800 to complete the requirements . <p> " Drivers dropping out is definitely going to happen , that is undeniable .

He added that while full-time drivers will comply with the regulations , part-time drivers will likely stop driving . <p> " The part-timers do not want the hassle of applying for the licence , they like the simplicity of becoming a driver where you can just turn on the app and start driving . When you impose regulations like this , ride-hailing is not exactly ride-hailing anymore . <p> As for Carriage For Her , CEO Nick Smith said the company anticipates a 30% to 40% dropout rate from its pool of female drivers .

He said that with fewer drivers on the road , consumers and riders may find it difficult to find a driver and the increased demand may drive up fares . <p> Anthony Lim believes that nothing is better than a good smoke and a car with character , with good handling aspects being top of the prize heap .

Next it involves ferrying a passenger , thus safety of the passenger ( customer ) is upmost priority , thus here comes the need for e-hailing driving insurance to protect the customer .. The need to inspect vehicles &amp; driver 's health condition is also related to the passenger 's safety . However the thing that i really sympathize is later on the $$ for all this extra regulations will be passed on to the passenger 's .. The driver want to earn a decent living , the e-hailing company wants to earn profit and sustain them self 's , the agencies &amp; insurance parties wil be paid for the services offered for this regulation .. Hence the passenger have to fork out more for a ride ..

@@40836231 <h> Banking : Rise of challenger banks in Asia <p> Challenger banks have been a trend in markets such as the UK in the last few years , but activity is ramping up in Asian markets like South Korea , Greater China and Southeast Asia , says James Lloyd , fintech and payments leader for Asia-Pacific at EY , in the recently published Citi GPS : Global Perspectives and Solutions report , titled " Bank X : The New New Bank " . <p> " While we have been supporting emergent players for quite some time , it is in the past year that I have dedicated a large majority of my time to this area . There is a huge amount going on across Asia-Pacific , " he tells the authors of the report . <p> In Hong Kong specifically , regulatory and infrastructure change is driving a tremendous level of challenger-related activity , says Lloyd . " By way of context , in May last year , the Hong Kong Monetary Authority published a revised Guideline on Authorization of Virtual Banks . In effect , this allows new players to apply for a retail bank licence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong is not the first market in Asia to seek to issue new licences in this way . But it does have particular significance , given the city 's status as an international finance centre , the availability of capital and potential access to the Greater China market . " <p> He describes a challenger or virtual bank as a digital-only proposition , one with no branch network . Apart from having an impact on costs , foregoing traditional physical infrastructure , more importantly , also has an impact on the customer experience , he says . <p> " Virtual or digital banks typically involve online customer onboarding , servicing and engagement . Of course , the specific results , products and services can take many different forms , particularly as a range of different players -- from incumbents to platforms -- seek to build their own digital-only or challenger banks . <p> " DBS Bank , for example , has already launched a mobile-only proposition in the growth markets of India and Indonesia . Similarly , CIMB Bank and other regional banks have announced that they are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the Philippines and Vietnam . In Hong Kong , Standard Chartered Bank has announced that it is in the process of seeking authorisation for a digital-only virtual-bank proposition . " <p> According to the report , these new banks are designed around meeting customer expectations , leveraging data insights through agile technology stacks to improve personalisation and offering fully-digital banking experiences . " Challenger banks also tend to be quicker at incorporating new products or processes into their platform and help easily connect with third-party products , offering more choices to the end-user . " <p> Banks , big tech taking the lead <p> The authors of the Citi report say challenger banks in Asia are mostly backed by large technology or telecommunications players or traditional banks . For example , WeBank , Mybank and Kakao Bank are backed by tech firms Tencent Holdings Ltd , Alibaba Group Holding Ltd and Kakao respectively . <p> " Challenger banks originating from start-ups intending to disrupt financial services in Asia ( for example , Neat in Hong Kong and Paytm in India ) are by far fewer than those originating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank , Monzo , Starling Bank and Tandem Bank ) . A limited regulatory framework for challengers in Asia ( with the emerging exception of Hong Kong ) and the presence of large tech companies ( especially in China ) may be some of the reasons Asian challengers are more likely to be an offshoot of a bank or telco , " says the report . <p> Why are so many traditional banking players coming up with their own challenger banks ? Lloyd says the incumbent banks in Asia are seeing first-hand the impact technology-led platform players can have on customer interactions as they expand beyond their anchor use cases and move laterally into financial services . <p> Many bank CEOs and management teams in the region are re-examining their current propositions and seeking to double down on all aspects of digital customer engagement , says Lloyd . One question to consider is whether to continue investing in existing infrastructure or seek to replace it , either in part or en masse , with a new digital technology stack . <p> " This is where the opportunity for ' greenfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the side , using components that could perhaps ultimately be brought back into the core proposition . There are huge opportunities associated with building solutions unencumbered by legacy technology , processes and mindsets , " he says . <p> " That is not to say that all legacy is necessarily bad . Think of the advantages of proven risk management functions , for example . But a combination of both innovative and trusted solutions can be quite powerful . " <p> In addition to existing banks launching new challenger propositions , other players such as growth-stage start-ups and platforms with an established customer base are also getting involved , says Lloyd . " In the UK , we have seen a range of new start-ups raise funding , build new propositions and begin to organically acquire customers . <p> " In Asia , platform players are beginning to emerge . Kakao Bank in South Korea , for example , is built on top of the country 's largest mobile messaging service . Similarly , in China , the large internet players have sought to capitalise on their extensive ecosystems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Lloyd observes a factor that will be especially visible in Asia , that is , building something new provides an opportunity to drive deep strategic partnerships with a variety of players at an equity shareholding level . He says this could be between banks and non-banks , technology players and distribution partners or some combination thereof . <p> " In fact , I would go so far as to say that a defining feature of challenger banks in Asia will be the emergence of multi-party joint ventures seeking to create true partner ' ecosystems ' that extend beyond financial services into other areas such as travel , transport , retail and telecommunications , " he adds . <p> Challenges for the challengers <p> Lloyd and his team have been supporting the design and development of several " greenfield " challenger banks in Asia . In the last 12 months or so of setting them up , the biggest challenge for new players is getting licensed , he says . <p> " In Hong Kong at least , the regulator has focused on applicants that can demonstrate sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digital-only bank . It has also been necessary to construct a credible and viable business plan , supporting areas such as improved customer experience and financial inclusion . <p> " Having said that , what I think is going to be different about Hong Kong relative to markets such as the UK is that the strongest new entrants will likely emerge with an established customer base . We will see platforms move laterally into financial services as well as traditional offline networks beginning to leverage their own networks for bank product distribution . " <p> These players are learning lessons not just from growth-stage UK challengers but also from scale-stage technology ecosystems in mainland China and emergent super applications in Southeast Asia , says Lloyd . <p> Project Imagine is working to create a second-generation challenger banking and wealth management alternative from scratch . It has been authorised to provide eMoney services as well as distribute , manage and arrange investments for its clients . But is not a bank . <p> " For instance , if the digital and technology functions of a bank sit outside the finance function @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only so much digital-led innovation can take place at the firm . Instead , if technology is embedded in the finance function , it is more likely to offer innovative solutions , " Chakravatry tells the authors of the report . <p> " There are also product silos -- people in a bank looking after only their own product , rather than a customer segment . The people responsible for segments are usually more propositional , so they may talk about the bank 's brand and offerings . But they do not actually make product decisions , which means tailoring products to the customers ' needs is incredibly difficult . " <p> On incentive structures , Chakravatry says most digital or technological transformations take four to six years to implement , which is quite a big bet with extensive risks for a big bank . In contrast , incentive structures in most banks tend to be driven by yearly performance . So , there is little incentive for individuals to undertake risky transformations at incumbent banks . <p> Can incumbent-sponsored challenger banks replicate the kind of innovation done by standalone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its parent brand to its digital arm or virtual bank , or for branding and marketing purposes , it automatically generates interest from management to look over the shoulder of its challenger arm to monitor returns , risk propositions and so on . <p> " This takes us back to the initial problem of organisational and incentive structures . However , if an incumbent bank can genuinely work at arm 's length , it is possible to replicate the challenger bank model and be equally revolutionary in those areas -- with the added benefit of trust from the parent brand as leverage , " he adds . <p> " It is a race to the finish right now . Will incumbents learn to decentralise decision-making and leverage trust without jeopardising decades of brand value , or will the challengers learn how to consistently deliver , stay funded and win trust while dealing with regulations and governance ? <p> " We will find out one way or another .

It was an instinct that they wanted to make a show the fans wanted to see . I have said no for 30 years . I was definitely the last guy to come to the party . I was the piece , arguably , that they had to get . <p> Guerrasio : Do n't be humble . <p> Macchio : Laughs .

I think it would have been a series on one of these platforms . <p> Guerrasio : So out of all the pitches you 've gotten over the years , which was the worst one ? <p> Macchio : It 's my favorite . Everyone would come up with the pitch of " You have a kid , and you become the Miyagi to your kid . " Everyone thought that was the brilliant continuation . But an executive once came up to me and John Avildsen , the director of " Karate Kid , " and took it a step further . It was very off the cuff , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and LaRusso had kids and they are related in some way ?

Daniel LaRusso was that kind of character that represented the everykid .

" <p> source <p> YouTube <p> Guerrasio : What 's been interesting to watch with the LaRusso character -- and it 's delved more in the second season -- is the motives for Daniel . Does he want to be the Miyagi to a younger generation , or is this just a guy going through a midlife crisis ? Have layers like that been fun to explore ? <p> Macchio : That 's part of what we discussed going into season two and , hopefully , many seasons to come . We want to keep this ball in the air and have the characters evolve , as opposed to a quick one-off . It was important to have LaRusso be a little off balance and have to fill that void in his life . <p> But in doing that , you tap into what was important to him in his adolescence . He does n't have his father , and his father figure is dead , so what seems simple is not so easy . He has the knowledge , but can he teach it ? And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It creates some interesting hurdles for the character . <p> Guerrasio : Has this all been a really weird time in your life ? At some point years ago , you had to have pushed LaRusso aside and been ready to move on . Is it wild that it 's back in your life ? <p> Macchio : It 's insane . Laughs . If you asked me 10 years ago , I would say no way . And it 's not that I buried the character ; I live with him all the time . But the concept of going back , I was always " No , no , no . " Why touch that again ? It has such a blessed light on it . Everything happened right . Pat Morita 's performance is treasured . Why would you go back and do that when everyone is trying to do that -- and , for the most part , failing ? Like , when they remade the movie , I told them , " Go make your movie .

@@40875232 <h> World Bank keeps Malaysia 's 2019 GDP outlook at 4.7% <p> Lead economist for Malaysia Richard Record said private consumption would continue to be the main driver of growth , albeit expanding at a more measured pace . <p> " Household spending will be buoyed by stable labour market conditions and income support measures such as the Cost of Living Aid ( Bantuan Sara Hidup ) , " he told reporters at the East Asia and Pacific ( EAP ) Economic Update briefing here today . <p> He said gross fixed capital formation was expected to increase slightly , driven by the private sector , while public investment was expected to remain subdued in the near term . <p> Record said monetary poverty was expected to continue its downward trend in 2019 , with a projected decline to 1.4 per cent based on the upper middle-income countries ( UMIC ) poverty line of US$5.50 ( US$1=RM4.12 ) per person per day in 2011 . <p> " Several initiatives for low-income households , including the national B40 Health Protection Fund , an insurance scheme for the B40 group , and affordable housing initiatives are in the pipeline to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Going into 2020 , he said Malaysia 's economy was projected to expand at 4.6 per cent , and the country was expected to achieve high-income country status by 2024 . <p> He said the country 's fiscal deficit was expected to narrow to 3.4 per cent of GDP in 2019 and subsequently to three per cent in 2020 . <p> " Near-term fiscal consolidation efforts are expected to be achieved primarily through rigorous expenditure rationalisation , with broad-based declines ( in percentage of GDP ) projected across major components of operating and economic development outlays . <p> In terms of risks and challenges , Record said the ongoing uncertainties surrounding the US-China trade tensions and shifts in global financial market sentiment would pose downside risks to Malaysia 's economy in the near term , due to the country 's high degree of trade and financial integration . <p> " On the domestic front , the relatively high levels of government liabilities and increased dependency on oil-related proceeds could potentially constrain the flexibility of fiscal adjustment against future macroeconomic shocks , " he said . <p> He said in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt remained a source of macro-financial stability risk and would act as a constraint on household spending . <p> Record said the principal challenge to more rapid and inclusive economic growth lies in increasing labour productivity , which in turn depends on stronger human capital development . <p> " Malaysia 's score on the Human Capital Index ( HCI ) is 0.62 , which is about as expected compared to other UMICs but well below that of its aspirational comparators , " he said . <p> He said Malaysia performed well on the child survival and years of schooling components of the HCI but did poorly relative to its economic peers in child nutrition and the quality of education . <p> " Key priorities are thus enhancing learning outcomes , reducing child under-nutrition and strengthening social protection systems to enable households to both invest in and protect human capital , " he said . <p> Meanwhile , acting chief economist for the EAP Region Andrew Mason said at the regional level , growth in developing EAP economies was expected to soften to six per cent this year and next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global headwinds and a continued gradual policy-guided slowdown in China . <p> " While most of the EAP region managed to weather the deterioration of external conditions in 2018 , the risk or conditions worsening would place additional pressure on policymakers despite most countries having reasonably sound economic fundamentals and robust domestic demand , " he said . <p> He said the World Bank had also reduced its forecast for global economy growth to 2.7 per cent this year from 2.9 per cent projected earlier in January this year on the back of challenging global conditions . <p> " Global growth is projected to slow to 2.7 per cent in 2019 , reflecting decelerating activity in advanced economies and in many large emerging market and developing economies , " he said . <p> He said global trade had weakened further amid slowing global investment and manufacturing activity .

Some JMBs may charge more and do not disclose the calculations for land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rates for commercial and residential parcel rent differed and were based on the Strata Title Rules 2015 . <p> As an example , for land categorised as town land in the Petaling district , a residential strata building unit owner could be subject to a minimum charge of RM40 and RM16 ( for low-cost ) per annum . <p> In comparison , a stratified commercial building unit owner could be charged a minimum of RM80 and RM32 ( for low-cost ) per annum . <p> Yusri said PTGS had the power to seize the property if the unit owner did not pay the parcel rent . <p> " If the unit owner fails to pay parcel rent after two notices are given , the unit will belong to the state government which can then look for a buyer or auction the property off .

Now , when the land office bills you directly , they still use the same figure of RM3.30 .

" <p> He raised the issue during the state assembly sitting in November last year and urged the Selangor government to review parcel rent rates on strata buildings . <p> He said the rate per sq m paid by parcel owners should be reasonable and not more than the quit rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bungalows are paying 33sen per sq m when high-rises are paying 10 times more , which is RM3.30 . <p> This was alright when the amount was divided among everyone so no one had a problem with it since it was affordable . <p> " Now when the rate is based on their unit size , a fair figure may be 33sen per sq m , " said Rajiv . <p> He added that the land tax charged on mixed development projects where residential units stand on commercial lots like shopping complexes , should be separated and the residential properties be charged residential rates instead of commercial . <p> Those who want to find out the calculations for parcel rent can contact PTGS offices .

@@40888234 <h> The case of " Malay envy " <p> Unhealthy inter-ethnic envy persists today which do not augur well for a country which prides itself in being a multiethnic society . - FILEpic/BERNAMA <p> I will look at the notion of " Malay envy " from three perspectives : <p> The envy people of other communities feel towards the Malays <p> The envy Malays feel towards the other communities <p> Malay envy in their own community <p> Of the three categories of Malay envy identified , the third has a longer socio-cultural existence . I will discuss the notions in reverse order from 3 to 1 . <p> In the pre-Merdeka era and going further back into the pattern of Malay village life , rural or kampung Malays were bound by a close-knit family and community existence . They were bonded by strong kinship relations where groups of families lived side by side in clusters of kampung communities where every part of their daily life was intertwined - from economic activities to socio-cultural practices to neighbourly interactions to kinship and family relations . <p> Because of the intimacy in a kampung community every person knew everyone else at close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-connectivity as in silaturrahim or goodwill but also bad cross-vibrations as in rivalry stemming from the feeling of cemburu or envy . There arose the habit of " jaga tepi kain orang " or nosing around other people 's affairs . The minding of one 's own business characteristic of individualistic urban living was not a socio-cultural phenomenon in a community which closely guarded the interests of its members . <p> Kampung life was replete with the cemburu mentality of individuals , families and neighbours in visible competition to display their material acquisitions as in changing house curtains and cushions every Hari Raya or wearing prominent pieces of gold jewellery . This bersinggit-singgit or competitive habit extended to other areas of social life such as weddings and exchanging gifts or hantaran . The more trays of gifts , the greater the family pride . Great pride in the educational , career and business achievements of family members could also turn to boasting about them . <p> Close-knit communities exist everywhere in history , and even today groups of people living together in a small physical space would be more inward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contributions while closely assessing them . Outstanding contributions inspired imitation in others and oftentimes envy . <p> Today rural urban migration which started in the 60s has turned many Malays into sophisticated urbanites living in comfort and luxury , but the envy mentality has remained a part of the Malay psyche . Modern Malay communities still carry with them the customs and habits of old as they nose around one another 's family and kampung backgrounds . <p> Having to coexist with the early migrant communities viz Arabs , Indians and Chinese who , from the start , had an economic edge over them has given rise to different attitudes in the indigenous Malays towards them . Generally there was acceptance and even admiration of the success especially of the Chinese in business and industry , but soon there grew an uneasiness that the Malay slice of the country 's economic cake was too small . <p> In the town areas , Malays who went to school with their non Malay peers shared an amicable social relationship , but still there was a tinge of envy that the families of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were successful teachers , lawyers and doctors who spoke excellent English and the Malays envied their professional achievements . <p> Envy of the success of others has a way of turning itself around into positive action as it did with the community of town Malays in Penang categorised by the British as Jawi Pekan from the late 19th century and later as Jawi Peranakan ( Images of the Jawi Peranakan of Penang , 2004 ) . Ethnically they were of Indian Muslim and Malay ancestry and their early success in business can clearly be seen as a test case for Malay resilience to debunk the myth of the lazy Malays . <p> When the Malays are in a fair competition and at a level playing field with the other communities and where they are accepted as equal partners , everyone prospers as they did in old George Town . Even today Malays from Penang display a more confident attitude and hold respected positions in the public and private sectors . <p> One can not deny that the vast majority of Malays were late arrivals in all sectors of the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children of fisherman , farmers , rubber tappers , craftsmen , clerks and school teachers went through English , Malay and religious education managing to be better educated than their parents . Many broke atap ceilings and moved out of their rumah kampung to live in concrete flats , terrace houses and bungalows . They were becoming authentic urban Malays alongside the Chinese and Indians . <p> Still they were envied because their successes were thought to be artificially heaped with props in the affirmative action programmes carefully crafted by the post-independence government . In the 70s the New Economic Policy ( NEP ) and its implementation became the focus of green-eyed communities who saw it as biased and unfair . The Malays had become the favoured community as the other communities were seen to be sidelined in the development of the country . <p> Unhealthy inter-ethnic envy persists today giving rise to all kinds of negative developments which do not augur well for a country which prides itself in being a harmonious multiethnic society .

And this is something that we can fully support , " said Laplanche . <p> NO BAN ON PALM OIL <p> Other developments that are encouraging are Sabah 's move to fully embrace the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil ( RSPO ) certification and at the federal level , the drive for the Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil ( MSPO ) certification initiative . <p> " Besides the Ministry of Primary Industries , the Ministry of Energy , Science , Technology , Environment and Climate Change has also listed down strong policy on renewable energy and solar development . <p> " Additionally , the Ministry of Water , Land and Natural Resources develops policies to curb deforestation and to encourage reforestation in degraded areas . So all these put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he explained . <p> Laplanche stressed that there is no ban on palm oil going into the EU , but what is happening is that France and the EU as a whole are gradually withdrawing the incentives for palm oil to be added into the diesel mix . <p> " The reason ( for withdrawing the incentives ) is because the calculation that was made showed that there is a problem of balance and carbon impact . <p> " Of course , I must be clear that although there is no ban , these measures will probably result in a reduction in the use of palm oil as a biofuel in Europe , depending on the prices of fossil fuel . <p> " Indeed , by withdrawing the fiscal incentives , the economic case for adding palm oil into diesel could disappear because palm oil is more expensive than traditional fossil fuel at current market prices . <p> " But it is important to understand that it is not a ban , and we are only talking about withdrawing an incentive , and only for palm oil as a biofuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil used for food products and basic material for the oleochemical industry at the French or the EU level " . <p> EU NOT AN ENEMY OF PALM OIL <p> He said that the EU was among the first to introduce the incentive for biofuel and it is among the last regions in the world to still give incentives for palm oil and biofuel . <p> " Most of the other countries have either never given the incentives for palm oil to enter their market as biofuel or had withdrawn them for a long time .

@@40937231 <h> The post-GE14 electoral reform journey <p> COMMENT The watershed 14th general election marked a historic step forward in the path of electoral reforms . <p> The outcome of GE14 proved that , despite high levels of boundary rigging and polling day malpractices , an electorally aware population can overwhelm all electoral odds . <p> After the dust of GE14 had settled , noticeable changes in the electoral mood became visible during a string of by-elections . The leadership change at the Election Commission and the inclusion of NGOs like Tindak Malaysia have allowed the evolution of democratic reforms . <p> Reflecting upon the first anniversary of the historic general election , we from Tindak Malaysia would like to share with readers our journey along this exciting road . <p> Before looking forward , it is important to step back in time and understand what Tindak Malaysia had faced previously . <p> Formed around the time of the then-watershed GE12 , which began the change process , Tindak Malaysia is a loosely held electoral reform NGO , comprising professionals from many fields . <p> We introduced and popularised the terms " polling agent " , " counting agent " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which later became just Paca , since barung agents became irrelevant ) . <p> Our volunteers studied election laws and created role plays of electoral scenarios to enable volunteers to understand the polling processes . They were taught how polls should be properly conducted . <p> The volunteers then trained trainers , crisscrossing the country to reach a wider audience in preparation for GE13 . The Paca training was conducted in various languages to cater to participants . <p> These training methods laid the foundation for the many Paca groups that sprouted everywhere in preparation for GE14 . In many polling stations , trained Paca were able to stop counting malpractices and saved the elections . <p> Unbalanced electoral boundaries <p> However , our analysis showed that no matter how well the Paca guarded the process , the election outcome was predetermined by unbalanced electoral boundaries . <p> From 2011 , a small group of volunteers with technical backgrounds began to explore the delineation of constituencies . <p> Politically biased delineation is a decades-old issue . We wanted to empower the electors to object meaningfully during the forthcoming redelineation exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society effort in digitising nearly 8,000 polling districts , which are the building blocks for constituency formation . We analysed existing irregularities and proposed new , balanced boundaries . <p> In 2014 , together with the Malaysian Bar , we organised a forum to engage the legal fraternity in order to mobilise expert help in preparing objectors for the upcoming redelineation exercise . <p> From the outset , we emphasised the significance of malapportionment ( unbalanced constituency size ) , and not gerrymandering ( irregular constituency boundary ) as the primary issue . <p> Despite our groundbreaking efforts , the grossly imbalanced redelineation was bulldozed through Parliament before the elections deadline . <p> Nevertheless , the experience ignited enough public interest to impact the pre-election conversation and somewhat neutralise the imbalances of the redelineation . <p> Even before GE14 , we were looking into electoral reforms in order to stop malpractices and ensure the independence of the EC . <p> In 2013 , we reviewed the constitution and election-related legislation and proposed amendments to tighten rules and remove loopholes . <p> This proposal , which we named the Malaysian Electoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prime minister and the opposition leader . Of course , nothing came of that . <p> We later collaborated with several overseas Malaysians ( members of Global Bersih ) under the name Projek Beres to incorporate international best practices . <p> Changes after GE14 <p> Following the change of the federal government in 2018 , our findings were presented to those persons charged with reforming the system . These included the Institutional Reform Committee ( IRC ) in May 2018 and Electoral Reform Committee ( ERC ) in February 2019 . <p> We are satisfied that all of our work with Paca and redelineation has yielded fruit in GE14 and now , with Projek Beres , we anticipate further reforms . <p> The new federal government has revamped the top leadership of the EC . This is a major step in the reform of a severely defective institution . No longer seen as an adversary , we now work with the EC on electoral reform . <p> For the first time , we were invited to be observers in the Cameron Highlands by-election . After that , we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for later by-elections . <p> We have also participated in NGO-level discussions on election offences , electoral roll discrepancies and issues with delineation . <p> Severe malapportionment <p> One big challenge is the grossly imbalanced delineation of 2018 that has been gazetted and will stand for eight years . <p> Having conducted redelineation research since 2011 , we have raised our concerns with the EC . <p> The biggest concern is the gross malapportionment , resulting in severely overpopulated seats like Rantau and Sandakan . <p> The Federal Constitution offers no recourse , since the clause controlling allowable seat size variation has been removed , leaving only the vaguely worded statement that the " number of electors within each constituency in a State ought to be approximately equal " , which is subject to interpretation . <p> The requirement that " regard ought to be had to the inconveniences attendant on alterations of constituencies , and to the maintenance of local ties " is also open to argument and does not offer firm guidelines . <p> While the EC has started looking into the matter of redelineation , a revision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliamentary and/or state seats is changed through constitutional amendment . <p> Ensuring sufficient facilities <p> One of our proposals to EC is to investigate whether the constituencies have sufficient facilities to conduct voter registration and polling . We have identified some constituencies that have violated this constitutional requirement . <p> For example , during the Semenyih by-election , voters in Kajang Prison had to travel outside of their constituency and into a neighbouring parliamentary seat to cast their vote . <p> Some voters whom we interviewed during the observation programme complained of difficulties in accessing the polling station . <p> Similarly , for the Sandakan by-election , voters of Sim-Sim are required to vote in a polling centre located in a different constituency . We expect there will be other such challenges . <p> We have suggested to EC that this could be used as the basis to conduct an early redelineation . <p> In Sabah , additional state seats were gazetted , but have not been defined in the current delineation . This means the last gazetted redelineation in Sabah was in 2003 . A new redelineation can therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addressed . <p> Zeroing in on polling districts <p> We have discovered that the building blocks of a constituency , the polling districts , are key to the problem . We believe that if the definition of polling districts can be controlled , malapportionment and gerrymandering will become very difficult . <p> Odd-looking polling districts , caused by selective inclusion or exclusion of elector zones , will result in odd-looking constituencies , otherwise known as gerrymandering . <p> Some polling districts , especially in the urban areas of Selangor and Sarawak , are overpopulated and add to the overpopulation of state and parliamentary seats , which results in malapportionment . <p> For example , Kuala Baram in Miri , which is the largest polling district in the country , has a bigger population than Igan , which is Malaysia 's smallest parliamentary constituency in terms of electorate size . <p> Given the poor geographical correlation between polling districts and polling stations , the allocation of polling stations in Rantau and Semenyih resulted in crossed paths and traffic jams which hindered the polling process during the respective by-elections . We expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the EC , IRC and ERC are : <p> Voters must be assigned to the right polling districts based on their geographical location ; <p> Polling districts must be defined to reflect the existing and future development of the area ; and <p> Polling districts population must be controlled according to practical considerations . <p> We have suggested to the EC that a review of polling districts can be conducted immediately since it requires no constitutional amendment . <p> Once the polling districts are rectified , the EC can confidently delineate constituencies that will fulfil all constitutional requirements . The EC has reacted positively to our previous contributions and we await their final decision on this . <p> Remaining challenges <p> The enthusiasm following GE14 and the refreshing changes within the EC were very heartening to our volunteers . <p> However , there are still challenges to be faced along this bumpy road . <p> One big challenge is the bureaucracy of the EC . The top layer has been refreshed , but the lower ranks are still mired in the old bureaucratic procedures . <p> For example , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes were made to the final appointments without sufficient communication . We had to scramble to deploy people who were able to absorb the changes . <p> This was a surprise , since the very same bureaucrats had engaged well with us in discussions about the election process and voter registration . <p> The second challenge comes from the Malaysian public . The wave of enthusiasm that was generated before , during and immediately after GE14 , has dissipated . <p> We realised this when our calls for observers in the Cameron Highlands , Semenyih and Rantau by-elections did n't attract even a single sign-up from people outside of our group . <p> Having delivered GE14 , the public are now sitting back to enjoy the fruits . They have failed to understand their ongoing role in the evolution of democratic reform . <p> We have managed to expand our participation in the observer programme . We hope the public will at least support the effort to clean up the electoral roll . <p> We are witnessing a dramatic overhaul of our election system . We now have a credible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforms . <p> We , in Tindak Malaysia , are honoured to be part of these electoral reform activities . <p> While redelineation may take time , other reforms are ongoing . We will continue to work with all groups and contribute our best to a cause that will mature our elections process and allow us to elect a government we deserve .

@@40955232 <h> ' Bossku ' phenomenon- can betrayal earn a badge of honour ? <p> LETTER In an unexpected sort of way the phenomenon of the " Apa Malu Bossku " wave has assumed vastly undeserved significance and an overrated profile within certain sections of our Malaysian society . The fad , which I hope will be a passing one , seems to be craving for attention . <p> Its existence has been acknowledged by opinion leaders , the press , media as well as on social media . <p> To some of its followers , it would seem that there is now an alternate and credible source of legitimate authority , a force that has a rightful standalone capacity in questioning , querying and criticising various actions and initiatives of the Pakatan Harapan administration . On the contrary , while not wanting to be seen as flogging a dead horse , should not the followers of this wave show some concern or remorse for what has transpired ? Or are they so enamoured of an accused person ? <p> Translated loosely as " What is there to be ashamed of , boss " it implies that the former prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of grave acts of embezzlement , larceny and corruption has no reason whatsoever to be ashamed . <p> What this further implies is that subsequent to the levelling of the forty-two criminal charges against Najib Abdul Razak , he has been venerated , anointed and elevated almost to the status of a folk hero . Najib , on his part , seems to relish this role as a respected cult leadership figure who is admired and has the continued empathy of a section of society . <p> From one perspective , it may be speculated that this individual in our country 's history has quite successfully had the temerity to reinvent himself as somewhat of a messiah-mobster belonging to a syndicate that champions the cause of the poor , downtrodden and dispossessed . He also wants to present himself as a good campaigner in the cause against the imagined marginalisation of both mainstream Malay and Muslim interests , both potential flashpoints in our country . <p> The irony is that leaders of both our majority and minority communities are not coming out to categorically state that our society abhors all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds and assets for their private agenda and greed . <p> To their credit , the rulers of two states have shown their hands in this matter . <p> In an aborted interview with Aljazeera , Najib offered some implausible explanations for all the cash , outrageously expensive collectables including jewellery , watches , handbags , handmade rugs and other luxury items that were in his family 's possession . He tried to say that he was planning on eventually handing these goods to some state entity . <p> As a young officer in the Razak administration , I was brought up with the admonition that as a civil servant , proof was not needed to allege corruption - suspicion was bad enough . <p> With this Bossku wave , Najib has effectively hijacked those very causes of justice , accountability and the wellbeing of the common people , the very basis which gave Harapan incredible traction in garnering support . <p> It is important that in spite of this Bossku wave , Najib continues to get a fair and full trial , due process in a court of law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views expressed here are those of the author/contributor and do not necessarily represent the views of Malaysiakini.

The median house price also increased at a compound annual growth rate ( CAGR ) of 23.5% from RM175,000 to RM280,000 , while the median household income grew significantly slower at a CAGR of 11.7% . <p> " Between 2002 and 2016 , house affordability had worsened for all states ... this occurred most significantly between 2012 and 2014 .

This further raises the need for interstate coordination , " the report says . <p> During the panel discussion , Soam said there had been a steady supply of affordable homes due to a regulation imposed on developers . Generally , issues faced by developers included the rising costs of materials and cost of doing business as well as premium and development charges imposed by state governments . " For example , a developer buys a piece of land in Kuala Lumpur at a very high cost . When it submits the building plan , DBKL will impose a development charge of , say , RM24 million . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RM300 psf . Is this reasonable ? " <p> Nevertheless , Goh said , some developers are " having the teh tarik syndrome " . For example , when steel prices go up by 10% , house prices also rise 10% when the house is built with various other materials . <p> Goh proposed a housing price control mechanism -- similar to that for essential household items -- to tackle the problem . " We are very stringent in controlling the prices of cooking oil , rice and sugar , but in the housing sector , we have allowed the developers to call the shots -- how much they want to sell a house or how much profit they want to make . To the House Buyers Association , a house is more critical than cooking oil or sugar -- you need a shelter over your head . " <p> However , Nungsari disagreed with Goh 's proposal . " If you have a housing price control mechanism , it will bring forth a floor price and developers will not sell anything below this price .

" Measures to induce structural change in the industry have not been effective . This reinforces the need for the housing delivery ecosystem to support technological upgrading through a consolidation of the supply chain via a new procurement route that enables technology absorption and a shift from the sell-then-build system to the build-then-sell system , which motivates productivity and innovation .

@@40994236 <h> Yes , you want an NCAP five-star-rated vehicle , but ... <p> Malaysian car buyers are a demanding lot . Not only are high quality and attractive designs high on the list of priorities , safety features are required inclusions as well . With the advent of every new model , particularly in the more affordable segments , features such as electronic stability control , airbag count , autonomous emergency braking and NCAP ratings come under the shoppers ' microscope . <p> Despite the heightened demands for quality automobiles , Malaysians -- for the most part , at least -- still appear to have misplaced priorities in their approach towards vehicular safety . It seems that an NCAP five-star rating is a sort of magical protection against all hazards which may be encountered on-road , even if seat belt usage has been neglected . <p> Did you know that every test result in the New Car Assessment Programme is attained with crash test dummies securely fastened with the aforementioned seat belts ? The ' SRS ' in ' SRS airbag ' you may have seen on steering wheels and dashboards stands for Supplementary Restraint System -- airbags are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event of a crash , not the first line of defense . <p> That lead role goes to the often-ignored seat belt . Sadly , the crucial protection offered by this most basic of safety equipment is sidelined when parents opt to install makeshift beds in the rear passenger compartment -- more often promoted on social media as a more comfortable way to balik kampung for the kids in the back seats when prolonged traffic jams are expected . <p> It really should n't need saying that this approach is n't the way to go . Children need to be securely belted in the rear seats -- like any other occupant , really . And yes , that 's right , adults really should be buckling up at the back , as we keep saying time and time and time again . <p> Children less than 10 years of age , or those who are still of insufficient height , should ideally use booster or child seats for optimum in-car safety , should any collision or otherwise untoward incident take place . By the way , Isofix child seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NCAP ratings , which really counts for nought if not used . <p> Silences the warning chime , but because of that , a very bad idea in every other respect . <p> Of course , with the inevitably heavier traffic that is part and parcel of festive seasons , lower speeds would mean lower risk , would n't it ? Unfortunately not . Accidents can and do happen without warning , as a family found out two years ago in the hardest way possible . In that incident , the family of five was travelling in a Perodua Viva in the slow lane , minding its own business when another vehicle collided with it , sending the Viva into the drain . A three-month-old baby died as a result . <p> A child seat was eventually found outside the car in the aftermath , indicating that the seat had not been properly secured within the vehicle . This should offer some idea as to the severity of what can happen if such an incident takes place when the rear seats are used as a bed , occupants laid unsecured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget about their own safety and remember to buckle up for themselves as well . Needless to say -- actually , it does need saying , given the lackadaisical attitude towards buckling up -- that the dummy clip for inserting into the seat belt clasp in order to disable the seat belt warning chime in most modern cars is a big mistake as it entirely defeats the purpose of seat belts . <p> In fact , the seat belt warning chime is a major contributor towards a car scoring enough points to be awarded a five-star rating ; bypassing the seat belt warning essentially renders the safety rating somewhat meaningless , as a safety package is only relevant when it is used appropriately . <p> According to data from the Malaysian Institute of Road Safety Research ( MIROS ) for 2017 , an average of 16 road deaths were recorded daily for the months of Ramadan and Syawal , which makes for concerning reading . Even if passenger car occupants were n't the sole contributors to that statistic , every viable precaution helps , and making use of seat belts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In any case , everyone can contribute towards reducing road casualties -- remember to be considerate , use your indicators ( and give way to those who have indicated ) , refrain from racing each other ( granted , more applicable when not caught in a gridlock ) , vacate the emergency lanes for actual emergencies and last but not least , pull over for a rest when you begin to feel tired behind the wheel . <p> With these in mind , we wish everyone safe travels , and happy reunions with loved ones this festive season . <p> Open roads and closed circuits hold great allure for Mick Chan .

Comfort can never override safety , because what use is comfort when safety has been compromised ? <p> " Unless you 're a parent , you ca n't understand ... " <p> I do n't need to be a parent to understand that a dead child as a result of your stupid choices makes you at fault and a bad parent . <p> Guys , Fastening seat belt is a MUST .

To win the Champions League three weeks later . <p> Liverpool have made huge progress under Juergen Klopp and a major trophy is a thoroughly deserved reward for the transformation that the German has initiated . <p> Klopp has never lacked belief in himself and he 's transmitted that belief to his players . <p> The Liverpool squad arrived in Madrid with the confidence that they were capable of winning ; they looked comfortable with their status as favourites . <p> They left as winners and with the even greater self-belief that will bring . <p> The manner of the victory in the end was n't a pretty one . <p> Let 's be honest , it was a very poor game of football . <p> Most neutrals were justifiably optimistic that Liverpool and Spurs would produce an open , free-flowing and exciting match . <p> Instead we got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spark into something more compelling . <p> Why did neither team play anywhere close to their potential ? <p> The pressure of such occasions often tends to stifle players rather than inspire them . <p> Then there was the fact that they had a three-week break prior to playing the final , both teams lacked a bit of sharpness . <p> The heat was possibly another factor that curbed the expected intensity . <p> I also think the tragic news of the death of Jose Antonio Reyes in a car crash just hours before kickoff cast a dark , heavy shadow over the final . <p> Following the emotion of the tribute to Reyes , the match then started in an utterly bizarre way with the award of a penalty to Liverpool in the opening minute . <p> As a Liverpool fan I was jubilant but I 'm sufficiently objective to say it was never , ever a penalty . It was a farcical decision . <p> The much-heralded video assisted referee ( VAR ) system once again proved how dubious it continues to be by reaffirming the referee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ludicrously interpreted these days that it appears to get rewritten on an almost weekly basis . <p> VAR seems to prefer awarding penalties in such situations . <p> The ref , Damir Skomina , clearly wanted to make a name for himself and spent an age wandering around the penalty area giving pre-penalty warnings to any player in the vicinity . <p> The result was a long delay before Mohamed Salah stepped up for the spot-kick . <p> Salah was unperturbed and confidently , almost casually , gave Liverpool the lead . <p> Understandably , Spurs looked dazed . It was a moment from which they never fully recovered . <p> Mauricio Pochettino had gambled on the fitness of Harry Kane but the Spurs striker looked as though he had not fully recovered from the injury he sustained against Manchester City in the quarter-finals . <p> A 75% fit Kane struggled to make any impact against Virgil van Dijk . <p> Neither midfield showed sufficient composure to keep possession or dictate the tempo of the game for any significant length of time . <p> The game frequently drifted rather aimlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustained and direct threat in the final third . <p> Spurs played with greater urgency in the second half and Alisson Becker was called upon to make several saves but they were mostly comfortable ones . <p> Divock Origi 's cleanly struck second ended Spurs ' resistance and saved we Liverpool fans the nervy final few minutes that we had been anticipating at that point . <p> Liverpool have the trophy that their season deserves . <p> Meanwhile , Spurs deserve enormous credit for the Champions League run that they 've had . <p> Keeping Pochettino will be their top priority for this summer . <p> Klopp finally has a winner 's medal from a Cup final ; now for an English Premier League one . 
@@41023234 <p> During its keynote , Craig Federighi , Apple 's software chief , talked at length for several of the new announcement the company had at its WWDC 2019 keynote . Among that list was the long-awaited arrival of iPadOS . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> As you can tell , the new OS is derived from iOS , and it 's pretty clear that Apple has made some tweaks to the software that would make the experience on the iPad a more fluid experience . Firstly , the new OS features an improved home screen that now allows you to switch place your widget besides your apps . For context , these are the same widgets that iOS users would usually find whenever you open up the notifications bar . <p> Multitasking also appears to be a core feature with iPadOS . Case in point , Federighi introduced a new split screen mode that allows user to open multiple apps within the same page . The feature is reminiscent to the way Microsoft 's Windows OS automatically splits programs and browser windows on a PC display , and seems easy enough to navigate through . <p> Federighi also demonstrated that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between them without a hitch . If you wanted to , you could also view all apps you 've opened and organised in the iPadOS ' own Expose-esque window . <p> To add on to that , there 's also a Column view built into iPadOS . Similar to Split View 's function , Column view allows iPad users to open up multiple columns in one window , and even functions like Finder on the macOS . <p> On another note , Apple has not neglected the Apple Pencil , and has given it some improvement with the new iPadOS . For a start , the new iPad-dedicated OS drops the latency for the pen from 20ms down to 9ms , making the tool even more intuitive . <p> Further , the accessory 's tool palette will also be getting an update that will provide developers with access to it , thus giving them the ability to add more third-party apps for it . <p> Other support features include a new download manager in iPadOS . It 's a feature that Apple should 've added in several updates ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is finally giving users a management app that will allow iPad users to organise their downloads . <p> Speaking of " about time " moments , the new iPadOS will now allow iPads to use USB drives and SD Cards as a medium for storing or transferring files . While it was n't outright mentioned , it seems that such support will only work with the new iPad with USB-C ports . <p> There was also mentioned about improving the browsing experience with the Safari browser on iPadOS . Federighi mentioned that prior to the new OS update , both the iPad and iPhone 's iOS would have difficulty resizing and setting the right browser for itself . <p> With iPadOS , the update will bring desktop-class browsing to the tablet , plus 30 new keyboard shortcuts and other new edition options . Such examples include the ability to cut a wall of text by pinching three fingers together and then pasting that text in another part of a document by using a three finger spreading motion across the display . <p> And if you want to undo the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

He said he was sometimes asked by coaches to drive athletes to meets , and , once there , sat and watched . <p> " I can go where I want , " he said . " I can go up to whomever I want . Or am I a leper ? Show me a law that I have violated , a Russian law .

" <p> Yuri Ganus , the director of RUSADA , told Reuters it would investigate the findings . <p> Russia 's athletics federation said the findings made by Reuters had been sent to RUSADA because they contained " information on possible anti-doping violations . " <p> The federation said it had called on RUSADA and the sports minister of the Kursk region to investigate Mokhnev 's work with athletes and , if the Reuters findings were confirmed , to " hold those guilty responsible . " <p> The International Association of Athletics Federations ( IAAF ) did not respond to a request for comment . <p> BLOW TO RUSSIAN PRESTIGE <p> In November 2015 , Russia 's athletics federation and RUSADA were suspended over what Dick Pound , who presided over a WADA-commissioned report into doping in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a major setback for a nation with a proud history of global success in track and field and beyond . <p> Russia says it has turned over a new leaf and is seeking to retrieve its status as a full-fledged participant in international sport . <p> Some critics , including former and current anti-doping officials and a former world-class athlete contacted by Reuters , counter that Russia has not truly changed its ways . <p> Asked to comment on Reuters findings , Travis Tygart , CEO of the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency ( USADA ) , a signatory to the WADA code , said : " If true , the world 's clean athletes have truly been sold down the river and the Russians are laughing behind our backs . " <p> Under the WADA code , if someone serving a ban violates it , the duration of the ban can be doubled . The code does not state what happens if the person is serving a life ban . <p> The WADA code establishes anti-doping regulations that must be followed and enforced by its signatories , including RUSADA . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it warned athletes in advance about testing and its officers accepted bribes from athletes . <p> WADA 's Executive Committee voted last year to re-instate RUSADA , saying it had undergone reform . At the time , members of WADA 's Athletes Committee dissented . <p> Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov referred questions to the sports ministry , which did not respond . <p> The Athletics Integrity Unit , which oversees integrity issues in international athletics , including doping , said it did not comment on specific cases when presented with Reuters ' findings . <p> BANNED , BUT TRACKSIDE <p> Mokhnev , the banned running coach , instructed Yulia Stepanova , then an 800-metre runner with the Russian national team , on how to inject herself with banned blood booster Erythropoietin ( EPO ) , and advised her on how to avoid detection , according to the WADA-commissioned report . <p> In addition to his interaction with athletes in Kursk on May 16 , Mokhnev was also track-side last year at athletics meets in Kursk , according to a video and photographs posted online by local athletics followers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her social media page , Mokhnev can be seen standing by the track , with a stopwatch around his neck , next to a runner called Nikolai Bukreyev . <p> The photograph was taken at a competition in Kursk that ran from May 17 to 18 , 2018 . <p> At another competition a few days later at the same track in Kursk , a city about 500 km south of Moscow , amateur video footage shows Mokhnev on the track . <p> In the footage , Mokhnev , who was out of shot at that moment , can be heard shouting at Bukreyev . <p> Bukreyev said he would not comment on " false facts " , without saying which facts he deemed false . <p> The head of the Kursk region 's athletics federation , Yevgeny Shumakov , said Mokhnev had not been coaching but rather offering advice to athletes from the side of the track . <p> He said Mokhnev received no pay for working with athletes , but added that a banned coach turning up at meets was " not okay " , although the federation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't handcuff him , can I ? " he said . <p> Reuters could not confirm whether Mokhnev has received any payments for his advice . <p> COLLEGE COACH <p> University track coach Volkov was banned for encouraging a female athlete to refuse a doping test at a 2015 competition in Moscow , according to the Russian athletics federation . <p> On two occasions in September last year , Reuters witnessed him instructing runners at the outdoor track belonging to the Moscow Power Engineering Institute , a university in the Russian capital . <p> The institute 's website described Volkov as the coach of its athletics team in October 2017 , two months after his ban had taken effect . The institute later told Reuters that this was down to a mistake by its press office . <p> He is now listed on the website as a member of the physical education faculty , but there is no recent mention of him as coach of the university team . <p> During one training session , Volkov instructed a group of about 10 runners as they sprinted around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hamstrings and calves by the track . <p> The institute said Volkov was conducting physical education classes with students and did not have contact with professional athletes . <p> RUSADA head Ganus said the agency could not demand Volkov 's firing because the institute is not a sports organisation . <p> BUSINESS TIES <p> Portugalov , formerly the athletics federation 's chief medical officer , had provided athletes with banned substances and covered up their positive tests for a cut of their winnings , according to the WADA-commissioned report . <p> Elite athletes who receive medical or nutrition advice from banned team personnel can face sanctions , according to the WADA code . <p> Portugalov , who owns a 20% stake in a firm called " Klokov . Technologies of Sports Training and Recovery " , offered medical advice to a group of about 20 people at a paid lecture organised by the firm at a Moscow weightlifting gym in December 2018 . <p> He offered advice on how to monitor blood components , and what nutrition to use for optimal training . <p> A Reuters reporter attended the lecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vyacheslav Klokov , said Portugalov had officially retired but continued to be called upon for educational activities related to health , nutrition and illness prevention . <p> RUSADA 's Ganus said Portugalov 's lecturing did not violate anti-doping regulations because , as far as the agency is aware , he was giving his audience advice about methods and treatments that are permitted under anti-doping rules .

" <p> Malaysia 's soil and waterways also face threats from pollution during the cleaning process when the water from the waste seeps into the ground . <p> " In some cases , the waste is dumped on abandoned land or in the forest and left there , " said the source . <p> Illegal factories <p> The sources said the situation worsens when recycling companies without their own waste processing premises hand over this task to factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas located close to the ports . <p> " Selangor is among the States that have many illegal factories .

@@41041239 <h> AMD Radeon VII Review : Still A Lot Of Room For Improvement <p> My initial impression of AMD 's Radeon VII graphics card was less than stellar . The card clearly has potential , but it 's clear to see that AMD was in a hurry to get the card out , as evidenced by its CES 2019 keynote . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> This review is more than a little late , but I 've spent a bit more time with the graphics card since my first look at it . In that time , I made attempts to push the card a little past its default boost clockspeed . So , without further ado , let 's jump right into it . <h> Design <p> I wo n't spend too much time talking about the design of the Radeon VII , as I 've already done so in my first impressions with the card . As a quick recap , the Radeon VII is AMD 's latest enthusiast level graphics card for the current market . Theoretically designed to go toe-to-toe with NVIDIA 's GeForce RTX 20 series graphics card . <p> It 's not an overstatement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineering marvel ; AMD has beaten NVIDIA to the punch and fulfilled its promise ( somewhat ) of churning out what is the world 's first 7nm GPU architecture . <p> Sadly , the GPU is n't highly anticipated Navi GPU architecture that AMD fans are waiting for . Instead , the GPU is just an " enhanced 2nd generation " variant of the current Vega GPU architecture . To that end , however , AMD has given the Radeon VII a generous 16GB of HBM2 graphics memory , running at a boost clock frequency of 1.8GHz and a 1TB/s memory bus . <p> Moving on , I like how AMD has reverted back to the same dusted aluminium shroud design that it first introduced with its dual Hawaii XT-based graphics card , the Radeon R9 295X2 . Yes , the design does look a bit plain , but to be fair , AMD 's reference cooler designs are kind of timeless . <h> Specifications <p> Just as before , the hardware specification I used for the initial testing of the Radeon VII remains unchanged . Also as per my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Radeon VII against is NVIDIA 's GeForce RTX 2080 Founders Edition . <p> The monitor I am using is also the same as before , which is the Acer Predator X27 4K HDR monitor . <h> Benchmark <p> As before , the synthetic benchmarks used in testing the card remain unchanged ; I ran UL 's 3DMark program , along with the Unigine Superposition benchmark program . For the real-world tests , I put the cards through four titles , which were Battlefield V ( BFV ) , Deus Ex : Mankind Divided ( DXMD ) , DOOM , and Shadow of the Tomb Raider . <p> As mentioned before , the Radeon VII clearly lags in the Unigine Superposition synthetic benchmark , and by a significant margin . In UL 's 3DMark 's tests , the card actually manages to turn the tables against the RTX 2080 . The only exception to the rule being the Fire Strike Ultra test . <p> Of course , gaming is where the mettle of a graphics card is tested , and the Radeon VII is capable of holding its own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mixed bag , with the card pulling ahead of the RTX 2080 in a couple of titles while lagging behind in the others . <p> In a test of raw power , the Radeon VII is right in its comfort zone with Deus Ex : Mankind Divided ( DXMD ) and DOOM , while the remaining titles -- Battlefield V ( BFV ) and Shadow of the Tomb Raider ( SotTR ) -- were obviously tailored to favour NVIDIA 's RTX range . <p> On the subject of BFV , the Radeon VII displayed some sort of " visual stutter " that was prevalent within the title . Initially , I suspected the issue stemmed from the pre-launch drivers AMD provided . But that was n't the case ; even after updating it to the official launch drivers , the stuttering was still there . <p> Given the amount of time that has passed since I tested the card , I 'm certain that AMD has undoubtedly addressed the issue . <h> Overclocking <p> The Radeon VII is one of the trickier graphics cards from AMD that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been restricted to the brand 's own WattMan overclocking tool . On a side note , I like that the new Radeon Software Adrenalin 2019 actually comes with a one-push auto overclocking GPU button , as well as the option to do the same with the card 's memory . <p> Moving forward , I manually overclocked the Radeon VII and managed to achieve a stable boost clock of 2GHz . However , doing this requires tweaking of the GPU voltage . In the case of this Radeon VII unit , that number hovered between 1145mV and 1211mV . That said , there was a great deal of trial and error getting to this point , and there were even times when the card would crash and fail to run certain benchmarks from the start . <p> At 2GHz , the Radeon VII did show some visible gains in the synthetic benchmark tests . In 3DMark , the card clearly pulled ahead of its default self in the Fire Strike tests , but fell short in the Time Spy tests . In Unigine Superposition , the card beat its pre-overclock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more or less the same in the gaming segment , but the range in framerate gains is quite wide . In BFV , the card in its OC configuration fell behind by several frames compared to its pre-overclocked performance in 4K . But overtook it when the resolution was lowered to 1440p and Full HD . <p> In DOOM , our Radeon VII showed little to no change in its performance , with the card nearly matching its pre-overclocked performance frame for frame , and while running with the Vulkan API . In SotTR , the overclocking clearly gave it an edge , putting it closer to the performance level of the RTX 2080 . <h> Power Consumption And Thermals <p> This portion of the review really should n't come as a surprise , but the Radeon VII is anything but a power efficient or cool card . During the review , I found no noticeable difference in the temperatures while running the card pre-overclocked and at 2GHz . <p> For those unaware , AMD 's current Radeon Software Adrenalin 2019 and WattMan OC tool displays the current temperature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core refers to the main GPU , while the junction indicates the overall temperature of the VRM modules surrounding the main module . However , it should be noted that the temperatures indicated are actually inversed ; junction values are actually core values , and vice versa . <p> At full whack , the main GPU was running at temperatures above 100 ? C , while the surrounding VRM chips peaked between 73 ? C and 75 ? C. As for power consumption , the entire system and Radeon VII pulled more than 450W , which is very high , even for a graphics card of this calibre . <h> Conclusion <p> As I 've said before , the Radeon VII feels like a missed opportunity here ; despite the 7nm process node , it 's obvious that the card was released on a whim , hence why it uses an " enhanced version " of the Vega architecture , and is not based on Navi . All is not lost though ; AMD can still salvage -- if not make the most of -- the situation by providing ray-tracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately needs to keep up with the demand for heightened realism in games , brought forward by the institution of real-time ray-tracing , courtesy of NVIDIA and it 's current RTX series GPUs . <p> On that note , we 've still got a couple of days to go before AMD 's big reveal of its new Radeon RX 5700 series of graphics card before E3 2019 , so we 'll just have to wait and see if the company will finally address the issue .

Singapore and the Borneo States would need that no ' two third rules ' to prevent rubber stamping of Federal legislations . Article 46 is just important as immigration under Article V of MA1963 . If Borneo States ' rights were to be breached we would vote against that and Singapore would ensure no unconstitutional and illegal amendments would be made . " <p> PM Lee would have responded . " That would be correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pre-empt at all costs that embarrassing opportunity to confirm that lawful and constitutional demand for the Singapore 15 seats by the Borneo States . So , they have to expressly agree that the Separation Agreement could only be disclosed to the world , only after its execution . Then it would be too late . The Borneo States would have no chance to confirm and demand from the PM of Singapore , Malaysia with DPM that all the Singapore 15 seats under no two third rules for the Borneo States expressly to be stipulated in the Separation Agreement on 9th August 1965 with a Supplementary Agreement on MA 1963 executed . <p> Singapore could not exit under ' Admission ' under Article 2(a) and any amendment of the new article 2(c) could not be done without signing the Supplementary Agreement by the four remaining parties including the deleting of Singapore under Article 1(2) ( c ) after amending Section 4(2) ( c ) of MAct63 first . After that surreptitious execution of the Separation Agreement , the Premier LKY of Singapore would understandably have responded . <p> " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can not say anything more . " <p> Years later , Premier LKY did feel remorseful . The Borneo States as ' equal partners ' should have been consulted and agreed as the two signatories in that Separation Agreement which again was executed with such flying speed without notice . <p> Unfortunately , the Constitutional nightmares began . Continental Shelf Act 1966 and Petroleum Mining Act 1966 steam rolled in parliament knocking down the pins of entrenched provisions in the Borneo States one by one . Oil would be the turbo charger to ensure success of Malaysia . The dismissal of Dato Kalong Ningkan as the Chief Minister to a great extent was also due to advices of P.E.H Pike , the Sarawak AG , and G. Shaw , the State Secretary of Sarawak , replying in the White Hallstyle for the Chief Minister in refusing to amend the various Articles of the FC and proposed new Federal Acts to protect Sarawak 's rights . That irked our premier Tunku . <p> The constitutional and political history of the Borneo States since 1966 would speak for themselves including the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1973 . The Special Grant ( balancing ) of RM5.8 million was abolished but the assured consideration of all the O&amp;G offshore proceeds were never assigned by the federal government to Sarawak .

Eight days later , the Sabah Oil Agreement was signed , exactly 6 months after the late Premier Tun Razak 's demise on 14.1.76 . <p> According to the Privy Council 's decision on Dato Ningkan 's case , The EOs were only meant to be ' temporary ' imposed under Article 150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kee Chok and his lot surrendered in 1973 . The communists were in the jungles , not at sea . The EOs were purely for reducing the putative 12 nautical miles of Sarawak territorial waters to 3 . <p> Tun Razak dared not go to the Privy Council for a Declaratory Judgement on the PDA1974 notwithstanding the EOs , as the strong bench of Lord Wilberforce , CJ Barwick of Australia and Lord Fraser would only have adopted the strong British judicial attitude against Emergency Ordinances related to aliens , not on the frivolous issues of reducing Sarawak territorial waters totally unrelated to the declared Emergency . PDA1974 would be declared certainly unconstitutional under Article 2(b) and the 7 FCs unconstitutional against the continental shelf , international boundaries and territorial waters for its O&amp;G established under the OIC1954 ( Alteration of Boundaries ) and illegal against valid Sarawak Land Code and Oil Mining Ordinance 1958 in the 7 PMS . <p> For aborting the Declaration Judgement of PDA1974 in the Privy Council , Tun Razak under Article VIII of MA1963 assured to pay another 5 per cent unofficial royalty from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional development fund not grant in addition to the 5 per cent cash payment by Petronas , as a rose by another name . <p> That verbal assurance , with verifiable part payments can be reconciled quite distinctly from other grants for Sarawak 's development . <p> Sarawak retained the export and import of timber products after obtaining the exemption from the Malaysian Timber Industry Board ( incorporation ) Act 1973 and also from Perbadanan Pembekalan Letrik Sarawak Act 1983 CAP 279 under Article 95D . <p> So in the Gas Supply ( Amendment ) Act 2016 , this Act should not be applicable to Sarawak ' unless consented by the state authority .

So Sabah and Sarawak can not be one State besides the vexatious annual Sulu 's ' rent ' ( padjak ) of RM5,300.00 . <p> Sarawak 's thorny road to restoration of its rights by amendments is tough ; Sabah 's path of restoration will be ten times harder , even with Datuk Liew Vui Keong as the law minister in the PM 's department . <p> 2 .

" Prevention is better than cure " else no cure in future . " Good fences make good neighbours . " <p> iii . That final demarcation of boundaries between Sarawak and Indonesia should be approved by the Council Negeri . <p> Thirdly , the Federation of Malaysia Agreement 1957 under Article 162(3) on dealing with the designations of officials of the States of Malaysia can be amended inside the square brackets adequately , as follows , if thought fit : " References in any existing law to the Federation of Malaya established by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any officer holding office .... the Federation of Malaya or to any authority or body constituted in or for that Federation of Malaya and to the extent applicable under the Federation of Malaysia ( including any references falling to be construed as such reference by virtue of Clause 135 of the Federal Constitution of the Federation of Malaysia Agreement 1963 ) shall be construed , ..... on and after Merdeka Day of Malaysia , as reference to the Federation of Malaysiathat is to say , the Federation established under the Federation of Malaysia Agreement 1963 and its territories ...... to correspond to any officer , authority or body referred to in any existing law . " <p> Sarawak hopes that the federal government will still negotiate on low profile , with mutual respect , benefit and let the various parliamentary committees study them carefully without rushing the proposed holistic approach also in English under the Rule of Law to restore the 4 actual boundaries under Article 2(b) and amend the broader , deeper and critical articles as stated above .

So , there is no need to hurriedly , as proven in the case of PDA 1974 legislations , to amend the skin-deep cosmetic Article 1(2) by July . Repent at leisure is never an option .

It was felt that the right-back had essentially been thrown under the bus by his coach . <p> As well as failing to sort out England 's porous defence , which was breached a whopping nine times in three games , Boothroyd was also criticised for bringing on two conventional centre-forwards at a time when 10-man England needed outlets and players capable of getting on the ball when they were struggling to retain possession in the closing stages of the French game . <p> Ostensibly , Boothroyd is still in a strong position , having signed a new , two-year contract just before the Euros began . In addition , as he was quick to point out , several eligible players were called up by senior team boss Gareth Southgate for the Nations League , while he could hardly be held accountable for some of the dismal unforced errors committed by his defenders . <p> " When you look at the calibre of the players making the mistakes , it does n't make sense , " he lamented after Monday 's 3-3 draw with Croatia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on June 4 , Luka Jovic had approximately 470,000 followers on Instagram .

" <h> " I 'd put aside my psychotic rage , after many years being awful to line cooks , abusive to waiters , bullying to dishwashers . It 's terrible -- and counter-productive -- to make people feel like idiots for working hard for you . " <p> Bourdain admitted in a 2017 interview with The Guardian that , for a time , he acted like a stereotypical tyrranical chef . But he made progress to break apart the ill will that environment created . He suggested his bad attitude came from the drug issues he openly dealt with . <p> " Nowadays I still have a rather withering ability to be sarcastic and displeased but I 'm not screaming at anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul , with a huge heroin and then crack problem .

Freedom of speech can not be justified when what is said can incite hatred against people or condemn a race or their homeland , or to speak blasphemous statements against a particular religion or God . In fact , in some legal jurisdictions , any kind of incitement to hatred may also be labelled as an act of terrorism . <p> In the Cambridge Union speech , you also made some derogatory comments on the LGBT community .

By condemning Jews like this , the world may have a distorted view of Malaysia , that this is a land of bigots . <p> I respectfully submit that this kind of vitriol is a dangerous weapon , with far-reaching consequences . It can only breed distrust , acrimony , alienation and antagonism between nations . Is this enmity and hostility safe to harbour in a world which is perpetually at conflict and at war ? <p> How can such prejudice be justified ? The answer is simple . It can not . So please , dear Tun , be more careful when you refer to the Jews . Please do not speak disparagingly of them as a race anymore , especially to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrorism . But at the end of the day , surely you would agree that one man 's terrorist could well be another 's freedom fighter . It all depends on which side of the fence we are standing on . <p> So there you are . I will end by reiterating the pride I feel when I think of all your achievements . But I am also disappointed with your prejudice , and I hope that this will change . For the sake of world peace , which I know you believe in . <p> I end this letter by thanking you for all your contributions to this country . You have shaped us to be what we are today , and for that , I remain eternally in your debt . I wish you many more years of health , peace , happiness and prosperity . <p> Thank you . <p> The views expressed here are those of the author/contributor and do not necessarily represent the views of Malaysiakini.

" Perhaps we sell them a small amount of civilian equipment . Just how much , I 'm not clear on because we do n't regard them as a core customer . " <p> The armed forces too have strongly denied official links to Huawei . " Huawei is not a military company , " Defense Minister General Wei Fenghe said at the Shangri-La Dialogue in Singapore in June . " Do not think that because the head of Huawei used to serve in the military , then the company that he built is part of the military . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains a topic of intense scrutiny in the U.S. because of the role the PLA has had in issues ranging from ratcheting up tensions in the South China Sea to alleged acts of state-sponsored hacking . It 's opaque operations and far-reaching powers in a country obsessed with stability have also raised concerns . Chairmanship of the Central Military Commission is often thought to be key to maintaining power in the country , which is why Xi Jinping and his predecessors were appointed heads of the body . The leader has doubled down on a policy dubbed " civil-military integration , " which aims to harness technology for military purposes . Beijing has thus encouraged greater participation from private companies in the defense sector . <p> Bloomberg was unable to contact the employees listed or determine whether they remain at the company . <p> The online sentiment classification study , which lists Shanghai-based Huawei employee Li Hui as its lead author -- focused on video and improving the accuracy of natural language processing algorithms . It yielded " very high accuracy , " according to a paper published in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a research institute of the Ministry of Public Security . Researchers used 240,000 comments to train their AI algorithms before testing them on a data pool of a million entries . <p> Li identified his or her employer as Shanghai Huawei Technology Co . The three co-researchers listed on the paper hailed from the PLA 's central committee , an elite IT research lab , and another military unit , the paper showed . The project was funded by the National 242 Information Security Project , a program created by Beijing to support IT security research efforts . <p> Wong Kam Fai , a Chinese University of Hong Kong professor who studies natural language processing , said that it 's common that universities in China and companies would collaborate with the government or military . Chinese " universities are quite open to working with the military . If it 's very sensitive , it will be classified . " <p> Wong said the papers on using technology to detect emotions in videos were n't particularly cutting edge , which partly explains why they can be made public . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will own the IP , " he added . " It 's possible that there 's a lot of research that people are just not seeing , because some military research is sensitive and classified . " <p> In addition , researchers sometimes put their employer 's name on papers without notifying the company , or wait till the paper comes out before doing . That 's because there 's a good chance some papers may never get published . <p> The author of a 2006 paper on America 's combat network radio -- Zheng Chuangming , from the Shenzhen Huawei Base -- looked into how U.S. software algorithms helped boost efficiency and conserve power . Zheng had published a more general paper on the same system only months earlier but listed his affiliation on that earlier document as the state-owned 7th Research Institute of China Electronics Group Corporation . <p> Another Huawei employee , Li Jie , is listed as working with two military researchers on the genesis and outlook of the geographical information system , used to collate and parse location data . That 's according to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telecommunications in the northern city of Dalian in 2009 . It 's not clear if Li , who worked in the Foundation Department of Huawei Technologies Co. , remains with the company . One of his co-researchers came from the National University of Defense Technology , one of the country 's best military academies . A third author was from a PLA entity that only showed up as a unit designation , according to publicly available information . <p> And in yet another paper published in 2013 , Huawei employee Zhou Jian worked with a PLA hospital on ways to help doctors better detect heart signals . The study was funded by the PLA 's 12th Five Year project , according to an introduction to the paper posted on cnki.cn , an online archive of academic research papers . Zhou is identified as an employee of Huawei Technologies Co . <p> " In the U.S. they have similar arrangements as well . The U.S. has military grants , " Wong said .

@@41111232 <p> It 's an issue that Amir Lowery and Simon Landau have been raising and tackling for several years . <p> Lowery , a former MLS footballer for Colorado Rapids and Kansas City among others , began coaching after his retirement in Washington D.C. and realised the group at his first club " was n't representative at all of the city " . <p> " It was almost 30 middle-class white kids . The inner-city kids , who are majority black or Latino , could n't afford it or were n't getting those opportunities . They just were n't in the picture , " he explains . <p> " I went out and started to look for kids to kind of shift the balance and in that process I met Simon , who was working with a local organisation here on a volunteer level called DC Scores . " <p> The pair are now in their fourth year of running Open Goal Project , an organization that aims to help ethnic minorities access and pay for these opportunities . <p> " Along the way , we 've been peeling back the layers and discovering how much there is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connecting the dots up to the top level , " Lowery explains . <p> " It 's becoming obvious why it 's impossible for these kids to access high-level soccer and why the national team looks like it looks still and we 're almost in 2020 . " <p> There is a complex web of issues , as Lowery explains . The cost of pay-to-play soccer in the US prices out lower-class families , many of those of an ethnic minority . <p> The accessibility of opportunities is not good enough , asking more money and travel from aspiring young footballers . Such opportunities to progress in the sport are n't offered in lower-income communities . <p> Lowery believes U.S. Soccer , the governing body of the sport in the country , is the " main culprit " and has accused those within the organization of chasing profit over inclusivity . <p> Asked what it can do to address these issues , he says : " They have to want to do something . I think we have to cross that line before the conversation starts on what they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been the main culprit in letting the system evolve into what it is today . <p> " Everyone is in it for what seems the profit motive rather than to develop good soccer players . " <p> When contacted for comment , U.S. Soccer rejected Lowery 's criticism but did not provide any examples of how the organization is actively tackling issues that young ethnic minorites face with the existing system prior to publication . <p> Although U.S. Soccer is known to run a scholarship program for its Girls ' Development Academy and encourages clubs to subsidize costs for youth players from low-income families , Landau added : " It 's bigger than any one club . It 's the way the system has evolved , it 's the way the business of soccer in this country has evolved .

As they watched on as those part of the program trained , they were taken aback by the talent and , in stark contrast , the lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stunned , " Landau explains . " They were working with the kids in the city and they were stunned that none of these kids were playing organized youth soccer . <p> " Their point was in England or in other places , they would be sent to find kids like this , and nobody is coming to find these kids . <p> " The lack of community outreach and gap-bridging that is done , just based on the way the system has evolved , is another issue too . " <p> While in countries like England coaches spend a lot of time around the non-professional game looking for new talent , the attitude in the US is to focus on those already in the system . <p> " The ultimate belief behind everything is that U.S. Soccer is missing out on the best players , or some of the best players , by neglecting kids in urban areas , by neglecting minorities , " Lowery says . <p> " To just totally throw a blanket over everyone who ca n't afford it and push them out of the equation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're missing a lot of talent . " <p> U.S Soccer argued that " this is not a blame you put on one organization " and can rightly point to the U.S. men 's national team , whose Gold Cup 2019 roster is incredibly diverse - over half the team are ethnic minorites . <p> Dunn , one of the USWNT 's four players on their Women 's World Cup 2019 roster with an ethnic minority background , commented on diversity in June . <p> " I am seeing so much more diversity and I think that 's really all I hope for , year-in , year-out , " the 26-year-old said . <p> " It 's always progressing in the right direction and especially being a woman of color I always root so much for the black girls that are doing well and I 'm always rooting for diversity in this sport continuing to grow . <p> " I 've been seeing it so I 'm quite happy with it .

I have n't seen an increase in diversity . I 've actually seen the reverse . <p> " There 's not one Latina on the USWNT . In the entire population of the United States , which has many Latina , it makes absolutely no sense that there 's no one on that roster . <p> " That 's just not more representative . " <p> Lowery and Landau know full well what sort of talent professional soccer teams are missing out on by neglecting lower-income communities . <p> Ariana ( 16 ) and Precious ( 15 ) are two girls to be aided by Open Goal Project , playing for the McLean , a team ranked second in the U.S. in their age group last year when the pair were there . <p> Both players were picked up by Lowery when playing recreational soccer and worked into the system by his contacts , while being funded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involvement , and Precious playing a year up from her age group , they shone for the team and became two of their star players - something that may not have been possible without Open Goal Project . <p> Their success only further highlights Lowery 's stance that it 's " critical " for soccer in the United States to be more accessible to ethnic minorities . <p> " If not , I think we 'll suffer over the next 10 or 20 years , " he says . " We 're essentially cutting out half of the population and not giving them access . <p> " We 're taking the best players from one half of the population . If you open it up to everybody , imagine .

@@41261232 <p> ( July 2 ) : Bill Huang , a Chinese-American telecoms industry veteran , used to target China and its vast , untapped market with the technological know-how he had learned in the US . <p> But over the past few years , the tables have turned . In his latest business endeavour , the engineer turned entrepreneur is relying on China for a key technology that would transform mobile communication for the next decade -- and it is a technology the US has fallen behind on . <p> As one of the first young mainland Chinese to attend graduate school in the US after diplomatic relations were resumed 40 years ago , and as one of the early participants in Beijing 's global recruitment programme to attract top talent in science and technology , Huang has a unique perspective on the current bilateral stand-off that centres on technology . <p> CloudMinds Technology , a privately held robotics sector company he founded in 2015 , needs the superfast 5G network to support its cloud-based platforms for operating intelligent robots . The next-generation wireless technology has become a flash point in the escalating US-China tech rivalry , and Huang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's kind of like a one-sided rivalry . Because the US does n't have the 5G technology , " Huang said on the sidelines of a recent conference on China in Philadelphia . <p> For months , the US government has waged a campaign to block the Chinese telecoms giant Huawei from dominating global 5G networks , lobbying allies to shun the company for what it says are risks of espionage or sabotage by Beijing . <p> Huawei is already ahead of its European rivals in market share thanks in part to its lower prices . But so far no companies in the US -- which has long led the telecoms industry -- can make the equipment needed to build the next generation of networks . <p> Huang , 57 , who spent three decades in the mobile communication sector , has watched from up close as the US gradually descended from its telecoms supremacy and China quietly caught up . <p> Technology is not like martial arts , or Shakespeare 's book , it 's not like everything is copyrightedBill Huang , CEO of CloudMinds Technology <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to countries around the world . Huang himself once worked at AT&amp;T 's research hub Bell Labs , a dominant leader in telecoms innovation known as " the idea factory " and arguably the most innovative scientific institution for a long stretch of the 20th century . <p> " In the last 20 years , the US went from being No 1 in the telecommunications industry to now almost exiting telecommunications equipment manufacturing , " Huang said , citing the acquisition of Lucent and Motorola by European counterparts . <p> It was a decline Huang witnessed with an initial sense of sadness . As a veteran of Bell Labs , he said , he had felt extremely proud of the company 's contribution not only to America , but to telecoms technology worldwide . <p> " But secondly I also felt a level of pride for China , " he said , " because it went from nothing in telecommunications to lead the world in telecommunications in less than 30 years . " <p> Huawei was under secret US surveillance , US fraud hearing told <p> Glenn O'Donnell , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US telecoms providers had little to do with politics , but was a function of inadequate interest in innovatation because of their dominance in the field . <p> " The long lease cycles and until recently the relative maturity of the market really did n't lend itself well for real innovation , " he said . <p> " And that 's now changing , and all of those players that decided not to play in telecommunications are now wishing they had a stake because there 's a lucrative new market . " <p> Also drastically different today is the state of relations between China and the US . As they fight their costly trade war , tensions and acrimony have spilled into other aspects of bilateral relations , from technology , defence and geopolitics to ideology . There are even warnings of " decoupling " -- something almost unimaginable to Huang , whose personal trajectory has been shaped by the intertwined ties between his homeland and his adopted country . <p> He calls himself " a product of China-US relations " . Such was his proud conviction that he gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president who put relations with China back on track in 1972 with a historic trip to Beijing that ended over two decades of antagonism and isolation since the Chinese Communist Party took power . <p> The visit by Richard Nixon -- who died in 1994 , the same year Huang 's son was born -- not only mended bilateral relations , but created an opportunity for Huang and many others like him : to learn the most advanced science and technology from the world 's leading innovation powerhouse . <p> Born in 1962 into an intellectual family in southwestern China , Huang spent most of his childhood in the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution . <p> " As professors , my parents had a very difficult time during the Cultural Revolution . But they insisted that we spend time to study , " he said . <p> Huang recalled being a " wild kid " , going to school to " have fun " . But when the time came to study , he was able to pick up the pace , which he attributed to the academic minds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " child prodigy " , he passed the country 's first university entrance exam in a decade at the age of 15 . A year later , in 1978 , he was in the first batch of students to enter university after the disruptions of the decade-long upheaval . He chose to major in electrical engineering , following in his father 's footsteps . <p> In his sophomore year at the Huazhong Institute of Technology , his parents told him to apply for graduate programmes in the US . <p> " They think the US has the best technology in the world , and they wanted me to come here to study , " he said . " I read everything about the US ... and I was very eager to come . " <p> Arriving at the University of Illinois ' Chicago campus in 1982 , at age 20 , Huang was one of the first new Chinese graduates to further their studies in the US after the re-establishment of diplomatic relations in 1979 . He did not speak English ( although he could read it ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could attend lectures . <p> He studied computer science in addition to electrical engineering , working day and night on projects in the lab -- a time he looks back on with fondness . <p> " It was some of the most intense time in my life , I suppose , " Huang said . " But I was young and relentless , and I could go on for three days without sleep . ... I thoroughly enjoyed it . " <p> US to speed up 5G development plans as race with China accelerates <p> Despite their vastly different cultural backgrounds , Huang made friends with his American classmates and fellow foreign students , some of whom were from India and what was then the Soviet Union . <p> " I experienced zero racial prejudice , " he said . " That was Chicago in the 1980s . I do n't know what happened today , but back then it was thoroughly what I thought was the ' melting pot ' . " <p> In his computer science classes , Huang learned Unix -- a state-of-the-art operating system developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create the program . <p> Little did he know he would later become a researcher at Bell Labs . " That was the holy ground of telecommunications , " he said , still beaming with pride when speaking of his former employer , which invented , among other things , the communications satellite and the cellular telephone system . <p> In 1994 , Huang joined 10 other former Bell Labs engineers at a California-based telecoms infrastructure provider that targeted the vast and underserved Chinese market . A year later , the company merged with a telecoms software company to become UTStarcom , with Huang as its co-founder and chief technology officer . <p> UTStarcom tapped into the fast-growing Chinese telecoms market with a low-cost , limited-range wireless service known as the Personal Access System ( PAS ) . It went public on the Nasdaq exchange five years later . In 2001 , China passed the US as having the most mobile phone customers . The rapidly expanding market propelled UTStarcom 's growth ; its revenues increased tenfold between its IPO and 2003 , when it controlled 60 per cent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived in the US for longer than he did in China and having become an American citizen , Huang moved from Silicon Valley to Beijing with his wife and son . China Mobile , the country 's largest telecoms operator , had asked him to help build a " Bell Labs for China " -- a request he readily accepted . <p> " It was not only a simple job , but a responsibility , a challenge I thought I should accept no matter what , " he told Chinese state broadcaster CCTV in 2017 . <p> Smartphone screen with resolution million times higher than iPhone : Chinese researchers make technology breakthrough <p> As the head of the China Mobile Research Institute , Huang led the carrier 's leap from 3G to 4G , and he was also at the centre of 5G research . " We put a lot of effort into researching what standards are required for the future network , " he said . <p> His return to China preceded the " Thousand Talents Plan " , a state-backed recruitment drive to lure the world 's brightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- with lavish grants . But when the plan was set up in 2008 , Huang was among the first batch of researchers to be enlisted . <p> " I express my heartfelt thanks to the state and the people for giving me such a good opportunity and condition to return home and serve the country , " Huang was quoted as saying at a forum for recipients of Thousand Talents awards hosted by People 's Dailyin 2010 . <p> " I worked for over 20 years abroad , and all my work was in the field of technology . I hope to bring the whole set of things I know back to China , " he added . <p> The recruitment scheme , much celebrated at the time , has become a sensitive subject today as tensions between the US and China escalate . It has drawn growing scrutiny and suspicion from the US , where investigators are looking for any connection to theft of American intellectual property . In response , China hushed up or deleted references to the programme in universities , companies and cyberspace . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theft , Huang gave a vehement defence of China . <p> " I think these are just basically blatant accusations with no ground , " he said . " Ninety-nine per cent of the technologies are not stolen . There are industrial espionage cases ... but they 're not systematic cases , and they 're not the result of the rivalry between China and the US -- they 're the result of competition . " <p> Huang also dismissed accusations that Chinese scientists and experts have " stolen " US technology . <p> " Technology is not like martial arts , or Shakespeare 's book , it 's not like everything is copyrighted , " he said . <p> " Everyone in Silicon Valley in the last 50 years started from somewhere , and then they become an entrepreneur and they move on to start their own companies . So in the early days , everyone took a little bit from what they have worked on . " <p> " It was customary , and then it became very litigious . Then people started saying : wait a minute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases , then it became more and more refined in what you can take and what you can not take ; what is protected and what is not protected . All of these things are happening industry-wide , it 's not a single US and China issue . " <p> But intellectual property theft is not the only American grievance . Many US companies have accused China of forced technology transfers , with foreign businesses required to hand over technology to their Chinese partners in exchange for access to the market . <p> Huang said that complaint " has been there since day one " . <p> " Chinese companies will always complain about American companies . American companies will always complain about Chinese companies . The reason is very simple : every company would want to use regulations and law to their advantage , " he said . <p> A trained engineer , Huang holds a " globalist " view of technology -- at odds with the national security perspective that has become prevalent in Washington . <p> " There 's no need for a confrontation in technology because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In Huawei labs , there are many American engineers . In Intel and Qualcomm 's labs , I can assure you there are many Chinese engineers , and there are many German , French , Swedish engineers in all of these organisations . The fact they 're sold by a Chinese company or they 're sold by an American company has no meaning because behind the technologies is an international effort . " <p> To make his point , Huang calls the technology created by CloudMinds a " US and China technology " . <p> " I mean , how do you categorise it ? Is it created by China or the US ? It 's created by both . Because we have engineers in Silicon Valley , and we have engineers in Beijing . " <p> Protecting IP in China is hard , but awareness is rising , thanks to Trump <p> The company has dual headquarters , with its global operation based in Santa Clara , California , and its China operation based in Beijing -- a structure Huang says now " makes perfect sense " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They kind of foresaw , if there are going to be trade tensions , this would be the right way to do it . " <p> But Huang questions if these tensions -- a large part of which he said had been " politicised " -- are so deeply embedded in every corner of society . <p> " I come to the United States very often , and I talk to the industry . I still feel it is the same America . " <p> " I encountered no scrutiny , no warning , and everyone is encouraging us , both from the US and from China , to continue our practice , " he said , adding that he only felt the tension when speaking to lawyers and government officials . <p> " But I am worried by all these stories . I think that 's why I said earlier : in the media it all looks very scary , but in practice , it 's all business as usual . "

The burger consists of a juicy beef patty that is topped with a generous serving of sambal belacan and petai , blue cheese dressing , a grilled pineapple ring and also oven baked cherry tomatoes . Served in their signature charcoal buns , the Stinkbomb is sure to ignite your taste buds and make you beg for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us , we got to try it out first ! <p> myBurgerLab also provides a poultry counterpart called " The Hook , Line &amp; Stinker " that replaces the beef patty with a crispy fried chicken thigh . Other than the patty and an additional serving of cheddar cheese , this burger has the exact same ingredients as the Stinkbomb and is definitely just as mouth-watering . A good alternative if you prefer chicken over beef ! <p> When we got these two burgers , we were impressed by not only the sight of the burgers , but the smell as well . After having a good whiff of it , we noted hints of blue cheese and sambal belacan which was enough to make our mouths water . I could barely stop myself from eating this ap-Petai-zing burger ! <p> Without further ado , here 's my two cents on this attractive combo . <p> Things that I loved about it : <p> The ingredients are fresh and perfectly complemented each other . There 's no doubt that myBurgerLab makes great burgers that taste amazing . Every ingredient used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making this a burger I would definitely order again . The oven-baked cherry tomatoes also added a very surprising twist to it , making each bite different from the previous one . <p> The sambal belacan and petai were spicy and tasted absolutely delicious and authentic . Though my tolerance for spicy food is a little below the average Malaysian , I loved that the burger had the perfect level of spiciness . It was enough to give me a " kick " but at the same time , I was n't crying and running to get refills every 10 seconds . Of course , not only was it spicy enough , but the sambal belacan was so authentic , I actually thought there was a Malay Mak Cik in the kitchen making it ! <p> The pineapple on the burger was perfection.I know , I know , not everybody loves pineapples on savory food ( ie : pizza ) , but this one really works ! The slice of pineapple in the middle of the burger was perfect as its sourness and sweetness blended perfectly with the sambal belacan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this burger is ! <p> It could be smellier . Personally , I am a fan of strong-smelling , pungent food such as blue cheese , smelly tau foo and of course , durian . However , for a burger that was named the Stinkbomb , I definitely wished the burger had a stronger and more pungent taste to it . That 's just me , but I 'm sure there are Malaysians who would be satisfied with the " stinkiness " of the burger . <p> There could be more blue cheese dressing . My colleagues and I agreed that as much as we enjoyed the sambal petai , it was a little too overpowering and we could only taste slight hints of the blue cheese . Although we could still smell and taste it , we definitely wished there was more blue cheese goodness on the burger . <p> Well , one thing is for sure , these two burgers still BLUE me away . <p> When WORLD OF BUZZ spoke to myBurgerLab , they also revealed that their main intention on bringing back this burger was because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed that because sambal petai is such a traditional and staple local delicacy , there would be no way that Singapore would mimic this burger . <p> All in all , I would definitely recommend trying the Stinkbomb or the Hook , Line and Stinker . It 's definitely a burger that I would order again and I 'm sure many Malaysians who are petai or blue cheese fans will be heading over to give it a go on the 5th of March ( Psst ... you can actually ask for the blue cheese to be served on the side or have it removed if you 're not a fan ! ) .

Interestingly , he was actually on a lookout for investment banking opportunities at the time to set him off on a " rewarding career " and landed an internship stint at JP Morgan . <p> With risk and funding matters to consider , Chang was reluctant to pursue his idea at first .

" I realised to write an entire app myself was challenging . So I started looking for online freelancers to work with me . " Chang took up a part time tutoring job for side income since paying for freelance services made a dent in his student budget . <p> However , overall , he believes his full scholarship from the university and living expenses stipend provided him with a good starting point . To date , Chang has invested RM200,000 into JomRun with RM50,000 coming from Sunway iLabs and Nexea Angels . <p> Some of Chang 's early struggles include getting partners onboard by cold calling companies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to wake up 3am to 4am to reach companies within office hours in Malaysia . Also , we did n't have anything to leverage on -- anyone can say they are building an app that 's going to gain traction .

As to what made him choose the path he did as opposed to joining an accelerator programme , Chang says he definitely considered the latter but thought it would be " time-consuming " especially since he was still studying . <p> Upon launching JomRun in August 2017 , Chang returned to Malaysia during Christmas break that same year . It was during this time that he found out about the Sunway iLabs Accelerator Programme and decided to apply . <p> Participating in the accelerator programme opened Chang up to a network of connections and potential investors . " I think that is the misconception I had previously , thinking it would be time-consuming . Although it sometimes is , the connections we make and the new perspectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garnered 2,000 users before the accelerator programme , Chang realised " that it was really hard to snowball the numbers as the number of users grew quite linearly . " <p> By partnering with marathon organisers and being open to feedback , JomRun pivoted its business model early on by entering into marathon ticketing which Chang believes is the main lifeline of the platform . <p> Taking a small percentage cut from ticket sales via the platform , JomRun is able to monetise . After all , companies are reluctant to offer rewards unless they gain too . " That is why we want to gather our database . Then , more merchants will look for us to offer rewards . " <p> As for expansion plans to other countries in Southeast Asia , it is certainly something Chang has in mind for JomRun although he is still on the lookout for the most suitable market to enter next . " It would take a lot of money so we need to choose wisely . "

@@41313239 <h> Raising Malaysia 's poverty line <h> Share this article <p> REMEMBER 1977 ? Maybe not , because most of the current Malaysian population had not been born yet . <p> Back then , Malaysia 's gross national income ( GNI ) per person was RM200 per month , and the government established a new poverty line income ( PLI ) of around RM50 per person . <p> Since then , Malaysia has prospered and GNI per capita has risen to more than RM3,800 per month while the PLI has increased only incrementally to RM245 ( RM980 for a family of four ) . <p> As the United Nations Special Rapporteur ( UNSR ) and others have argued , an update of the PLI is long overdue . <p> Regardless of the poverty line used , no one would deny that Malaysia has made remarkable progress in reducing poverty . <p> The sharp decline from almost half of Malaysians living in poverty in 1970 to less than 1% today using the current PLI is among the best in the world . Yet it is time to raise the bar . <p> Even " absolute poverty " lines need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty index could serve as key barometers of Malaysia 's progress toward shared prosperity and inclusive development , but only if they are upgraded to reflect the current realities in Malaysia . <p> It is a common misconception that absolute poverty lines should be based on the minimum biological and nutritional requirements for survival . <p> It is about more than survival , and includes having the resources to lead a healthy , active and dignified life and being able to participate meaningfully in society . <p> That is why virtually all countries revise their poverty lines as they develop and living standards improve . <p> This concept is elaborated quite clearly in the UNECE methodological guide that Malaysia references for setting the PLI : " Also the base of the absolute measure , that is the basket of goods , is likely to need updating over time as community standards or expectations change . " <p> One recent example is Mexico , a country with a GNI similar to Malaysia 's , where the autonomous panel responsible for setting the poverty line revised its standards upwards in 2018 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is for Malaysians to decide , based on Malaysians ' own values and aspirations , perhaps drawing lessons from other countries that have advanced to upper-middle or high-income status . <p> Recent research by Martin Ravallion shows that countries with average incomes similar to Malaysia 's have absolute poverty lines equivalent to RM2,550 per month for a family of four , almost three times the current PLI . <p> That poverty line would yield a poverty rate of about 15% , which is close to the rough estimate given in the UNSR 's report , and also the 17% that arises from applying an OECD-style relative poverty line . <p> The multidimensional poverty index ( MPI ) introduced in the 11th Malaysia Plan is also too low for a country at Malaysia 's level of development . <p> Malaysia 's MPI comprises the current monetary PLI plus non-monetary measures of deprivation such as education , health , and living standards . <p> Even when non-monetary aspects of wellbeing are considered , Malaysia 's MPI counts less than 1% of Malaysians as multi-dimensionally poor . <p> At the recent World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new research on a potential alternative MPI for Malaysia , using the same multiple dimensions as the current MPI but setting standards relevant to an upper-middle income country . This alternative estimates Malaysia 's rate of multidimensional poverty at 19% . <p> The UNSR 's report also rightly draws attention to those who are disproportionately affected by poverty . <p> It highlights that not only is poverty more prevalent than the isolated pockets often assumed , but also that poverty is deeper among some communities in Malaysia . <p> Many of these are " statistically invisible " because the Household Income Survey ( HIS ) that is used as the basis for poverty measurement excludes Orang Asli settlements , foreign workers and refugees . <p> The HIS does not record the status of persons with disabilities , and its sample design prevents reliable poverty estimates for indigenous people in Sabah and Sarawak ( non-Malay Bumiputera ) , whose poverty rates appear to be much higher than those of Malays . <p> The government authorities have the technical and financial resources to amend the HIS to make these comparisons possible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absence of this information impedes the formulation and implementation of policies to help Malaysians escape poverty . <p> Updates of the PLI and MPI to levels commensurate with Malaysia 's state of development can complement the current focus on the B40 to guide policies to ensure that the needs of the poorest Malaysians are addressed adequately . <p> It will take political courage , and good communications , to raise Malaysia 's official poverty standards . Inevitably some will claim , incorrectly , that poverty has increased . <p> The reality is that poverty has not been increasing , but rather that Malaysians expect more from life and more from their government and most of all to share in the nation 's prosperity . -- September 1 , 2019 . <p> * Kenneth Simler is senior economist with the World Bank Group Global Knowledge and Research Hub in Malaysia . <p> * This is the opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of The Malaysian Insight .

These gardens not only bring communities to plough the land together but also enhance interaction and understanding among communities . <p> Public transport is encouraged and efficient . Toilet facilities are automated without the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dues . <p> Local governments in these cities play a significant role through their respective vision , mission , values and operational excellence . They engage the people and integrate their aspirations for clean , healthy and aesthetic cities that are human-centred , rather than profit-centred . <p> Cities are built from a unique and universal cultural vision of life , where there is a balance between identity and the universality of life . <p> Today , looking at our own cities , I find much to be desired . We ca n't even get the basics right -- like clearing rubbish and drains efficiently . <p> While writing this article , I got a message from a resident in Menglembu , Ipoh showing me a pile of rubbish in front of a local Tamil school .

@@41358239 <h> Malaysia must urgently ratify ILO convention on violence , harassment <p> The Labour Law Reform Coalition is shocked by the sexist remark made by Pakatan Harapan senator Mohd Imran Abd Hamid in the Senate on 31 July 2019 . <p> We urge the Malaysian government to immediately ratify the new International Labour Organization ( ILO ) convention concerning the elimination of violence and harassment in the world of work ( C190 ) as a measure to eliminate the potential threat of violence and harassment against women . <p> Violence against women is a crime under Malaysian laws under whatever circumstances ; dressing should not be an excuse for perpetrator to use violence on another dignified person , let alone calling for the protection of men from committing a crime . <p> The justification of such severe criminal offences not only insults men and women , but also tacitly encourages violence with impunity . <p> We are saddened by the fact that the disrespectful words were uttered by the honourable MP , who had declared he would defend the Federal Constitution and the rule of law during the swearing-in ceremony . <p> Mohd Imran 's sexist language , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mokhtar and Tajuddin Abdul Rahman in the past and a Perak state executive council member Paul Yong , who was accused of raping his domestic workers , shows that there is an urgent need for the government to ratify the newly adopted ILO Convention on violence and harassment in June 2019 . <p> This is because we do n't know how these elected representatives are going to deal with workers who work in Parliament , political parties , the civil service such as the navy or government ministries , or at home . Will this sexist attitude escalate to sexual harassment or violence in the workplace ? <p> In 2018 , the Inter-Parliamentary Union conducted a survey and found 67.9% of female MPs in the European Parliament had received a comment relating to their physical appearance or based on gender stereotypes and 24.7% had suffered sexual violence . <p> Besides , 40.5% of European Parliament staff said they had suffered acts of sexual harassment in their work ; 69.2% of the cases involved male MPs . <p> Sexual harassment and violence in Malaysia is on the rise .

In addition , there were 1,682 cases of rape in 2017 . <p> We call upon the Malaysian government to review its " abstain " position while voting to adopt the Convention on Violence and Harassment in the International Labour Conference . <p> It is an embarrassment that the ruling coalition did not support an international convention which is perfectly coherent with the criminal justice system in Malaysia , let alone the Pakatan Harapan manifesto , which had promised to advance labour rights by putting our labour standards on par with ILO standards . <p> Earlier , the Labour Law Reform Coalition had proposed the inclusion of an enforceable code of conduct on sexual harassment to ensure workplace safety . <p> The coalition also supports the enactment of a Sexual Harassment Act to eliminate harassment against men and women , but we do not share the same opinion as Mohd Imran . <p> N Gopal Kishnam and Irene Xavier are the co-chairpersons of the Labour Law Reform Coalition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views expressed in Aliran 's media statements and the NGO statements we have endorsed , the opinions in other pieces published here do not necessarily reflect Aliran 's official position . <p> Our voluntary writers work hard to keep these articles free for all to read .

The SCR , based on an analysis of a sovereign 's ability and willingness to meet debt obligations , determines the country 's borrowing cost . <p> The higher the quality of a debt/bond , as determined by SCRs , the lower the perception of risk and a country 's borrowing costs . Ultimately , governments who ignore bond markets are punished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However , in the wake of the European sovereign debt crisis ( along with the global financial crisis -- GFC ) in 2008 , the Big Three drew heavy criticism , among others , for being overzealous with the downgrading of non-crisis hit eurozone major economies , such as France and Austria , that exacerbated the financial crisis , together with a slew of mistakes in the assessment of risks and , ultimately , credit ratings . <p> A study by the Bank for International Settlements found that despite the systematic mispricing and conflicts of interest in rating collateralised debt obligations ( CDO ) that led to the GFC , CRAs continue to have a significant and economically important impact on credit default swap ( CDS ) spreads and overall investor sentiment . <p> The past mistakes in ratings raise the question of whether SCRs can effectively make accurate and meaningful credit ratings given the complexities in assessing a country 's risks . <p> The problem with credit ratings <p> Credit practitioners appreciate that the methodology for credit evaluation is only effective if relevant data is availed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The most common and widely used indicator for a nation 's economic performance is the GDP , which , however , only measures the national income/production and not the changes in a nation 's underlying asset base or its wealth ( human capital , natural resources , intellectual capital and so on ) . <p> This is odd given that conventional credit evaluation for individuals and corporations is based on the quality of the income statement and the balance sheet . Nations have complex varied structures and compositions , and thus the idea that their economic complexity could be easily analysed and translated into a band of ratings with accuracy is incomprehensible , and less so if it is to be done by short visits to countries . <p> The debt-to-GDP ratio heavily influences rating agencies in their assignment of SCRs . Unfortunately , the perception of the credit risk of sovereigns depends on measures similar to those of assessing risks for corporations and individuals . <p> Ratios used for individuals and corporations operating in a similar environment and system are generally comparable . There is a wealth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply not so for countries where there are long gaps between default occurrences . <p> Additionally , the ratios for nations and their relevance , such as those produced by American economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff , have recently received severe criticism .

First , is the default on foreign currency borrowings and second is the default in domestic currency , which is characterised by severe devaluation and/or hyperinflation . <p> Foreign borrowings , usually US dollar-denominated , have caused many well-known or sovereign crises in the Latin American region such as Argentina , Venezuela and Ecuador . Malaysia 's previous experience of borrowing in foreign currency should serve as a warning , notably , Malaysia 's borrowings in yen with ostensibly low interest rate which was seemingly low cost at one time , but following the appreciation of the yen against ringgit , the borrowings resulted in substantially higher costs . <p> Certainly , going forward , the likelihood to invest internationally would be to use surplus government funds as compared with borrowing for investment as done recently . The question that begs to be asked is of what relevance are international ratings if borrowings in foreign currency are kept to a minimum going forward . <p> As alluded above , a country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a lack of confidence in the local currency in its ability to retain its value . This usually stems from declining confidence in the government of the day , normally due to economic malaise that causes supply shortages and leads to expectations of inflation . Zimbabwe is a well-documented case of such a default , which is characterised by hyperinflation . <p> Similarly , severe currency devaluation would also result in a crisis with the outflow of funds when there is a complete loss of confidence in the country 's currency and this leads to a selldown of local currency assets . <p> With loss of confidence , domestic and foreign investors will try to sell the domestic currency , exacerbating the surge in demand of foreign currency . The shift in supply and demand causes the domestic currency to fall sharply . It is not uncommon for flight-to-quality to occur , wherein banks in financial centres benefit from increased deposits . As a result , this places additional pressure on the domestic banks ' holding of foreign currency . <p> Should Malaysia deserve a better rating ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very unlikely that Malaysia could default given that there is no pressing reason to borrow in foreign currency as the country enjoys a trade surplus . Furthermore , a sovereign 's ability to service its financial obligations is more important than just the size of its debts . <p> Critical to capacity to repay foreign debt is the level of reserves . However , Malaysia 's total reserves have not increased significantly in recent times , despite the trade surplus , given the movement in the financial accounts . <p> The issue of outflows due in financial account can be addressed by capital controls as a last resort . This was clearly demonstrated by the seven-year period , reserves of US$25 billion in 1998 grew to US$70 billion in 2005 when capital controls were in place . We could argue that Malaysia 's capital controls were effective because of the trade surpluses , otherwise black markets would have developed to trade ringgit despite the capital controls and , hence , a serious net outflow of funds . <p> It is crucial that policymakers closely monitor for trade surpluses and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be possible by carefully undertaking imports of large ticket items , in particular , government non-financial public corporations ( NFPCs ) purchases . Furthermore , a fuller understanding of the international flow of funds for Malaysia is required given the large errors and omissions ( EO ) in its balance of payments ( BOP ) . For example , the size of such EOs in 1Q2019-3Q2019 is larger than its current account by some three times . <p> A critical risk which remains is the sudden outflow of funds if there is a selldown of securities . Over time as we know from the Asian financial crisis , investors understand that a devalued currency with a fundamentally sound economy will eventually recover . Therefore , sound economic management must remain the bedrock to ensure risks are mitigated and a realisation that market movements are transient and manageable . <p> Should we tighten our belts during a slowdown ? <p> During times of economic slowdown or recession , some policymakers mistakenly believe that governments should act like households and tighten budgets in anticipation of declining income . This is simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own central banks that issue their own currencies . <p> Austerity proponents , like Italian economist Alberto Alesina , make the following two assumptions of high levels of public debt : ( i ) that rising public debt increases investors ' expectations of a default , thus leading to higher overall borrowing costs ; and ( ii ) expectations of economic players of impending tax hikes and , hence , causing individuals and firms to invest and consume less . <p> The first assumption is not a rule of thumb as a country that has an independent monetary policy can freely set interest rates and by ordering the central bank to print money . This was demonstrated by the massive quantitative easing ( QE ) that took place in the US and the UK . We would strongly advocate fiscal policy rather than QE , which resulted in asset bubbles and weak increase in aggregate demand . <p> The second assumption is misplaced . Entrepreneurs do not solely base their investment decisions on government deficits and supposed subsequent future tax hikes , but instead on the back of expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overall job creation will decline , which then negatively affects households ' ability to spend in the overall economy . <p> Austerity proponents advocating for reduced government spending is largely premised on the notion that the private sector can provide full employment to the economy . Giving market forces a free hand over the economy was in vogue during the early 1980s , as promoted by US President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher . <p> This resulted in the weakening of trade unions and depressed employment benefits . Unfortunately , these policies of unfettered free markets are being cited as the main reasons for stagnating median income in the US since the GFC , which has also grown at a much slower pace since the late 1980s . <p> A reminder from the great recession of 2008 is that the private sector , when faced with great uncertainty , can not continuously provide full employment . In such circumstances , it is incumbent on the government to expand its balance sheet to pick up the slack of the private sector . As John Maynard Keynes argued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slump , is the right time for austerity at the Treasury . " <p> Further the quote " Austerity is a tool of ... financial interests -- not a solution to the problems caused by them " from the book Austerity : 12 Myths Exposed by Bryan Evans , Dieter Plehwe , Moritz Neujeffski and Stephen McBride is germane to this discussion . <p> Going forward <p> The issue before us is do we as a nation focus solely on trying to reduce the fiscal deficit ? Or do we ensure that a sufficient social safety nets for the weakest in society are well preserved in the face of a slowing global economy ? Do we also at the same time undertake a mission-orientated approach to critical projects to develop the country more rapidly ? <p> New thinking in economics promoting " bottom-up policies " suggests that spending on social safety nets , such as providing a universal basic income , increases spending in the economy , which ultimately increases aggregate demand .

We see no conflict of " crowding out " if the government and government-related companies take on radical risk that the private sector is unwilling or incapable of taking on . It is critical to ensure that such monies incurred in deficit spending do not end up in foreign properties , foreign bank accounts and so on , but to circulate in the local economy to increase aggregate demand . <p> It is important that policymakers understand that the government 's deficit is the private sector 's savings . Moreover , the government has a better capability of managing debt than the private sector due to its central bank with fiat money . It is worth noting that the only time the Malaysian government ran a budget surplus was the period prior to the AFC and , concurrently , the private sector racked up debt at an astonishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an exchange rate crisis . This was also a period of trade deficits . <p> The key concern of policymakers is that an increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio or deficit will invite an adverse reaction of the Big Three . However , before policymakers pander to the views of rating agencies , they need to consider the points above and debate among themselves about what is truly in Malaysia 's best interest . <p> As a nation , we have travelled the unorthodox path before in respect of the economy during the AFC , and it paid dividends and earned us international recognition . However , if the government were to go against the advice of CRAs alone and ignore them , investors may be skittish and feel there is no other alternative that could assist them in making their investment decisions . <p> Investors , like it or not , will still be guided by the CRA for the foreseeable future despite heavy criticism of rating agencies , for example , in their assessment of CLOs ( collateralised loan obligations ) /CDOs prior to the GFC or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ junk -- in 1998 during the AFC . <p> Ideas that have been bandied about to counter the Big Three include establishing an Asian/Asean rating agency or even an Islamic rating agency , which may have a better understanding of issues related to Malaysia or those of emerging markets . Perhaps , another option that may merit consideration is the issuance of sovereign equity , which could pay dividends to investors based on the economic performance of a country . Equities are outside the remit of CRAs . <p> In the final analysis , credit ratings are merely the opinions of the CRA on borrowers ' credibility . Fear of the unknown/uncertainty by the public and global investors can lead to adverse credit ratings and even massive sudden outflows of funds . However , the government can counter this , even when taking bold steps for the economy , by establishing effective communication of its policies to the public and global investors and improving its transparency and corporate governance . <p> Efforts by the current administration to improve its credibility through institutional reform are commended , but more can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our view is that any view or even advice by third parties to the government , such as this article , is not prescriptive , but what really is required is a discourse and the courage to challenge the existing schools of thought and the status quo .

@@41393235 <h> SST one year on -- a tax system fit for the future ? <p> Slightly more than a year ago , Malaysia reintroduced the sales tax and service tax to replace the Goods and Services Tax ( GST ) , which was zero-rated a few months before it was abolished . While commonly referred to as SST , the sales tax and service tax operate as two distinct tax systems . <p> Given the short lead time for the implementation of the SST , the Sales Tax Act 2018 and the Service Tax Act 2018 are predominantly based on the Sales Tax Act 1972 and the Service Tax Act 1975 . While both of the 2018 Acts have been enhanced as best as they could , business models and transactions are very different now compared with the time the underlying legislation was conceived some 45 years ago . <p> It is timely to look at some of the practical issues raised by businesses and consider if the SST should be considered a temporary measure , while Malaysia moves to an indirect tax system designed with the future in mind . <p> Defining taxable services <p> As the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the question that often gets asked is , " Is this service taxable ? " <p> The confusion arises because the service tax legislation seeks to group taxable services under a number of broad categories . Fundamentally , this manner of defining taxable services will always be open to interpretation . On the other hand , a more specific or narrow definition could mean a wide range of services falling outside the ambit . <p> In striking a balance between being prescriptive and ensuring the scope for tax collection remains broad , more specific definitions can help . But from our experience , even a specific definition of a taxable service is open to interpretation . <p> One such example in the current service tax legislation , where the broad term " management services " was made more specific to include 10 subsets of management services . One of these subsets is project management services which , on a first reading , seems specific . But when one tries to analyse what types of services fall within the scope of project management , it becomes significantly less so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be regarded as " management " , but execution should not . But the line between the two blurs significantly depending on ( among other factors ) the degree of input by each party in the decision-making process . <p> This is just one example of the many discussions between businesses , tax professionals and the Royal Malaysian Customs Department on a regular basis . <p> Complexity in exemptions <p> With the sales tax , some of the more common issues relate to the exemption system . Under the sales tax regime , registered businesses manufacturing taxable products can claim exemptions from the payment of sales tax . Exemptions are also available to specific persons or industries . The intention here is to prevent the sales tax from being levied more than once in the supply chain , or , at all , for policy reasons in the case of certain goods . The result is innumerable exemptions spread over three orders , each with their own attached conditions . These conditions may be difficult to meet , and could require a significant amount of monitoring for businesses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , often due to a lack of process or insufficient understanding of how exemptions work . <p> Consider the following scenario : ABC Co manufactures taxable and exempt goods partly for sale in Malaysia and partly for export . ABC Co uses the same packaging materials for all goods . ABC Co can claim an exemption from payment of sales tax on the packaging materials for all goods , excluding those exempt goods that are sold locally . But to do so correctly , ABC Co must apply for two separate exemptions , which sit in two separate parts of the exemption order . ABC Co must also monitor the usage of packaging materials to ensure that the exempt material is not used to package exempt products for local sale , or the exemption becomes invalid . If this is already sounding complicated , one can imagine the real-world issues where transactions are a lot more varied and complex . <p> A single-stage tax ? <p> The sales tax and service tax are often referred to as single-stage taxes . This means that they are only levied once in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in practice , the lack of interaction between sales tax and service tax can result in a compounding effect . Combined with the propensity of businesses to mark up their total costs , the single stage nature of the two taxes can result in an increase in costs resulting from such mark-ups compared with the amount of tax that is actually collected throughout the supply chain . <p> Let 's consider support services first . These are services acquired by businesses in the supply chain to enable them to deliver their products to the end consumer . Not all will be subject to service tax , but certain support services such as consulting , advertising , legal and warehouse management are taxable . Service tax on these support services increases the overhead cost at each stage of the supply chain . <p> Next , we consider the direct supply chain . Sales tax is levied at 10% at the start , namely upon manufacture . This additional cost , together with the increased overhead costs becomes the basis for the mark-up by the manufacturer . Rather than marking up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ costs plus associated taxes . This continues at each stage of the supply chain , each level embedding its own tax element as appropriate and applying a mark-up on what is perceived to be the total cost . <p> As a result of this , what are supposed to be single-stage taxes create a compounding effect , which eventually finds its way into the prices of products . <p> A future tax system ? <p> On to the crux of the matter -- what is the most efficient way to tax transactions relating to goods and services ? Should businesses be made to bear these taxes ? Or should consumption be taxed ? These certainly require a lot more deliberation . In the meantime , some enhancements and simplifications may be needed to address the common concerns of businesses . <p> One possible solution to reduce the cascading effect to businesses is to consolidate the two taxes for exemptions to apply across both frameworks . A single registration system , in which registered persons do not charge each other tax , would mean that the service tax does not become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tax does not become embedded in the supply chain of services . This would greatly reduce the number of exemptions required , making it simpler for businesses across the value chain . <p> The definitional issues in service tax are more challenging . One plausible way to reduce definitions is to move to a model where all services are subject to service tax but at a lower rate , with specific exemptions given for essential services such as life insurance , education and healthcare . With a reduced rate , the cost to the rakyat could be maintained but the definitional issues would be vastly reduced . <p> While these may not be the only solutions to the issues of the sales tax and service tax , they deserve to be part of the conversation as to how Malaysia should move forward with indirect taxes . This may be a difficult issue to address but a necessary one to help promote transparent growth for the nation while enhancing confidence in our tax system . <p> Raja Kumaran is head of indirect tax and Tim Simpson is director at PricewaterhouseCoopers Taxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

However , certain trade-offs on economic growth could be expected in the short term . <p> The SPV 2030 , a road map for the country 's development with the primary aim of providing for a decent standard of living to all Malaysians by 2030 , was launched on Saturday by Prime Minister Tun Dr Mahathir Mohamad . <p> " Malaysia is now at a critical juncture as its aspiration of becoming a developed high-income country by 2023 is being challenged by many structural impediments and weaknesses domestically as well as increasing complexity in the external environment , " said executive director of Socio-Economic Research Centre Lee Heng Guie . <p> In dealing with the various structural issues and weaknesses in the economy , decisive and bold reforms will be needed in ensuring sustainable and inclusive economic growth in the longer term . <p> Lee added that while implementing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic growth may be unavoidable in the short term . As such , adequate social protection measures should be in place to cushion the vulnerable groups . <p> The SPV has three developmental objectives : i ) restructuring the economy towards a progressive , knowledge-based and inclusive community ; ii ) addressing inequalities ( wealth and income disparities ) , which aim to narrow the economic gap between different income household groups , between ethnic groups and between regional development ; and iii ) building a united , prosperous and dignified Malaysia . <p> " SPV 2030 , in my view , is a good plan but the key always lies in the execution of the plan . We have no lack of good plan and focus in IMP3 2006-2020 ( Industrial Masterplan 3 ) but the real gross domestic product ( GDP ) growth will likely come in at an average of 4.9% a year , falling short of the plan 's target of 6.3% . It is the same as in IMP2 but given a boost via the Economic Transformation Programme ( ETP ) in 2010 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ETP and the SPV 2030 comes just in time to rejuvenate the growth , if it can be executed efficiently , " said RHB Research Institute 's chief Asean economist Peck Boon Soon . <p> He added that the way to drive the 15 key economic activities identified in the plan must be set out clearly . <p> " In my view , there is no easy way out but to gear towards exports given Malaysia 's small market that will limit its growth potential . It is a tough road to pursue but it is necessary if we want to move our income up , " he said , adding that the success of an export-oriented policy needs to be led by big corporations in terms of both foreign direct investments and domestic direct investments . <p> Such a policy must be supported by a pool of skilled labour that is educated and prepared for Industry 4.0 , artificial intelligence and Big Data . <p> " This is also a tough task as the process will take time to yield the right results , " said Peck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , namely the compensation of employees at 48% of GDP . <p> " The target of a 4.7% average GDP growth is also slightly on the optimistic side given the humongous task in executing the plan , " he added . <p> The SPV 2030 report highlights a number of glaring structural economic weaknesses and economic gap , which not only would impede the country 's future economic development and income advancement but also challenge the country 's goal of achieving sustainable economic prosperity , said Lee . <p> Some of the weaknesses include Malaysian industries ' low to medium value-add and the low adoption of high technology , uneven distribution of economic development , low income and wage inequality among workers , widening the rich-poor income gap , uneven urban-rural , east and west coast developments , concerns over rising foreign equity ownership and bumiputera agenda . <p> " The report acknowledges that corruption and abuse of power had stifled economic growth and distribution of wealth . Over a period of 20 years ( 1996-2015 ) , there was RM1.1 trillion worth of government procurement for development , supplies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awarded to bumiputeras . Still , the bumiputera SMEs ' ( small and medium enterprises ) contribution to GDP was below 9% in 2015 , " Lee said . <p> This reflected significant flaws of the affirmative action policies to drive the bumiputera economic empowerment agenda . The pervasive and entrenched corrupt practices as well as distribution of leakages in the supply chain had not improved the conditions of the bumiputeras as was intended , he added . <p> " This calls for a radical and bold revamp of the policy to ensure that public resources are efficiently distributed to achieve the intended outcome , giving fair opportunities to those having abilities and competencies to deliver , and not to those who take a free ride on public procurement , including contracts , APs ( approved permits ) and government grants to make quick gains , " Lee said in a written statement . <p> On government procurement , he proposed a centralised agency to oversee its procurement projects and contracts . It should also monitor the performance of the bumiputeras ' involvement in the implementation of projects . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure better governance of the public procurement and the deserving ones will be given the opportunities , " he said , adding that public procurement is most vulnerable to corruption . <p> Meanwhile , translating economic growth to be shared among all Malaysians requires a host of supply side ( type of investment , industry , job skill set and technology adoption ) and income-based ( productivity-linked compensation , strong purchasing power , manageable cost of living , stable prices and supply of necessities ) measures to provide the means and opportunities for all to participate in the development process , Lee said . <p> Among other things , the government should also consider providing fiscal incentives for firms that provide benefits to workers to meet the living wage standards . For example , double-tax deduction for transport allowance and other cost of living adjustments for the lower salaried employees , he added . <p> Boosting shared prosperity will also require concerted efforts to strengthen a healthy and stable as well as fiscal sustainable social contract , particularly in the area of promoting equality of opportunity , improved opportunities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulnerable . <p> " This can be achieved through a specific structure of taxation system and income-related benefits , expenditures and targeted social programmes on needs-based rather than a race-based policy , both in content and actual implementation .

" We have a decuplet of one family and a decuplet of another family that are going to space .

There will also be other mouse control groups on the ground that do n't live in the ISS simulator or eat the controlled space diet . <p> Every two weeks , astronauts on the ISS and scientists on Earth will take stool samples from all of the mice to compare their excrement . They 'll also keep tabs on how much the bodies of the mice in space are changing relative to their peers on Earth , using a special mass-measurement device that does n't rely on gravity . <h> Studying twins helps scientists pinpoint what space does to the body <p> This is n't the first time that NASA has compared a twin on the ground to a sibling in space . <p> caption <p> Scott Kelly , left , and his identical twin brother Mark Kelly . <p> source <p> Getty Images/Bill Ingalls/NASA <p> When astronaut Scott Kelly spent a year in space , scientists kept close tabs on the changes happening inside his body and compared that information to his identical brother Mark , who was back on Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one key way , according to Vitaterna . <p> " The human twin study was one pair of twins , so the mouse study is statistically better powered , " she said , adding that the Kelly brothers ' results left unanswered questions that the mice could help solve . <p> For example , Scott Kelly 's gut bacteria changed , but the scientists are n't sure how much of that was just due to differences in diet . So the mice will have much stricter laboratory controls over what they eat than the men did . <p> The scientists hope that any new information about how the mouse gut changes in space will inform future treatments they give astronauts or even people on Earth . <p> " If we understand , ' oh , this intervention helps protect the microbiome , which in turn helps protect the immune system and metabolism , ' that 's useful information -- not just for space , " Vitaterna said . " It 's not like stress is just a space flight thing , people here have stress as well . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after years of persistence through failure and frustration . <p> source <p> Hollis Johnson/Business Insider <p> GOAT is the world 's largest resale marketplace for high-end sneakers , and is valued at $250 million . <p> Its cofounder and CEO Eddy Lu spent more than 10 years creating and leading failed startups and business projects before achieving success . <p> He credits struggles -- and even fights -- with his cofounder Daishin Sugano in their early days of working together to their current efficient workflow and mutual understanding . <p> For more than a decade , Eddy Lu tried to find the next big thing : 99-cent smartphone apps , golf apparel , Japanese desserts . They all flopped , but he was n't headed back to the Wall Street world he left . <p> Then he got into high-end sneakers with an online marketplace called GOAT -- as in " Greatest of All Time , " as they say in sports and rap . And in 2015 , on Black Friday , GOAT blew up . It could n't keep up , and thousands of orders went unfilled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he finally had something worth fighting for . <p> He told us what that was like , in an episode of Business Insider 's podcast , " Success ! how I Did It " : " We responded to every single customer-service message . I think there were about 4,500 that day . But at that point it was better to be hated than unknown . " <p> Today GOAT is the world 's largest sneaker-resale market . It has over $100 million in funding , 7 million users , more than 300 employees , and 400,000 pairs for sale . It raised its latest round of funding at a valuation of $250 million , according to Recode . Earlier this year , it merged with the retail store Flight Club , an iconic reseller in the sneakerhead world , and one that can provide GOAT with the international reach it needs to scale . <p> Lu 's cofounder , Daishin Sugano , has been with him for every failed startup . And Lu says it 's thanks to him -- and a pair of counterfeit sneakers -- that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My cofounder , he 's a huge sneaker enthusiast . He started buying sneakers when his dad bought him his first pair of Jordans , the Jordan 5 Grapes , back in the day . <p> Rich Feloni : Yeah , with the purple in them . <p> Lu : Yeah . And 23 years later , because Michael Jordan 's number is 23 , they rereleased the Jordan 5 Grapes . He went on eBay , bought a pair , and he got them , and they just did n't feel right . They turned out to be fake . He tried to ask the seller for his money back ; he tried to contact eBay . It 's just an onerous process . We were just , like , " We could build a really great app to help clean up this market . " So we built GOAT . <h> Dropping everything to build anything <p> Feloni : At what point in your life did you realize you wanted to be an entrepreneur ? <p> Lu : After my aspiring basketball career ended . The Lakers did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I had a network of lemonade stands when I was a kid or anything like that . <p> Feloni : So you 're not falling into that mythology there , no ? <p> Lu : For me , I always liked building things , and that 's why I did computer science . I graduated in 2003 when CS was n't in favor . It was after the dot-com bust , and it was just because I liked building things that I wanted to do computer science . I went into the corporate life . I was a consultant . I was an analyst at Lehman Brothers when that still existed . <p> Feloni : Why did you get into finance if you got a computer-science degree ? <p> Lu : I never wanted to do hardcore programming . I did like building businesses , and thinking about new problems . But going into corporate life , I realized I 'm not a good employee , to be honest . Every night , and this is back to when I worked at Lehman , I became roommates with Daishin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what we could build on the side , what we could do , how to create a new business . It was n't a startup back then , it was just , " Let 's create a new business while we 're young . " <p> Feloni : Why ? What do you think drove you to say that ? <p> caption <p> Lu and his cofounder Daishin Sugano have been building businesses together since 2007 . <p> source <p> GOAT <p> Lu : I do n't know . Besides the fact that we always wanted more , for some reason . I left my job in consulting to do banking because I was just kind of bored . It just was n't stimulating , so I thought doing a banking job would be a lot more rewarding and challenging . There was a lot more work , but it still was n't challenging to me and us . We just kept talking about other ideas on the side . Working corporate jobs like that , demanding corporate jobs , it 's really hard to try to do another business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the same day in 2007 . We were just , like , " Let 's just quit and figure it out . " Much to the chagrin of our parents . My dad was very happy I had a Lehman Brothers job . But we just did n't feel like it was right . We wanted to try something while we were young , so we just quit and started to do stuff . Thankfully Daishin is a designer ; I was a developer . That was when the iPhone just came out , so we built a bunch of those 99-cent apps . <p> Feloni : Like games and stuff ? <p> Lu : Games . Little apps . Little to-do apps . All those types of things to just start our startup journey . That 's where we started , and we just never looked back , thankfully . It 's been a long , painful , meandering road to GOAT . <p> Feloni : Do you think that you and Daishin would have quit your jobs cold turkey had you guys not had these conversations ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been in your life ? <p> Lu : Having a cofounder you can trust is so important . You hear it all the time ; it 's really hard to start a startup by yourself . I 've seen it through the years , and believe me , Daishin and I have worked through our issues . We 're an old , married couple now , but in the beginning , we had physical fights , we 've thrown each other to the ground , there was this one time at a restaurant , I remember . We had a disagreement about some business term , and we were yelling at each other at the restaurant -- people were looking at us . He got up and walked away , and I kept on barking at him , walking out the door . We totally forgot to pay . We just walked out the door all mad at each other . But we knew that , just right after that , we were just like , " OK , let 's just focus again . Let 's just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really built the company . Resilience is another one of our core values , and it 's because we were able to bounce back so quickly from setbacks . Thankfully , since we 've been together , and worked through all those issues for so long , now that we 're doing GOAT it 's just so much easier . We know our lanes , we know what each other 's good at , and we just can execute . <p> Feloni : Yeah , and in the early years , when you were learning ... you had a bunch of odd businesses like golf apparel , those phone apps , high-end tea , the Japanese cream puff things . What were you trying to accomplish ? Were you just throwing things at the wall and seeing what stuck ? <p> Lu : What 's funny about the cream-puff franchise is that we were building startups on the side , iPhone apps , stuff like that . We were just , like , " Hey , this is a cool , single product . Easy to do concept . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Feloni : When was this ? <p> Lu : This was right about ' 07 , ' 08 , when we decided to do these things . We were just , like , " This could be great passive income , because we could just put some money in , hire some good managers , and they can operate the stores , and we can have passive income while we build our startup dream . " Nothing is ever passive , if you know about the food-service industry . It quickly went from a passive income to something that was pretty hands-on . Especially during the ' 08 downturn when things were going down . We operated the store a lot ; we worked the store . A lot of friends are always saying , " Oh , I would love to own a coffee shop or a restaurant someday . " For me it 's just , like , no , do n't ever do that , because the chance for success is so hard , we quickly learned . Thankfully , we did it while we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no exponential growth , so it 's like you just have to put in capital , you might make a little bit of money , chances are you wo n't . We learned that tough lesson for those few years because we were in it , it was not passive , we were spending probably 80% of our time doing that , and 20% working on a startup . After a few years , we sold some , we dissolved some , and we just moved on because we just had to cut our losses . It was a great learning lesson while we were young . <p> Feloni : Why do you think you have that resilience ? <p> Lu : Me , personally ? I 'm pretty stubborn , I guess . Yeah , I do n't know . I was pretty independent growing up . My parents did n't pay for college , they did n't pay for my car ; I just kind of had to figure things out when I was growing up . We had a middle-class upbringing . I just had to figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think just because of that , I 've been pretty stubborn and focused on really making sure things work . <p> Feloni : Was there ever a moment when you questioned what you were doing and wondered , " Do I need to go back to an office job ? " <p> Lu : How many thousands of moments are we talking about ? When we were doing the cream-puff franchise , and it was ' 09 when the economy was n't good , and we were in debt . Every kind of debt possible . I was in credit-card debt , in debt to my ex-girlfriend , my girlfriend at the time . It was a lot of pain . I would wake up in the middle of the night with just pangs of guilt , and I was scared , yeah . I do n't think Daishin and I ever thought we ... To be honest , going back to a big corporate job just was probably worse than that . I dreaded every Sunday afternoon when I was working at a big corporate job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole entrepreneurship journey . I just think it was not going be in the cards . I think we were just foolish and stupid , but we just thought we would just figure it out . <h> Getting to GOAT <p> Feloni : Before you got to GOAT , when you were building GrubWithUs , you raised $7 million for that , right ? <p> Lu : Yes . <p> Feloni : By the time that you pivoted to GOAT , did n't you have only a million dollars left ? <p> Lu : Yeah . It was a fun journey . We had investors at that point , and we pivoted a couple of times . A few of our investors were antsy , they wanted us to get acqui-hired , they wanted us to return the money . We tried a few times and we did n't work . We did those acqui-hire meetings . We talked to different companies . But again , we just did n't want to be a middle manager at some random company . To be honest , Daishin will be the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard when we had those acqui-hire conversations because we knew that we wanted to just keep going . At a certain point , we made a decision , and we told our board , " Hey , we have one last go . We 're going to try something . " <p> Feloni : So he pitched it first ? <p> Lu : Daishin complained to me a lot about the fake Grape purchase that he had . We looked into the sneaker market , and we did n't know if it was a big enough opportunity at the time . The recent trend is a lot of kids , and especially males , care a lot more about fashion . They 're buying street wear , they 're buying sneakers . But back then , we were just like , " Oh , it 's kind of a still , a smaller market . " So we thought about the idea , we put it on the side , and our board member , Greg , at the time , he used to work at eBay . One day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey , do you guys know anything about sneakers ? " We were like , " Yeah . " And he said sneakers are one of the few categories that 's growing . People do n't collect baseball cards anymore , Magic cards , stamps , coins . But sneakers were a collectible that was growing . So we decided to look into it even further , in collaboration with Greg . We were just like , " Hey , we could build this and do something . " That 's how GOAT was born . <p> caption <p> A GOAT employee inspects a pair of Adidas Yeezys to verify their authenticity before they can be sold in the marketplace . <p> source <p> GOAT <p> Feloni : Was this your last shot ? <p> Lu : I do n't think it would 've been the last shot . We would 've figured out a way to keep going . <p> Feloni : Daishin started as a sneaker fan , but you did n't personally ? <p> Lu : I 've always liked sneakers , but I was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . He definitely was the enthusiast . <p> Feloni : When you go into a space like this , where there are so many obsessive fans , when you 're just starting out , just entering into it , how are you able to offer an authentic experience for people who take this culture so seriously if you were initially coming in as an outsider ? <p> Lu : Daishin had all the product knowledge , so he 's our head of product . He 's really been driving it . But it was pretty painful in the beginning still . We launched in July 2015 , publicly . There was a day in late September , it was about 6 p.m. , we still did n't have a sale that whole day . I went in and bought a pair to tell the team , " Hey , guys . We got a sale . " It definitely was not easy going . It 's a two-sided marketplace . There 's a lot of stuff that has to happen for you to be able to scale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this market . If you look at our site today , it looks like a retail-like experience , where you only see stock photos . It 's a big deviation from the past sneaker marketplaces , especially places like eBay , where you see the seller photos and all these bad and crappy photos that they take . We decided to make it a retail-like experience , because we wanted people to trust GOAT as the single source of truth for authenticity . You do n't have to trust the seller for authenticity . Actually , a lot of people in the sneaker market were n't fans of that . Big sneaker influencers in the industry emailed us and said , " Hey , not sure if this is the best way to go , because we really want see the pictures of these sneakers before we buy . " We just had a point of view . We said , " No , this is how the future of the sneaker market 's going to be , where you want to trust us so that there 's as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went against some of our friends in the sneaker industry . <p> Feloni : It was a matter of surrounding yourself with the people in the community , but also knowing when to just stick to your own guns ? <p> Lu : Yeah , and the inflection point happened Black Friday 2015 . It was funny : Our head of marketing , Sen , it was a week before Black Friday , and he was just , like , " Hey , why do n't we create a Black Friday promo ? " And we 're like , " Of course , just throw something up . " We did n't think anything of it ; it was just something else we were going to try for growth . We decided to discount all the hottest styles of the year ; it was the first year of the Yeezy Turtle Dove , the Supreme 5s . But we said , " Hey , let 's discount the 12 hottest styles of the year to retail prices . " We put it out there , and the whole internet thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had sub-100 pairs , but we gained over 100,000 users because of the promo . Every single influential blog picked it up . Complex , Hypebeast , Highsnobiety . Our servers crashed every single day because we 've never had scale before . This was the first time we 've had scale . I was one of the back-end developers back then , and we never cached any pages , we never optimized queries . It was just such a painful week up until Black Friday . But on Black Friday , as you can imagine , it was so painful because 100,000 users tried to access our app . It just did n't work , and we got so much hate mail and hate Instagrams . I 'll show you it later . A comment per second : " F -- you . " " Screw this app . " All this stuff , and it was a pretty traumatic experience , because we disappointed 100,000 people , when only a few dozen people got shoes . We had this whole apology tour . We responded to every single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day . We just did n't know what happened . But at that point it was better to be hated than unknown . Even though it was so traumatic , I would 've done it a thousand times over , because it was that inflection point in our business where people were upset , but they started to realize our value proposition . It 's , " Hey , GOAT is this place where I do n't have to worry about getting fakes because they authenticate my sneakers . " We turned it from something that was bad into something that was good , because we started to educate them about the market , and us , and the industry . What 's funny is that to this day we get some random messages that say , " I have n't forgotten about that Black Friday yet . " But also we have a couple employees from that . One of our earliest customer-service managers , she participated in that event , and because of all that commotion , she was , like , " I can probably help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joined us . She 's still with us today . <p> Feloni : Why do you think it is that the sneaker industry , the collectible styles , the more exotic ones , why do you think it 's been so big in the last several years , 10 years even ? <p> Lu : I just think when I was a kid , and you would go to a Foot Locker and say , " Hey , I want these Jordan 1s . " And they 'd be like , " Oh , sorry , we do n't have your size , but we have these Pippins for you if you want them . " It was just like , " Oh , I 'm just gon na play basketball . OK , fine . Let me get these Pippins . " This day and age , people crave individuality , and people know what they want . Today , if you walk into a retailer , and they do n't have the exact thing that you want , you 're going to turn away , you 're going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . I just think that , given that people crave individuality , they crave fashion , they want to be unique , they come to us because of that . You do n't want to just go to the store and just get whatever they have left . <p> Feloni : Do you see it as a trend ? <p> Lu : Yeah , I definitely think it 's a growing trend , just because guys have n't cared about fashion for so long . There are a bunch of people , the sneaker enthusiast and the fashion enthusiast , who were the self-starters of that trend , first movers . Now guys are just more fashionable now . They care about what they wear , and it 's going to be a trend that lasts a long time . <p> Feloni : You were the first to market with offering this kind of online marketplace for buyers and sellers , get shoes authenticated . <p> Lu : We were n't exactly the first to market . Flight Club , which has been around for 13 years , started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they expanded to LA . They have a huge web presence as well , and they really pioneered this industry . Thankfully , we had the opportunity to merge GOAT and Flight Club together earlier this year , to really create the largest marketplace in the world . It 's really from their knowledge and tutelage that GOAT even existed , because we saw that there was a demand for this category in this industry , in terms of resale sneakers . For us , we really looked up to them . I think we have a different vision than some of the other people . We are focusing on sneakers right now . Other companies have gone and said , " Handbags , watches , things like that . " For us , sneakers first ; let 's build the best and most recognizable sneaker company . Let 's build our brand . It 's because when we did GrubWithUs , one lesson that we learned was that we tried to open so many cities at once . We opened in Chicago , Dallas , Austin , LA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city right before we tried to expand into all these other cities . We kind of spread ourselves so thin that we just were n't able to execute anything well . For us , we 've barely scratched the surface in terms of selling sneakers . We 're still a small player in the sneaker space . Our ideal vision is to be the sneaker market for everyone . So it 's not just people who are buying Yeezys , but it 's people who just wan na buy that pair of runners or that pair of basketball shoes to wear . We want to service the whole market , and since we 've barely scratched the surface , we want to focus on sneakers before we even think about going into other categories . <h> Resilience above all <p> Feloni : What do you think the biggest challenge of your career has been ? <p> Lu : I think one of the biggest challenges was winding down all the cream-puff shops that we had . It was not fun . We honestly owed a bunch of money , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products , we had investors that we had to , unfortunately say , " Hey , we lost all your money . " Yeah , it was just a big learning lesson into the types of businesses we wanted to create in the future . We never wanted to do something where we were restricted in terms of our vision because it was just much better to set our own path . I think , even though it was a really tough lesson , again , it 's one of those things , I think , Daishin and I would 've done over , even though it was our most challenging thing , because we learned so much from off-roading that franchise . <p> Feloni : How did you pull yourself out of that ? <p> Lu : It took a long , long time , just slowly repaying people . I repaid that ex I was talking about over the years , and just repaid the state , repaid a bunch of those debts . It took a while to wind out , but thankfully , like I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull ourselves out of it . I 'm so glad it was n't one of those things where you retire and then you 're like , " Hey , I want to open up a coffee shop . " Then you put all money into it , and it does n't work , and you have to go back to work because of it . So thankfully we were young and could afford to repay it . <p> Feloni : How do you personally define success ? <p> Lu : For me , success is really just happiness and freedom . I think with success comes those , naturally . I think as long as you have the freedom to do what you want and you 're enjoying every single day , that 's pretty successful . <p> Feloni : Yeah . What 's next for you ? <p> Lu : People ask us this a lot , you know , " Oh , are you gon na sell your company ? " " What are you gon na do ? " Daishin and I know that starting a startup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We tried for so many years to do that . As long as we 're having fun , as long as we 're successful , we 're going to keep going . It 's not like I have a better idea . I do n't have a better idea , I do n't want to be a middle manager somewhere , so let 's just run this company , run it well , be happy about it , enjoy every single day , and just like build a big business . And that 's what 's next . <p> Feloni : What advice would you give to people who want to have a career like yours ? <p> Lu : Definitely be resilient . I mean , GOAT 's had extreme success , thankfully , but it took a long time to get there , and it 's really easy to give up . It 's really easy to burn out being a startup founder . Thankfully Daishin and I like I was saying are pretty foolish and stupid and never gave up and just kept going , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to get it right on the first time . Or the second time . Or the third time . I think , you know , for us and our team , we 're just executors . We , for me , my belief is , let 's try something , and if it does n't work , we can always change . I mean , yeah , it 's not heart surgery , so I 'm always willing to try something as long as there 's a good hypothesis around it . I 'm not the type of person where you do a ton of research and then you create a 50-page deck to start something . It 's really ... and the people who thrive on our team , our executive team , are people who just kind of get stuff done . And so it 's just , " Hey , we have a hypothesis -- it 's grounded in some data-driven thought , it 's grounded in some gut feeling . Let 's try it . If it does n't work , let 's try something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given up . Just because there 's always something to try . So let 's just keep going . <p> Feloni : It seems like you 've already been in a situation where the worst-case scenario came true , right ? <p> " Fortnite : Battle Royale 's " newest limited-time mode was taken offline shortly after launch this week , after an influx of players caused the game 's matchmaking systems to crash . <p> Developers at Epic Games have said the mode will be brought back online " as soon as possible , " but have not provided any estimation for when it will happen . <p> When it eventually comes back online , " Playground Mode " will be the game 's first non-competitive practice arena , which will allow players to take a break from the fast-paced battle-royale formula by roaming through the island with up to three of their friends . <p> " Fortnite : Battle Royale " creators launched the game 's first non-competitive mode this week , only to have the influx of players crash the entire game for several hours , forcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Epic Games first announced they would be introducing " Playground Mode " early this week , fans and streamers went wild .

@@41466240 <p> Now , obviously a lot of people will be drawing comparisons with the Geely Binyue , which will form the basis of Proton 's next SUV , widely tipped to be called the X50 . So we decided to answer your imminent questions once and for all by directly comparing the specifications of these two vehicles , the starting points for two of the most hotly-anticipated cars from our national carmakers . <p> Firstly , some housekeeping is in order . While both of these cars will be entry-level SUVs , just like the larger Aruz and X70 , they will occupy different and distinctly separate segments of the market -- so this is n't an apples-to-apples comparison . Judging by the numbers and data alone , the Perodua will be significantly smaller and almost certainly cheaper than the more sophisticated Proton . <p> Click to enlarge <p> It should also be noted that the specifications and equipment listed here are specific to the home markets of Daihatsu/Toyota and Geely , and hence are subject to change -- particularly in terms of powertrains and safety kit . Lastly , to give some perspective , we 're also including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , as well as the Aruz and X70 . <p> Now , let 's get down to business . The Rocky/Raize is sized closer to A-segment norm , measuring a hair under four metres long and 1.7 metres wide . The Binyue , on the other hand , is in proper B-segment territory , being a whopping 335 mm longer and over 100 mm wider . The Geely is also longer in terms of wheelbase ( 2,600 mm versus 2,525 mm ) , while its lower height ( 1,609 mm versus 1,620 mm ) adds to its overtly sporty look . <p> The Binyue 's increased dimensions should translate to greater room inside , as well as a larger boot ( Geely does n't quote boot space ) . The Japanese cars counter that by having a false floor that can be removed to reveal a deep well -- which can be used to hold houseplants and other tall items -- although Perodua 's version will probably have a full-sized spare wheel residing within that well instead . <p> The Binyue is also better equipped , available with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a panoramic sunroof , dual-zone climate control , an air purifier and a power-adjustable driver 's seat . And while the other cars get a nine-inch touchscreen with Apple CarPlay functionality , the Binyue adds a 10.25-inch display outfitted with the Geely Key User Interface ( GKUI ) and the much-vaunted voice control system . <p> Safety-wise , both cars are available with the prerequisite six airbags and stability control , plus an assortment of driver assistance systems . Both get autonomous emergency braking and adaptive cruise control , but only the Binyue has lane keeping assist for Level 2 semi-autonomous driving capability , as well as blind spot monitoring and a full park assist system ( the Rocky/Raize twins only provide steering assistance ) . But it 's not all bad for the other two , as they get the pedal misapplication control feature that 's missing on the Geely . <p> The powertrain is another area where the Binyue scores highly against the Rocky/Raize . Even the base 1.0 litre turbocharged three-cylinder is significantly more muscular compared to the equivalent engine in the others -- with 134 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 37 hp and 65 Nm more . In China , this engine is only available with a six-speed manual gearbox , whereas the Daihatsu/Toyota are offered only with a CVT . <p> Interiors of the Toyota Raize ( left ) and Geely Binyue ( right ) <p> Step up to the 174 hp/255 Nm 1.5 litre unit -- developed in conjunction with Volvo , no less -- and the gulf grows to 77 hp and 115 Nm , and you also gain the option of a seven-speed dual-clutch transmission . This is the most likely engine and gearbox option to be offered over in Malaysia , although China also has a plug-in hybrid model that we 've not listed here . <p> As for Perodua , the 1.0 litre turbo mill is very much a possibility , but this being a conservative company , we 're expecting it to replace it with either the 1.5 litre naturally-aspirated four-pot from the Myvi and Aruz ( paired to a four-speed automatic gearbox ) or the hybrid system that was teased at the Kuala Lumpur International Motor Show ( KLIMS ) last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive system offered in Japan . <p> This being such an early stage for both the Perodua and Proton models , there 's no pricing information as yet , but these cars are expected to be significantly cheaper than both the Aruz and the X70 , which retail from RM72,900 to RM77,900 and from RM99,800 to RM123,800 respectively . So what do you think of these two cars , and which would you get with your own money ? Sound off in the comments section after the jump . <p> After trying to pursue a career in product design , Jonathan Lee decided to make the sideways jump into the world of car journalism instead . He therefore appreciates the aesthetic appeal of a car , but for him , the driving experience is still second to none . <p> Proton game over quality is bad , especially X50 that is a Chinese rebadged SUV and we can expect the car to have multiple breakdowns . Better to buy game changing Perodua because Perodua makes quality car for everyone , unlike Proton cars that become junk after 10 years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous vehicle on the road , driver and passenger will not survive after the accident . Furthermore , ride will be very terrible just like Aruz . Those who say that this DULAN crap is a game changer are really brainless . Do they want more people in Malaysia journey to the west ? <p> All these while we have been dumping groung for Japan be it the ori stuff or rebadge with super premium price ... its nice to be ' dumped ' by another country . Surprisingly what China dumped us with is well equipped with what the we allow Japan to dumped us with . <p> I vouch for this . I 've been calculating my bezza 1.0 FC recently and the best I can get is about 16km/L and that 's mostly on highway roads doing constant 80-90km/h . City can only get max 14km/L .. but if I ever reach 20+ , I 'll showoff do n't worry lol <p> I predict that Proton will not " RUSH " to launch X50 . It 's gon na be their strategy to make people wait and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . See like X70 , Perodua does n't seem to have any " plans " on bringing in their own SUV so quickly but the X70 hype creating unrest amongst them ; maybe after some reliable source saying how good the X70 is . Then suddenly the arrival of Aruz . I admit the price is tempting but sometimes we need a two three step upgrade from our current ride ... So , Aruz is just an upgrade of a Myvi while X70 is plying its trade amongst the big name SUVs . But whatever LOL <p> My gosh Honda ... to be specific Honda Malaysia . Its all ' N/A ' in the spec list . Will Honda Malaysia becomes the next Toyota Malaysia in term of sales figure ? History ( or Toyota ) have shown that if one fail to adapt/change , failure is to follow . <p> since when we started to compare a Toyota the worlds most valuable brand to a chinese car ? please do nt lower your standards by doing so . Geely is not close to Koreans in specs and prestige and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy is produa d55L , .. IF THE ENGINE IS 1.0 TURBOCHARGER , .. BECAUSE , .. PERODUA never produced any turbocharger engine yet . Wthell , .. if the engine still same like myvi and aruz , .... I redther put my money to proton x50 . PERODUA should prefer turbocharger engine here in malaysia . How come they just depending of NA engine only ? We waiting so long for the PERODUA produced turbocharger engine . I been sick dreaming about it . <p> Perodua can only fight back with Price , Better sound system 8 speakers + 1 Subwoofer JBL ? ( Now a days aftermarket android player 9/10 inch very cheap already ) . Is time , Perodua offer us Malaysian with better and New technology , not Old under power 1.5L NA 4 SPEED AUTO . ( Minimum 5 speed auto if 1.5L NA , still acceptable ) <p> Ca n't compare Aruz with X70 , different segment , spec and price . Aruz is a brilliant strategy model by P2 to gain market share ; 7 seated SUV with affordable price tag , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Aruz will be its powertrains and 4spd AT . <p> Perodua will use CVT ? Good luck to the buyer and good bye from me , Perodua ! I 'll take X50 any days since engine co-developed with Volvo but not X70 ( purely Geely ) even though they did drive from China to UK to prove their engine .

However , with occupiers ' corporate real estate strategy now seeking greater lease flexibility ; companies looking to maintain a contented and productive workforce ; and employees striving for an attractive and appealing workplace experience , CBRE believes a fundamentally different approach is required . <p> In its Asia Pacific Research report on " The hotelisation of office space : New approaches to future-proofing commercial portfolios " , the real estate services and investment firm pointed out that office space is moving towards consumerisation and hotelisation . <p> This is mainly due to advances in technology , a more mobile workforce and uncertain economic growth , which are reshaping the business environment and transforming the occupier approach to real estate decision-making . <p> Moreover , unpredictable business cycles and irregular headcount growth have also led to the need for more short-term space that offers tenants the option to rapidly " flex up " or " flex down " , it added . <p> " As occupiers ' requirements , expectations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . This new paradigm requires property owners to adopt a fundamentally different approach to leasing and asset management . <p> " Rather than simply filling up a building with tenants on conventional long-term leases , landlords striving to achieve a competitive advantage can offer a blend of traditional space , flexible space and turn-key solutions , supported by a comprehensive set of amenities , leading-edge technology and personalised human-delivered services , " the CBRE report said ( see Figure 1 ) . <p> It noted that although some landlords are experimenting with a range of new strategies to differentiate their properties beyond the traditional selling points of specification , location and accessibility , many are still struggling to devise an effective response to the changing landscape in the office property sub-sector . <p> However , if the landlords can adopt a more proactive approach and take on a more service-oriented role to transit away from just being pure space providers , they could enjoy improved tenant retention , higher rents and create future-proof portfolios . <p> Here are a few tips for office building owners from CBRE . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious starting point is to capitalise on the flexible space trend . CBRE 's 2018 Asia Pacific Investor Intentions Survey found that about half of landlords and investors believed that allocating no more than 20% of a building to flexible space could enhance its value . <p> Indeed , securing flexible space operators as tenants is the most direct approach while other options include " hotel-like " characteristics that provide fully-fitted " plug and play " offices that are leased to and managed on behalf of tenants . <p> However , landlords must closely evaluate the profitability of individual operators and obtain greater covenant protection such as higher rental deposits and corporate guarantees . <p> Regardless of the way in which landlords opt to respond to the agile revolution , the solutions listed above ultimately point to the need for assets that provide a blend of traditional and flexible options , enabling tenants to access a network of different spaces on demand . <p> That said , landlords must also be mindful of allocating the optimal proportion of a building to flexible spaces . <p> 2 Offer curated experiences <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad range of amenities and supporting services . <p> In addition to basics such as parking space and F&amp;B , CBRE 's 2018 Global Tenant Survey 2018 ( Figure 2 ) found that office occupiers in Asia Pacific are increasingly demanding conference and meeting management services , gym and fitness spaces , and other wellness facilities . <p> A few progressive landlords are now offering hotel-like services and amenities such as concierge service , dedicated tenant lounges , on-site F&amp;B and wellness programmes This requires a balance between catering to tenants ' expectations and the increased costs in designing , building and managing high-quality amenities . <p> By providing an environment in which going to work becomes a curated experience , landlords can begin to operate their offices as if it were a full-service hotel . In many respects , therefore , the landlord 's primary customer is the employee , and no longer the tenant . <p> 3 Integrate wellness into building design <p> Although wellness is not a new concept in the workplace and many companies already have office wellness programmes in place , it has only recently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ design should consider ways in which to enhance the health and productivity of building occupants .

However , while much of the conversation around tenant engagement platforms invariably focuses on their technological sophistication and efficiency , many platforms overlook the importance of genuine human interaction , particularly in service delivery . <p> For tenant engagement platforms to be truly effective , they must be integrated with people services .

Co-living also enables sustainable lifestyles through sharing and efficient use of resources and spaces . <p> L.ve Space is one of the latest entrants in the co-living space scene in Malaysia . Its maiden project is a quaint dwelling nestled in the bustling commercial district in Taman Tun Dr Ismail ( TTDI ) , Kuala Lumpur . <p> Its vision is to foster a sense of connectivity and community among urban Malaysians while offering a space close to the city and their workplaces . <p> And that means L.ve TTDI is highly accessible and surrounded by amenities . It is situated on the second floor of a shoplot on Persiaran Zaaba with a bar on the ground floor and plenty of F&amp;B outlets along the same row . <p> The 1,800 sq ft shoplot is rented by L.ve Space and was handed over to them in mid-July .

" We believe living in the city should be fun and fulfilling . So we think about breathing life into the usually dull spaces . We think beyond the aesthetics of the space to make it the most comfortable for interaction . <p> " Finally we endeavour to make our spaces self-contained with all the trappings needed to provide a comfortable living environment , " relays Chua . <p> On tenant screening and selection , he says : " We look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to us .

This rate could be subject to revision in the future . <p> " We are targeting RM1,000 ( per month ) . As for longer-term stays , we do allow for one year but with three-month blocks .

@@41544234 <h> PHB plans integrated development in Bukit Bintang <p> SEVERAL buildings in the city centre near Bukit Bintang , built during the British administration , are expected to make way for a multi-billion ringgit integrated development project comprising serviced apartments , offices and a mall . <p> Documents seen by the digitaledge WEEKLY show that Pelaburan Hartanah Bhd ( PHB ) is planning to develop a 6.8-acre site in Jalan Conlay , Kuala Lumpur , which used to house the office of the Kuala Lumpur Regional Centre for Arbitration ( KLRCA ) . <p> The proposed development , located directly opposite Kompleks Kraftangan , includes a 50-storey serviced apartment building and two blocks of 37-storey office suites that will sit atop an eight-storey retail podium and a three-storey basement car park . <p> PHB submitted its planning proposal to Dewan Bandaraya Kuala Lumpur ( DBKL ) for approval last month .

The 85-year-old was gazetted in 1983 as a heritage site under the Antiquities Act 1976 and the National Heritage Act 2005 . <p> According to KLRCA 's newsletter for the third quarter of 2014 , the colonial bungalow on Jalan Conlay had eight rooms that accommodated three arbitration rooms , a library , a reception room , a general office , the secretary 's room and the director 's room . In 1993 , two new counsel rooms were added . <p> " The building was designed as one of the many types of government quarters ( for housing the many government officers in the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vicinity back in 1925-1930 . It is termed a ' colonial house ' since the design uses the Colonialists favoured Palladian and Neo-Classical vocabulary adapted adequately to the climatic requirements of the region .

@@41544237 <h> Making a house a home for a special child <p> PETALING JAYA ( Dec 6 ) : Creating a safe and comfortable home is often a challenge for many parents , especially those with kids that require special care . Many may find it overwhelming and not know where to begin . <p> For architect and mother of two Mumtazah Mustajab , making her house a safe place to live for her children , especially for 13-year-old son Najib who was born with autism , took lots of time and planning . <p> Mumtazah is a director of architecture firm Archisphere Sdn Bhd and one of the council members of the Malaysian Institute of Architects ( PAM ) for the 2019-2020 term where she is chairing the community and social responsibility committee . <p> She and her family live in a double-storey linked house in Taman Melawati , Kuala Lumpur , a neighbourhood with plenty of green outdoor spaces for children to enjoy . They moved here after Najib was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder ( ASD ) at the age of three . <p> In terms of safety for Najib , a number of things were considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other houses is the kitchen counter which was lowered by some 150mm from the normal height of about 90cm to enable the children to use and to learn to clean the dishes , Mumtazah tells EdgeProp.my . <p> " We also took a long time to look for the right furniture and fittings . We had to test them out to ensure everyone in the house will benefit from them , especially Najib . We are very satisfied with the outcome today because we are able to help Najib develop life skills while living happily and safely in this house , " she says . <p> For those who are looking to make their homes friendly to children with autism , Mumtazah offers some tips . <p> 1 Understand the child 's condition and needs <p> The first thing to do is to understand the biological conditions of the child , as no two persons with ASD are the same . Every individual on the autism spectrum has his or her own problems to some degree with social interaction , communication , behavioural and sensory sensitivities which require specific care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extremely sensitive to sound , light , texture , taste and odour which may cause them to become agitated , " she explains . <p> For example , some autistic children can not stand the way certain textures or clothing feels on their bodies , finding it uncomfortable . So , it is best to use furniture , furnishing and flooring in smooth materials , or those that do not contain those specific textures . <p> In other words , there is no one-size-fits-all solution and every aspect must be handled individually , she says . <p> " When designing their home interiors , many parents want to decide on things like colours and furniture , but often forget about what best suits their children , especially those with special needs . <p> " We should fit out the home with the child 's condition in mind and cater to his or her needs , " she reiterates . <p> 2 Clear definition of spaces <p> Spaces in a home should be clearly defined to avoid confusing children with autism . The more things there are in one place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may worsen their condition . For example , do not put toys in a bedroom or eat in a bedroom , says Mumtazah . <p> " You can use a small table or carpet to define each space . At the same time , you need to teach the child what activity should be carried out in certain spaces , " she adds . <p> She also notes that a specific space must be set aside as the child 's personal space . " This is a must-have for a child with autism as it helps them to calm down when needed . Plush toys , bouncing balls , carpeted or timber floors in calming colours can be placed in their personal space . <p> " In Najib 's case , when he needs to calm down , he will go to his space tucked in a corner on the ground floor and calm himself down by hugging the beanbags . Music also helps to calm him down so we put a TV and a radio there as well , " she says . <p> 3 Use simple and calming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white , cream and brown to set a calm and serene tone , making the spaces conducive for Najib to focus on doing a task without getting distracted easily . <p> " We try to keep it very simple and natural when it comes to colour . If there are too many colours , it may be uncomfortable for those who have visual sensory problems , " she says , adding that muted pastel colours are also good choices as a base . <p> " Use colours wisely . For example , red will make you feel hungry , so you can use it in the dining area or kitchen , where you can have some reddish tones . Green can be used in the bedroom as it gives you a feeling of tranquility , " she points out . <p> 4 Be mindful of furniture and fittings <p> As some children with autism have an acute sensitivity to noise , touch or other sense modalities , it is important to keep those sensitivities in mind when it comes to furniture and fittings . <p> Mumtazah 's advice is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I would recommend polyurethane , leather and bamboo furniture as they are safe and easy to clean compared with fabric ones . <p> Parents are advised to cover sharp edges of things in the house to protect the kid from self injury . <p> Choose ceiling fans and other electrical appliances that do not make too much noise , especially when there are children with hypersensitive hearing around . <p> " If your home uses fluorescent lights , cover them with a diffuser as autistic children find the flickering from these lights uncomfortable , " she says . <p> Meanwhile , lever-type water taps and door handles are much easier for the child to use compared with , for example , ball knobs . <p> 5 Budget -- one step at a time <p> If budget is tight , start by purchasing items of priority and save for future purchases . <p> " Be selective , patient and always check your budget , " notes Mumtazah . " Your home may need to change as your child grows . Some furniture may not be suitable anymore after some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to buy better ones . " <p> " When it comes to fittings , sometimes the best ones are not necessarily the most expensive ones .

Compared to the US , medical costs in Malaysia is 65% to 80% lower and this has attracted medical tourists from many countries . Genting 's cool atmosphere and proximity to the KL city centre are plus points for an integrated medical tourism development . <p> " Diversifying product offerings would make the property market in Genting Highlands even more vibrant , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ongoing developments here include Grand Ion Majestic and Celestia Genting Highlands on the hilltop as well as Tropicana Grandhill , Pavilion Genting Highlands , IBN Highlands City , Geo Antharas , Geo Royal and Geo Elite located close to Genting Permai .

For example , the 20-acre IBN Highlands City in Genting Permai will have a retail mall , says Foo . <p> As housing demand is largely driven by tourism and rental , new developments in the area commonly offer fully-furnished units to lure buyers . A few projects such as geo38 Residence , Ion Delemen as well as the upcoming Grand Ion Majestic have even partnered short-term rental management companies to help homeowners rent out their units . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaining popularity and the success of GPO , psf prices of newer high-rise residential developments are catching up with Kuala Lumpur 's prices . <p> Looking at high-rise projects completed in the past five years , there were very limited secondary transactions in 2018 and 2019 while more transactions are seen among the older developments , although the number is still small . <p> Nevertheless , Foo believes the secondary market will slowly gain momentum as more new projects come on stream . <p> Transacted prices of some old apartments have seen a drop between 2017 and 2019 , owing to competition from new supply . However prices of those located close to RWG such as Kayangan Apartment and Ria Apartment are holding up better , while Genting Permai Resort Apartment at the midhill has also seen a 27% increase in average transaction price based on seven transactions across three years .

With all investors eyeing the same target market , rent is very competitive , " Saleha says . <p> Foo concurs and adds that with more supply coming into the market , yields and occupancy rates could become more challenging . <p> " However , I believe that those who have the ability could still buy property here as their holiday homes , because Genting Highlands is one of the top tourism destinations in Malaysia , " he says . <p> In terms of rental yields , Foo says certain apartments offer healthy yields . He cites geo38 Residence which received yields of between 5.1% and 5.76% while data from the National Property Information Centre showed that rental yield of Ion Delemen was 3.7% in 2017 and 2018 . <p> Sulaiman of Rahim &amp; Co points out that the main challenge would be sustaining occupancy and attractiveness to potential tenants and short-stay guests .

Fortunately , Genting Highlands is expected to continue drawing visitors both locally and regionally , " he says . <p> Other concerns among property buyers include the traffic and human congestion that occur during peak seasons as there is only one main access road up and down the hill .
