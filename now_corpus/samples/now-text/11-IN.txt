In the film , Rishi Kapoor plays a Sardar and Akshay 's father . Whereas Akshay 's character ' Gattu ' has short hair , no turban and no beard which are a typical of Sardars . <p> This comes as a surprise moreso with reports that Akki 's character in the film is based on England 's cricketer Monty Panesar . When we probed into the deal , we learnt that the actor did n't want to run into any kind of controversy and hence decided to play a Mona-Sardar in the film . <p> It can be recalled that Akshay faced trouble during ' Singh is Kinng ' when large groups of Sardars staged protests against Akshay for incorrectly portraying a Sardar . This time around to avoid any such undue conflict , Akshay requested director Nikhil Advani @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Mona-Sardar . <p> The script originally had Akshay 's character as a Sardar ; however Akshay explained his predicament to Nikhil . A source close to Akshay reveals , " Akshay did not want to hurt any community 's religious sentiments , and he also did not want to take any risks with ' Patiala House ' . Therefore he requested Nikhil to make necessary changes to the script . " <p> Nikhil too understood Akshay 's situation and readily agreed . The explanation about a Mona-Sardar in a Sikh family will be shown in a sequence where Gattu 's parents get his hair and beard shave off to protect him during the harrowing anti-Sikh riots . <h> From around the web <h> More from The Times of India <h> From Around the Web <h> More From The Times of India <p> Recommended By Colombia <h> Comments <p> Characters Remaining : 3000 <h> OR PROCEED WITHOUT REGISTRATION <p> Share on Twitter <h> SIGN IN WITH <p> FacebookGoogleEmail <p> Refrain from posting comments that are obscene , defamatory or inflammatory , and do not indulge in personal attacks , name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delete comments that do not follow these guidelines by marking them offensive .

The period varies from bank to bank . The next stage is when an account becomes dormant . Typically , when the no-activity period goes beyond two years , an account is tagged as a dormant account . <p> The period varies form bank to bank . For instance , ICICI Bank Ltd 's website says , " ICICI Bank may classify an account as an inactive if there are no customer-induced transactions for 15 months in the account . Dormant if there are no customer-induced transactions for 18 months in the account . That is no customer-induced transactions for three months after the account had become inactive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes dormant if it 's not used for a period of two years . <p> Who transacts:Remember that the transactions undertaken by the bank on your account is not taken into consideration when calculating the no-activity period . In other words , even if your bank debits your account with a service charge or credits your account with payment of interest , the transaction wo n't be considered as an activity from your side . Transactions initiated from your side ( debit or credit ) or a third-party transaction on your account are required to keep the account live . <p> Why you should n't keep a dormant account <p> It 's expensive : One of the biggest costs that you pay for keeping an account dormant is the opportunity cost . The money lying idle in your account earns an interest rate of 3.5% per annum only . <p> If you had kept the same amount in a liquid fund or a liquid plus fund you would have earned a return of 4.5-4.75% per annum .

That much money was n't claimed for 10 years . <p> Another option is to convert it into a sweep-in account , which is a savings account-cum-fixed deposit product . In these accounts , any surplus amount above a pre-determined limit gets automatically swept into a fixed deposit account , which earns more than 3.5% per annum . <p> Even if you do n't have a large amount parked in these accounts , there is a minimum balance to be maintained . If you fail to do so , most banks would slap you with a fee even if the account is inoperative or dormant state . And that too over and over again -- for as long as your account stays dormant . For instance , Punjab National Bank charges Rs150 per quarter for not maintaining the minimum balance , for Barclays Bank India , the fee is Rs250 per quarter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range of Rs75 per quarter to as much as Rs1,000 per year . <p> Eventually , your account will reach a stage where it may actually run into a negative balance . Some banks close the account in such cases , but there are some that have accounts in dormant state showing a negative balance and you may end up owing money to the bank for the fee . <p> However , dormant accounts do not get reflected on your credit report even if they show a negative balance . Arun Thukral , managing director , Credit Information Bureau ( India ) Ltd , says , " Only the assets from the banks ' point of view are a part of the credit report . Savings accounts or other types of deposits are never included . " <p> Dormant accounts may not work against your creditworthiness , but they are possible cases of fraud . <p> It 's risky : Frauds are on the rise in the Indian banking industry and identifying a fraud in an unused account is n't easy . <p> There have been instances where bank employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dormant accounts or even fixed deposits that have n't been claimed for a long time . <p> Says Mayur Joshi , chief executive officer , Indiaforensic.com , a financial fraud investigation company , " It 's best to close an account that is not used since keeping it inoperative or dormant is risky . It 's possible that a dishonest bank employee can forge your signature to steal small amounts or transfer funds from your account to another account or even use such account for illegal activities . " <p> Moreover , the possibility of identity theft and net banking frauds can not be ruled out , especially in an ignored account . ICICI Bank 's website says , " Such accounts are prone to be used for illegal transactions , laundering money or funding terrorism , any of which could land a bona fide customer in serious trouble .

" <p> Moreover , it 's inconvenient to maintain many accounts . The higher the number of accounts , higher would be the number of account numbers , personal identification numbers , debit card numbers and endless papers to handle . <p> Besides , whatever little interest you earn on each of them will have to be taken into account while calculating your income for tax purposes . Interest that a savings account earns is taxable .

@@3953239 <p> In public space one keeps hearing many a things which are horrifying , vicious and bad in taste .

While Congress supporters did outpour their anguish through protests and filing of some cases , the RSS itself distanced itself from this statement . Tarun Vijay of BJP , with RSS background , also dissociated BJP form this statement . Interestingly even while distancing BJP from Sudarhsan 's statement he made it a point to pay compliments to the intellect of K.Sudarshan . <p> Overall even the other people from RSS stable were mild enough to dissociate themselves from the outpouring of their ex- Chief and one of the longest serving leaders of RSS .

Communal view of society looks at peoples ' interests , material and otherwise only through the prism of religion . According to this ideology all Hindus have similar interests ; all Christians have similar interests and so on . This communal ideology begins with ' sameness of the interests ' of one religious community and than goes on so say that interests of two religious communities are different from each other .

The communal ideology , irrespective of any religions in whose name it operates , changes the horizontal social differences into vertical ones ' . The society has divisions according the rich and poor , privileged and deprived . According to this ideology what matters is the vertical divisions according to one 's religion . This ideology as such focuses on issues of identity and undermines the real worldly problems .

This is not the first time such a thing has happened . Gandhi murder ( Nathuram Godse ) , murder of Pastor Stains ( Dara Singh ) , Pramod Mutalik 's antics ( Sri Ram Sene ) , communal violence and all that is the outcome of divisive sectarian ideology .

@@3966234 <h> Making more space for malls <p> Last updated : 13 January , 2011 <p> TRENDS <p> Retail realty has come out of its recessionary hiding hole and is poised for a great deal of development this year , observes Ruth Dsouza Prabhu <p> Market observers will agree that retail real estate seems to be moving slowly up the graph in Bangalore . In fact , more than half of the proposed shopping space that is intended for the year will be coming up at Bangalore as well as in Mumbai and the NCR . <p> Summarising the year that went by , Abhishek Kiran Gupta , Head - Research &amp; REIS , Jones Lang LaSalle India , " In 2010 , both domestic and foreign retailers re-drafted their plans for expansion into various Indian cities . <p> The immediate effect was felt by the increase in high-street transactions as suitable space was not available in prime shopping centres . <p> " Several shopping centre developers focused on execution of their ongoing projects rather than expansion . Rents have found support at the current levels and there is little likelihood of further downward movement . The rationalised rents will help retailers who are seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have become more popular with developers , and this has led to better mall management . " Coming to the present year , one the main predictions from Bijay Aggarwal , Managing Director , Salarpuria Sattva is that selling of retail space is not going to be the mantra this year . <p> Gradual rise in demand <p> He says , " As a result of the recession of 2008-09 ' , several retail projects were stopped mid-way or did not take off . This led to a lower supply of retail . Today , as we have moved out of the recessionary mode , the demand is gradually on the increase and the prospects look extremely good for this year . In fact , what will work is a mix of leasing as well as revenue sharing . Rentals are a thing of the past . " <p> Irfan Razack , CMD , Prestige Group , elaborates extensively on the retail realty prospects of 2011 saying , " There is immense scope for retail development in Bangalore keeping in mind that there has been a significant increase in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the IT boom . Also , Bangalore is very cosmopolitan in nature and in addition , the younger generation represents a majority of the population in the city .

Malls will continue to gain ascendancy , becoming the preferred destination for shopping . It is also crucial that the local city infrastructure keeps pace with the retail development to ensure healthy organic and structured growth. ? " After the difficult 2008-09 , rentals across the country have stabilised and are certainly at more realistic levels now . Concepts like revenue sharing , which are now in vogue , were in fact pioneered by us several years ago . We do see a gradual increase in rentals over the coming years though .

" <p> Abhishek Kiran Gupta completes this round-up of predictions saying that this year , many shopping centres across geographies and the value , lifestyle , specialty and luxury retail segments will see completion . However , the emphasis will be on value and necessity retailing in the Tier III locations . Growth of lifestyle and luxury retail will largely be limited to the Tier I and Tier II cities . <p> " While select developers would demand a higher rent for their upcoming projects , average valuations are not likely to rise too soon . The possibility of 100% FDI being permitted for multi-brand retailing holds strong promises for retail real estate in India . However , due to the associated beliefs of negative effects to unorganised retail , the proposition is not likely to be accepted without a fair degree of opposition . " <p> Malls vs standalone <p> In such an environment , a reasonable question for those hoping to enter the retail realty line is what will work better -- malls or standalone outfits ? Bijay Aggarwal believes that malls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " Standalone units such as Central , which are on the scale of a mall will be successful . However , any standalone between 40 , 000 sq ft and 1 lakh sq ft is not going to work . Any standalone that does come in should be two lakh sq ft at the minimum or more . " <p> Irfan Razack believes the Indian retail sector is booming and mall growth is being seen as a clear indicator of the economic prosperity in India . <p> These shopping cum entertainment destinations are getting bigger and better , sporting multiplexes and food courts to woo shoppers . Dominant retail activity is visible in the top cities but Tier II and III cities are also witnessing a change . <p> He says , " Retail would also benefit hugely over all from the opening of FDI , as this will mean many more brands and categories will be encouraged to enter the country .

He also feels that despite the mall at Malleshwaram , there is ample scope for a value mall at Peenya . <p> Irfan says , " Within Bangalore , the southern part of the city will continue to grow , especially the areas of Jayanagar , Bannerghatta and Kanakpura Road . <p> " Needless to say , Whitefield is fast developing into a satellite hub to the city and will soon become a self-sustained locale , especially now with an elaborate social infrastructure in place with prominent malls in the area making a mark. ? <p> " North Bangalore will however take some time to gather momentum and keep pace with other parts of the city that are witnessing rapid growth .

@@3969240 <h> The changing face of La Nina <p> ' The Little Girl ' -- La Nina -- has had an outsized impact across globe since manifesting itself in mid-2010 . La Nina and its equally rumbustious sibling , El Nino , come about when the waters of the eastern and central Pacific Ocean along the equator become unusually cold or warm . These changes in the Pacific produce swings in atmospheric pressure , winds , temperature , and rainfall that have a global impact . These coupled with changes in the ocean and atmosphere are collectively called the El Nino/Southern Oscillation ( ENSO ) . For India , an El Nino is often a cause for concern because of its adverse impact on the south-west monsoon ; this happened in 2009 . A La Nina , on the other hand , is often beneficial for the monsoon , especially in the latter half . The La Nina that appeared in the Pacific in 2010 probably helped last year 's south-west monsoon end on a favourable note . But then , it also contributed to the deluge in Australia , which resulted in one of that country 's worst natural disasters with large parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south-eastern Brazil and played a part in the heavy rains and consequent flooding that have affected Sri Lanka . <p> It is becoming increasingly clear that global warming is contributing to the impact that ENSO has . The Indian Ocean is warming rapidly . There are already indications that this warming along with the growing temperature of the western Pacific is influencing the effect of a La Nina . A paper , ominously titled ' The Perfect Ocean for Drought , ' which was published in the journal Science in 2003 , linked the prolonged droughts from 1998 to 2002 that afflicted the United States , southern Europe , and south-west Asia to the warmth of these ocean waters during a protracted La Nina . Such heightened ocean temperatures may well have played a crucial part in weather-related events in recent months . While the La Nina that developed in mid-2010 lent a helping hand to the south-west monsoon , the warmth of the tropical Indian Ocean may have prevented a more equitable distribution of rainfall -- eastern Uttar Pradesh , Bihar , Jharkhand , and much of West Bengal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Indian Ocean and western Pacific probably provided the extra moisture and energy for the exceptionally heavy rains that Australia and Sri Lanka experienced . It could be one reason why in India the north-east monsoon , which is usually retarded by a La Nina , has this time seen a surfeit of rain . The writing on the wall is clear enough : global warming will worsen the swings of climate variability brought about by factors like ENSO , making extreme weather events such as droughts and floods more frequent . The world needs to pay heed . <h> These unprecedented events show that climate change is the biggest challenge before mankind in the 21st century even bigger than terroism or we can term it as natural terrorism which every person on this Earth is responsible for.Although global warming and global cooling are natural cyclic events according to Climatology and this is the period of the former one but human has added to its effect as a catalyst.We will have to take stringet steps to curb it otherwise humane graves shown in the Movie 2012 could be true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 , 2011 at 20:30 IST <h> The situation seems alarming.The time has come that the summits on climatic discussions result in results.The vexed issue between the developing and developed countries is harming the both.The consensus needs to be build for the betterment of our Universe .

She is , he says , thanking him for restoring her bowel flora . <p> It 's a distasteful cure for a problem that 's increasingly widespread : the Clostridium difficile bug , typically caught by patients in hospitals and nursing homes , can be hard to treat with antibiotics . But Borody is one of a group of scientists who believe the answer is a faecal transplant . <p> Some jokily call it a " transpoosion " . Others have more sciencey names like " bacteriotherapy " or " stool infusion therapy " . But the process involves , frankly , replacing a person 's poo with someone else 's , and in the process , giving them back the " good " bugs they desperately need . <p> Borody 's grateful patient , Coralie Muddell , suffered months of chronic diarrhoea so bad she would often embarrass herself in public , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The technique that cured her has had a success rate of around 90 percent in the experimental cases where it has been used so far .

" There 's rising recognition of how effective this is , " Borody , a Sydney-based gastroenterologist , told Reuters . <p> YUCK FACTOR <p> There 's little doubt this treatment has an image problem . Faeces , including important bowel flora , is transferred from a volunteer donor -- screened to limit possible other infections -- into the colon of the infected patient . The treatment can be administered by a colonoscope or an enema , or by the mouth or the nose . <p> " I used to be frowned upon and called ' the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose scientific papers have included such titles as " Flora Power " and " Toying with Human Motions " . But he is also deadly serious . One of his published studies reported that in patients with recurrent C.difficile infection , 60 out of 67 -- 90 percent -- of those who received faecal transplants were cured . <p> Alex Khoruts , a gastroenterologist at the University of Minnesota Medical School in the United States , agrees that the science is not to be sniffed at . " The data are very strong , " he said in a telephone interview . " There is no question that it works . " <p> Khoruts published a study in the Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology in 2009 that showed a single infusion of faeces reversed the absence of bacteroides -- a group of bacteria vital to the body 's ability to withstand infections with C.difficile . <p> Khoruts often sees patients who have taken course after course of antibiotics . As soon as the treatment stops , the infection returns . It does n't take much for these sufferers to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faeces . <p> " The patients I see do n't have any qualms about it , " he says . " By the time I see them , they 've often been sick for anywhere from six months to two years , so they 're quite desperate . Nothing really scares them . " <p> The main aim , he says , is to keep the poo pure . <p> " What we try to do is preserve it as close as possible to how it was in the donor . There 's no in-between culture or enrichment . We want to transfer as much as we can intact . " <p> The donor faeces is filtered to remove some larger particles and then " simply goes through a blender " , says Khoruts , with a saline solution to liquefy it before it is administered . <p> He favours methods which avoid going in through the mouth or the nose , which he says may make patients gag . <p> Borody 's clinic , at the Centre for Digestive Diseases in New South Wales , acknowledges that using a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the throat and into the stomach -- is not the most attractive method , but argues it is the most reliable way of killing the C.difficile bug and its spores once and for all . <p> A Europe-wide study published in The Lancet late last year found the incidence of C.difficile infections in hospitals in the region had risen to 4.1 per 10,000 patient days in 2008 from 2.45 per 10,000 patient days in 2005 . <p> The infections can have a range of consequences , from severe diarrhoea to blood poisoning , colitis and death . <p> A 2008 report from the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology ( APIC ) found that on any single day in U.S. hospitals , there could be 7,000 infections with C.difficile and up to 300 deaths . <p> The most commonly used antibiotic for C.difficile is metronidazole , and some more severe forms are treated with vancomycin , traditionally seen as the antibiotic of last resort .

" So we really ca n't say standard medicine has done that well in 50 years . " <p> " POO IS THE ONLY ANSWER " <p> Khoruts now fears that unless the medical establishment embraces the technique , " the majority of people who could benefit from this procedure are not going to get it . " Borody says " poo is the only answer .

@@3994232 has the business model of turning forts and palaces into lavish hotels taken firm roots in India . Delhi-based heritage management consultant Amita Baig -- with half a heart -- agrees , " It is one way of conserving our palaces " ( " Bringing out postcards on them is another way " ) . But if given her way , it would rather be an elaborate book on the subject , she states . Something that she " can share with everybody . " <p> In fact , Baig , jointly with architect and photographer Joginder Singh , has recently published one such book . Titled " Forts &amp; Palaces of India " , it is a coffee table book published by Om Books . A spread of 253 pages with words and full-size colour photographs , it is a close peek at what these vestiges of royalty are all about . Baig 's Introduction in the book sets the ball rolling . In few words , she succinctly stitches together periods of Indian history lineally -- from Mohenjodaro to the colonial times -- creating the mood to peruse the tome of a book . <p> States Baig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book ; I did n't want it to be scholarly or of just academic value simply because India is not about didactic histories alone . " After being in the field of conservation for 25 years , she felt , " it needs to be put across to readers what I had learnt . " <p> Baig and Singh have principally zoomed their interest on forts here . " We have covered a few palaces also only because they are inside a fort , " she clarifies . The forts are divided as per their age . So a little known Kalinjar fort in Uttar Pradesh , a redolent remnant of the Vedic era , opens the book . " Many legends are attributed to this historic fort . According to one , Kalinjra , son of king Bharata , is said to be its founder while another claims it to be the abode of Lord Shiva , " says Baig . " Central to the sacred geography of Kalinjar is the Patal Ganga or underground Ganga , which surfaces in a cave carved with sacred images , " mentions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forts are those of Bandavgarh with the Buddhi Talab , mentioned in the Mahabharata , Sisupalgarh ( Bhubaneswar ) , Ranthambore and Bhatinda . The next lot includes the Rajput forts , perhaps the most exposed ones to readers in North India . In competition are the Sultanate forts in Golconda , Kotla Feroz Shah , Bijapur and Daulatabad . Falaknuma Palace and Chaumuhalla Palace too find place in this section . <p> Delhi 's Purana Quila and Lal Quila , Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri form the Mughal forts segment . The Sikh forts have the usual suspects like the Kapurthala fort . <p> However , the segment on Bundelkhand forts brings to fore a handful of little-known forts , like the one in Datia , Samthar and Ajaigarh . The Samthar fort , " is one of the more ambitious fortifications built in the 17th Century . " Samthar was a powerful Gujjar kingdom when the Moghul Empire was disintegrating and the Marathas were gaining ground in Central India . It also flaunts pictures of intricate rock carvings from the Ajaigarh fort . <p> Edifices from Hampi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Points out Baig , " Padmanabhapuram was one of my best experiences ; away from invasions , loot and pillage , this Travancore fort has some original paintings even today . " She also points out , " There is no conservation work happening in the Maratha forts ( covered later in the book ) . " <p> Baig 's book covers the less exposed hill forts in Kangra , Nurpur and Basgo too . The Eastern fort segment exhibits Ramnagar fort by the river Ganga , the majestic Tripura and Hazarduari forts and Burduwan Summer Palace . The book ends with a segment on such constructions by the Portuguese , French , Danish and the British . <p> With the right pictures complementing Baig 's commentary , the book is a laudable effort . And Baig is all praise for Archaeological Survey of India for this . " They helped a lot , facilitated our access to the forts before the public visiting hours , " she says . Researching on the subject did n't take too long though . " There is information out there , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do only cross-checking . " <p> All for preserving the legacy , Baig comes up with a pertinent suggestion here , " Our forts have to be invigorating , they ca n't be just static buildings . A way of introducing people to them would perhaps be to make them camp sites .

@@3994233 <h> Yusuf Arakkal : Portrait of artist and his haunting , taunting faces <p> New Delhi : Noted Kerala-born portrait artist Yusuf Arakkal has honed his trademark portraiture of faces in the last 40 years into a series of haunting visages . " If Mona Lisa can sport a moustache , why ca n't I paint faces ? " asks the artist , now working on canvases woven around Christ . <p> The evocative faces have been defined by critics as " voices from the void , filled with a strange power that haunt , taunt and burn with a latent fire " . No wonder an exhibition , on at the Art Alive Gallery that closes Feb 12 , is called " An Inner Fire " . <p> " I have been painting faces since Day 1 . I trained in portraits even before I went to the art school under Jaya Varma , a relative of the renowned Raja Ravi Varma . He taught me to draw faces in the European tradition for 18 months in 1964 , " the painter told IANS . <p> " Between 1964 and 1969 , I painted several portraits but when I finished art school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life . There were times when I painted children 's faces . <p> " Certain faces lingered in my memory and haunted me . Sometimes I refer to press photographs but I do not copy from photographs .

Influences of filmmakers like Vittorio de Sica , Satyajit Ray , Raj Kapoor and Truffaut are apparent in his work . <p> " I am interested in the camera , " he said . <p> Arakkal 's life is one of adventure . A member of the erstwhile ruling Arakkal clan of Cannanore in northern Kerala ( now Kannur ) , the artist of Islamic lineage left his native place for Bangalore in search of a job . <p> Initially , he felt lost in the film-crazy Bangalore of the 1960s . <p> But a member of the extended Arakkal royalty took in the young artist and provided him shelter till he found a job as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the desire to paint and sculpt was overriding , the artist remembered . <p> Arakkal gave up his job to study at the Chitrakala Parishad .

JUANITA KAKOTY catches up with this legend and his thoughts behind his classic shots . <p> I always thought that a good photograph was about telling a story , until I heard the great master . Leafing through the pages of an unbound printed copy of his soon-to-be-released Varanasi : Portrait of a Civilization by Harper Collins , ace photographer Raghu Rai mused , " Photographs are not about telling stories , but about capturing energies ; about recreating the inner experience of any given situation " . He likened a photograph to a movie which is deep and sensitive , " It 's like coming back and not analysing it , but enriching through the silence that it restores " . And over the decades , this is precisely what his photography has done -- captured subtle details that energise a frame , connected people to inner experiences , and restored silence through brilliance . <p> Raghu Rai has , over four decades , captured India in its many moods and expressions . " You know I shoot primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own country , I will be more satisfied than flirting around everywhere . It is the traditional India , where so many generations have learnt to live side by side , where I like to invest most of my time . There are layers and layers to be dug up here . " Rai has , so far , published more than 30 books on India and the sheer range of his work is prodigious . Each book is a delight , not only for connoisseurs , but for sociologists and historians as well . <p> While still holding the book on Varanasi , Rai reflected , " With the arrival of digital technology , I am reborn . It gives one much better quality than the film ; and also allows greater control and freedom . For instance , one can shoot in the middle of the night and still produce natural colours with the help of photoshop " . As I nod in agreement , he further espoused photoshop by pinpointing a small detail , " All colour films exaggerate the colour ; so does a digital camera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reality . " <p> His current projects , in fact , have emerged out of this technology boon . " I started taking pictures in 1965 .

Now , I am taking out old transparencies and negatives , which have the ability to stay alive in today 's mind , and getting them scanned . This is how , in the last few weeks , I have been able to come up with three books -- The Indians : Portraits by My Album , produced by Penguin , one on Mumbai by Om Shanti Books Institution , and , " he said holding up the book in his hands , " this -- Varanasi : Portrait of a Civilization , by Harper Collins .

He has been a jury member of the World Press Photo three times and has been a member of the prestigious Magnum Photos ever since he was nominated by the great Henri Cartier-Bresson in 1977 . His photographs have appeared in leading international dailies and magazines . And to think of it , Rai had almost not become a photographer ! <p> Raghu Rai had trained in civil engineering , the sought after ticket , especially in those days , to prestige and honour for the Indian middle class family .

It is the intuitive energy and responses to situations that liberates me from the physicality of things and takes my work to a much higher plane .

@@4008232 <h> Bhushan Steel : Buy <p> Expertise in producing cold-rolled steel and improving margins as a result of higher capacities and vertical integration make the stock attractive . <p> February 12 , 2011 : <p> Rising raw material costs and a challenging market to pass on those hikes have made for a trying environment for steel producers over the last two quarters . In such a setting , integrated producers with a premium product mix have an ace up their sleeve . A recent entrant to the integrated producer category , Bhushan Steel , appears a smart bet in the space , owing to its expertise in producing cold-rolled steel and improving margins as a result of higher capacities and vertical integration . <p> At the current market price , the enterprise value/tonne stands at around Rs 41,000 on its projected 2012 capacity , which is a premium to larger peers such as SAIL and JSW but just hovering below its replacement cost . This maybe justified , given the company 's product mix and limited scale which may render backward integration into mining smoother . On a P/E basis , the company trades at around 7.8 times the trailing 12-month earnings , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MICROSTORY <p> Over half of the company 's 1.9 million tonnes of hot-rolled coil production capacity at Orissa is processed into cold-rolled and coated variants by units in Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra.The company has maintained its operating margins at 28 per cent over the last two quarters , while others such as SAIL or JSW ( 18-20 per cent ) have seen substantial margin erosion . In the first nine months of this fiscal , Bhushan Steels ' net sales and net profits have grown by 25 and 26 per cent respectively as the Orissa capacity comes on-stream and producers hike prices gradually . The recent quarter saw net sales and profits rise by 36 and 23 per cent to Rs 1,900 crore and Rs 280 crore respectively . <p> Between 2006-07 and 2009-10 , an improving product mix and capacity additions have seen the company 's net sales and profits grow at a compounded pace of 14 per cent and 40 per cent respectively . Operating margins have improved from 17 to 28 per cent over the same period . <h> GROWTH DRIVERS <p> The company 's ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark rests on its efforts to improve integration through higher crude steel capacity and commissioning of iron ore and coal mines . The upcoming three-million-tonne Brownfield capacity at Orissa ( to be commissioned by 2012 ) and the operation of iron ore and coal ( both coking and thermal ) mines over the next four years , may be the key profit drivers for Bhushan Steel . This may catapult the company 's margins closer to the 35-40 per cent mark . The Brownfield additions , coupled with the 70 per cent addition in cold rolling capability , could result in sales trebling by FY-14 . <p> The company 's 400 MW captive power capacity ( including associate Bhushan Energy 's capacity ) should lower the power bill for company 's power hungry Conarc furnace . Its 70 per cent stake in Australian miner , Bowen Energy , which has substantial coking coal mines and an offtake agreement with Resource Management for thermal coal are other measures to ensure timely and cost-effective supply of coal , in an increasingly scarce and concentrated market . <p> Reports indicate that the consumer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heavy steel users , including air-conditioners and home appliances , grew by 12 and 23 per cent respectively . The automobile segment saw 32 per cent growth in sales in 2010 , a level which may be difficult to replicate . But even more moderate levels of growth will bode well for steel producers . <p> The growing consumer pies in both segments coupled with increasing levels of competition will lead to higher levels of domestic procurement of raw materials and components . This trend will work in favour of domestic steel producers which supply to these segments . <h> Industry outlook <p> With global demand remaining lukewarm and aggressive miners looking to hike iron ore and coal prices at the earliest signs of rising demand , the steel industry has been unable to match its price increases to the pace of raw material price hikes . This has resulted in a dent in the margins of steel producers , globally , over the last two quarters . High raw material costs are likely to remain a pain point for the steel sector , with few major mine additions till @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices hikes in the 2-5 per cent range over the last three months to cope with rising costs . Floods in Australia have , however , presented a new set of challenges to steel producers , one which they may not be able to ' price-hike ' their way out of . <p> With pricing power firmly in the miner 's corner , a surfeit of steel production capacity globally and a slow and arduous recovery in the global steel cycle , the only alibi steel producers have for hiking prices is rising raw material costs . In this scenario , being amongst the lowest cost and integrated producers appears to be the best bet to retain margins . Bhushan Steel has the potential to be among that handful of producers . <h> Risks <p> With debt equity levels of just over three , Bhushan Steel 's ability to service and payback Rs 13,000 crore in debt lies in the steel prices remaining stable at the very least and the company sticking to its expansion timetable . Failure to do so will hurt profitability . Similarly , delays in commissioning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's prospects of morphing into a well-hedged integrated producer . While the company 's EBIT covers interest 5.7 times over , rising interest rates do pose a serious threat to the operating margins .

The Beagles has a long history of producing some of the State 's and the country 's best basketball players and once again they have produced a player that could possibly help Karnataka regain its glory . <p> " My father encouraged me to play cricket but after he passed away , I lost the urge to play cricket and I took up basketball , " said the 18-year-old commerce student from Presidency College . <p> " My mum encouraged me to play basketball and so did Mohan sir of Beagles .

It is NOT going to redraw it 's boundaries anymore or at any time . Plebiscite of the state is something that never can be achieved . The ' comments ' he made based on the handling over of power to UN security forces and gradual transaction of power must either be hallucinating or being in a state of mental instability .

They lose their time , and energy and of course the commission they would of earned .

It is high time the make-up artists in the Hindi film industry are given the recognition they deserve , says Rajiv Vijayakar <p> They are the unsung , behind-the-scenes heroes . Their work is seen , yet unseen in the movies , and Bollywood stars would literally lack lustre if not for the magic of their hands . Veteran make-up artiste Pandhari Juker ( known to the industry as Pandhari Dada after the famous deity of Lord Vithal of Pandharpur ) is active at 80 . <p> Guru to most of the other respected make-up men of contemporary cinema like Deepak Sawant ( best known as Amitabh Bachchan 's personal make-up expert ) , Mickey Contractor , Bharat Godambe and Vidyadhar Bhatte , Pandhari launched the Star Institute , which offers training courses for make-up artistes as well as beauticians . From Amitabh Bachchan , Sanjay Dutt and Sunny Deol to Madhuri Dixit and Manisha Koirala , it was the industry buzzword -- ' If you want a successful career in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I was perhaps the first trained technician in this field , " recalls Juker . " When I joined V Shantaram 's Rajkamal Studios on February 4 , 1949 , I had no knowledge of what make-up in cinema meant and involved and I learnt on-the-job , assisting names like Baba Vardhan and Dada Paranjape . Then , K A Abbas packed me off to Russia for Pardesi . I stayed back for a year and underwent training at Mosfilm Studios , where I earned a diploma in make-up . " <p> Though Juker learnt a lot when working with British make-up whizkid Jimmy Vining on the colour film Jhanak Jhanak Payal Baaje , his main tryst with fame came when he was summoned to give Meena Kumari a dark-complexioned look in the black-and-white film Char Dil Char Raahen , again made by Abbas . " It was a challenge to show someone with a dark skin in a black-and-white film , " says Juker . " Later , because of Nana Palsikar , the famous character artiste , I entered the portals of B R Films with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with B R Choprasaab till Zameer and for the television epic Mahabharat . " <p> Long association with cinema <p> Juker had a 17-year association with Yash Chopra and long associations also with V Shantaram , Subhash Ghai , Ekta Kapoor and many others . " I did Hindi and Marathi films and television serials and some plays . I also worked on a couple of international projects , " says the veteran . At the peak of his career , Juker was even consulted for the film 's casting ! " I was humbled when stars would come home , at my convenience , if I was busy . If necessary , they would even report at location at 5 am ! " he recalls with a smile . " Amitabh Bachchan wore an artificial beard without removing it in Saat Hindustani for the entire shooting schedule in Goa because I could visit the location only once to fix it on him ! " he adds . <p> However , Juker is not too impressed when foreign artistes are unduly given importance at the expense of Indian make-up aces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on outsiders . When are they going to recognise our indigenous talent ? " he asks . Juker credits a lot of filmmakers for giving his fraternity due importance and recalls Dilip Kumar giving " 80 per cent of the credit to make-up artistes " for his success . Asks Juker , " What is a film , serial or play without make-up ? But , ironically , while there are no awards for make-up artistes , each and every person on stage at all award ceremonies needs make-up , right from the dancers to the hosts ! " <p> His student Deepak Sawant , known as Amitabh Bachchan 's pet make-up man , however states that make-up men are getting their due now . However , Juker is clear that his tribe is well-paid . " I never had problems in that respect , " he says and goes on the add , ? " I was given a lot of creative freedom . " Juker 's prot ? g ? s have a near-monopoly in the field today -- Mickey Contractor , Bharat Godambe , Vidyadhar , Pravin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among others . <p> Asked about the Maharashtrian grandslam , Juker says , " That was the case even earlier , even with other technical jobs in the industry .

Later , Sarosh Mody came in and achieved fame with Sanjeev Kumar 's films like Naya Din Nayi Raat . " <p> Vidyadhar states that with relationships scoring over training and expertise in getting work , a whole new breed of people are seen in the industry . " But they have technology that aids their work . Facilities like photoshop , colour correction and digital intermediate and VFX are at their disposal . We never need such things ! " About their own issues with modern technology , Vidyadhar notes , " Post-production of any kind is done within the four walls of a studio . People involved in post-production do not get to work with actors directly like we do ! But they can enhance our work , sometimes , or correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the right natural lighting . But sometimes they can spoil our work too by colour-correcting everything except the artiste 's face ! " ? Bhatte states that lighter shades are generally employed for highlighting weak areas while dark shades contour and subdue features that are too prominent or unnecessarily sharp . <p> The make-up fraternity unanimously concedes that the advent of colour made things easier . " Earlier , we also had to compromise on quality of materials used . But now , we can lay our hands on the best cosmetic brands available in the market , " adds Bhatte , whose recent standout work includes Lage Raho Munna Bhai and Band Baaja Baaraat . <p> Juker explains how the use of a monitor while shooting allows errors to be detected and corrected immediately today . " Back then , we would never know about the errors till the final print was out ! " <p> About the common belief that these make-up materials inflict damage on the skin , Bhatte asks , " How can they when they are layers that act as protectors ? " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same as used by the common man . " The quantity is more and the layers are thicker because it has to last longer , that 's all . " About allergies , Deepak says that they are rare . " Rajesh Khanna 's skin was allergic , so he had to use very light make-up , if at all , " he reveals . <p> Make-up artistes in general prefer to handle a complete project or may work on specific actors . It not only constitutes what is known in film parlance as ' greasepaint ' , but also wigs , beards , hairstyling and prosthetics . Most of the veterans are experts in all these areas and they have worked with inspired ingenuity and are self-taught .

The batsman stood his ground and the decision was sent upstairs . Side-on replays seemed to clearly show McCullum 's fingers under the ball but a front-on shot , as it so often does , created doubt that the third umpire , Amiesh Saheba , ruled on . Before then Jayawardene had scrambled for 50 deliveries to make 26 but silkily added a further 40 at a run a ball and Sri Lanka never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 's been waiting 64 matches for . Looking typically unhurried , he was content to work the ball around early on before unfurling some of the stylish strokes that are his hallmark as the innings went on . One six , eased down the ground off Scott Styris , told of a batsman in total <h> Smart stats <p> The 145-run partnership between Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene is the second-highest for Sri Lanka against New Zealand in a World Cup match . <p> Sangakkara and Jayawardene have put together 4724 partnership runs in ODIs , which is the highest by a non-opening pair . This was also their tenth century partnership in ODIs , which puts them in second place , next only to the Sachin Tendulkar-Rahul Dravid pair , who have 11 . <p> The 112-run margin of victory is Sri Lanka 's third-highest against New Zealand . <p> Muttiah Muralitharan 's bowling returns of 4 for 25 is his second-best in World Cups , next only to his 4 for 19 against Ireland in 2007 . <p> New Zealand 's total of 153 is their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Sri Lanka . <p> control . The verbal exchanges that Jayawardene got involved with after his escape only served to fire him up and he was soon exhibiting the fluent form that had deserted him since his century against Canada in Sri Lanka 's opening game . <p> The pair added 145 and the importance of the stand was demonstrated by what followed . Sangakkara rushed to his century with four boundaries in six deliveries but was out soon after for 111 . Following his dismissal Sri Lanka lost five wickets for 55 in the final 8.2 overs . That they even got so many was almost entirely down to Angelo Mathews , who swatted 41 from 35 balls to thwart New Zealand 's fightback . <p> In the end , the collapse was irrelevant but in the knockout stages , opposition teams will know beneath Sri Lanka 's top order is a soft underbelly waiting to be exposed . New Zealand would have backed themselves to make a better fist of chasing but - despite dew , on a ground that will host the World Cup final , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them into submission . <p> The early work was done by the quicks when Brendon McCullum was given out by the TV umpire after Jayawardene , of all people , claimed a low catch off Mathews . There was some uncertainty as the take was almost spilled at the last moment . TV replays were not entirely certain but , unlike the first time , the right decision was made and McCullum was sent on his was for 14 . After Guptill fell for 13 , Jesse Ryder and Ross Taylor threatened to make a match of it but the spinners took over . <p> Mendis ' mystery may have faded with exposure but his variations proved too much for Ryder who nibbed a carrom-ball behind for a 23-ball 19 . Muralitharan 's introduction had been delayed after he picked up an injury while batting . Despite hobbling around , he was still devastating when he finally got into the attack in the 18th over . <p> A doosra took care of Kane Williamson for 5 before he landed the killer blow by spinning one back into Taylor 's pads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rightly given out for 33 and his team never looked like competing . Scott Styris chipped a return catch to Muralitharan , who belied his injury to spring up and snaffle the chance , and Nathan McCullum and James Franklin soon followed . Between them Mendis and Muralitharan took six wickets for 49 in 14 overs . <p> Unlike the frenzied excitement in Group B , the qualifiers in Group A are already settled . Sri Lanka are guaranteed to finish second whatever happens between Australia and Pakistan , which might well leave them in line for a contest against the World Cup mysterybox , England , in the quarter finals . <h> Match Timeline <p> ah a great match , but it would be better for the middle order to go out and practice for a couple of hours in the ground every day and focus ahead of the QF , SF and finals . should the middle order perform well , along with the top , given that murali and co are as effective as ever , the WC is SL's. remember guys , you are one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't get into the knack of dropping catches . as sanga said , sl is capable of utilising the variability in bowling to capitalise on the opposition . however , it is better to perform in every department .. good luck boys , you can do it ! ! ! ! <p> Posted by shameerpvt on ( March 20 , 2011 , 16:00 GMT ) <p> If SL proved its capability with the bat effectively , their bowlers will do the rest .

The only question for NZ was the controversial decision re McCullum 's catch . Mahela Jayawardena had every right to stand his ground and this was justified by the third umpire 's decision as was the right of McCullum 's brother when he stood his ground . Both batsmen were unsure whether the catch was properly taken . Contrast this with Ponting 's dismissal today against Pakistan when he knew that he definitely hit the ball . What did he expect if it went to review ? The UDRS has been installed to deal with LBWs and the likes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tests in SL when UDRS was first introduced and found out more than once ! ) who do not walk when they have clearly hit the ball .

Hope they are more confident about their abilities with this win . Good to see Mathews making some runs . He needs to use his head when batting rather than trying to hit the first ball he receives for a six . He should take a few balls to settle in . He is a batsman that can afford to spend some balls to settle in so that he can cash in later . <p> Posted by &amp;nbsp on ( March 19 , 2011 , 13:26 GMT ) <p> I want to see chamara silva out &amp; Thisara Perera In QF what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutta grew up supporting England during the 90s . Despite this , he still enjoys the game . His unrequited passions for Graeme Hick and , in latter years , Vikram Solanki gave him a stoicism that guided him through an Economics degree and a stint working at the European Parliament . He maintains the purest love for Tests and the whims of legspin bowling and still harbours hope that he could be the answer to England 's long search for a mystery spinner . As it is , his most exciting cricketing experience was planning a trip to Australia for the 2006-07 Ashes with two utterly indifferent friends . Unfortunately his lung collapsed shortly before his planned departure and the pair were left to wander around from Test to Test , unprepared and clueless . Any comparisons with England are far too obvious to make . That cancelled holiday inspired an Ashes blog which led , via some tea-making at the Wisden Cricketer , to the ESPNcricinfo towers .

@@4069236 <h> Japan fears Nuclear reactor is leaking contaminated water <p> Tokyo : Highly contaminated water is escaping a damaged reactor at the crippled nuclear power plant in Japan and could soon leak into the ocean , the country 's nuclear regulator warned on Monday . <p> The discovery poses a further setback to efforts to contain the nuclear crisis as workers find themselves in increasingly hazardous conditions . <p> In another new finding , plutonium was detected in soil at five locations at the plant , Tokyo Electric Power Company , which runs the complex , said . The company asserted that the plutonium , found in samples taken a week ago , posed no threat to public health and that only two samples appeared to have plutonium that came from the plant . Tests of nuclear weapons in the atmosphere , which ended in 1980 , left trace amounts of plutonium around the world . <p> The contaminated water threatening the ocean had radiation measuring 1,000 millisieverts per hour and is in an overflow tunnel outside the plant 's Reactor No. 2 , Japan 's nuclear regulator said at a news conference . The maximum dose allowed for workers at the plant is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the reactor 's turbine building , where contaminated water was discovered on Saturday , to an opening just 180 feet from the sea , said Hidehiko Nishiyama , deputy director-general for the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency . <p> The contaminated water level is now about three feet from the exit of the vertical , U-shaped tunnel and rising , Mr. Nishiyama said . <p> Contaminated water was also found at tunnels leading from the No. 1 and No. 3 reactors , though with much lower levels of radiation . <p> " We are unsure whether there is already an overflow " of the water out of the tunnel , Mr. Nishiyama said . He said workers were redoubling efforts to first remove the water from the Reactor No. 2 turbine building . Government officials have said that the water is probably leaking from broken pipes inside the reactor , from a breach in the reactor 's containment vessel or from the inner pressure vessel that houses the nuclear fuel . <p> The nuclear safety agency also reported that radioactive iodine 131 was detected Sunday at a concentration 1,150 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a mile north of the drainage outlets of reactor units 1 through 4 . It also said that the amount of cesium 137 found in water about 1,000 feet from plant was 20 times the normal level , roughly equal to readings taken a week ago . <p> Mr. Nishiyama said there were no health concerns because fishing would not be conducted in the evacuation-designated area within about 12 miles of the plant , the Kyodo news agency reported . <p> The disclosure about the escaping contaminated water came as workers pressed their efforts to remove highly radioactive water from inside buildings at the plant . The high levels of radioactivity have made it harder for them to get inside the reactor buildings and control rooms to get equipment working again , slowing the effort to cool the reactors and spent fuel pools . <p> Workers pumped less water into the reactors Monday in an attempt to minimize the overflow of radioactive water from them , slowing the cooling process , Tokyo Electric said . <p> Alarm over the radiation levels grew last Thursday when two workers were burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radioactive water inside the turbine building of Reactor No. 3 .

In emergency situations the limit is usually raised to 100 millisieverts but it has been raised to 250 millisieverts during the crisis . <p> There was no evacuation of the workers stationed at Daiichi after the high radiation levels were discovered .

All three kinds of nuclear fuel at the complex could leak plutonium . Reactor No. 3 is fueled partly by mixed oxide fuel , or mox , which is made from plutonium and uranium . Most reactors ' fuel is uranium . <p> But plutonium is a regular byproduct of a reactor 's splitting uranium atoms in two . In a kind of nuclear alchemy some of the speeding subatomic particles of the fission process turn uranium into plutonium . <p> So reactor fuel rods that undergo atomic fission get riddled with plutonium -- though less than in mox fuel .

Thus this week could be a rare , opportune and pregnant moment in the troubled history of regulation of medical education in India .

And to take our country to the happy consummation of quality assured and universal health care .

In August , Parliament gave its assent to the provisions of the ordinance , but only for a one-year term ending in May 2011 . <p> Thus , on the one hand , for the first time , a small body of reputed experts has the power and , indeed , the mandate to rectify the perceived wrongs of the MCI . They have recognised the need to move quickly on many other fronts as well such as shortage of medical manpower , quality of medical education , shortage of faculty in medical colleges , deficiencies in postgraduate training and so on .

And hence the need and urgency to raise in the public domain one crucial aspect of reform of medical education which may not receive the priority it deserves . In spite of the danger of over simplification , the argument here can be stated briefly . <p> ( 1 ) It is generally agreed that the major challenge in health care is in ensuring sound and competent basic health care to the disadvantaged communities , both rural and urban . Indeed , it is an every day experience that even for those who can afford it , dependable and quality assured basic care is a very rare commodity . <p> ( 2 ) This type of care is non-specialised , has to address all common and urgent medical conditions , with limited laboratory and other facilities . It should ensure continuity of care for all members of the family , of all ages . It is mainly ambulatory . And it must include disease prevention and promotion of health , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Obviously this is not the kind of care that medical students are now exposed to in the so-called teaching hospitals . It is a different kind of clinical practice , usually referred to as Family Medicine ( or family practice , though the former is a better term ) . This can be taught only through a significant exposure to secondary and primary levels of care , the lack of which is the foremost deficiency in Indian medical education today . <p> ( 4 ) Unless and until this component is introduced as a required part of the undergraduate course , India will never be able to solve the lack of competent , well trained , basic doctors in our primary and secondary level health clinics and hospitals . Without this , the proposed new medical graduate will not be the basic doctor who forms the backbone of a sound health care system all over the world and which India sorely needs . <p> The logic of this is such that a high powered " Retreat " of the Health Ministry on September 28 and 29 , 2010 expressed its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the issue of curriculum change to make doctors more sensitive to primary health care .

Health issues have never been a powerful element in our political discourse . They have never been a decisive factor in the elections , unlike in Britain or the U.S. So there is no great incentive for political parties to reflect on or act decisively on the societal responsibilities of medical education . <p> Electorate easily pacified <p> In the public perception , sound medical care is equal to access to particular medical interventions and publicised advances in medical care . The electorate is more easily pacified by the offer of medical insurance of the type instituted recently in the southern States .

As PG students when we interact with students from all over India , we could easily notice this gross difference in competency. as a Intern in a Govt.medical College in Chennai , I have conducted around 70-80 deliveries . In some Northern States , they do nt even know how certain procedures are done or what are the equipments generally needed in a ward . Really very poor .. my suggestion is .. 1 . making internship compulsory ( not only on papers ) , 2. in final MBBS case presentation , inspite of concentrating more on MS , AS , AR , complicated respiratory diseases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given to common ailments like malaria , typhoid , diarrheal diseases , asthma and PUO , etc .. 3 . In a north indian state where i am doing PG , the government doctors are never present on duty . they just pay a share of their salary to the CMO of the district and enjoy in their home and do activities such as PG entrance preparation . 4. the situation in medical colleges are much poor . There is no equipment , there are no monitors in elective OT and even in ICUs. sparing one or two , no consultant is present on duty hours . They have their own busy private practice even in their duty hours . even when a maternal death occurs , no one bothers about this , no medical audit , nothing . 5 . So first rectify the flaws existing in the present system , rather than focusing on changing the system . 6 .

Privately , I have heard from many practicing doctors in India on what is known as ' commissions ' -- which are actually kickbacks and bribes -- that are routinely expected and demanded by healthcare providers from labs where they send their patients for tests -- from blood work to X-rays to CT scans and other diagnostic tests .

Why nobody wants to even broach this subject ? <p> from : Kollengode S Venkataraman <p> Posted on : Mar 30 , 2011 at 01:06 IST <h> Those are interesting view points from Dr. Zachariah . I completely agree with those views . There are two issues that we need to consider first . On the first hand , we have to see how to improve the health of the community at large and the second is the changes in medical education to better match the public health needs.The best way to address both the issues is the integration of two systems to get a trade-off . First we need to see whether Family Medicine as a specialty has addressed the community needs and fill the gap in community health from various countries that is in place . As per my knowledge , there is quite a good amount of data to suggest that the family doctors have succeeded in meeting the community health through health promotion and health education . Therefore , I seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better match the community needs . However , by simply creating a family medicine specialty with increased ( 20-25% ) rotations in primary and secondary levels of health care for medical students may not completely address the restructuring of medical education to meet the community needs . Following are my suggestions to achieve a better integration of medical education to appropriately address the community needs . 1 . Family Medicine is the best capsule for the ailing Indian health system . It is very important that how we administer that capsule . Family Medicine should be developed as a specialty at the post-graduate level ( MD level ) . First we need to understand the definition and the core objectives of family medicine . The Academy of Family Physicians of India ( http : **29;458;TOOLONG ) may be an important resource in this regard . 2 . Family physicians should be trained in public health , if possible with a Master of Public Health . Family doctors should be aware of the core disciplines of public health to better address the community health needs . We have the Indian Institutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Health Foundation of India ( PHFI ) to address the need of training family physicians in public health . If that is not possible at this point , it not a bad idea to initially integrate family medicine into community medicine and get family physicians trained in community medicine . 3 . There should be a greater emphasis with regard to research into community health problems by the family doctors . Therefore , training in public health and/or community medicine would serve the purpose . 4 . How do we attract medical students in to family medicine specialty and then the family physicians into service for the rural and tribal communities are a big challenge ? Family Medicine as specialty , if developed really well , then I do n't think it is a problem in attracting medical students into it . There is a huge demand for post graduate medical seats . Therefore , I am very positive in getting medical students in to the family medicine specialty . The government should provide enough incentives for the family physicians to reach the rural/tribal communities to do research and/or medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up medical colleges in the tribal sub-plan areas with coordination of the Integrated Tribal Development Agencies ( ITDA ) such as a Tribal Medical College . These tribal medical colleges should have an attached Center of Tribal Health Disparities ( CTHD ) to aid in research in issues related to disparities in tribal health . The students coming out of these medical colleges should be mandated to serve their needs . To conclude , the government should work in coordination with the Medical Council of India ( MCI ) and all other related agencies to improve the health of the public at the primary level through changes in the medical education . " Prevention is better than Cure " <p> from : Dr. Ramu Gudigantala <p> Posted on : Mar 30 , 2011 at 01:02 IST <h> I am trained in India and worked in primary , secondary and tertiary teaching hospitals in India for more than 12 years . For some time now I am working abroad . It is heartwarming to note the medical council has turned to be one of the rare non corrupt organisations in India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long the our corrupt politicians will allow it to work as such.I do nt think it is the deficiencies in the medical education primarly which result in doctors not concentrating in primary and family health . There is consierable political interference in the transfers and posting that , if given a choice anybody would leave . Doctors once they have completed the learning curve tend to leave on this accord . The remuneration should also be competitive . I know of many colleagues who earn just over Rs 20,000. in rural areas , while their just graduated kids earn more than treble than amount in software companies in cities . The govt should be ready to spend more money in health . The MCI has made no mention of the fact we spend the lowest GDP% on health among the civilised countries . The care given by the family care medicine doctors should be of high quality and be equivalent to any specialist in the field they practice . If they are ' jack of all fields and master of none ' nobody who has a choice will go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on : Mar 29 , 2011 at 23:04 IST <h> Medical education in India today , like all other education system is hijacked by a section of people whose only objective is to earn money and more money at the cost of the diseased and the dying poor.The training in the teaching hospitals are towards this goal by the example young mind see in their mentors.The proposed All India entrance examination will foster this trends and install a capitalistic mind set on ' feudal ' lines . This is a wrong step . Let each university conduct its own entrance examination , design its own courses of study and hospital training ( under the framework set by the MCI ) comprising of at least 25% of practical training in a rural setting at the primary health centers run and managed by the university and not by the government.Today the Primary Health Centers , run by the state governments , are plagued with absenteeism , indifference , incompetence and corruption on a mass scale.This can be minimized if these centers were run by the university based on the principle of autonomy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical education . <p> from : A N Malviya <p> Posted on : Mar 29 , 2011 at 21:29 IST <h> Improvement of Family Medicine at the grassroot level and to take its benefits to the disadvantaged communities , demands the aforementioned reforms in undergraduate medical education . But considering socio-economic viewpoint , not much of doctors would prefer opting for this stream . So it is still a dilemma for the educated middle class or the intellegentsia of our society , whether to do the right thing and offer our services to the poor and downtrodden or to realise our capitalistic dreams of big house , car and money . And government is also not helping in any way , by offering some incentives to work for the disadvantaged communities . Governement is more concerned in reducing the deficit by cutting on social spendings . <p> from : Bhanu Handa <p> Posted on : Mar 29 , 2011 at 13:42 IST <h> Prof. Zachariah is right in pointing out that even the ordinary average middle class finds it difficult to find good primary healthcare . Though , there has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones are rather lacking . A major factor contributing to this i feel is the selection of less than meritorious people for the job . It is very easy to find a doctors son becoming a doctor by virtue of donations/NRI seats etc , and returning back to run the family business . This kills quality and turns the hospitals into money making machines because the money spent on the childs education has to be compensated . Hope the MCI considers this aspect and ban the paid seats . <p> from : Jaibir <p> Posted on : Mar 29 , 2011 at 12:22 IST <h> In government medical college hospitals , for example , in Chennai , the number of out patients is enormous ( in Stanley and MMC-more than 5000 patients a day ) . Of this , 34th of the population belongs to secondary and tertiary care category only . So , the under graduates need not separately under go exclusive training in secondary and tertiary care centers where teaching staff are not post graduates and the infrastructure is not up to the required standard . In Tamil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under 3 different heads viz. Director of Medical Education , Director of Public Health , &amp; Director of Health Services . When I was working as Dean , Government Thoothukudi Medical College and Hospital , I found it very difficult to co-ordinate with DPH &amp; DMS whenever they organized state government 's popular health schemes like ' Varumun Kappom ' . Unfortunately qualified specialists with post graduate qualification would not be available in their side and I was to be forced to depute my teaching staff to conduct the camps . Unlike Dr. Zachariah 's era when so many specialties were not existing and an undergraduate with MBBS was more than a specialist in almost all the specialties , including family medicine ; at this juncture , cutting of 25% exposure of the under graduates to clinical medicine in tertiary care centers will definitely jeopardize the quality of outcome . <p> from : DR.R.Meher Ali <p> Posted on : Mar 29 , 2011 at 12:06 IST <h> The views of Prof.Zachariah on primary and secondary level health care and creation of permanent clinical training for medical students at these levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time they should also increase the number of medical colleges on par with engineering colleges . It is a myth that the quality of education will fall if we increase the number of medical colleges . Like in engineering it will contribute to nation 's progress , especially in the field of primary and secondary health care . The insurance schemes are just eye wash and they only benefit the insurance companies and the license giver ! Instead the money is worth spending on creating facilities for primary heath care . The Medical Council should quickly decide on this and implement the same . <p> from : R.M.Murthy <p> Posted on : Mar 29 , 2011 at 10:25 IST <h> If we want health of our poor people to improve , there is no substitute for improving accessibility of this under-privileged section of our population to medical care at affordable cost . For this purpose focus of our medical education has to change . The poor do not need costly medical care . They need a caring family physician , as pointed out in this article .

To start with , the authorities should consider having senior medical students be a ' part of ' the PDS SYSTEM that is already in place .

Whilst I agree with a lot of the sentiments expressed , 2 themes strike me as being the core issue behind any comprehensive review . One is the independence from politics at a macro and micro level and the other is transparency . Both are interlinked in such a way that if one is disengaged , the other cog slows it down to a level that becomes untenable . Political interference is common in any country , and UK , Australia and New Zealand are recent examples of how a good system can be brought close to ruin . MCI has a long history of being run by a community close to politicians and have repeatedly shown no regard for the needs of the community at large . In that regard , my concern is that the review will not go far enough to provide the autonomy that is seen in the countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the profession . Dilution of standards and flagrant disregard for humanity is rife in the profession . Imagine this , a student pays a lifetime earnings to go through medical school and he/she comes out with only one aim- to recuperate the money back . I have realised that being a medical professional does not make millions . The ethos of the profession being more than that has been lost with the private provider generation . As a double whammy , private medical institutions have only contributed to dilution of standards and not the other way around . I am hoping against hope that this panel will have a mandate to make brave changes and make the MCI a truly bonafide organisation like the General Medical Council for eg. Then only will we make true steps towards progress . The rest of the regulations can be put in place once the MCI takes the lead role . <p> from : Thodur Vasudevan <p> Posted on : Mar 29 , 2011 at 04:11 IST <h> the movement to create family medicine as a specialty originated in USA in the in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial.The results of this are very evident in the American health system as of today.We lack primary healthcare professionals .

How do I decide ? <p> Last updated : 20 April , 2011 <p> Every academic year , thousands of parents debate on whether to send their children to schools affiliated to the CBSE , ICSE , SSLC or the IB . How different are these various school boards ? How do you choose from among the available options ? This week , Bhavna Mulani writes about what makes the CBSE and ICSE boards what they are . Next week , we look at the IB and SSLC boards . Watch out for it . <p> CBSE : Winds of change <p> The Central Board of Secondary Education was set up ' to affiliate institutions for the purpose of examination and to raise the academic standards of the country ' . It prepares the syllabus for students from Lower Kindergarten ( LKG ) to Class 12 , for schools affiliated with it and conducts two India-wide board examinations : the All India Secondary School Examination for Class 10 and the All India Senior School Certificate Examination for Class 12 , which is a school-leaving examination . CBSE is considered a premier board in India as it incorporates modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are affiliated to the board in the country . The medium for education prescribed by CBSE is either English or Hindi. ? <p> The foremost reasons to choose the CBSE would be : <p> *The CBSE syllabus is presented in a very scientific manner , is divided into units with the number of periods required to cover it in the year and the weightage of marks it will carry in the examination . Thereby making planning and preparation easy . <p> *The syllabus lays stress on Math and Science . Objective questions help prepare students for national level competitive examinations. ? <p> *The CBSE also conducts the All India Engineering Entrance Examination ( AIEEE ) which is a common entrance examination on an all-India basis for admission into engineering and architecture/planning programmes in the country . Similarly pre-medical and pre-dental tests AIPMT ( PMT/PDT ) are conducted for medical and dental colleges after the 10+2 exams . Besides , most Indian competitive exams are based on the CBSE syllabus , thus giving an advantage to children from CBSE schools . <p> *Since CBSE follows the same curriculum throughout the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central schools and other private CBSE schools all over India , it becomes an obvious choice for parents in transferable jobs . <p> ? Earlier it was believed that CBSE was not recognised outside India . However this is not so anymore . Now , the UCAS recognises CBSE at par with ISC . The All India Senior School Certificate Examination for Class 12 is widely recognised internationally for direct admissions to university undergraduate courses . <p> The advantage that CBSE has over ICSE , in a predominantly Hindi speaking country like ours , is its lack of stress on English literature . Since English is more functional and application based in CBSE , it meets the basic needs of the student who wants to focus on Science or Math . It does not lay undue stress to master the nuances and subtleties of literature . <p> CBSE has ceded to the winds of change and has shown responsiveness to the needs of a dynamically changing pedagogical scenario . It is now becoming more than just an examination body . The process of reviewing and upgrading the syllabus makes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The new system of Continuous and Comprehensive Evaluation requires the syllabi to be done and reviewed on an on-going basis , thereby trying to ensure that the student is evaluated throughout the year , not just on the day of the exam . Another welcome addition is rewarding non-scholastic activities too . Notwithstanding the debates the ' grades instead of marks ' may have garnered , students still get a pretty good idea of where they stand. ? <p> The CBSE course would ideally be beneficial for a student pursuing any of the science streams , but for a student who wants to pursue management or humanities , ICSE might be a better option . CBSE is said to be more intensive rather than extensive as , " it just introduces the topics on a superficial level in Math and Science in Class 9 and 10 , without going in-depth " as said by Suchita Das , senior teacher , Laurels International School ( ICSE ) . <p> On the other hand , there are scores of teachers and principals who swear by the CBSE Board and believe it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has . <p> ( The writer is Mentor , Indus World School/ ? Career Launcher ) <p> ICSE : Freedom to innovate and be creative <p> The colonial rule in India brought in western thought and sensibility . With the intention of spreading their faith in the colonies , the colonisers might have felt a need for a certain level of education among the natives . What is interesting to note is that many colonisers considered it their duty to make the people of the land ' cultured and civilised ' . And of course an ' English education ' was yet another means of establishing their dominance and strengthening their hold over the country . Thus we have the Cambridge School Certificate Examination being introduced in India . It continued to be a symbol of honour and prestige right unto Independence . <p> After independence , it functioned as the Indian Council which was to administer the University of Cambridge , Local Examinations Syndicate 's Examination in India and , to advise the Syndicate on the best way to adapt its examination to the needs of the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Delhi School Education Act 1973 , as a body conducting ' public ' examinations . <p> The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination conducts three examinations , namely , the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education ( ICSE - Year 10 ) ; The Indian School Certificate ( ISC - Year 12 ) and the Certificate in Vocational Education ( CVE - Year 12 ) . The subject choices and syllabi prescribed for these examinations are varied and aimed at nurturing the unique gifts of individual pupils . <p> The ICSE ( Class 10 ) curriculum has been designed to provide an examination in a course of general education , in accordance with the recommendations of the new education policy 1986 ; The ISC ( class 12 ) is a two-year course of study beyond the Indian Certificate of Secondary Education ( Year 10 ) examination or its equivalent . Moreover the Certificate of Vocational Educational ( CVE - 12 ) has been created as an examination to prepare candidates for particular occupations , in accordance with the recommendations of the Ministry of Human Resource Development ( MHRD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> While going through The Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations ( ICSE ) site , one is definitely struck by the points listed under the heading of ' Ethos of the Council ' which include trust and fair play and values to form the bedrock of education . This surely speaks of the board having its head and heart in the right place . <p> As one of the mentors , who has taught in both CBSE and ICSE schools mentioned that ICSE gives much more freedom to innovate and be creative . The syllabus according to her is expansive and does not hold back the school and the student from experimenting with new ideas . <p> The advantages of an ICSE school would be : <p> *The fundamentals of a subject are taught better in ICSE/ISC syllabus .

As it is said that the ICSE English is the toughest as well as the best as it has two papers in English . Hence it is not advisable for those who either do n't have a good foundation in English or the interest . <p> *Since the ICSE offers a choice of subjects in class 8 itself , it reduces the stress on those children who want to pursue a subject which may be anathema to them .

It also offers the option of a third language , like French , German , Spanish , etc. depending on what the school offers . <p> *In keeping with its progressive approach , it was the first to incorporate subjects like Environmental Education and SUPW ( Socially Useful Productive Work ) as a part of its syllabus . It also offers unconventional subjects like agriculture , home science , fashion designing and others . <p> ?

But to make it really relaxing , you need to be cautious while planning for it . <p> Shyamal Banerjee/Mint <p> Setbacks can come in any form . Cameras without memory cards , unexplained cancellation of hotel bookings , loss of critical documents when your luggage goes missing at the airport , credit cards that do n't work where you are holidaying and SIM cards that seem to have slipped into a temporary coma are problems that most travellers have faced at one time or another . <p> While some of these can be managed if you are travelling within the country , they can become big spoilers if you are holidaying abroad . Here are three broad things you need to be careful about to sort out your basic needs . <p> Carrying money <p> You do n't want to run out of cash in the middle of your holiday . A basic plan to counter such a situation is estimating the cost of the trip . But do n't be conservative and stick to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the mode of carrying becomes important . <p> Carrying cash is fraught with risk . Besides , according to the Reserve Bank of India , you can carry only $3000 in cash while travelling to most countries . <p> While you may need cash for immediate expenses such as commuting , it 's better to carry money in a combination of instruments : the options are prepaid forex cards , credit and debit cards and travellers ' cheque . " If you plan to be away for a week or more , consider a " portfolio " of payment options . Just as you would n't invest all your savings in one stock or bond , you do n't want to tie up all your travel money in one form of payment . Each form of payment has its advantages and together they create worry-free travel , " says Lakshman Pandey , director , prepaid travel payment , South Asia-South East Asia , Australia , New Zealand , American Express . <p> When you are in an unknown location , carry less cash because there are chances of getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheques and encash the same at a money changer after showing your passport for signature verification . They are safer than cash and if lost or stolen can be replaced . <p> Says Noel Swain , executive vice-president , supplier relations , Cleartrip.com , online travel agency , " I look into combinations of international currency . For example if you are in Thailand when you are exchanging money into Bath it first gets exchanged into dollar and then Bath . It 's better to convert rupees into dollars and carry a combination of currency notes and travellers cheques . However , carry small amounts in the local currency for emergencies . " <p> When shopping or going to restaurants or malls , you can use either prepaid cards or travellers cheques . " If you want to make large purchases , you can use cards , " says Pandey . Prepaid cards are easy and convenient to use as you only need to remember a PIN ( personal identification number ) and all VISA outlets accept them . Moreover , if you are running out of cash , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more money uploaded on the card . <p> But prepaid cards have costs attached . Apart from issuing fee that you pay at the time of buying , there are other charges . For instance , in Axis Bank 's travel currency card , you will have to pay $2 or ? 1.5 for withdrawal at an ATM . Similarly , if you use HDFC 's Forexplus Card for the US , then you will pay $2 for ATM cash withdrawal and $0.50 for balance enquiry . <p> Another option is to use debit and credit cards but you would end up paying extra on surcharges for every withdrawal . " Carrying money through debit and credit cards internationally is not a very cheap option . The conversion and withdrawal charges are fairly high compared with other options , " says Ashish Kishore , vice-president , leisure business , Yatra.com , a travel portal . HDFC Bank on its Gold Credit charges a conversion rate of 3.5% and a withdrawal charge of 2.5% of the amount withdrawn or Rs 300 , whichever is higher . If you use HDFC 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 per balance enquiry and Rs 110 per cash withdrawal plus taxes . <p> However , if you are travelling in interior areas , where accessibility of a bank or a money exchanger would be a problem , carry enough cash in local currency . <p> Calling back home <p> Even when holidaying , you need to make certain calls home -- whether to update on your parents ' health or to connect with family and friends . <p> Using the roaming facility on your cellphone while on a foreign trip may not be the best strategy in terms of costs . A good option would be carrying international SIM cards or calling cards . <p> Calling cards are like prepaid cards and work like a recharge voucher . For instance , Airtel sells vouchers in denominations of Rs 300 , Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 , as per their website . If you use the Airtel card while in the US to make calls back home , it would cost you Rs 8 per minute compared with Rs 143 per minute from your local SIM card . Similarly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made through a calling card compared with Rs 159 from your local SIM card , according to their website . <p> When calling , punch in the 14-digit number printed on your calling card ( it 's a scratch card ) before dialling the number you want to connect to . One disadvantage you face with calling cards is the fact that they can be used only for outgoing calls . <p> International SIM cards are country-specific cards that are compatible to any Indian handset . Though they have to be bought in India , they are ready to use as soon as you arrive in another country . Companies such as Clay Telecom and Matrix Cellular ( International ) Services provide international SIM cards . <p> While Clay Telecom has both prepaid and post-paid options , Matrix provides only post-paid . <p> Says Gaurav Dhawan , executive director , Clay Telecom , " If you are using your local number from India , it may cost you about Rs 80-150 per minute for calling back to India depending on the connection you have and destination you are visiting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you use Clay Telecom 's international SIM card . " <p> To get an international prepaid SIM card from Clay Telecom with a talk time of Rs 400 , you will have to pay an upfront charge ofRs 1,800 . For the post-paid card , you will be charged a security fee of Rs 10,000 . You need to use your credit card to make the payment . <p> Since Matrix offers only post-paid cards , you can pay after you come back from your trip . Matrix offers country-specific SIM and data cards for at least 30 countries . <p> Securing your trip <p> Even if you plan your trip to the last detail , you can not account for unforeseen emergencies , medical or otherwise . Travel insurance can take care of such emergencies , at least financially . While you can not travel to certain countries without travel insurance , it is a must even if you are travelling to countries that do not make it compulsory for you to buy insurance . <p> The price of your cover will depend on the sum insured , location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insured can range between $50,000 and $5 lakh and the cover will cost you at least Rs 500 and go up to as much as Rs 30,000 or even above . <p> Typically , insurers divide the area of coverage into three parts -- Asia , the US and Canada and the rest of the world . The cover for the US and Canada is more expensive . <p> If you have taken a travel package , your operator may also offer travel insurance . Check what the operator is offering before settling for it . <p> However , watch out for certain aspects . " Make sure that the insurer has a local office or a representative in the country of travel and has a network of hospitals where you can get cashless treatment .

District energy is efficient , reliable and cost-effective . <p> Cogeneration or combined heat and power ( CHP ) is often used and involves recycling the thermal energy surplus from electricity generation . In addition to such recycling of energy , more efficiency can be obtained via the aggregation of the heating or cooling loads of multiple buildings in close proximity . A central plant providing even loads is typically more efficient than individual building systems . Additionally , district energy systems may employ technologies such as deep lake water cooling or biomass combustion , making it an attractive option for situations where flexibility in fuel sources is viable . <p> According to the U.S. Department of Energy , district energy systems have been operating in the U.S. for over 100 years and currently serve more than 4.3 billion sq . ft. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol and Supreme Court , the Empire State Building , the Mayo Clinic and Harvard Medical School .

Most of the planning for new networks or extensions to existing networks is conducted in Bentley sisNET . Operations and maintenance uses the data for planning upgrades and equipment replacement strategies . Replacing aging equipment is very important for safety reasons to minimize the risk of the very hot water used in the district energy systems causing harm through pipe ruptures or valve failures .

Semi-dynamic situations model the changes in the input temperature ( such as when a power plant changes its service temperature level ) as the heated water travels through the network . Bentley sisHYD executes the thermal calculations dynamically while modeling the hydraulic component as a series of static calculations . The results are particularly useful for utilities investigating how temperature changes can result in heat energy improvements in the network .

Sharada Prasad was media advisor to former prime ministers Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi . This is the full text of Dr Baru 's address : <p> I first met HY Sharada Prasad in 1982 in the very room in which I later sat in the Prime Minister 's Office . He knew me only as Rama 's husband ! I was in Delhi on a visit from Hyderabad where I was a university lecturer and went to call on him because Rama had asked me to . <p> I would meet him occasionally during my days at the Economic Times and Times of India and tried hard to get him to write for the editorial page of the TOI , when I was in charge of it in 1994-96 . He always declined the invitation with a smile . Finally , when he chose to write a column I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed to get him to do so for The Asian Age and Deccan Chronicle . <p> Perhaps as a consolation he called me one day and told me that he had informed Encyclopedia Britannica that he would stop writing the chapter on India that he had written every year for close to 50 years , and henceforth they should approach me for the chapter . <p> I was flabbergasted , flattered and honoured . <p> The editor of Britannica wrote me a warm letter saying that I must be someone very special because after a ' life-long ' association with EB , ' Mr Prasad has chosen you to inherit his annual contribution to the Britannica . ' I have written that chapter since , every year . <p> On June 2 , 2004 , I joined the PMO in the morning and called on ' Shouri mama ' ( as Sharada Prasad was called by his friends and family ) the same evening to seek his blessings and take his advice .

After letting me know that I was sitting in Nehru 's first room in the PMO , he added with a mischievous smile , ' Of course , Natwar ( Singh ) also sat there !

The PM would instantly fall in line and allow me to go ahead , overruling the dissenters . Securing Shourie 's imprimatur was enough . <p> For a man who wielded a powerful and elegant pen for the prime minister of India , who had the unquestioned trust and confidence of a powerful prime minister like Indira Gandhi , who had travelled around the world with her , hearing her read out his prose , whom generations of Indians had seen in Films Division documentaries and front-page photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was with him on my first day in the PMO in his two-room , Punjabi Bagh DDA flat . <p> Every day of my four-and-a-half years in the PMO , I would recall that first evening that I spent with Shouri . <p> Do n't fool yourself , I would tell myself , you may be here today , but one day you too will have a modest apartment to retire to . Shouri was among the very few who worked with Indira Gandhi and Rajiv Gandhi who had no Vasant Vihar or New Friends Colony or Maharani Bagh house to leave for his children . It is the combination of his wisdom and simplicity , his prose and wit , his deep knowledge of both India and the world that makes him a truly unique occupant of that all powerful corner of Raisina Hill . This memorial lecture is dedicated as much to Shourie as to the values he embodied . <p> One of the things that Shouri said to me when I met him the evening of my first day at the PMO was that during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost daily contact , with key interlocutors in just five newspapers -- Hindustan Times , Indian Express , The Statesman , The Hindu and Times of India . <p> That was a different world . <p> While India reported less than 500 newspapers in the years Shouri first came to deal with them , and only one television channel , by 1991 there were 923 newspapers and still only one television channel . But Shouri regarded dealing with just the top five English dailies adequate to influence the rest of the media . These five , he presumably believed , set the tone and the agenda for all others to follow . It is also possible he believed having these five on one 's side is what mattered as far as the PM was concerned . <p> In 2008 , the year I left PMO , the Registrar of Newspapers reported that 2,337 newspapers were in circulation in India . In 2004 there were already several news television channels , but by 2008 the number had more than tripled .

Not only had Indian language television and print become more important , but even English language television and print had burgeoned and the internet had arrived . <h> Nowhere has there been a bigger boom in media than in India <p> It was during my last days in office that I acquired a Facebook account and Outlook magazine put me on their cover , along with some celebrities , for being the first PMO official with a Facebook account . <p> Twitter had not arrived by the time I left office . Today Shouri would not be able to recognise , much less relate , to the media scene in India .

The ruling political party dominates print , television and film production and distribution . <p> In Andhra Pradesh the YS Rajasekhara Reddy family was well on its way to achieving this kind of integration of business interests in media and politics . <p> The relative ease with which the Karunanidhi-Maran families in Tamil Nadu and the YSR family in Andhra Pradesh , to a lesser extent the Pawar family in Maharashtra , have acquired substantial stakes in media , entertainment and politics is a pointer to trends at the national level . <p> There have been reports that the Congress party plans to start its own television and print media businesses . The Left walked down this path in Kerala but was unable to achieve the kind of dominance that the DMK has succeeded in acquiring in Tamil Nadu . <p> The FICCI-KPMG report shows that while there has been a phenomenal expansion of the media business , in almost every major language segment and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent and 75 per cent of the market . <p> In other words , the media pyramid in India is highly skewed . A few newspapers/channels at the top of the pyramid , controlling close to three-quarters of the readership and/or viewership and a large number of small players below sharing the rest of the cake . <p> Part of the problem in regulating the media business arises because of the growing links between politicians , political parties and the media and entertainment business . <p> In Andhra Pradesh , for example , the top two media companies , with print and television business , are Eenadu and Sakshi -- the former owned by the pro-TDP Ramoji Rao , and the latter owned by YSR Rajasekhara Reddy 's son Jagan . <p> In Tamil Nadu the power and influence of Kalanithi Maran 's Sun TV is even more brazen . Indeed , the DMK as a party has acquired enormous control over the entire media business including circulation , cable network and film distribution . <p> In Maharashtra , every media company has its own political interests . Across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nexus between politics , business and media is very close and pervasive . <p> With such visible and known links between political parties and media companies , what is the kind of regulation that government qua government can impose ? Indeed , in a democracy the question does arise whether government or even a quasi-official body should have any powers at all to regulate media . <p> This market structure is ripe for oligopolistic practices and it has been alleged for a long time that such practices have become all too common in India . Very often the intense rivalry and competition between professional journalists in rival media firms masks the implicit collaboration and non-compete clauses -- including deals on advertising , circulation and hiring of journalists -- between the firms themselves . <p> Indian media needs a framework of reference to define what constitutes a competitive structure , what policies amount to being restrictive trade practices , how can such practices be curbed and who curbs them . Has the time come for the Competition Commission of India to consider a framework for regulation of cross-media ownership , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including the phenomenon of ' paid news ' , in the media and entertainment industry ? <p> Click ' Next ' to read further ... <p> Image : The DMK as a party has acquired enormous control over the entire media businessPhotographs : Babu/Reuters <h> Professional editors are becoming an endangered species <p> A few years ago when the former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Board of India , GN Bajpai , convened a meeting of all editors and suggested that the media accept a SEBI code for journalists reporting on markets and companies , a majority of the editors gathered there opposed any SEBI imposed code and instead offered to come forward with a code of their own that media companies could adhere to . Nothing has been heard on the subject since . <p> Institutions like the Press Council of India have lost their lan , and the Editors Guild of India has become a club of former and future editors with little influence on those presently occupying the hot seat ! The inability of the Editors Guild to reverse the phenomenon of ' paid news ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Guild were in fact guilty of the crime , illustrates this better than any other example . <p> A related issue of internal governance that has profound implications for freedom of press is the nature of editorial control in media . Just as politicians have become media barons and media barons have become politicians , establishing a continuum between media , politics and government , there is a parallel continuum between media , business and editorial leadership , with publishers and CEOs becoming editors and editors becoming publishers and CEOs . <p> Time was when many professional journalists worried that the post of editor was being devalued with print and television companies not naming editors and dividing up the editor 's work among several persons , both journalists and managers . As a consequence , today several print and television media have no single editor and , therefore , weak editorial control and leadership . <p> As some of the conversations recorded in the famous Nira Radia Tapes reveal , senior journalists not only worry about the fate of politicians in power , but they also worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unabashed blurring of roles , an increasing number of business persons and politicians are now quite blase about using carrots and sticks to influence and brow beat the media . <p> But a far more insidious development has been underway -- namely the integration of the positions of publisher/CEO with that of chief editor/ editor . The job of editor has been under threat in Indian media for a long time , but today professional editors -- who have no ownership stake in the media company -- are becoming an endangered species . <p> Owners or CEOs are editors and editors have become shareholders or CEOs . Those who worry about content also worry about revenue . It is not difficult to see what this means for editorial freedom . It is also not difficult to see that the famed separation of powers between ' Church and State ' in the media no longer exists . <p> Owner/ CEO/ Manager/ shareholder-editors either impose corporate objectives or their personal whims . Editors who speak eloquently about the freedom of the press and autonomy of media are often the first to impose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Editors , who demand accountability from elected representatives of the people , are often quite happy to censor dissent and straitjacket diverse opinion within their own organisations . When such tyrannical editors are also owners or CEOs of their media establishments there is no internal court of appeal for a journalist . <p> Click ' Next ' to read further ... <p> Image : Former telecommunications minister A Raja is being investigated for the 2G scam and is in prisonPhotographs : Adnan Abidi/Reuters <h> The media may be turning populist <p> The burden of my song has been to draw attention to the fact that the impressive growth of Indian media in recent years has not been matched by a similar rise in professional standards , both on the editorial side and in business ethics and practices of media firms , and media accountability . <p> As a consequence , despite the phenomenal growth of the media and the high visibility of media personalities , the public regard for journalists has not in fact risen . A recent poll in the US and UK rated ' nursing ' as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least ethical ones ! <p> I have not been able to find a similar poll in India , but the result is unlikely to be very different . Concerns about corruption in the media are just beginning to surface . When a couple of cases get exposed their impact on the credibility of our profession would be hugely destructive . <p> Because of all these trends , Indian journalism is presently facing a crisis of both credibility and competence . In the past few years we have witnessed increased public scrutiny of the executive , the legislature and even the judiciary . More recently we have witnessed some early signs of a similar scrutiny of the media . <p> The cynicism and anger that have come to characterise public criticism of the other three ' estates ' will sooner rather than later be seen in the criticism of the media . Each of the ' four estates ' have from time to time drawn public attention to the shortcomings of others . Sometimes three of the four have combined to bring the fourth to heel . <p> So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the executive , legislature and the judiciary in a joint bid to discipline or rein in the media . During the emergency , when media was under attack , the judiciary was in fact an ally of the media . When the Rajiv Gandhi government proposed an anti-defamation law , the entire media stood as one and with support from other political parties resisted the move . <p> Today , the media will find it more difficult to defend itself against such scrutiny and regulation . The day may not be far when public opinion will demand more accountability and transparency on the part of media organisations . With public opinion on its side , the executive and/ or the judiciary may well begin to demand such accountability from the business and editorial heads of media organisations , and from prominent television anchors and columnists , not to mention the regular reporters . <p> What is worrying , however , is that in response to such public anger and cynicism the media may be turning populist -- a standard response of a politician -- in an attempt to ingratiate itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Media populism is in part a response to public anger and , paradoxically , a response to public disdain and indifference . <h> Indian media must look within , introspect and rediscover <p> To an extent this is the logical culmination of the phenomenon of qualitative development not keeping pace with quantitative growth . The ' dumbing down ' of the media brings in its train disregard for it , disrespect for it , disenchantment with it . This makes the media ripe for greater regulation . <p> If Indian media wish to avert this threat , then it must look within , introspect and rediscover professional values . This is easier said than done . It is not because of a lack of will that this has not happened . There is often no incentive for such introspection and no reward for mending ways . <p> The good thing , however , is that we live in a society and a nation in which we have the freedom to debate these issues . In paying tribute to the memory of Sharada Prasad , my generation must pay tribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for posterity . <p> Shouri was a freedom-fighter , like Kamalamma Sharada Prasad 's wife , like my father and my grandfather and grandmother . Their generation was the architect of a unique experiment in human history -- building a vibrant and liberal democracy in a diverse and stratified society , a backward and poor economy . Shouri epitomised by the best instincts of that generation , symbolising the liberalism and pluralism of a generation that was inspired by Gandhiji to value High Thinking and Simple Living . <p> These values are under threat and the media is not doing enough to protect them . By encouraging those with contending view points to argue with each other , we are not doing enough to create greater consensus between conflicting views . <p> The greatness of the Indian people is not that we are argumentative , as Amartya Sen has celebrated with an eye to a global audience . The real greatness of the Indian people is that we are in fact consensual . Merely because we invented the ' Zero ' and made possible the binary 1:0 system , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Indian mind sees the world in black and white . Thinkers like Sharada Prasad have always reminded us of the range of gray possibilities in comprehending the reality around us . <p> The day the Indian media moves away from its binary world view , its argumentative ' me and you ' divides , and moves closer to the consensual frameworks of reference of a people who have always valued the idea of Sarva Dharma Sambhava -- of Unity in Diversity -- it will have created a new paradigm , a very Indian paradigm , in the world of communication . <p> That would be the best tribute we can pay to a great Indian , a truly renaissance man , a liberal scholar , a non-argumentative Indian like Sharada Prasad ! <p> Dr Sanjaya Baru is the editor of the Business Standard <p> Image : Indian Sikh pilgrims wave to onlookers during the Baisakhi festivalPhotographs : Mohsin Raza/Reuters

@@4108232 <h> Tax issues with owning more than one property <p> There are no restrictions on the number of properties you can own either under the general laws or under the income tax laws . <p> This article idea triggered from a simple query -- how many properties a person can own ? On the face of it , the answer is even simpler -- as many as you want . There are no restrictions on the number of properties you can own either under the general laws or under the income tax laws . <p> Here arises another question - How many properties for which you can take a home loan ? There are also no restrictions in this respect either under Income Tax Act or regulations of the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) . However , there are some tax implications under the provisions of income tax laws and wealth tax laws for owning more than one house . <p> In this article I would like to cover the subject of ownership of more than one property and its implications . <p> Deduction in respect of repayment of principal of home loan Presently , the income tax laws allow you an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housing loan . This amount also covers the amount you paid on registration and stamp duty for any residential property . As per my understanding of the provisions , there are no restrictions in respect of the number of properties for which this deduction can be claimed . Please note that this deduction is available together with the other items of expense and investments eligible for deduction like life insurance premium , school fees for two children , contribution towards PPF , Provident Fund , NSC , etc . It is important to know that you can claim this deduction only if the loan has been taken from banks , housing finance companies and other specified entities . This deduction can only be claimed after you have taken possession of the property . You are not eligible to claim any tax benefits , even if you have started repaying the principal amount of the loan , unless the construction is complete . <p> Repayments of loan taken by you from your friends and relatives are not eligible for this deduction . <p> The deduction in respect of repayment of housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Code ( DTC ) . So , for all practical purposes , this deduction on principal repayments is available for only one more year if the DTC gets implemented as per schedule . <p> Deduction for interest payment You can claim deduction in respect of interest on loans taken for the purpose of purchase or construction of any property . This deduction is also available in respect of interest on loans taken for the purpose of reconstruction , repairs and renovation . The interest payment can be claimed for any house property and not necessarily residential house property . However , if you own a house property which is occupied by you , then you can claim a deduction for interest up to 1.5 lakh . In case you have more than one house property , the tax treatment is different . If you own more than one house property and all are occupied by you , then you have to exercise an option to choose one of the property as self-occupied and the other properties will be treated as let-out , for which a notional rental income is required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case the other property or properties are let out , the actual rent received is taxable . Also , there is a difference with regard to tax treatment for interest paid on loan taken for such properties . In respect of the properties , which are either let out or deemed to have been let out , you can claim the whole of interest paid as deduction against the notional rent or actual rent received . Under the proposed DTC , the interest on house property will be allowable only if the other property is let out . That means you will not be able to claim any interest paid in respect of other properties which are not actually let out . However , the deduction up to 1.5 lakh will continue to be available in respect of one self-occupied house property . <p> In this case , even if you have borrowed money for the house from your friends or relatives , you will be able to claim tax benefits on such loans . <p> Exemption from capital gains The present income tax laws allow you an exemption from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property . The exemption is available in respect of sale of two types of assets . The first class includes long-term capital gains arising on sale of residential house properties . There is no restriction as to the number of residential houses you can own for claiming this exemption . The second class includes assets other than residential house properties . You are not eligible to claim the exemption in respect of long-term capital gains on such assets in case you own more than one house in addition to the house which is being purchased for claiming this exemption . <p> Provision under Wealth Tax ActA few of you only would be aware of the existence of wealth tax as only a few people are covered under the ambit of wealth tax due to exclusion of various financial assets and a high minimum slab limit . However , as far as tax on value of house property is concerned , the Wealth Tax Act provides for exemption of one house from levy of tax . There is no limit on the value up to which your one house enjoys the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be 1 lakh or 100 crore . However , the exemption is available in respect of one house property in case you own more than one -- you have an option to choose one of the houses as exempt and offer the value of the other house for wealth tax . All the commercial properties are exempt from wealth tax . In case you own more than one house and the others were let out during the previous year for a minimum period of 300 days , it also is exempt from wealth tax . <p> However , in case the value of the second house together with other assets is not more than Rs30 lakh , you still do not have to pay any wealth tax as the total value of the assets does not exceed the basic exemption limit . <p> So , each member of your family can own a house in his/her independent capacity and thus the tax benefits of owning a single house can be retained by each of the adult members in the family . <p> Balwant Jain is CFO , ApnaPaisa.com , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be reached **28;197;TOOLONG 
@@4108233 <h> Review : City of God is a good watch <p> It seems to be the phase of complicated narratives in the Malayalam film industry . <p> The unprecedented success of Traffic early this year started the trend and now , filmmakers will not stop until they milk the idea dry . The story -- being told in multiple perspectives with multiple plots running parallel -- heads for thematic as well as literal collision in the climax . <p> The latest addition to explore this idea is City of God , directed by Lijo Jose Pellissery ( the director who made a promising debut with last year 's Nayakan , starring Indrajith ) and written by Babu Janardhanan . Still , it is to the credit of the writer-director team to make a story full of grey characters with unpredictable temperaments that it slowly works on us . <p> The story consists of characters found on the fringes of society . They may be an essential part of any growing city like Kochi yet they never disturb the equanimity that the upper strata live in . <p> There is Jyothilal ( Prithviraj ) , who is a criminal working for a rich real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dirty work for his boss . He is a kind of soul-keeper for drug abusing Sony . <p> At the other end of the spectrum is Swarnavel ( Indrajith ) , a Tamilian who works on a construction site .

She seduces a young man to be her partner-in-crime . <p> The narrative keeps moving back and forth , with scenes being repeated from various angles denoting the point of view of the characters or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace is meditative and taxing for the lay viewer , who has been spoon-fed with every development in the plot being underscored by dialogues or background music . But here the viewer is required to invest his intellect and undivided attention to grasp the proceedings . <p> Added to this the conventional technique is done away with . When we expect a high octane action at the end of a scene , our hero just gets up and walks away , defusing the situation . <p> Almost three-fourth of this film is shot in Tamil with the colony of migrant labourers as the backdrop . We can easily see the influence of maverick director Mysskin in capturing the raw and loud emotions is concerned . <p> Indrajith hogs the limelight as Swarnavel . He seems to be the loudmouthed emotional guy with a mirth-spreading personality . Prithviraj as Jyothilal is a brooding kind of a man who tends to weigh his words before they fall out of his mouth , which suits him very well . Rajeev Pillai holds his turf very well in the ensemble cast . <p> All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are equally as far as progression of the plot is concerned . Rima as the heroine who can hide her despair and the signs of physical abuse beneath the dab of mascara is perfectly cast . Swetha as the sweet-talking but shrewd businesswoman does charm .

@@4108235 <h> Geospatial Technology : The Land of Milk and Honey <p> By Becky Shumate , GISP <p> Ed. note : This article originally appeared in the February 16 , 2011 issue of GISCI Newsletter and is reprinted here by permission . <p> " GIS , is n't that the thingy that uses the satellites ? " Yes , we have all heard it , and is usually the result of our response to the " what do you do " question . As we struggle to describe or define our geospatial jobs and professions to industry " outsiders " and often times over-simplifying these descriptions , you might be surprised to find out that a definition has been written for us by the Geospatial Workforce Development Center at the University of Southern Mississippi . So the next time your mother-in-law or Great Aunt Flossy asks what you do for fun ( a.k.a. a living ) , simply say , " I am a member of an ' information technology field of practice that acquires , manages , interprets , displays , analyzes , or otherwise uses data focusing on the geographic , temporal , and spatial context ' " . And follow-up with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> However , after the Dept. of Labor 's Employment and Training Administration ( ETA ) tagged Geospatial Technologies as a " High Growth Industry " in March of 2010 , maybe the new response will be " Yeah , I 've heard of that . Pretty cool stuff " . Reality or wishful thinking ? Reality . The ETA is responsible for the federal job training and worker dislocation programs , as well as , unemployment benefits and other public employment services and has estimated that the geospatial technology profession will experience a growth of over 330,000 geospatial professionals between 2008 and 2018 . This growth figure would bring the number of geospatial professionals to just under 1.2 million and is supported by similar estimates by other geospatial organizations . As quoted by the Geospatial Information &amp; Technology Association ( GITA ) , " uses for geospatial technology are so widespread and diverse , the market is growing at an annual rate of almost 35 percent , with the commercial subsection of the market expanding at the rate of 100 percent each year . " <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The ETA also estimates that the job growth is increasing at roughly the same rate as the entry of new geospatial professionals . Otherwise , how can our industry accommodate an additional 330,000 new professionals competing for the same jobs ? In their " Identifying and Addressing Workforce Challenges in America 's Geospatial Technology Sector " report revised in November of 2005 , ETA identifies a need for a standard description of credentials , experience , and training necessary to work in the geospatial industry . The GISP certification issued by the non-partisan GIS Certification Institute has filled this need . At a quick glance , a geospatial professional 's minimum knowledge , experience , and credentials will immediately be indicated by the four letters following their name ( " GISP " ) . <p> What does a " GISP " signify ? As in the medical field , the letters following a name is an indication of that individual 's credentials and that he or she has met certain requirements specified in their field by fellow colleagues . Similar to the " M.D. " that follows a doctors ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name describe an individual as having at least four years experience working in the geospatial industry , at least 1,200 hours of either formal or supplemental education specifically for the geospatial field , as well as , a significant presence and participation in the field through publications , association involvement , and conference participation . The bare bones of it are that a valid GISP certification means that the individual has been " vetted " by other geospatial professionals and has met the requirements specified in their field by fellow geospatial colleagues . In today 's working environment where managers are rolling up their sleeves and getting their elbows dirty , no manager that I know would ever turn down help vetting an applicant . The GISP certification is essentially a " professional reference " for geospatial professionals . Any applicant that would knowingly " pass " on a professional reference from a certification board made up of fellow geospatial professionals , most likely would not make the grade in your organization.That is the long , short , and straight of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@4123235 <p> The stereotypical image of Muslim women depicts them as frail and fragile , trapped within the four walls of their homes . But Kaneez Fathima and Rafat Seema powerfully fracture such images . They are not only standing firmly on their feet as professional working women , but also fighting boldly for justice for the oppressed sections of society . <p> Last month , I met Kaneez Fathima and Dr Rafat Seema , two young women from Hyderabad , at a workshop in Bangalore on Muslim women . Kaneez is a librarian by profession and a firebrand civil liberties activist , while Rafat is general secretary of the newly-formed Nisa Research and Resource Centre for Women , with which Kaneez , too , is associated . <p> Rarely , I must remark , does one encounter Muslims doing constructive grassroots activism , and that is what makes Kaneez and Rafat so different and , of course , so special .

During the spell of communal violence in Hyderabad and Secunderabad last year , the Centre distributed ration kits to the poorest of the poor as well as financial aid to poor women , Muslims and non-Muslims . <p> Currently , Nisa is focusing its efforts among the under-privileged groups who require help , apart from functioning as a research and resource centre engaged in research studies , consultancy , advocacy and policy intervention on women- related issues with the support of NGOs , funding agencies and the corporate sector . <p> On March 8 , this year , to mark International Women ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bilingual ( English and Urdu ) ?

@@4135230 <h> The Fuss about the 4-2-3-1 Formation <h> Subscription Error <h> Subscription Error <h> Report Errors <p> Use this window to let us know of any feedback about the content . <p> So what 's this fuss about 4-2-3-1 ? Why do people think that a formation can change the fortune of a team like England.Well the most widely used formation in international football is 4-2-3-1 and the top clubs in Europe have been using variations of 4-2-3-1 over the past decade except of course the English clubs until recently who prefer the classic 4-4-2 . In a tactical sense , England is way behind Spain as Spain adopted the 4-2-3-1 as early as 2000 . English pundits still regard playing 5 in midfield as defensive and is not looked upon kindly in the Premier League . <p> The Evolution <p> The trend of making their second striker as the play maker emerged in the 1986 world cup and of course Maradona was the most famous example , and once more and more teams started adopting this -- the coming of 4-2-3-1 was inevitable . So then teams played a holding mid player to pick up the playmaker and the striker up lone used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle , so to prevent that there were two holding midfield players and there was born the Double Pivot . And slowly but surely teams realised the importance of having possession and not being over run in the midfield and many turned to the 4-2-3-1 . Of course every manager and every team had their own interpretations of this system . <p> The Double Pivot <p> The efficiency and the compactness that the double pivot provides makes it vital to have in the modern game . The double pivot actually is the usage of two holding mid-fielders in front of the defence . One generally more creative than the other and is termed as the " Deep Lying Playmaker " . All the 4 semifinalists at the 2010 World Cup used the double pivot . Spain , Holland and Germany all made their own interpretations of the 4-2-3-1 whereas Uruguay played with a classic 4-4-2 but unlike England whose Central Midfielders had to go forward and support their strikers , the Uruguayan central midfielders stayed back and acted as a double pivot . This statistic shows the importance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern game . Actually the use of double pivot depends lot on the two players involved as in a double pivot each player does n't have a definite role , either of them can stay back and either of them can make a forward run depending on the situation . But the roles may vary from team to team . <p> The most important role and generally the best player is the attacking midfielder or the advanced playmaker.He has to have great vision , creativity , the ability to see a pass and generally should have a good finish too.Wesley Sneijder ( Netherlands , Inter ) , Xavi(Spain) , Fabregas(Arsenal) , Ozil ( Madrid , Germany ) are accomplished players who perform this role effectively.There are two important tactical points to be noted here <p> The CAM , because he plays between the lines or as one can say between the defense and the midfield , can get the opposition into a conundrum . He drags either a center back or one of the pivots from out of his position . <p> If the CAM drops deep then it helps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do when playing teams like Barcelona , this also prevents your midfield from getting overrun . <p> The False 10 <p> We all know about the false 9 ( a striker who drops deep to create space for other players to exploit ) , but in the World Cup there emerged a new tactic-the false 10 . The false 10 's break forward from deeper parts of the pitch to exploit the gaps created in the opposition defence by the false nine 's movement . Sneijder , Ozil and Keisuke Honda perfomed this role quite admirably . But the man who is master of this role is Lionel Messi for Argentina ( By the way he is an excellent false 9 for Barcelona ) . <p> As you can see both Ozil and Sneijder 's positions are quite same as their striker 's , so this proves the theory of the false 10 . <p> Variations of the 4-2-3-1 <p> There have been a number of variations of the 4-2-3-1 by manager of various clubs and international sides . Lets look at some of them . <p> The Strikerless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Sir Alex Ferguson in the 2007-08 season , here the front three i.e Rooney , Ronaldo and Tevez used to drop into midifield and then depending on the situation took turns to play as the striker . The ability of all the three player to either play on the wings or up front meant that SAF could use this tactic to a great effect . Although United used it to great effect and won the Double that season , Roma under were the ones who initially perfected it . <p> Dunga 's 4-2-3-1 <p> Dunga 's Brazil was not very popular back home , as they were looked up as a defensive minded unit not playing the samba-style football their fans are used to seeing . Europeans viewed Brazil 's formation as a 4-2-3-1 with Gilberto and Melo as the pivots , Ramires ( or Elano ) , Kaka and Robinho supporting the lone forward Luis Fabiano.But the Brazilians insisted on describing their system as a diamond . They saw Gilberto as the base , Melo on the left and Ramires on the right as carrileros ( the shuttlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the tip of the diamond ( Play maker ) and Robinho as the second striker.As we can see below both the views are correct . <p> Mourinho 's 4-2-3-1 <p> Jose Mourinho adopts a defensive approach in his 4-2-3-1 ( Real Madrid , Inter ) by using 2 holding midfielders and basing the attack on a disciplined counter attack . He used it to great effect at Inter and it a work in progress at Real . <p> How does one play against the 4-2-3-1 ? <p> The easiest way to play against a side playing 4-2-3-1 would be to play 4-2-3-1 ourselves . But if the opposition is of higher quality then we would stand no chance.The W-W formation is an effective way to combat the 4-2-3-1 . The W-W which Barcelona have mastered recently was actually used in the 1930s , as they say history does repeat itself . <p> Whatever the tactical system is the players who are on the pitch have to perform , but having said this the modern game is increasingly being played out in the mind especially the internationals where the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

The audience can happily shut themselves away from their real-life hassles and have a roller-coaster ride of emotions and laughter watching Allari 's and his antics . <p> Incidentally his films have something to talk about : A theme/subject relevant to contemporary times , woven seamlessly to induce hilarity much to the audience 's delight . Seema Tapakai , his latest release , too falls in the same category -- a story with a message and thoroughly entertains in the first half and adds a tinge of seriousness in the second half . <p> Director Nageswara Rao has ensured that Naresh 's success streak more or less continues with Seema Tapakai and also introduces a new heroine Poorna ( a known name in Tamil film industry ) in Telugu . <p> GK ( Sayaji Shinde ) is a crorepati who wants to amass more wealth . Though he lives well with his family , he is stingy when it comes to parting with money or doing charity . One of his sons Krishna ( Naresh ) falls in love with Satya ( Poorna ) . Satya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and espouses for their wealth to be distributed amongst the poor and the needy . <p> She teaches slum children and does whatever she can for the betterment of the poor .

They wear tattered clothes , sell Mirchi bhajias , bananas , flowers , iron clothes etc. , all so that Krishna could earn Satya 's affections . Since the family loves Krishna they do it for him at his behest . <p> Later it is revealed that Satya is the daughter of a factionist ( Nagineedu ) and her uncle Rao Ramesh saves her from being kidnapped . Krishna comes to know this story but hides it from his family . There is enough bloodshed , revenge etc as another factionist Venkatappa ( Jayaprakash Reddy ) too pitches in . <p> Will the lovers unite against all the opposition ? Well , you got to check @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice laugh riot . It 's enjoyable to watch Naresh 's antics to woo Satya . At times one feels there 's an overdose of the anti-crorepati mouthed by the leading lady . The director ensures that there are no dreary moments in the first half . <p> The second half does become a bit sentimental and melodramatic , though . <p> There are quite a few songs -- one of them reminiscent of yesteryear backdrop and costume . The dialogues induce laughs . Of course there 's Brahmanandam to add more to it although his role is not properly etched and sounds repetitive . MS Narayana and LB Sriram add their share of comedy . <p> Naresh can sleepwalk through such roles . He is convincing in whatever he does generally .

Uday Bhaskar is Director of the New Delhi-based National Maritime Foundation . The views expressed in the column are his own . ) <p> By C.

Global opprobrium followed in intense measure and New Delhi with Atal Bihari Vajpayee at the helm as the Prime Minister was ostracised . The U.S. led by President Bill Clinton gravely warned India that it had dug itself into a huge hole by going ' nuclear ' -- for Pakistan would soon follow suit and that South Asia would become the most dangerous place in the world . <p> However , contrary to the popular and assiduously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only catching up with Pakistan and redressing the nuclear asymmetry between the two that had grown in Rawalpindi 's favour since May 1990 . <p> Pakistan 's army had acquired credible SNW status on May 26 , 1990 and this development has been documented in rigorous detail by two respected U.S. authors , Thomas Reed of Lawrence Livermore Laboratory and Danny Stillman of Las Vegas Laboratory in their book " Nuclear Express " published in January 2009 . <p> The authors corroborated the view held among some nuclear experts that China had tested a weapon design for Pakistan on May 26 , 1990 and that this was part of a complex and deliberately tangled nuclear proliferation lattice among Cold War rivals that had its genesis in the U.S. nuclear enormity of August 1945 . <p> Thus two myths have to be revisited . South Asia had become nuclear well before May 1998 and China , the first Asian nuclear weapon power ( 1964 ) had created a ' southern ' Asian nuclear grid that enabled Pakistan and led to the A.Q.

The worst case scenario was the exigency of the non-state entity acquiring nuclear weapons through a deviant state and using the same to advance a terrorist agenda . <p> Iraq became the target in 2003 and even at the time , more objective voices within the U.S. and elsewhere pointed out that like OBL in Abbottabad - the NWET elephant in the drawing room was the Pak army - but there were no takers . The true believers drew their certitude about matters nuclear in southern Asia from a different narrative and marched to a different drum . <p> The ' treasure trove ' of data and information retrieved from OBL 's mansion in Abbottabad may contain some definitive clues about how determined and close the al Qaeda was to the nuclear weapon or material and the degree to which the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twin tower collapse in September 2011 was laden with multi-textured import for OBL -- pun unintended -- and NWET the most attractive and effective option . <p> OBL has been interred to a watery grave but the malignancy of NWET is a reality that has to be dealt with adroitly . The Pak army has created a virtual reality of cultivated paranoia , where it is the eternal victim of external perfidy , and Galahad-like valour as savior of the state and the Islamic faith -- a domain that it inhabits in menacing isolation . <p> Rawalpindi has to be weaned away from the nuclear weapon capability that it acquired in May -- covertly in 1990 and overtly in 1998 and the corrosive strategy it has chosen . <p> And this can be done only if the many nuclear myths and related narratives apropos southern Asia are revisited with honesty and humility . <h> Trending On Reuters <h> TACKLING POLLUTION <p> India asked authorities in and around its capital on Wednesday to crack down immediately on overloaded trucks , illegally parked cars and vehicles emitting visible smoke in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

From being a ruling party , it is not even the State 's main Opposition party today . Vijaykanth 's DMDK , which won 29 seats ( six more than the DMK ) , has bagged this privilege as the second largest party in the Assembly . <p> The 2G scam and domination of DMK chief M Karunanidhi 's family members in different fields including television , cinema , and their alleged amassing of wealth through various illegal activities cost the party dearly in the polls . <p> So , is it time to write the DMK 's epitaph then ? Not really . The DMK has got quite a bit of fight left in it and it has the ability to pick up the pieces and rebuild itself . <p> That way , the DMK and the AIADMK are similar to each other . Both are cadre based parties that have weathered many storms . In the 1996 assembly polls , the AIADMK had lost even more badly . The AIADMK-Congress alliance had won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The DMK along with Tamil Maanila Congress of G K Moopanar had won a landslide victory . The major reason attributed to Jayalalithaa 's defeat was the rampant corruption that had prevailed during her tenure . <p> Actor Rajnikanth had famously said during the run-up to the polls that even God could not save Tamil Nadu if Jayalalithaa were to be re-elected . Of course , Jayalalithaa returned to power in 2001 , lost in 2006 , and is back again with a thumping majority in 2011 . <p> Jayalalithaa fought the corruption cases filed against her in court and has been acquitted in all but a lone disproportionate wealth case which is pending in a Bangalore court . <p> Karunanidhi also has faced corruption charges in the past . He was indicted by the Sarkaria Commission for favouring a contractor in the Veeranam water supply project in the 1970s when he was chief minister . <p> The Sarkaria Commission had noted : " It has been established that Shri . Karunanidhi , abusing his official position as chief minister , actuated with the motive to unduly favour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Veeranam project , directed the chief engineer , Shri . Hussain , to tailor his recommendations on the tenders in such a manner as would enable the Government to accept the tender of Sathyanarayana Bros ... There is no doubt that Shri . Karunanidhi was interested in the contract being given to Sathyanarayana Bros. for some extraneous consideration . " <p> The point is that both the DMK and the AIADMK have faced charges of corruption in the past , but have still managed to come back to power . It has been the pattern in Tamil Nadu because there is no other party that has the capacity to challenge the two . When people get fed up with the corruption of one party , they have voted for the other . <p> The DMDK , which projected itself as an alternative to the two Dravidian parties , let down those looking for a change by aligning with the AIADMK . The DMDK has a long way to go to catch up with either the DMK or the AIADMK in terms of voter support . <p> Only the politically naive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just because it has emerged as the second largest party in the current assembly .

@@4149239 <h> Take maternity coverage with low waiting period <p> While buying health insurance , the policyholder mainly compares the features available under various products and premium payable for each one of them . In the past few months one distinct feature that has come to fore is the maternity coverage . Although all insurers under their retail product lines do not provide this , it is being provided by all three standalone health insurers , Star Health and Allied insurance company ( Star Wedding Gift Insurance Policy ) , Apollo Munich Health Insurance Company ( Easy Health Family Floater Exclusive and Platinum Plan ) and Max Bupa Health Insurance Company ( Heartbeat Family Floater Plan ) . <p> An FCRB analysis reveals whether taking a health insurance policy to get coverage for maternity expenses is practical or not .

BL Kapur Memorial Hospital in central Delhi , charges around Rs 20,000 to 22,000 for normal and Rs 35,000 to Rs 37,000 for caesarean . Holy Family Hospital in South Delhi , charges around Rs 12,000 to Rs 14,000 for normal and Rs 24,000 to Rs 28,000 for caesarean . In these charges , the expense for medicine , room charges , doctor 's fees , dietician and pediatrician 's fees , medical investigation charges , operation theatre charges and nursing expenses are included . <p> In order to get coverage for maternity and delivery charges , one has to opt for family health insurance policy and wait for a few years before becoming eligible to claim the same from the insurance company . <p> Apollo Munich has the longest waiting period of four years , while in Star Health it is three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is two years . <p> The analysis shows that the average premium for a couple of around 27 years of age , the premium for a plain vanilla family health insurance policy with Rs 3,00,000 sum insured comes to Rs 4,700 .

The new Baul singers have not been taught the incredible historical legacy that is The Bauls of Bengal , indeed , many are more interested in how they look or how they can make themselves a celebrity . There is no Bengal without Baul , and there is no Baul without Bengal . There is a soul connection between the Bauls and the soil of Bengal .

Baul roots are not only deep , they are ancient .

Kirtan is not just call and response chanting , it is about telling the stories of Radha and Krishna , the stories of all the scriptures . Who is Ram and Sita ? What did they do ? What are their stories ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeds of Indian . <p> Baul philosophy . Songs as seeds of wisdom and philosophy is a profound exemplification of what it is to be Baul . The seeds grow into the tree called Baul Sadhana , and without the seeds or the roots in song a tree will never grow . It is these roots I am determined to preserve for future generations . <p> The truth is well known in Bengal that Shri Nityananda , or Nitai born in Ekchhaka , Birbhum , West Bengal in the 1400-1500 's , was a Baul . Shri Nityananda inspired his best friend , a scholar by the name of Shri Chaitanya Dev , or Gauranga . As best friends Sri Nityananda shared the Hare Krishna Mahamantra with Shri Chaitanya Dev , along with our Hare Krishna song , dance and Baul sadhana . Baul is an oral tradition passed on through sanskrit , word of mouth , hearing and remembering , as in storytelling . An oral tradition is not like a book tradition . The books reside instead within our memory , alive in as much as we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vaishnava reformers . These writers and reformers never had a connection to the oral tradition or the roots of Baul . The way of the Baul is the way of the Rasa Lila Mystics , the original Hare Krishna singers and dancers in Bengal . Bauls accept all , feed all , even adopting those who are rejected by mainstream society . A Baul is never pedantic . We never say we are better or that Krishna is better than Shiva . Rather , we encourage people . We are not preachers who gather people for the sake of collecting devotees or collecting money to build temples . Bauls want everybody to be a free bird , to reconnect to the divine within . Bauls speak of love and connectivity , but more importantly , they demonstrate these truths in their every interaction . <p> Shri Nityananda , being a Brahmin Lineage Baul when he met Chaitanya , was already dancing and singing the Mahamantra as his ancestors had been for almost 5,000 years . This song and dance organically and spontaneously flowed to Shri Chaitanya . Now I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nityananda and Sri Chaitanya . They have been completely written out of Vaishnava history . I am also seeing Sri Nityananada being left out of the story by some modern writers stating Shri Chaitanya is the only father of modern day kirtan , but the Bauls carry on without these words , in song and action , as is our way . <p> Babu Kishan aka Krishnendu Das Baul is a Baul Guru , Master of , Indian Folk , Classical , and Bollywood music . He has produced , promoted , composed for all the top Bollywood Indian Cinema 's musican 's and singers . He is the first Baul to compose Fusion Music , receive a modern education with a BA in Indian Philosophy , MA in Indian Music , the first Baul to live in North America . As a Music Director , Composer , for Indian Cinema for 30 years , he has composed over 150 scores , produced 44 albums . A prolific writer , poet , and author of 3 books on Baul .

The launch comes as the premium bike segment in the country welcomed a new player , S&amp;T Motors from Korea or better known for their Hyosung brand of bikes . Hyosung in collaboration with Garaware Motors launched two bikes in the range of Rs 4.75 to Rs 5.69 ex-showroom .

Till date , Bajaj Auto has been able to sell 1500 units of the Ninja 250R in the country . That said , the Ninja 250R is actually a sportsbike unlike the CBR250R which is a sport-tourer with a more upright riding position compared to the sport posture of the Ninja .

Since everything starts somewhere , it might be worth remembering that Pepsi 's Dil Maange More ! was more than an advertising slogan in India . It was a catalyst of change that heralded in an era of cool marketing . Coke followed with Life Ho To Aisi . About a decade later , Pepsi is still ahead of the game with its latest and very hip Youngistan Ka Wow ! -- a tagline that speaks to the rising , confident youth of India Shining . <p> On the Canadian front , Telus , a telecommunications company , spearheaded this trend by running Hinglish ads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada 's growing South Asian community . Given the shifting demographics and dynamics of today 's multicultural markets , most companies and institutions are keen to make diversity work towards increasing their bottom line . <p> After all , finding the right message that strikes a chord with consumers is an age-old marketing strategy . In other words , ads need to be culture-specific and insight-driven . So when Rogers took the iconic line from the classic Hindi movie , Sholay , to market to the South Asian segment , it delivered a cultural connection . Creative expression together with a language that speaks to the soul of the community builds great synergy . <p> TD bank urged South Asians to " Double your mazaa " by doubling their travel rewards with the TD Canada Trust Gold Travel Visa card .

Though they are eager to capitalize on diversity , they fail to capture the festive spirit . Bell Canada showed how a little flair can go a long way . " Put some bang in your bhangra , " said Bell to those celebrating Vaisakhi this year , enriching their tagline -- " Bell celebrating just got better . " <p> The telecom and banking industries have until now been the front-runners in multicultural advertising , but of late several other companies are joining the trend . Gautam Nath , a partner at Monsoon Communications who looks after branding and growth strategies , says that there is a growing interest from consumer products companies , retailers , real estate and the media . Nath , named one of Canadian Immigrant magazine 's Top 25 Immigrants for 2011 , notes that more and more businesses want to provide meaningful ads to the target markets , and for that he says , " companies are realizing the need to use professional agencies to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more relevant communication for this segment . " His agency developed " Kraft ka khana " to define a new series of recipes for South Asians . <p> Smuckers Foods of Canada ran a commercial in Hinglish for their Golden Temple brand of atta that explored multi-generational family ties . " Ma kehti hai the best rotis come from ... Golden Temple atta " showcased the tender nurturing bond between a mother , daughter and granddaughter . <p> Though I find myself drawn towards Hinglish ads , Robin Brown , senior vice president , consumer insights , at Environics Research Group , cautions that companies must use Hinglish selectively . What 's more essential , he said , is to understand the immigrant experience , address their goals and challenges , and acknowledge their optimism and anxiety . Choosing the language to communicate these influences then becomes a secondary consideration . South Asians , he also noted , tend to be more sensitive to " in language " advertising compared to Chinese Canadians who accept it more easily . <p> Elsewhere , aside from advertising , Hinglish has worked its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year OMNI Television premiered Just for Laughs ' first Hinglish standup comedy show for a bilingual audience .

But if you 've never heard of these words before , help is at hand in the form of a reference guide , The Queen 's Hinglish : How to Speak Pukka , by Baljinder K. Mahal . A talented young friend , Abeer Khetrapal , enjoys blending English and Hindi words to create unique coinages . For example , " door " mixed with " darwaza " ( Hindi for door ) becomes " doorwaza , " and " ice " combined with " tootna " ( Hindi for : to break ) is " icetooters " ( icebreakers ) . While the semantics of these constructions is interesting , it gives Hinglish a totally new spin . <p> As the multicultural advertising trend catches fire , adding more linguistic flavour to Toronto 's melting pot , who 'll be next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 'll come knocking at our doorwaza ?

We believe that real estate presently is going through very challenging phase in NCR &amp; markets like Mumbai attributing to oversupply and customers ' preference for ready for possession or close to completion projects when making decision for buying their home . However , there is good realty demand from Tier II and III cities as these destinations promise substantial growth opportunity . Besides this , the housing in the range of Rs. 15 -- 25 lakh will continue to get maximum attention and will primarily drive the sector in years to come .

Omaxe presently has access to more than 5,000 acres of land ( including approx. 145 mn sq . ft. of saleable area and approx. 700 acres of land for future developments ) . However , part of it was completed in FY 2011 ( 22.66 mn ) and another 17 -- 18 mn will be completed in FY 2012 .

The list is a cause of concern for Sikhs as it prevents many from the Sikh diaspora from visiting their families in Punjab . <p> Lakhwinder Singh Gill , a Canadian citizen , has recently fell victim of the limitations considered to be imposed by list . His father , Atma Singh , expired after years long illness , on 19 June but Lakhwinder was not permitted to attend his father 's funeral . <p> Lakhwinder , a resident of Village Bharowal in Ludhiana District , left India for the first time in November 1995 for England .

This list was sent of State Government 's review and it was believed that names of all the persons " blacklisted " were on this list . Even at that time the issue was raised by certain Sikh bodies that either the Government had not sent the names of all the persons for State Government 's review or they were keeping a " secret blacklist " to harass Sikhs . <p> " To our knowledge two persons , Subhneet Kaur of New Zealand and Lakhwinder Singh of Canada , who were denied entry to India and Punjab from Delhi and Amritsar Airports in 2011 and 2009 respectably , were not in the list sent for review " added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He claimed that it is against the principles of natural justice to adjudicate against a person without giving him information about his alleged fault . <p> " Sikhs are being deliberately targeted by the Government of India , through these so-called black lists , which has resulted in violation of their collective and individual rights .

@@4198235 <h> Duckworth-Lewis vs Jayadevan again <p> June 24 , 2011 15:49 IST <p> As the ICC reviews the Duckworth-Lewis ( D/L ) method , it has invited V Jayadevan to Hong Kong on June 27 to present his VJD formula for rain-interrupted ODI matches . Srinivas Bhogle discusses the two formulas . <p> Why are we revisiting this question ? Have n't we talked of this before ? <p> Yes , right here on Rediff some six years ago . But it appears that the ICC has decided to review the Duckworth-Lewis ( D/L ) and Jayadevan ( VJD ) rain rules again . And this time they 've invited Jayadevan to Hong Kong on June 27 to present his VJD method . <p> What 's changed in these past six years ? <p> The big change is that both D/L and VJD methods are now computer-based . You key in all the relevant match details , and the computer tells you what the revised target is . It is no longer simple back-of-the-envelope stuff . <p> The other change is that T20 cricket has come along in a big way . So ICC now has to worry both about ODI and T20 interruptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T20 is just an ODI match in which both teams lose 30 overs each . But it looks as though T20 is a very different sort of animal . <p> How good are the D/L and VJD targets in T20 ? <p> Currently both D/L and VJD set very similar targets , and both need improvement . But VJD will find it easier to adapt to T20 than D/L because of the way it is architected . <p> Why is that ? Why is D/L seemingly struggling with T20 ? <p> I 'll give you an informal answer . I think D/L is too tightly ' stitched together ' , and lacks the flexibility to migrate to T20 ; VJD is more heuristic and will therefore find the T20 migration easier . <p> But let 's return to ODI . Can we agree that D/L now does a good job in ODIs ? <p> Oh , there 's no question about that . The D/L Professional Edition is now stable and respected for ODIs . But the question they 'll ask at Hong Kong is : does D/L 's Professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? All comparisons I 've seen or made tell me that VJD would perform just as well , if not better . Sadly , VJD has never been offered the chance to prove itself in the real international cricket arena . <p> I just heard you say that VJD can do even better than D/L . Can you give me a concrete example ? <p> Ok , here 's a concrete example . Let me be honest and declare that I got this example from Jayadevan . Let me be even more honest and declare that this is a fabricated example . Imagine three ODI situations where Team 1 has respectively reached 56/0 , 62/0 and 67/0 in 20 overs when it starts raining heavily . Team 1 's innings is terminated and Team 2 must be set a target in 20 overs . VJD sets targets respectively of 116 , 124 and 130 for Team 2 , while the corresponding D/L targets are apparently 148 , 147 and 148 . <p> These D/L targets worry me on three counts . First , asking Team 2 to score 148 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 56/0 in 20 overs appears unacceptably high . Second , why should Team 2 's target go down by a run when Team 1 has scored 6 runs more ? Third , why does Team 2 's target remains unchanged at 148 even though Team 1 has scored 11 runs more . This appears to be a serious inconsistency . <p> But surely the D/L method is fully validated now ? <p> Yes , I have no doubt that the D/L algorithm is impeccable . That 's why this inconsistency is almost certainly because the D/L software is misbehaving ( Jayadevan created this example using D/L 's Wincoda 2.0 ) . Jayadevan too agrees that the software is the likely culprit , but he then makes an important observation : once ICC allows the use of software to reset targets , it is the software that must face the examination , not the algorithm ! <p> That 's well put ! <p> Oh , Jayadevan 's clever to be sure . He has the engineer 's instinct . He 's not unduly in love with mathematical models having beautiful continuity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get better and more realistic targets . He says he 's done his job if he gives the most realistic target almost every time . <p> But how does ICC judge this ? Do they have some criteria to compare the rival rain rules ? <p> ICC has stipulated seven criteria : <p> A Reasonability of adjusted targets under a wide range of match scenarios <p> G Overall mathematical robustness of the underlying theory and formulae . <p> Can you restate them in layman 's terms ? <p> ICC 's saying the targets must be fair in all situations ( that 's A ) ; should n't turn wonky if they are reset again and again ( that 's B ) ; should work even if we fiddle with rules , e.g. , by introducing power plays ( D ) ; computers must n't crash , hang , freeze or misbehave ( E ) ; and software should n't unduly delay the match by confusing umpires and scorers ( F ) . <p> I notice that you omitted C and G ? <p> The criterion C is satisfied if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduced by D/L ) that allows you to describe the margin of every ODI victory in terms of runs . But VJD too uses par scores ; so this criterion wo n't influence the contest . <p> I suspect that G , which is saying " do n't cook up your numbers and tables " , has been put in to favour D/L . When Jayadevan 's method was rejected in 2004 , the expert had questioned its ' mathematical robustness ' . Perhaps they could beat VJD with the same stick this time too . <p> To me it is actually a big advantage that the VJD method is heuristic , i.e. based on intelligent use of the trial-and-error method . D/L must be discovering that their mathematical equations are now becoming a beastly burden , especially when they try to use them for T20 situations . <p> So what 's our final verdict ? <p> See the table below . <p> A <p> Reasonability of adjusted targets under a wide range of match scenarios <p> VJD has a slight edge over D/L , although the Professional Edition has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially for interruptions in Team 2 innings ; this is where their beautiful mathematical model helps ! For multiple Team 1 interruptions , however , D/L might struggle . <p> C <p> A suitable method for describing the result of an interrupted match <p> Both D/L and VJD use par scores . So it 's a draw <p> D <p> Compatibility with current or prospective playing regulations <p> Big advantage for VJD , because the model already accommodates the first two power plays , and has instruments to respond to later power plays . Also I see VJD 's T20 version doing better than D/L 's version ? ? ? even though neither might be the best . <p> A draw ! D/L might claim a win because they have the Windows-based Wincoda . In reality , Wincoda 2.0 , with its possible bugs , fares worse than D/L 's excellent DOS-based Coda 7 versions . VJD 's software is DOS-based , but it does the job impeccably ( VJD has no money to develop a Windows version ! ) . <p> F <p> Practical impact on a match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a par score has sunk in . Many scoreboards routinely display the par score , and it does create greater awareness of the state of the match . <p> G <p> Overall mathematical robustness of the underlying theory and formulae <p> It eventually boils down to ensuring that resource percentages diminish monotonically in unison with the ' balls remaining ' and ' wickets remaining ' . Both D/L and VJD satisfy this condition . If D/L question the validity of VJD 's statistical regression fit , we could also ask D/L : what 's so sacred about a parametric model ? <p> I saw your table . But it seems like a lot of technical mumbo-jumbo . Just tell me who wins ? <p> It would obviously depend on what sort of importance or weight one attaches to each criterion . But there 's no doubt that A. is the most important criterion , and here VJD has the edge . Remember too that both D/L and VJD have been intensely studied for a decade ; so if there was something horribly wrong someone would surely have found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now less of a concern . That 's why my vote is again for VJD . <p> We 've spent a dozen years with D/L without ever being entirely satisfied . It 's now time to give the VJD method a chance .

This is the first Oriya Film to be remade in Telgu and was a big hit in South India . <p> During the fifties , one witnessed the advent of socio-mythologicals .

The sixties began with Sri Lokanath which was highly acclaimed . It was also commercially viable .

Based on the conflicting attitudes of two brothers , one an atheist and the another a theist , the wife of the elder brother acting as a catalyst to compromise between to two , it maintened a smooth narrative pattern . The rural milieu was quite convincing . It is also worthy to note that ' Sri Lokanath is first Oriya Cinema , which get first national award in 1960. the decade from 1960 to 1970 was the glorious decade in Oriya Cinema in terms of quality . A number of Oriya films were made on Oriya Novels by popular Novelist like Kanhu Charan Mohanty ( Kaa , Abhinatri ) , Basanti Kumari Pattnaik ( Amadabata ) Upendra Kishore Das ( Mala Janha ) and Kalandi Charan Panigrahi ( Matira Manisha ) to name a few .

Commercially both the film did not do well though they showed a definite attitude in Oriya Cinema . <p> During the seventies , especially after the runway hit , ' Manata ' ( 1975 ) directed by Bymokesh Tripathy of Anapurna Theater fame a sudden rise in rate of film production was observed . Though a number of Oriya film were produced no attempt was made to provide the basic amenities to the producers in the state , this inadequacy stood as a major hurdle for producing more films in Oriya language , though Orissa is a land of scenic beauties having rivers , lakes , golden sea beaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architectural marvels . The Orissa literature enjoys a pride of place in comparison with the classic of other states of the country . To over come the above difficulties and to encourage the upcoming producer in films of Oriya language the Orissa Film Development Corporation Ltd. was established in the year 1976 as a nodal agency for implementing the state policies with a view to promoting the growth of film industries in Orissa . In seventies Oriya Cinema gave birth to its first colour film " Gapa Helevi Sata " ( 1976 ) though ' Samaya ' ( 1975 ) was partially coloured ) . During the mid seventies , Oriya Cinema lost its direction , films were made with the sole intension of doubling the investments , irrespective of quality . This lead to deterioration of Oriya Cinema , were culture value were thrown the winds , and box office culture of the cheap hindi commercial cinema was imported .

Most important event of the Oriya film industry in eighties is arrival of three directors of the " Parallel Cinema " and they have brought the Oriya film industry a fair glory . They were Nirod Mohapatra , Manmohan Mohapatra and Sagir Ahamed all from Pune Film and Television Institute . Nirod Mohapatra 's Maya Miriga in 1984 was mile stone in the history of Oriya Cinema .

Number of theaters did not improve , major banners were disillusioned about the type of film to make . Same entered the small screen . Audience refuse to see the same 6-8 faces in each film . All permutations and combinations ( including introducing non-Oriya Heroine ) had been tried ' Jaatraa ' ( Hindi film style ) was flourishing in both rural and urban areas . Colour lab and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Studio . Video units were also setup by private farms . Thus there was apprehension all round regarding the future of the big screen cinema .

As a director those who have done commendable work for oriya cinema for the last 75 years . Among them Kalyan Gupta , Gopal Ghosh , Prafulla Sen Gupta , Pravat Mukharjee , Sukmar Ganguli , Amar Ganguli , Nitai Palit , Gour Parvati , Sarada Nayak , Nagan Ray , Sisir Mishra , Prasanta Nanda , Md .

But most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Bengali films . Interestingly the most of the recent film producers were in real estate business . For them film is a business like real estate . Though the number of film production is increased but ' Odiyatwa ' regional flovour hardly arose when the place , time and characters were all ' Now Oriya ' . Yet it is heartening to note that many new talents from the film and Television Institute are coming up to take assignments in Oriya Films . The Industry deserves support from all sections of the society to prevent withering away of this flower which had gladdened many hearts and brought joy to many lives , let the platinum year be the harbinger of its blossoming season .

@@4207232 <h> Top 10 ' Angry Young Man ' avatar films of Amitabh Bachchan <p> Bbuddah ... Hoga Tera Baap mark a return for Amitabh to his Angry Young Man roots , so expect some cracking dialogue with plenty of dishoom dishoom from the original maverick ! This revisionist masala films definitely warrants a look back at the many roles Amitabh Bachchan has unleashed his righteous fury . However , with each of these roles , Bachchan offered a different interpretation of his most iconic persona . You could say Bachchan 's Angry Young Man was a successor to the Disillusioned Young Man of the 50s played by Raj Kapoor , Dilip Kumar , and Guru Dutt . Aided by great screenwriters Salim Khan , Javed Akhtar , and directors who knew how draw the best out him ; Amitabh Bachan 's iconic persona is a perfect fusion of all these elements in creating a lasting legacy for Indian cinema . Though the Angry Young Man that Bachchan embodied became an increasing staple in masala films , he echoed many of the frustrations during the Emergency period of the 70s . So here are some of the many Angry Young Men or I 'd coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vijay Verma in Deewaar -- A list would simply be incomplete without mentioning one of Bachchan 's key roles ! When he lounged in the dockyard chair in that iconic pose with a cigarette dangling from his mouth and glaring at the henchmen , an indelible moment of cinema history was created . Just from that scene , Bachchan created a hero who would willingly get into fights and launched a fashion craze of flares and tight shirts revealing a macho hairy chest ! This Vigilante Vijay 's fury over the injustice against his parents by society sends him on a vengeful ascension to the top of Mumbai 's smuggling ring . Ever since Mother India to Ganga Jamuna , one good son and one wayward wastrel and a noble maa is a recipe for masala success , but Salim and Javed 's script blurred the lines of good and evil and you could n't help but sympathize with Vijay . With this film , Bachchan perfected one of many of his memorable death scenes , cradled in his mother 's arms and revealing his innocence , which is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone so positively Byronic would attract another damaged soul in Parveen Babi 's character . The Angry Young Man 's luck with the ladies would improve down the years , but this key role Bachchan makes empathize with such a doomed man and stealing the thunder from his upright brother Ravi ( Shashi Kapoor ) . <p> Inspector Vijay Khanna in Zanjeer -- " Yeh police station , aap ke ghar nahi ! " ( this is a police station , not your home ! ) growls the most famous Vijay to a prisoner . If Deewar fashioned a tragic and stylish persona that shaped all other heroes to come then Zanjeer launched Amitabh Bachchan as an aggressive alternative to voice the collective angst . When his parents are killed , Vijay focuses his obsessive energy onto all the criminals who land up in his jail . This was a hero defied the law to satiate his own rage . Tired of society and its rules , this Angry Young Man was all about the individual which is why it must have been heartening to audiences to see such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Bachchan as he was so unconventional to other actors at the time . He was not muscley like Dharamendra , far too busy for romance unlike Rajesh Khanna , and his acting style harkened back to the method style . Bachchan is a physical actor using his body language to suggest his upset , just look at how energetic the fight scenes are or the quiet intensity that recalls Hollywood method actor John Garfield . Even when the love story elements cropped up , Bachchan 's searing and yearning gaze in the song " Deewano Ko " lets the obvious known that all an Angry Young Man needs is some lovin ' ! <p> Vijay Kumar in Shakti -- One of Amitabh Bachchan 's most overlooked interpretations of the persona is his most matured performances . This toned down revisionist masala film places Bachchan against another titan Dilip Kumar , and it is incredible to watch two of the most talented actors of Indian cinema face off . Kumar and Bachchan match each other and compete too , and it is a revelation to watch their two very different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the film delves into their psychological grievances with each other . The neglect and scorn Vijay feels from his father fuels his new lifestyle as a criminal and to look for a father figure in his gangster boss . It is as if the 70 's Angry Vijay that Bachchan played had mellowed a tad and become far more sullen and bitter for the 80s . It is remarkable to watch Bachchan transition his iconic persona by ushering him into a new grey are and a new decade . <p> Vijay Kumar in Trishul -- Hell hath no fury like a Vijay scorned , is likely the motto of Amitabh Bachchan 's pairing with scriptwriters Salim and Javed and director Yash Chopra . Trishul is no different but loosely based on Karna in the Mahabharat 's struggle for power against his family and it falls aptly in the Angry Young Man mould . On her deathbed , Vijay 's mother reveals he is the illegitimate son of RK Gupta ( Sanjeev Kumar ) who ditched her before he was born . Vijay vows to become his father 's competitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was a startling switch from a hero who turns to crime for his parents or devoted to them , as this Vijay does not care for his father . Bachchan plays this amoral Vijay with maniacal glee complete glaring at everyone around and angry tirades directed at his father ending each with a terse ' Yes Mr RK Gupta ' before storming off . <p> Vijay Dinanath Chauhan in Agneepath -- Mix in a bit of Scarface , a lot of gravely voiced Brando posturing , and a whole lot of Vijay fury and we get Amitabh Bachchan 's most seething performances . When his father is framed and killed by corrupt town members and a bad man called Kancha Cheena , Vijay becomes a much feared and ruthless don to the chagrin of his mother and sister . This one of Bachchan 's later roles and after a string of duds he started the 90s off with a bang and let everyone know he was still in the top of his form . With his eyes lined with kohl and bloodshot , and repeating his famous line ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image of terror . Critics have been divided over Bachchan 's performance , which is stylized at times and very near copies Marlon Brando 's Vito Corleone intonation . You do get the sense that Bachchan was putting everything on the line for this film and a little experimentation with his iconic persona certainly helped him land the National Award for this film . Whatever we may think , Bachchan 's performance was the real spark in his stagnated period , and it remains to be seen if Hrithik Roshan can top such a fearless role . <p> Subir Kumar in Abhimaan -- Rarely do critics cite some of Amitabh Bachchan 's pre-Vijay films as key in his oeuvre . However , the sparks felt in this film and others like Namak Haram or Anand are previews to the fuller actor Bachchan became after his iconic roles . This film by Hrishikesh Mukherjee looks at the marriage of two singers played by Amitabh and Jaya Bachchan as his star is on the wane and she overtakes him on the charts . The film , which echoes ' A Star Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Norman Maine character as Frederic March , James Mason , and Kris Kristofferson have attempted . The jealousy and downfall , each of the talented actors has their own spin on the hurt pride of a once popular star . Bachchan definitely comes closest to Frederic March 's sensitive portrayal as Subir is genuinely pleased for his wife till he sees that his own career is being eclipsed as his contacts and fans flock to his wife instead . Bachchan makes a dislikeable character into such a humane tragic person character that the audience feels for him as he alienates all those around him . The early signs of a darker side and buried resentment , which Bachchan portrays so well in this film can all be seen in his key roles . <p> Toofan/Shyam in Toofan -- There has to be one cheesy role in this list where Amitabh Bachchan gives his anger turned up to 11 in a very nutty and implausible film like this ! Bachchan plays really a Power Ranger superman of sorts called Toofan and his magician twin Shyam , who is out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father many years ago . Sound familiar ? The film was one of a string of shamefully good films Amitabh did in the 80s , thankfully Agneepath followed . However , Toofan is one angry man using his trusty arrow kit and jumping onto helicopter skills to avenge his father . The fact that Amitabh Bachchan mouths such silly lines and turns on the Angry charms for such a cheesy film is a testament to durability and reliance on the Angry Young Man archetype which it had become in those days . Each of these above Angry roles , Amitabh has stretched the parameters and challenged the very persona he created , but it is nice to see him sometimes be angry in the most silly of storylines like this one ! <p> Buddhadev Gupta in Cheeni Kum -- You could call this Amitabh 's transition to Grumpy Old Man roles , but it deserves a place from this list for Bachchan 's commitment to reinventing his persona . Bachchan is the original Angry Young Man but he did have time for romance and humour and R Balki 's script @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our idea of Amitabh Bachchan . Balki gives us grizzled chef Buddhadev who wastes no opportunity insulting his staff but lets his guard down around his elderly mother and young neighbour . These sweet moments reveal the softie inside all of the Angry Young men Bachchan may have played , they do all have a yearning for love but keep up the macho defence , which is why Tabu can see through his fa ? ade . <p> Subhash ' Sarkar ' Nagre in Sarkar -- Another brilliant revisionist take by Ram Gopal Verma who knew how to capitalize on the persona and the public 's appetite to see Bachchan in a negative role . For the 10 minutes when Bachchan played the original Don , he was menacing and curt , and Sarkar can be seen in the same light . In one moment drinking his tea from the saucer with villainous glee or comforting an upset father seeking justice , Bachchan is clearly enjoying subverting his persona and it 's positive to see that in an actor who is constantly challenging himself . Certainly , it is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilizing the baritone voice for sinister speeches and it completely works in synergy . Playing the Vito Corleone in this film , this Godfather only loosens up around his family but as his wayward son Kay Kay Menon finds out even they are not spared from his wrath . <p> Amit Malhotra in Kabhi Kabhie -- This one might seem out of place on a list of the top 10 angry roles by Amitabh Bachchan , but an Angry Young Man is most definitely Byronic too ! When Pooja ( Rakhee ) leaves him for another man , Amit is spurned and tortured by this decision all his life till it affects his current marriage to Anjali ( Waheeda Rehman ) . All of those eloquent and sad poems he reads out and harbouring resentment for the world is something a Romantic poet would approve of ! There is an overflowing frustration in Amit that Bachchan portrays so effectively . The construction business he owns and his pensive stares into space , Bachchan gives a stock character a lot of depth . The fact that he blames his wife for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left his own past behind and carries the rejection with him . It is one of Bachchan 's most poignant and mature performances as he plays a man lost in ennui and of a life and love he was deprived from . <p> These are only some of the many roles Amitabh Bachchan has done that covey that Angry Young Man persona in different interpretations . The fact that Bachchan experiments and constantly reinvents himself with each role drawing on his public 's love of his image and his own strengths within that image is a testament to his longevity . So here 's to more anger and fury to come !

A good Lokpal bill has to be nothing less . <p> It is in this context that this article addresses the issue of whether the Prime Minister should be brought under the ambit of an Ombudsman ( Lokpal ) and be subject to its scrutiny . It is important to observe that in most of the Lokpal bills , including the 2010 government draft ( except the 1985 version ) , the Prime Minister is within the ambit of the Lokpal . <p> The Constitution <p> Under the Indian Constitution there is no provision to give immunity to the Prime Minister , Chief Ministers or Ministers . Under Article 361 , immunity from criminal proceedings is conferred on the President and the Governor ( formerly the Rajpramukh ) only " during his term of office . " <p> So what is the principle behind such immunity being given ? The line is clearly drawn . Constitutional heads who do not directly exercise executive powers are given immunity as heads of state . Active politicians such as Ministers , who can not remain aloof from the hurly-burly of electoral and party politics , ethical or unethical , honest or corrupt , are not given any immunity . They are subject to penal laws and criminal liability . <p> The basic structure of the Constitution clearly denies immunity to the Prime Minister . <p> Internal Emergency <p> During the period of the Internal Emergency ( 1975-77 ) , Indira Gandhi enjoyed dictatorial powers . She detained without trial prominent Opposition leaders and was supported by a captive and rump Parliament . <p> The Constitution ( Fortieth Amendment ) Bill was moved in , and passed by , the Rajya Sabha in August 1975 and later it was to go before the Lok Sabha . The Bill was blacked out from the media and hence very few people knew about it . It never became law because it was not moved in the Lok Sabha . <p> The Bill sought to amend Article 361 by substituting sub-clause ( 2 ) thus : " ( 2 ) No criminal proceedings whatsoever , against or concerning a person who is or has been the President or the Prime Minister or the Governor of a State , shall lie in any court , or shall be instituted or continued in any court in respect of any act done by him , whether before he entered upon his office or during his term of office as President or Prime Minister or Governor of a State , as the case may be , and no process whatsoever including process for arrest or imprisonment shall issue from any court against such person in respect of any such act . " <p> The attempt to give life-time immunity from criminal proceedings for acts done during and even prior to assuming office , of the President , the Governor and additionally the Prime Minister , did not materialise . <p> Foreign jurisdictions <p> In Japan , Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka ( July 1972 to December 1974 ) was found guilty of bribery and sentenced . In Israel , Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was indicted in corruption scandals in August 2009 . In Italy , Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi enacted , through a pliant legislature , a law by which he shielded himself from prosecution . The Italian Constitutional Court recently invalidated crucial parts of that law , which may result in his trial being revived . <p> The following are some of the main arguments against bringing the Prime Minister under the Lokpal 's scrutiny . The first one runs thus : " The simple answer is , if the Prime Minister is covered under ordinary law ( the Prevention of Corruption Act ) , you do n't need him covered under Lokpal . " This is a view that has been attributed to the former Chief Justice of India , J.S. Verma ( Hindustan Times , June 27 , 2011 ) . Any misconduct by a Prime Minister can be investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation : this view is that of Chief Minister Jayalalithaa ( The Hindu , June 28 , 2011 ) . This objection concedes the principle that the Prime Minister is not immune from criminal liability and can be investigated , but argues and assumes that the Prevention of Corruption Act and the CBI present effective existing alternative procedures . Nothing could be farther from the truth and the ground realities . <p> What is the ground reality ? First , the CBI , the premier anti-corruption investigative agency , is under the Department of Personnel and Training , which is controlled by the Prime Minister 's Office ( PMO ) . Secondly , the career prospects of CBI officers and other personnel are dependent on the political executive , and all officers are subject to transfer except the Director . Thus , the investigative arm is controlled by the ' political suspects ' themselves . Thirdly , the Single Directive , a secret administrative directive that was invalidated by the Supreme Court in the Jain hawala case in 1997 ( Vineet Narain v. Union of India ) has been legislatively revived . Consequently , under Section 6A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act , the CBI is disabled from starting an inquiry or investigation against Joint Secretary or higher level bureaucrats without the Central government 's prior approval . Therefore , the Prevention of Corruption Act is a non-starter against Ministers and high-level bureaucrats who may act in concert . It is imperative that the CBI 's anti-corruption wing be brought under the Lokpal and not under the PMO . This alone would meet the test of an independent and fearless investigative agency as enunciated by Justice Krishna Iyer . <p> Secondly , it is argued that if the Prime Minister is within its ambit , the Lokpal could be used by foreign powers to destabilise the government . Today , the checks on the executive government are the higher judiciary , which has actively intervened in the 2G spectrum scam and other scams ; the CAG , whose reports against the functioning of the telecommunications sector triggered investigations into scams ; the Election Commission headed by the Chief Election Commissioner , which conducted elections in West Bengal in the most efficient and orderly fashion . All these authorities could be undermined by a foreign power . Why should the Lokpal alone be the target of a foreign power ? Why not the intelligence and defence services ? Why not leaks from Cabinet Ministers and their offices -- bugged or not ? <p> Thirdly , it is argued that bringing the Prime Minister under the Lokpal 's scrutiny would mean a parallel government being put in place . This objection is disingenuous . Do the Supreme Court and the higher judiciary constitute a parallel government ? Is the CAG a parallel government ? Is the CEC a parallel government ? Is the CBI a parallel government ? The answer is clear . These constitute checks and restraints on the political executive and the administration so that public funds are not misappropriated and constitutional democracy and citizen rights are not subverted . The Lokpal will be under the Constitution and subject to judicial review , and it is imperative that the anti-corruption wing of the CBI be brought under the Lokpal . There is no question of any parallel government . The Lokpal will be only a check on the corrupt activities of the Executive . If all checks and balances are to be regarded as the marks of a parallel government and therefore abolished , it will be a recipe for dictatorship . <p> William Shakespeare wrote : " There is a tide in the affairs of men , which , taken at the flood , leads on to fortune ; Omitted , all the voyage of their life is bound in shallows and in miseries . " There is a tide in the affairs of this country and there is a great opportunity to promote good governance through a powerful and independent Ombudsman . India 's economic reforms , for which the Prime Minister deserves approbation , should not be derailed at the altar of scams and corruption . Will his leadership ride on the tide of fortune and take the country forward to greater heights ? <p> ( Anil Divan is a Senior Advocate , and president of the Bar Association of India . E-mail : abdsad@airtelmail.in ) <h> I am very thankful to you sir for writing a very well researched and a comprehensive , simple yet bold piece of writing . I wish it reaches the masses and create awareness . <p> from : Pragya Sharma <p> Posted on : Aug 10 , 2011 at 11:04 IST <h> As a common man , all that I wish to see through is that all , powerful or sundry being brought under the ambit of a powerful Lokpal . We need independence in its true form . <p> from : Shailendra Singh <p> Posted on : Jul 31 , 2011 at 19:43 IST <h> Law making is the exclusive power of legislature.upto this politicians are correct but in a country where a person who gets only 30 % votes in election and get selected will be able to think the wishes of the whole population . They are afraid of strong lokpal because that will curtail their chances of being corrupt.a strong lokpal is the need of the hour and PM should come in its ambit.The anti corruption wing of CBI should also work under LOKPAl instead of DoPT . There are so many instances where CBI has to take permission to investigate against a corrupt politician from another corrupt politician . I do n't know why politicians are afraid ? If they know they are correct then why are they doing these nonsense things like stopping Anna from another strike . <p> from : Ashish sharma <p> Posted on : Jul 30 , 2011 at 14:42 IST <h> I believe this article should be circulated to all news channels , all news papers , and to as much individuals as possible . This is really a brilliant piece of writing , as can be seen by number of comments in its support , clearing every doubt on Lokpal . <p> from : Savyasachi <p> Posted on : Jul 29 , 2011 at 21:51 IST <h> The article is clear and unambiguous in content and simplicity . Accolades to Mr anil Divan . What is the problem with the Parliament and ministers ? Are they so mortally scared that they want to hide behind colonial mind set ? . It is time for the country to get rid of those who resist improvements in administration of good governance . All including PM and judiciary must come within the ambit of LP . <p> from : Parameswaran <p> Posted on : Jul 29 , 2011 at 21:27 IST <h> what an article this is . It brings the issue of PM being under lokpal in perspective . <p> from : Yogendra Pratap Pundir <p> Posted on : Jul 29 , 2011 at 17:20 IST <h> Thanks for making our understanding cristal and clear about Lokpal Bill ..... Lots of accolades to The Hindu for such a remarkable articles . <p> from : Neelima Bhatt <p> Posted on : Jul 29 , 2011 at 12:23 IST <h> This is a very well written article . All government approved in today 's declaration of lokpal bill was what they want irrespective of demands put in front by Anna Hazzare and co . All the decisions that cabinet has taken today to prevent corruption , hey must have assuered all the ministers that there will be a way out of this if anyone caught red handed in cases of corruption . The option of getting CBI under Lokpal bill is a way out altleast for an uninterupted enquiry in a corruption scam . <p> from : Anmol Shrama <p> Posted on : Jul 29 , 2011 at 10:58 IST <h> The very gist of the Constitution of India is simple - to serve common man in a manner that she/he must have her/his legitimate right ( in the form of anything ) but corruption deny every right of citizen . No body is above the law if she/he is guilty of any crime . <p> from : Pankaj Kumar <p> Posted on : Jul 29 , 2011 at 10:30 IST <h> As this article has clearly shown , why Prime Minister should be under the ambit of Lokpal , the responsible authorities must not overlook these factors and should frame an effective Lokpal , which work effectively for common countrymen instead becoming a puppet in the hands of ministers and senior officials . <p> from : Mehul Parmar <p> Posted on : Jul 27 , 2011 at 23:43 IST <h> ANIL DIVAN hats off to you sir ... You , Anna Hazare , Arvind Kejrival are real Super Stars of India . My kids will have Pics of people like you and anna in there bedroom instead of Salman , Amitabh and Sachin . I wish many more people like you are in power and spread the jan lokpal movement . JLP movement doent have power and resource so people like you are real asset . <p> from : Sandip Borkar <p> Posted on : Jul 16 , 2011 at 03:25 IST <h> Very precious job has been done by your newspaper . Really anybody believes or not but it is fact that our country is the biggest homeland of corrept beurucrates . In every foriegn country when you will hear any thing about India , the 1st sentence will be India 's corrupt pliticians &amp; bureaucrats . <p> from : Shahbaz Alam <p> Posted on : Jul 7 , 2011 at 21:34 IST <h> This article compares Higher Judiciary , CEC , CAG and CBI to the proposed Lokpal which is like comparing Apples and Oranges wrt the powers of Lokpal . In any case , Higher Judiciary should be outside the purview of the Lokpal for a stable democracy . <p> from : Pradeep S <p> Posted on : Jul 6 , 2011 at 20:30 IST <h> I will really be surprised to see this Lokpal bill passed by the government . Like the Kashmir issue , this talks will go on for years . India can not be saved . Abdul Kalam 's dream of seeing 2020 is merely a dream which can only be in books . Look at China 's growth . These politicians are going to leave us in shame in front of the whole world . Unless and until the punishment for the corrupted politicians are intensified , the hope for a brighter India can not be seen . This can be witnessed from 2G scam . If Raja and Kanimozhi are not sentenced to imprisonment for at least 25-30 years , <p> from : Ram <p> Posted on : Jul 6 , 2011 at 00:23 IST <h> The kind of corruption which affect common man most is from the officials of Group D , C or B level only . Every department has its own ' Code of Conduct ' ; under which a senior officer commands immense powers to streamline corrupt behavior of these subordinates . So the real solution is to create circumstances where senior officers are held responsible for their supervisory lapse in failing to arrest the corrupt practices of their subordinates . At present the senior officers enjoy and junior level officials face disciplinary actions for implementing verbal orders of their seniors . Once this system is reversed , we are bound to see substantial difference . Lets not forget , ' to kill a fly you do n't need a cannon ' . So petty corruption which affects the common man most can never be controlled by bringing PM under ambit of Lolpal but by making higher bureaucracy accountable to the public at large . <p> from : B.Govind <p> Posted on : Jul 5 , 2011 at 12:53 IST <h> I liked the comment given by Chief justice of India that CBI should come under the realm of lokpal and lokpal under the Constitution . By , doing this we are not only empowering CBI and lokpal , we are also staving it off from corruption.Double Whammy India ...... Hope they approve of Iyer 's incisive thinking . <p> from : Vishal <p> Posted on : Jul 5 , 2011 at 12:23 IST <h> The aritcle is well-written . But there are many issue we should focus on . It was brilliantly pointed out by Ramaswamy in his comment . But we all want to write and read what is sold . We shall include many issue in this bill , the right to education for all , rising all above quota system , effective and effecient polity making , etc . The Prime Minister , is the one being autonomously selected by 1.21 billion population of the country , through a proper democratic method . But how the Lok-pal would be selected , just by bunch of guys who are renowned in their work , it seems a good fight , which is being approved by our middle class , but not all section of society . The middle class has preconceived that , other section of the society are incapable to work for the wellness of the country . I feel that the efforts shall be made to achieve the main goal not to deviate for it . <p> from : Saurabh <p> Posted on : Jul 4 , 2011 at 22:14 IST <h> Brilliance on a piece of paper sir . Hats off . <p> from : ankush <p> Posted on : Jul 4 , 2011 at 18:23 IST <h> I wish that people like Anil Diwan uproot the false information disseminated by the media and expose the media and its supporting the vested interests . If our media were upright and independent most of the national issues would have come to limelight in the right perpective . In fact media has colluded with the vested interests and always misinformed and misguided the public . Our fourth pillar has not stood up for justice in the issues of national importance but always discussed trivial issues to divert attention . I hope that the media changes its course and takes up issues of national interest . 1 . Why we are at the rock bottom of corruption index as per Transparency International . Is media asking this question to the Goverment . Why CBI and the other agencies are under the control of the Goverment ? Why they are not Independent ? Is media asking these questions to the Government ! <p> from : Ramaji <p> Posted on : Jul 4 , 2011 at 14:22 IST <h> -PM can be investigated only by the agency which is under his control . The article explains how badly our system has been exploited . The article vividly explains how untenable the government 's current stand on PM coming under the ambit of Jan Lokapl . Time is being wasted on this trivial issue . It is a sad thing that we feel great as the largest democracy , but our system is fraught with loopholes . We have a proxy PM who does not know what his cabinet ministers are doing , even if he knows , he will remain silent effectively becoming a powerless executive ( indirectly making PM , as the representative of people , responsible for their greedy acts ) -is this our basic structure of constitutional ? We even here the news of the EX-CJI having inappropriate wealth , this shows our judiciary even at the highest level is not corruption free . 2G and KG has become a cliche.It is high time that we review our whole democratic system.It is the effective Lokpal that will be the first step towards it . <p> from : Srikanth <p> Posted on : Jul 3 , 2011 at 23:37 IST <h> Reasons being cited for not including the Prime Minister 's position for probing of charges against him , on the plea that the PM can not become dysfunctional because of investigations by the Lokpal , are without merits and as such escapist . What will happen , if because of natural reasons such as death or any serious ill health problems , the PM is not able to function in a normal way.Is there no provision or a second line of defence for the Government to function ? Such a situation did happen in our Country when Lal Bahadur Sastri passed away in Tashkent , Russia . At the State level when Jayalalitha was not able to take the chief-ministership , on an earlier occasion because of a court verdict , an alternative person from AIADMK was promptly put in place , without any hitch.We have also recently seen the spectacle of how the PM himself was not initiating action against the perpetrators of the 2 G scam.For many months , the Parliament did not function properly.The Supreme Court had to direct the CBI to go ahead with the unearthing of the greatest scams of recent years . Not including PM under surveillance of the Lokpal is therefore hollow and dangerous for the Country . Not including the Judiciary in the Lokpal list looks logical and reasonable but not the Prime Minister because of the spate of scams that were not taken notice of by the PM on his own . <p> from : MSVenkataraman <p> Posted on : Jul 3 , 2011 at 23:27 IST <h> This is a must read article . I never understood why to and why not to PM under purview of Lokpal Bill . I think PM must not be given immunity from Lokpal Bill . <p> from : Satish <p> Posted on : Jul 3 , 2011 at 23:27 IST <h> Excellent . All the more reasoning to bring PMO under Lokpal . This should be published in All news papers . <p> from : Sada <p> Posted on : Jul 3 , 2011 at 20:52 IST <h> Right article at the right time . But , what about Mrs. Sonia Gandhi ? I mean , if someone scales the ladder of power the manner in which Mrs. Sonia Gandhi has done and without becoming a PM or even a Cabinet Minister , holds all real political power in her / his hands , without any accountability to the Parliament or even the Media , thereby the nation and it 's people , will the Lokpal ( in any eventuality ) be able to reach out such an extra-constitutional power centre , that functions out of public money ? <p> from : Sanjay Tirdiya <p> Posted on : Jul 3 , 2011 at 18:54 IST <h> Lawyers as a tribe do not enjoy much confidence among the common people , yet I have to accept the arguments of Mr. Diwan as cogent , although I am not sure whether he can equate the offices of CEC , CAG , Higher judiciary with that of the Prime Minister.For me the problem is not bringing in the office of PM under Lokpal , but putting higher judiciary under its purview.It is right many of the readers have asked for a vernacular edition of the piece to make the arguments known to the man in the street . I would also like to see a comparative analysis of both Government 's as well JanLokpal 's drafts put before the people in an objective manner . <p> from : John D. Jayakumar <p> Posted on : Jul 3 , 2011 at 14:58 IST <h> It has indeed become a hot debate all over the country and if we delve deep into the matter we will realise that the matter is more symbolic than being something concrete . PM being the executive head of the nation is always under scrutiny and can rarely avoid the glare of media , political parties , citizens etc . It is the executive body attached with the PM that has to be more rigorously and continuously scrutinized as in our country corruption generally goes top down and if we can stem the flow at the very top we might be able to root out the weeds.And astonishingly all the states CM have kept a silence on it even though they would be thoroughly affected by it too once lokayukta gets formed.They need to come up with their their suggestions and opinions so that we can have an amicable solution which the govt is ready to implement and citizens ready to accept . <p> from : Ravi Verma <p> Posted on : Jul 3 , 2011 at 14:27 IST <h> My sincere thanks to Mr Anil Divan for an outstanding article and to ' The Hindu ' for publishing it . I humbly request ' The Hindu ' to start an Anti-corruption campaign and educate the masses on Jan-Lokpal . I am forwarding link of this article to all my contacts . <p> from : Lt Col AP Singh <p> Posted on : Jul 3 , 2011 at 14:06 IST <h> Very good authentic report ; as a common citizen I am having the opinion that no one is above the law . Why PM or President or Supreme court chief justice be an exception ? Even our Ramayana teaches us that Sita has to show her purity by passing through the fire to convince Rama &amp; all other people that she is innocent.There is no valid reason for excluding PM as validate by Mr.Anil Divan 's report . All the very best for Team Anna for a successful Lokpal bill . <p> from : Abilash <p> Posted on : Jul 3 , 2011 at 13:39 IST <h> If Lokpal functions under the constitution , the Prime Minister 's office being already under the constitution , what is the need of a Lokpal ? Another point to note is that the members of the Civil Society formed by Anna Hazare are hand picked , however eminent they might be in their respective professions . So they are less equiped to speak for the people of the country than the members of the government who are elected by the people through a democratic process . However , the suggestions of the civil society must be held with the greatest esteem . But the job of laying down the guiding principles for a Lokpal be best left to the government . Real remedy , however , for eliminating corruption from the society is to lift the minds of a certain section of the people prone to corruption from its state of degradation to one of moral values . <p> from : N K Kuri <p> Posted on : Jul 3 , 2011 at 13:34 IST <h> Is n't it ridiculous to talk of immunity at all . Why is it needed at all ? Do the Prime Minister and other high office officials need to do immoral things to have some good for the nation . If we scrutinize the concept of immunity little bit closely it can be found that it runs against the basic precepts of democracy . This term should be completely deleted if it exists somewhere in our constitution . <p> from : Mudasir Ahmad Yatoo <p> Posted on : Jul 3 , 2011 at 09:16 IST <h> A good article with satisfactory explanation for a strong lokpal . Congratulations ............ <p> from : Veeresh Gali <p> Posted on : Jul 3 , 2011 at 07:58 IST <h> Kudos to both Adv Anil Divan and The Hindu for an unusually clear and candid analysis of a treacherous situation created by the vested interests in the corridors of power . <p> from : P M Ravindran <p> Posted on : Jul 3 , 2011 at 07:30 IST <h> While Lok Pal has it 's own independence in investigation and recommendation to prosecution , it must still be answerable to the elected parliament . Without which , there could be other problems that could emanate from such an arrangement . <p> from : Saratchandran <p> Posted on : Jul 3 , 2011 at 07:10 IST <h> At the time of election , the politicians blatantly bribe the population and the population in return bribe the men/women in power for the rest of the time ! It all comes down to who has the power at what time of the election cycle . It is a collective shame of the country that every decent Indian must fight against at all transactions . If the judicial arm of governance is not supportive of rectifying the disorder , help of the public media to be sought to name and shame the officials involved . The corruption can only prevail under anonymity ! <p> from : Saratchandran <p> Posted on : Jul 3 , 2011 at 06:57 IST <h> Brilliant and well balanced article by Anil Devan.It must serve as eye opener to the people in keeping updated with the ground reality and the need of one such organisation which may rein in influential people and high up being indulged in corruption.Those who have reservation in putting The prime Minister under the ambit of Lokpal either rebut sans genuine and logical points ormisguiding the people.CBI comes under the purview of the Prime Minister , will hardly exercise its power if the Prime Minister are proven wrong . Corruption has become the most talked about word today.Thanks to effort of Anna Hazare , People has been pressed and awakend from the slumber to fight the chronic disease like corruption . <p> from : Wakeel Ahmad <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 22:30 IST <h> Civil Society refers to a section of the society as distinguished from military or religious society . So the people on the government side like ministers and MPs also belong to the civil society . In addition to that they are elected by the people in a democratic election and enjoy greater acceptibility . On the other hand the members of the civil society of Anna Hazare , however eminent they might be in their professions , are chosen arbitrarily and do not enjoy the sanction of the people . Their views on Lokpal bill must be taken and considered with the deepest regard they deserve . But just that , nothing beyond . The problem is not with this committee or that committee . The problem of corruption is much deeper . It is the degradation of the minds of a section of the people in position of power and authority , devoid of morality , ethics , propriety , and self respect that is primarily responsible for the widespread corruption . The remedy lies in uplifting the minds from this morass . <p> from : N K Kuri <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 21:09 IST <h> It was really insightful to know the realities going around which gives support to the stand of TEAM ANNA why the P.M should be brought under the ambit of Lokpal . It would give a solid base for the crusade against corruption . <p> from : Neha <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 20:03 IST <h> An article with lot of loop holes.Mr Divan says that article 361 exempts president and governor , has no trouble with it , but does not scratch the reason for why they being exempted.If the president of the country and governors need to be exempted then how can the PM who actually represents stability of polity in country should be included ? Most of his arguments are made for a legal chamber but not for the court of people and reason . <p> from : Arun <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 17:12 IST <h> I strongly disagree with Mr.Yuvan for two reasons . I completely agree that we , the citizens , should not pay bribe . Ideologically it is correct . But practically it does not seem to be feasible for two reasons 1.1 - Take the case of a common man , for example , who wants to get his daughter married off . To meet the marriage expenses he plans to sell a small piece of land and goes to the sub registrar 's office where the clerk demands Rs.5000 . The marriage is next month . Do you expect him not to pay bribe and endanger his daughter 's wedding or pay bribe and get his work done ? Would n't it be easier , if the clerk did not demand money ? 1.2 - Would it be easier to educate 120 crore people not to pay bribe or to control the 12 lakh or so government employees if their bosses are sincere ? 2.0 - A.Raja , the telecom minister , was not bribed by a common man ! Suresh Kalmadi was not bribed by a common man ! ! They are swindling from our tax money and that is what we are trying to control primarily . <p> from : Siva Ramaswami <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 16:14 IST <h> All persons involved in influencing/interpreting the laws of the land should be brought under LOKPAL . <p> from : A V Raju <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 15:47 IST <h> Let us think again . Is there any law now which allows corruption , still people are corrupt.It 's not important to make a law in Black &amp; white and stay inactive . It 's the attitude of people should change . If we the people do nt give bribes then how they ( politicians ) going to get it ? If the politicians say " we will give so and so free .. " are we not the first one in the line to get it . Did we ever question how he says its free . Not one but every one should question then automatically everything will come under control . let alone we change then change comes automatically . <p> from : Yuvan <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 13:55 IST <h> You 've changed my opinion about political corruption in India . I was a Visiting Parlimentary Fellow during time of Indira Gandhi regimes extraordinary power grab .... at Centre . CBI must be legally independent of PMO - ie. it explains why SC is forcing their hands on 2G scam in order to get investigative traction . My problem is that current Lokpal Bill - from both sides - is too ambitious and might get side-tracked politically . Ombudsman institution is under the consitution of Sweden - first such public prosecutor in European states - and is principally focused on official maladministration . I 'd like Lokpal Bill to focus on maladministration and report directly to Parliament . Parliament must table its annual reports and publish it . And once it gets established , and there is room for improvement , I 'd consider making it premier administrative court on official maladministration . India is a case study of good intentions lost because of inability to focus on nexus of power . <p> from : Dr. Hari Naidu <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 12:27 IST <h> Thanks for sharing this . All media should support Anna Hazare and country 's Strong Jan Lokpal Bill . <p> from : Pradeep <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 12:23 IST <h> The greatest menace India is facing is corruption.There must be a militant , active nationwide movement against corruption.judiciary and Prime Minister should be under the Lokpal . <p> from : Arakkal C Hameed <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 09:51 IST <h> Wonderful articles.Gives answers to all the foolish questions raised by the politicians regarding Lokpal bill.Next we have to think how we can save the country from these politicians . <p> from : Midhun <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 09:16 IST <h> Excellent article . The ruler should be liable to prosecution in the event of having been found guilty . This is the ancient culture of India . Manuneedhi Cholan himself awarded death punishment to his son who accidentally killed a calf . This ancient tradition of India has to be followed . <p> from : Sekkar <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 09:09 IST <h> Kudos to ' THE HINDU ' for giving such valuable inference for the common man . The solution for this problem is VERY SIMPLE , if ONE issue is controlled , denial of which is the main reason for such corruption , injustice , inflation , unemployment etc. , majority of problems in india can be uprooted from Indian history . The issue is , currently in india all the politician contests the elections any number of times he wants , ultimately sticking to that seat and subverting all the powers to their gain.If we change the constitution to amend that , one can contest and be in any ministerial/MP/MLA/CM/PM etc. , berth at the maximum of 2 times/terms only ( like in other countries ) then these fellow leaders will fight with each other to bring all kind of law that they now hesitate to do.The advantage with this change is every Indian gets a chance , nepotism avoided , police and law will not be afraid of politicians . <p> from : Arun <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 08:29 IST <h> Thanks for the detailed article . At least , there is one news site which showed mercy to the anti-corruption movement .. <p> from : Murali Kumar <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 03:11 IST <h> Great Article ! This will clear a lot of uncertainty created by the Congress party to derail the Jan Lokpal bill . Kudos to Mr.Anil Divan . <p> from : Rajpal <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 02:23 IST <h> Outstanding article . Kudos to ' Hindu ' for publishing and for eductating the country . Congress 's attempt to add confusion will clear up with socially responsible people like Anil Divan and media like The Hindu . I find very convincing answers to the questions posed by ( corrupt ) politicians . You have certainly raised the bar . Hats off . <p> from : Vamshi <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 01:13 IST <h> Mr.Anil Divan has succinctly dwelt upon his views pertaining to inclusion of PM under Ombudsman ( Lokpal ) and the need to bring in a fearless agency to keep a vigil and do away the prevalent corruption from the country.Thanks to Anna Hazare the movement to uproot the corruption has been reinforced . The CBI being controlled by PM has not proved so much effective as needed . Then how come any case against PM be tried by CBI ? The reservation expressed by M.S Jayalalitha and Justice Verma to exclude the PM from lokpal bill is biased and will leave some scope to give the birth of corruption . It was ( late ) and ex-PM Rajive Gandhi , who said that if Rs.100 issued by government , only 12 paise reaches to the people.The recent reveallation of the scams in the tenure of the UPA govt has added much stigma . It is high time we the citizen of india came forward and played a proactive role to save the country from those high ups who are bringing this country on the brink of disaster . <p> from : Wakeel Ahmad <p> Posted on : Jul 2 , 2011 at 00:12 IST <h> Really an awesome article . I request the hindu to handover the transcript of this copy in all the regional language to the all the regional news paper of india . Every indian need to know the truth . <p> from : Vivek Singh <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 23:30 IST <h> firstly , I was supporting Annaji for his view to bring Prime minister under the lokpal purview without reason but now , after reading this article , I have lot reason for supporting him . Really it 's very nice article . Thanks to Anil Divan &amp; ' The Hindu ' for publishing it . <p> from : Hemant Singh Kathayat <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 23:28 IST <h> Every politician should read this article who are against of perview of PM and judiciary under lokpal , and they have need to rethink about their view . They also need to think about 120 millions people . <p> from : Gyandeep kashyp <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 23:25 IST <h> There can be no better presentation than this on the need for Strong Janlokpal . Anil Divan deserves to be congratulated on his attempt to open the eyes of sceptics . If Tamilnadu Chief Minister happens to read this article , she is sure to change her stand . The clarity with which article puts itself in defending the stand of Janlokpal in bringing PM under JLP , is an awakening call to all indians , who look forward to good &gt;governance , transparency and elimination of corruption . <p> from : G. Munendran <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 23:24 IST <h> This is very valuable addition to the present debate on corruption Clear , concise and precise . There can be no credible voice more than that of Anil Divan . Let J.S Verma and Kapil Sibal read this and reply point by point . If there is no such rebuttal , we have to presume that these two gentlemen have no answers , and concede these points <p> from : Vivek <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 23:11 IST <h> I can not better the elegance that I have found in a letter to Bishop Mandel Creighton from Lord Acton , so I quote a part of it : " You may say that people in authority are not to be snubbed or sneered from our pinnacle of rectitude . I really do n't know whether you exempt them because of their rank or of their success , or power , or of their births ...... i can not accept your canon that we are going to judge Pope and the King unlike other men with favoured exemptions that they did no wrong " . " If there is any presumption , it is the other way , against the holders of power , increasing as the power increases historic responsibility has to make up for the want of legal responsibility . Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely . Great men are almost always bad men , even when they exercise influence and not authority .. " . <p> from : Dr. Ajoy Bhattacharjya <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 21:41 IST <h> Dear Mr Divan , Would you consider writing an opinion on the inclusion of ( i ) the higher judiciary ( ii ) all bureaucrats ( central and state , all India and state level cadres , from all services , working directly under the govt or in PSUs etc ) and ( iii ) conduct of MPs and MLAs , under the purview of the Lokpal ? These being the other three areas considered contentious by some . Judging by the comments posted so far , most readers of The Hindu would like to read what you have to say . <p> from : D Mahapatra <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 21:15 IST <h> Hats off to you Mr.Divan ! This unambiguous article has cleared all my doubts , if there were any &amp; now me and many more like me would support the Lokpal bill even more strongly . <p> from : Annupriya <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 21:05 IST <h> A very mischievous and misinformation campaign has been going on by vested interests in the UPA dispensation to exempt the office of the PM from the ambit of the proposed Lokpal as if the heavens would fall if he is covered by the Lokpal.This is far from true as has been brilliantly brought out by Divan.Is any more justification needed to end the controversy that has been unnecessarily created to divert the attention from the tasks before the panels for drafting the proposed Bill ? <p> from : V.Padmanabhan <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 20:24 IST <h> Firstly I must say thanks to Sh . Anil Divan Sir for removing the contradictions on the issue . Then I would like to answer a gentleman Mr. Pramod Patil that If a prime Minister is found to be corrupt then cetainly we must take the risk of the whole govt falling . Because in that case it can not be called a risk because the risk would be greater if such Prime Minister continues to be in office . <p> from : Sunil kumar <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 20:09 IST <h> Good Synopsys . Timely too . I believe we Citizens must vote for enabling the creation of a just and fair lokpal , which can not exempt our Country 's Chief Executive staying out of it 's ambit . The consequence of the Lokpal ( Civil Society version ) will certainly be dissapointment in the sections of the society who actively participate in the election process ( **37;436;TOOLONG nexus ) , and will lead to revival of interest in the sections that must participate , but for obvious reasons choose not to ; vis-a-vis , The Middle &amp; the Middle Upper Crust of the society . The common excuse of these classes staying out of the election process is that , " We do n't have it in us , as we can not lie , or play games . " A just and fair Lokpal 's consequence will be a great revival in their interest , thus culminating in their active participation . This is the urgent need of the hour , as it will brilliantly enlighten and enliven our Great Country , once again . Kudos to Mr. Divan , &amp; The Hindu Team ! <p> from : Sunit Jang Bahadur <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 18:53 IST <h> The article is very motivating and enlightening . How I wish the PM read this article and then made a fair opinion about himself and his government that is deep ridden in corruption . <p> from : Kamal Bhardwaj <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 18:38 IST <h> Great Article . It clarifies and reasons various critical items in Lokpal bill submitted by civil committee . The best part is that the article is presented in a layman language which makes it easy for common people to understand . This article should be publised on front page in all the newspapers . <p> from : Anshul Agarwal <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 18:12 IST <h> Well said . Does this mean that the governing authorities do not know anything about our constitution ? Or is it that their mind is clouded with their mistakes stopping them from looking at the broad view of Lokpal 's intention ? Or is it even more than just mistakes ? " Every member in the parliament is a representative of the people . If they do not sync with people 's view , they are only speaking for themselves . " So if they hinder any progress in forming a prosperous India , they should be seized from power immediately , rather than argue with them . Abraham Lincoln said " government of the people , by the people , for the people , shall not perish from the earth . " . And our government is going to perish if it does not understand these words . <p> from : Muthuselvan <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 16:36 IST <h> A Prime Minister does not fall from heaven ( this may not be the view of some ) . He or she in that high office come to that position with popular support or as is the case with the present Indian Prime Minister , with the support of people who have popular support.Thus a PM is the creature of the people in a democracy where the peoples ' will is supreme . A Prime Minister is the servant of the people to govern the country as per their will . People therefore could have another servant of theirs or a group of them ( a Lokpal ) to ensure on a continuous basis that those entrusted with the power to govern the country do perform their duties as per their will as reflected in the constitution and laws of the country . If the logic enunciated above is valid , then the Prime Minister should be the fist person who should be under the scrutiny of the Lokpal . <p> from : K.Vijayakumar <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 16:09 IST <h> Congratulations Mr Divan for bringing out the true picture of CBI , CVC and all other investigating authorities . Did not we see that CBI raided at Raja 's residence only after giving him ' enough time ' to right off the evidences ? Was it possible without taking into confidence the PMO ? We have seen the power of tolerance and restraint by all high and mighty people and authorities of our country like Military , Courts , Election Commission etc . Government is afraid not for the country , but for itself and as our missile man has called ' we must unite ' and get a ' Jan Lokpal ' <p> from : Prof VP Tiwari <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 16:06 IST <h> Lucid and logical . Glad that this good piece of work has been published . <p> from : Vijay Bharat <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 16:05 IST <h> This is a fabolous article by Mr Divan . It points out the important issue of the lokpal bill . Bringing the office of the prime minister under the ombudsmen is very sensitive , though as the constituion did not provide any impunity to the prime minister , then I think that the PM should come under its scan range.In all the contradicting thing we must properly interperate the constituional words.I personally opine that the lokpal will not in anyway supersede the constitution . <p> from : Nurul Arfin <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 15:53 IST <h> The idea of keeping the PM out of the ambit of ' Strong Lokpal ' means keeping him above the democracy and the constitution . What is wrong if the PM and other ministers are made liable and responsible for their conduct to the exchequer of India ? All the reasons given by them held no ground , and , in fact , seem fictional . An ideal democracy works only when everyone is considered equal in front of law . The people of India has got a chance now to bring a change in and improve the current state of affairs . This can be seen in their eyes in the form of hope and enthusiasm and , in the statements and actions of our leaders in the form of fear . <p> from : Deepak <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 15:48 IST <h> Thanks to A. Divan for presenting a complex issue in such simple and straight farward . <p> from : RAj <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 15:38 IST <h> Very well said ! ! I am impressed with your way of thinking in favor of strong lokpal.I think now there is no any doubt about constitutional harm . This article should be send to all draft committee members who are opposing to bring PM under lokpal bill . This artcle will be very appropriate answer . <p> from : Ahmad <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 15:28 IST <h> Very lucid , factually correct , and devoid of any frivolities. this article should be read by every person who wishes to understand the Janlokpal bill issue in correct perspective . This article really separates the wheat from the unnecessary political , pseudo legal and intellectual chaff that the speakers on different media are dishing out to the common gullible aam aadmi . <p> from : Dr Rakesh Dholakia <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 15:27 IST <h> It is hard to figure out whether corruption in India moves from down ( the masses ) to up ( top executive ) or vice versa . There is a saying that a leopard does not change it 's spots . This reminds me of anti-coca cola activists who shout slogans/protest in front of coca-cola factories and then go home and chill out with a bottle of coca-cola . The top executive ( some without even a basic high school education ) have mastered the art of getting kickbacks placed directly in foreign banks . Lokpal will do little so say stop a nuclear power plant deal where an initial deposit of millions is made to a Swiss bank so the government then opens it 's doors to let in the French , U.S. and Russians to build their white elephants and cancer causing power plants priced at billions into our country . under the pretext of clean and safe energy when in reality the deadly pollutants are invisible . Can we see the x-ray the machine puts out in the x-ray room ? No ! And how will we detect these foreign bank deposits ? <p> from : Agela Alvares <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 15:05 IST <h> I think this article logicaly clears most of the confusions created by vested interests . Thanks Anil . Very Good effort . <p> from : Amit Malik <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 15:03 IST <h> Insightful and honest . I hope all Indians read this . Kudos to Hindu for publishing this . What has Sibal to say to this ? ! <p> from : MV <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 15:00 IST <h> The issue has been raised many a times before also but before the people of India can deliberate about it , it has been nipped in the bud . We should be thankful to Hazare sahab for raising his voice to the utmost level of 20,000Hz. so that at least these wolves can listen to it . The sleeping souls of our youth has also awaken to fight for the cause . <p> from : Pankhuri Agrawal <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 14:51 IST <h> Excellent article Sir . We need another such argument regarding the rest of the differences in the drafts . <p> from : Vijay <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 14:21 IST <h> Dear citizens Now it is the time for fighting for the corruption as the corruption has gone up to the grass root level in india we needed the powerful institution to curbe the corruption in order to remove this corruption we needed such powerful institution . PM , whole and soul of the Parliamentarian should come under the lokpal bill . As in the same time CBBI ACB are also should come under the lokpal because they are all under the parliament politicians they are using this CBI ACB ARE taken advantage bend downing whole system of the constitution . the power of the parliment so it should be merged in the lokpal and also it should include state ministers CM and all the local bodies of the governmental and private institutions . Then only we can remove the corruption . Slowly it will becomes the habit for the nation . <p> from : Venkataramareddy <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 14:18 IST <h> Excellent article . Solid and sound reasons thrown at those who have been against bringing the PM under Lokpal . If this article can not convince them , then nothing else can be done with their adamency . If this article could be published in other newspapers more people will be enlightened . <p> from : Sridharan <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 14:01 IST <h> A good and detailed analysis by Shri Anil Divan . Let all the people who are against corruption , join hands together and work for passing of Lokpal Bill . <p> from : Chittaranjan Dasgupta <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 13:49 IST <h> Between some convincing arguments put forward by Ms.Jaya some days back and this superb article by Anil Divan to the contrary , i am now convinced that the PM should be brought under the ambit of the LokPal with provisions not to allow frivolous charges being made and processed by the Ombudsman . Otherwise , this article brings out forcefully a valid case for the inclusion of PM under LokPal . This , in fact , will be the implication , if the CBI and CVC are made to report to Lokpal as the Civil Society Draft envisages , and CBI has powers of investigating the PM even under the existing laws . I congratulate THE HINDU on the timely publication of this article , especially when some ex-judges like Verma and CMs like Ms.Jaya expressed reservations , which seemed to confuse certain sections of the people . Let us now all get together and build a consensus that we support the Jan Lokpal Draft in toto and support Annaji to the hilt , and create a Lokpal , to rid this country of corruption . <p> from : K.S.Ranganathan <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 13:28 IST <h> Though some of the facts above came as knowledge to me , the write up seems to have lost focus somwhere within itself . I did not see any enlightenment or enforcement . It happens to be mere extracts of a beautiful english dictionary without any clear intention expressed or motivation revealed . Sorry but did not appeal . <p> from : arjun <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 12:54 IST <h> Truly said . Prime Minister is just the Chief Executive Officer of the Union Government i.e just the chief employee of the people of India and if the people of India are prone to any investigation against their misdeeds then why not their employees and specially the Prime Minister who is the most responsible for his cabinet . Saying that there will be a parallel government is a totally misleading tactic of Congress Party as Lokpal and their decisions can be easily challenged in High Courts or Supreme Court , and Lokpal is only for investigations and prosecutions ( which can be challenged ) not for policy making of the nation . The main reason behind this denial is that Courts give punishments or judgements only based on the facts and informations provided by the investigating agency , and the agencies are in control of the governemnt , so government 's culprits goes unpunished . But if the investiagting agency gets independent , then correct facts and information will be put before the courts . <p> from : Vaibhav Singh <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 12:47 IST <h> This article has thrown light on the mishandling of information that has led people against the truth . Anil has put forth an impeccable argument that envisions what an efficient claim to support the good cause of Lokpal must contain . Further , it spots all the flaws that congress and other parties cite to evade a mechanism that would uphold democracy and remove the cobwebs of ignorance casting shadows over and upon the course of legal possibilities to empower a noble cause . The citation of Krishna Iyer 's judgement and bringing to light the history of Lokpal bill will enlighten the people who blindly follow the leaders actively misleading and betraying the people . The third reason to counter the argument supporting the immunity of the Prime Minister to Lokpal is also throwing light on why the current machinery ca n't relied upon for effective investigations.The article , when read gives hope and energy for people supporting a better machinery to counter , handle and eradicate the corruption . <p> from : Karthikeyan Srinivasan <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 12:29 IST <h> The simplicity of the article gives it great strenght . Normal people like me never understand the parliamentary language embedded in a bill or an act . It is important for people who cant reach out to that high level be apprised with such simple but hard hitting articles.I thank ' The Hindu ' for their exemplary choice and timing to publish the same . There maybe hundred 's of revolutions to raise the people 's spirits to achieve something great , but it takes a pen a few words to bring a change to your doorstep . <p> from : Bharath <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 12:21 IST <h> Uncountable thanks to Mr Anil Ji . In one word I want to make a comment about this article that is - Ineffable.This article ought to be translated in all the languages of India and printed in all the news papers . Thank you The Hindu for providing such a precious gift . <p> from : M N Pandey <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 12:16 IST <h> I support the views of Anil Divan ( ' Lokpal bill and the Prime Minister ' , The Hindu , July 1 , 2011 ) and like to add to them . No one has questioned the need of a Lokpal . Hence , those , who are averse to inclusion of PM into the ambit of the bill on the ground of existence of Prevention of Corruption Act and the Central Bureau of Investigation , should explain why they do not mind an ombudsman for others . Will not the same Act and Bureau take care of all ' criminals ' ? A ' Prime Minister is not immune from criminal liability and can be investigated ' was admitted long back . The dictator in Indira Gandhi , though " supported ( then ) by a captive and rump Parliament " , was later investigated upon by the Shaw Commission . Then came the case of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao 's bribe to JMM Members of Parliament , which at some stages of judicial procedure found all of them guilty , though all the guilty escaped at the Apex Court due to lack of effective laws . As Justice Krishna Iyer suggested none including the President of India needs to be exempted . We have the history of many ' corrupt ' members of our higher judiciary . We are right now reading the stories of Chairman , NHRC and the CVC . The issue of ' career prospects of CBI officers depending on political executive ' to which Anil Divan refers to is applicable to members of IAS , higher judiciary and others , with the addition of ' post-retirement prospects ' . Manmohan Singh half-heartedly tells that a Lokpal is ' essential and desirable , but not a panacea ' . He continues to tell that ' he had no hesitation in bringing himself under it . However , many of his Cabinet colleagues were of the view that bringing the institution of the Prime Minister under Lokpal would create an element of instability ' . So he finally says that he would ' work for a national consensus ' . The consensus is sure to evade . Some of his colleagues hope to live as PM at least for a short spell . They may try to revive the old Constitution ( Fortieth Amendment ) Bill . Truly many people have lost faith in the proposed Bill . If at all a bill is drafted and passed by the House , how far it would be effective is clear from the words of our leaders . In fact it looks as a higher priority should go for an exhaustive set of electoral reforms , which should necessarily include provisions for a ' 50%+ minimum support for winning candidates ' , ' recall of elected representatives ' and a ' none of the above column in EVMs ' . This will empower the voters and check corruption more than the Lokpal Bill itself . <p> from : P.R.V.Raja <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 12:13 IST <h> Thanks to legal expert Anil Divan for clearing mist through Hindu that PM under Ombudsman ( Lokpal ) will not be against basic structures of the Indian Cons. ! He has quoted views of ex-justice V K Krishna Iyer that to probe into malpractices by high-ups independent investigative agency must be set up as way back as back in 1979 . Quoting instances of various countries , writer has said that basic structures of Cons. does not give any immunity to PM from his misdeeds-Pm is still under perview of anti-corruption laws than why not under Lok Pal bill ! There is instance that PM in office Narsimha Rao had faced corruption charges in the court and he appeared before the court to submit his points and simultaneously ran govt . No harm in putting PM under Lok Pal Bill , which would ultimately give signal top is under net and one should beware of corrupt practices . All govt , public servants and judges must be put under lokpal to eliminate graft.But dictum of so called civil society must end . <p> from : Krishn Kumar Singh <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 12:09 IST <h> Dear Editor of Hindu . May I request that you publicize this well written informative article in all your sister publications ? . The public have to be informed . They must be informed . There is a great need for letting the people of this country know what is going on in their country . India seems to be held in a envelope grip of corrupt politicians who think India belongs to them and it is their birthright to rule with total immunity . A big thank you and to Mr Anil Divan . <p> from : Rakesh <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 12:06 IST <h> Best article I have read on Lokpal issue . Based on facts and true political picture . Good on the Anil Divan . <p> from : Satinder Singh <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 12:06 IST <h> This article provides with a brilliant analysis and evaluation of arguments and counter-arguments of bringing PM under the ambit of the envisioned institution of lokpal . Coruption is a social evil . Any autority having an element of discretion , in the exercising of his authority , is liable to be corrupt . Thus , there has to be a web of checks and balances to ensure that the authorities are free from arbitrariness as well as undue influence . The Lokpal may be an effective bulwark against the deluge of capriciousness of executive action and decision . But , limiting its role to a few areas will not only defeat its purpose but will frustrate the people who are expecting a resolute action from the government so as to tackle the menace of corruption . <p> from : D Bardhan <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 11:57 IST <h> First of all Congratulations sir ! for this brilliant article.But I differ on various points that are as - 1 . The objective of the ' Lokpal-debates ' should not be centered on Prime minister only as there are also many aspects to discuss that are much more important . 2 . If you are discussing then you should very well understand that if PM is under Lokpal while he is in tenure then there will be bogus traps targeted upon him everyday ( generally most of which will be nothing but political fiction of opposition parties or overactive imaginations of media ) and PM will end up in doing nothing but justifying and proving himself innocent and that even at the cost of prime national duties . <p> from : Vikas Kumar Khichar <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 11:49 IST <h> A very informative article.Giving details of how much we are paralyzed when it comes to taking action against the perpetrators.Lets hope for a more inviolable India with the Lokpal Bill . <p> from : Himani Saini <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 11:46 IST <h> Corruption travels from top , therefore for a healthy nation , it is absolutely necessary that PM , like Ceaser 's wife , should be above suspicion , a corrupt PM and stupid PM will make entire nation corrupt , as such PM should be brought under ambit of Lok Pal to ensure proper functioning of the nation . <p> from : Manish Chowdhary <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 11:34 IST <h> Excellent article . The objections on the grounds of ' derailing democracy ' , ' parallel government ' , etc. do n't hold water any longer . Wish that the author could be part of Anna team ! <p> from : D. Chandramouli <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 11:25 IST <h> We must have a strong Lokpal who can act as the saviour of the people and keep the rampaging divide-and-rule instincts of the political class under check . The problem worse confounded in India is the Congress belief that it has the inherent right to rule , especially of the first family of the Nehrus . This leads to depredation of our august institutions and the proverbial supping with the devil when it concerns checking the activities of Pakistan or China . Mindset of politicians is not expected to change ; only a tough law like Lokpal can help . Already India is without Indians thanks to quota syndrome where the government treats its citizens as of this caste or that giving rising to unscrupulously deviant behavior . If semblance of morality has to be revived a tough no-nonsense Lokpal is a must . <p> from : Vedanta Rao <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 11:24 IST <h> As Walter Lippmann envisaged , Public Opinion is the key to Good Governance . The very flow of response to the responsible analysis of a knotty issue by Mr.Anil Diwan mirrors the same . This said , I do worry about the Prime Minister 's post and power being hijacked , the way Ms.Jayalalithaa had articulated . <p> from : Soundararajan Srinivasa <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 11:16 IST <h> Anil ji has clearly explained the need of a Jan Lokpal including the PM under it ... a thorough article mentioning the need of a strong Lokpal ... I wonder why these realities are not shown on TV by any News Channel , why are they busy showcasing government 's ineterets ... they show that Baba Ramdev 's trusts ' finances shud be reviewed , they never showed the victims of the $th June night at Ram Lila Maidan ... This clearly shows that the media is biased . Thanks Anil ji for this great article , I hope it creates a lot of awareness . <p> from : Arvind Sharma <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 10:48 IST <h> It is suggested that the Lokpal bill would not constitute as a parallel government just as judiciary or CBI or any other investigate agencies . But , is not worth noting that these too have become corrupt and that is the main reason we are looking for something else above all these . As a nation we have all facility to counteract the corruption and it is these facilities which have become corrupted . Introducing the Lokpal would just add one more to the list . Would anyone promise on the fact that the new committee will constitute people who is not corrupt and will not become corrupted ? Until as citizen we make sure that we do the work given to us and make sure the others follow , there is no need for these high end dramas . We are spending a lot of energy and time on Lokpal instead if we spend the same time and energy on the educating the people on not to bribe , I think it is a time better spent . Let it be mass movement . <p> from : Vincy Sebastian <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 10:46 IST <h> The article by Mr. Divan is a complete one.Thanks Mr. Divan . <p> from : R K Ghosh <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 10:41 IST <h> PM has not only failed , miserably , to prevent such major scams as 2G , CWG , black money , etc etc that have taken place , but even does not appear to have regretted the happenings . He still maintains that the corruption is the propaganda by media and opposition . He even goes to the extent of putting the blame on CAG , INSTEAD of admiring the CAG for bringing out such major swindlings by his ministers . Under these circumstances , it has now become a necessity to bring PM also under the scrutiny of Lokpal . <p> from : Gosakan <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 10:39 IST <h> It is parallel Govt . If the higher judiciary is subjected to enquiry , only that particular judiciary will be placed before investigation . If the CBI officer is placed before investigation ( LOKPAL ) that particular person will be subjected to investigation . If the Head of the Nation , PM is subjected to enquiry the entire country will be non functional . As long as all MPs are under the scanner of LOKPAL there is no need for PM to undergo harassment in the name of enquiry/investigation . He has to do a lot for country other than this kind of harassment . <p> from : T.Subramanian <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 10:27 IST <h> Anil Divan has forcefully argued the case against the attempts of powerful political interests to prevent bringing the Prime Minister under the ambit of Lokpal and making him or her subject to its scrutiny . Mr.Divan 's article provides the Lokpal activists potent ammunition to fight for their cause . <p> from : K.Vijayakumar <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 10:10 IST <h> Thanks for the enlightening analysis of the controversial issue . It was brief , yet comprehensive . It cleared ambiguity on several points : firstly whether Lokpal really has the power to form a parallel government , secondly whether CBI and the prevention of corruption act are enough to investigate prime minister , and thirdly why it is necessary to bring prime minister under the ambit of Lokpal . After what happened in India during the dictatorial rule of Indira Gandhi during emergency , no one can deny the necessity of bringing prime minister under Lokpal . <p> from : Divya <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 09:44 IST <h> Great Article sir - I agree with you that its high time that the politicians need to change character and policies a like . I believe that ' End of Tolerance is the Beginning of Revolution ' ... Public revolution has already started by Anna - it will be a success sooner the better .. <p> from : Raj <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 09:27 IST <h> The argument and conclusions are crystal clear ! It is mandatory that the prime-minister should set an example by subjjecting himself to scrutiny by the Lokpal if this nascent venture is to bear fruit and end corruption . Only then will he be able to absolve himself of the allegations of a ' conspiracy of silence ' which has proved very ineffective in protecting erring ministers and MPs from the long arms of the law ! If he does not submit himself to the lokpal and if the anti-corruption wing of the CBI is not given sufficient powers to act against the high and mighty without fear or favour lokpal will remain a toothless tiger ! <p> from : Dr M S Seshadri <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 09:24 IST <h> I do not agree . Covering the office of PM under the proposed Lokpal could lead to politicization of the Lokpal mechanism . Anil Diwan has cited many instances from other countries where PMs were prosecuted for alleged acts of corruption.Ok , but under which mechanism ? Were they covered under the Ombudsman ? Diwan has not clarified this . Furthermore , considering the political realities in India , the inclusion of PM under Lokpal is a sure recipe for destabilization of a popularly elected government . When a minister resigns , the Government does n't fall , but when the PM resigns , this makes the entire cabinet to go . We must take this vital difference into account.In today 's scenario , mere initiation of investigation , by the the proposed Lokpal , of any allegations against the PM would destabilize the government . Can we afford this ? <p> from : Pramod Patil <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 09:20 IST <h> Excellent piece hitting all the nails bang on . I only think that if all our institutions and officers were courageous enough to exercise the immense powers that the Constitution of India vests in them , we would not feel the need for a Lokpal . We need less laws not more , but more enforcement not less . <p> from : Apalwankar <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 08:58 IST <h> Kindly send the article to Mr.Kapil Sibal and Mr.Manish Tiwari . Can they rebut the reasons put forth in the article ? Thanks Mr.Divan . <p> from : C S Padmanabhan <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 08:51 IST <h> Thanks to the writer and The HINDU for this detailed , no-fluff and incisive analysis of the problems . This is an immense contribution to the public domain of discussion . You have put the matter in a form and language that a layperson like myself can understand . <p> from : KK <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 08:32 IST <h> Excellent article . Let us pitch in for an effective lokpal . The PM at least opened his mouth to say that he has no problems with being in a lokpal . I do not know when he will have the courage to implement this viewpoint , or will he like to make the office for Rahul easier as other sycophants ? <p> from : Prabhat <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 08:10 IST <h> The article is excellent . I also like to point out the judgment of the Supreme Court rendered by Justice.V.R.Krishna Iyer , " Protest fasting , a versatile weapon in our cultural armory , is meant to sensitize or conscientize the soul of the Administration when it is too paper-logged or callous to look at human problems from the angle of human justice . Beyond that , this great Gandhian technique can not be blunted by promiscuous use , so long as democratic mechanisms are alive and not impervious to legitimate grievances and can be sparked into action not merely by sensational , though sincere , tactics like fasting unto death . " Jagdish Saran and Others Versus Union of India and Others . AIR 1908 SC 820 . <p> from : Bharat S Raj <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 07:55 IST <h> It is fact of life that the basic ingredient to run the machinery of any government is corruption and this stark reality is all known for a long time now . Weather it is NDA or the BJP lead governments all of them pose to to be clean but each one is ' Holier than thou ' . We as Indians must not allow the Govt to hijack this bill . <p> from : Gopal Balakrishnan <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 07:32 IST <h> I have a simple solution to this logjam between Government and Civil Society - The PM and even the President should be subject to supervision by Lokapal as long as they are not from the Gandhi-Nehru family or alternatively Lokpal shoudl have been an obedient servant of the Gandhi0Nehru family for atleast a period of 5 years prior to his appointment to the office - he should loose his position on determination of lack of faithfulness by any member of the Great family . This is the only way to gain support for the Lokpal Bill from people like Sibal and Digvijay . <p> from : Ram <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 07:30 IST <h> The very fact that PM was included in the 2010 draft of the Lokpal bill proposed by the same government exposes the confusion and lack of coherence in the government as it opposes the same proposal in 2011 . It is pretty clear the government has lost its ability to feel the pulse of the society . Thank you Anil for a very good and informative article . <p> from : Bhushan <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 06:58 IST <h> Lokpal is not the same institute as the other institutes referred to by the writer . It is to investigate on matters of corruption either suo moto or on a complaint . If anyone is allowed to complaint against the Prime Minister and the matters investigated then it is either too naive or too idiotic to think that the PM can function effectively . And this would also mean in principle that every chief minister should also be brought under Lokayukt . If this happens then may god bless this country . <p> from : Harpreet Singh Chugh <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 06:21 IST <h> Nice article . Thanks to Hindu for publishing this . <p> from : Dev <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 05:51 IST <h> This article should be published in all major news papers and not only in english ... should be published in all regional languages then only common people will understand the bogus draft of govt . <p> from : Ashish Mehta <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 04:44 IST <h> We are grateful to Mr. Anil Divan for putting forth a clear and logical analysis for the lay people to understand the issues clearly . The author has rightly pointed out the fallacious argument of some to prevent PM from being investigated by the proposed Lok Pal bill . Why should a person occupying the high office of Prime Minster be anxious if he is clean and beyond the pale of corruption ? Indians who have witnessed Bofor scandal and JMM MPs purchase involving premiers have no faith at all in the sanctity of the post . Only extremely gullible will buy any of the silly arguments of the Prime minister being a holy cow . It is amusing to see Ms. Jayalalithaa throwing her support for exempting PM from Ombudsman when she herself is facing court on corruption charges . Her views on the issue will be taken with pinch of salt . <p> from : N.G. Krishnan <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 04:30 IST <h> Excellent article sir ... <p> from : vivek <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 04:13 IST <h> Awesome info and rebuttal to Kapil Sibal <p> from : Anand <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 04:12 IST <h> Thankful to Mr Anil Divan for such an incisive article and to ' The Hindu ' for publishing it . Will it be read by the ' Powers that be ' in the right spirit ? <h> This excellent article debunks wholesale the weak arguments put forward by the Congress netas who argue against a Lok Pal or want a lame duck LokPal . It seems the Congress party and also the various other political parties have a vested interest in corruption . They are keen to ensure that their immunity from the law and prosecution is well maintained . - One of the reasons that Indian politics have attracted so many people with criminal background is due to perception that the way to quick , fabulous riches is via entering politics , raise any noisy issue possible and get into a bargaining situation with the party that wants to desperately to remain in power . Consequently , good , capable and honest men shied away from entering the political arena as they prefer not to compete with the push and shove of the street hooligan who wants to be a MP , MLA etc . The country is the biggest loser due to this situation . <p> from : Rakesh <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 03:24 IST <h> Anil Divan : Please accept congratulations on the timely article , The Hindu has done a great service at a critical time.Will the Ministers who are represnting Government on LOKPAL Bill drafting body read and assimilate this article.I specifically request Kabil Sibal , Chidambaram , Veerappa Moily to read . Elected representaives are answerable to Constitution and Law of the country.In countries like USA have a provision to withdraw the elected represntatives by withdrawal votes.In India unfortunately even after 64 years we have not developed good parliamentary practices , conventions and procedures . Congress party has ruled the country for more than 50 years and their leadership has created a parallel power of influence and virtually run the central government with out any norms and over a period diluted the constitutional principles . Now the counry has got a puppet PM , Figure head President and ineffective checks on the Executive.Whatever reforms we do must rectify this situation . <p> from : Narayanan Krishnan <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 03:16 IST <h> I think this is the best article ever on the subject of Lokpal and corruption . Anil Divan deserves kudos and equally ' The Hindu ' deserves to be appreciated for publishing this . News papers/medias which do not have the concept and conviction expressed by the authors normally do not publish those articles . This clearly shows the policy line that is being adopted by ' The Hindu ' . Perhaps , since the policy of such media is not in concurrence with that of the Government/its senior Ministers , editors of Hindu and some other high circulation newspapers were not invited for the meeting with the PM . <p> from : G.Chandrasekaran <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 02:41 IST <h> A forthright support for the Lokpal which is a long time coming in the midst of the dust and cloud created by the vested interests in the government , business and some in the media to obfuscate the real issue and distract the attention of the public away from the beacon call of the crusader Anna Hazare . <p> from : Ramakrishnan <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 02:15 IST <h> Anil Divan 's article is most timely . It clarifies so many of the legal issues of which most of the public are not aware of . In the light of the above article it is nothing but deception by the politicians to say that the Prime Minister is not to be covered by Lokpal , because he is covered by Prevention of Corruption Act . It is also deception to say the Lokpal would be a superpower and dictator beyond the reach of all , when there can be instituted constitutional checks and balances as in the case of other constitutional authorities like the President , the Prime Minister and the judiciary etc . Given the choice , no politician will willingly accept any measure that they feel would be a threat to their unlawful acts . Hence if the public comes forward forcefully , with the threat that the politicians ' future would be at stake in the next election , would the politicians come around . If the Parliament fails public have to force it to do its duty . <p> from : S.Narayana <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 02:06 IST <h> It is really a wonderful and informative article . This Article is strong slap on the face of the corrupted politicians and ministers who do wrong arguments and mislead the country for their vested interests . <p> from : chandra <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 01:35 IST <h> This is well-thought out piece of arguments in support of extending the office of prime minister under the ambit of Lokpal bill . Anil Diwan makes an excellent point in support of it . As well , his arguments refuting some of the opposition is well thought-out . Listening to the prime minister Manmohan Singh recently , even he is not opposed to it . It may be some of his colleagues , who are looking beyond the present environment and are not in favour . There needs to be a debate just on this point . We also need both legal opinions as well as political opinions . Decision should not be made based on hype as some members of the civil society seems to suggest . All in all , it 's good for the country . A good start . No one should think that just getting a strong Lokpal will eliminate corruption . But at least , it will make every attempt to arrest it as far as possible . As time goes along , it can be improved with experience . Let 's not delay it . Sooner the better . <h> JAYANT <p> from : Jayant M.Shah <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 01:30 IST <h> I really appreciate your article . But you must admit PM in the lokpal ambit is not the most critical component of the demands by the Jan lokpal bill ( JLPB ) . Independent investigative agency under Supreme Court , no conflict of interest are the no brainers . However , no politician on the panel , protection to whistle blowers and financial incentive to identify a corrupt official or politicians are the required and essential teeth to this bill . Govt versions comes after plaintiff for upto 2 years of punishment and this will deter almost most common people from taking the benefits of this new law . We need another article discussing the difference of the two in much more detail and the implications of the government bill , which will just produce another govt entity that will be misused by the political party in power . <p> from : Vivek Sharma <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 01:26 IST <h> Please print this article in all newspaper in India . Let everyone know the real truth , and not be influenced by Congress propoganda and mis information campaign . Thank you Mr Anil Divan . Why have been you so silent . Why have you not published this article before . Please give as much publicity to this article as possible . <p> from : R Kumar <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 01:24 IST <h> Wonderful article , based on facts and sense . Thanks to ' The Hindu ' for publishing this . <p> from : Vishwa <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 01:16 IST <h> Very well written indeed . Thank you Sir for pointing out all the reasons for having a strong Lokpal . All the explanations for the PM having immunity from the Lokpal are hollow at best . Only accountability at the highest levels will ensure that the rank and file behave responsibly . There is no dearth of commissions , agencies , panels , rules etc. to deal with corruption , but with messy documentation and sometimes questionable motives , every investigation is scuttled in our country , we have to begin by holding the highest office bearers responsible . Only that will prompt them to demand accountability from their subordinates . The higher the office the bigger the risks and liabilities , just unfettered powers without the tight leash of accountability leads to dictatorship . <p> from : Tanu <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 01:12 IST <h> To date , a very concise and good article on this subject . I have seen a loads of comments , accusing the opposition and other elements with all sorts of proverbs , etc just with no logical reason , which made me lose interest in sharing my ideas whatsoever . But this article is excellent . In my perspective , the investigated can not control the investigator . The job of the politicians stops at the level of making policies , which , if likely to cause harm to the nation and are made to benefit the political and/or economic interests of the ' policymakers ' , should be invalidated by the judiciary and/or the public should have an opportunity to accept/or reject the policies . Presidents in US had faced trials for misusing/using their power at the cost of their nation . However , that is a utopian dream in India . <p> from : Sivasathivel Kandasamy <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 00:53 IST <h> Anil Diwan 's eloquent and comprehensive response to the delaying and diversionary tactics is impressive . It is high time that all the citizens , high and low , whatever their political , religious and regional affiliations might be , to raise their voices and fists to stop this charade and wipe this horrendous blot on India . <p> from : Anamika <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 00:51 IST <h> BRILLIANT ARTICLE . Thank you for coming forward to build a better India for everyone ! Please continue with your watch while the fog of mis-information persists . <p> from : D Mahapatra <p> Posted on : Jul 1 , 2011 at 00:18 IST <h> Model the Lokpal similar to the Election Commission with all encompassing investigative powers . If the crime is committed , the case may be taken to the Supreme Court or High Court for conviction and punishment . Laws may be changed so as to mandate the SC/HC to dispose the case in say one year so that the cases are not prolonged . If the Lokpal comes up with a case against the SC or HC authorities or the PM , the case could be taken to the parliament for conviction . If the parliament is not willing , for some reason , to punish the accused , it could be taken to the President . If there is no action from the President , it can be empowered to seek the referendum of the people of India . There are a lot of ways to take care of the constitutional conflicts that these wretched creatures are lamenting about . <p> from : Siva Ramaswami <p> Posted on : Jun 30 , 2011 at 23:57 IST <h> The author tries to quote multiple facts and references and deduce the point that the PM should be brought under the purview of the lokpal.Entire issue of handling corruption has now been turned into a debate around this point . In my opinion this is more of symbolic in value and does not to a great extent alter the contours of the lokpal bill . We have so far had PMs who have had good track record on demonstrating integrity while holding office as PM . Even if there were one or two instances ( Ex:Lakhubhai Pathak case ) it could be handled in multiple ways . Instead of debating all other important issues such as bringing Cabinet Ministers , State ministers and govt officers under lokpal , the media has overblown this issue and has made it appear as if Lokpal 's only intention is to scrutinize Prime Ministers . Instead of discussing this one point , there has to be more focussed discussion on appointment of Lokpals and the degree of autonomy . Request Hindu to publish op-eds on other facets . <p> from : Ramaswamy <p> Posted on : Jun 30 , 2011 at 23:53 IST <h> No mincing of words ! ! This is the most candid and appropriate response to those vested interests who are making all efforts at their disposal to scuttle the noble efforts to establish independent Lokpal .

@@4212234 <p> Saurabh Chaliha ? s literary radiance will last foreverRanjit Kumar Dev Goswami Two Assamese writers in the forties and the fifties of the twentieth century introduced their readership to a kind of sensibility rare in its sophistication , subtlety , scope and comprehensiveness : Ajit Barua ( b. 1926 ) in poetry and Saurabh Kumar Chaliha ( 1933-2011 ) in fiction . Steering himself free of the sing-song lyricism of his romantic predecessors ( some of them later associated with what literary historians called modernism in Assamese literature ) , Ajit Barua effected a radical shift away from patterns of rhythm derived , as it were , from the metronome ; explored the possibilities of the language of everyday speech and tried to load just about every rift of his verse with what may be called an ore of silence . <p> Chaliha , in his turn , fashioned an idiom that was ? impure ? in its break from the standard literary idiom of the day ( current since the last quarter of the nineteenth century , more specifically from the literary eras of Banhi and Jonaki ) and sensitized it to accommodate the anxiety , loneliness and restlessness of a ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traditional certitudes . Combination of several registers ( Kamrupi , Bengali , English and Standard Assamese ) , Chaliha ? s prose with its ingenious use of diegesis and mimesis captured a multiplicity of feelings adroitly organised and thus made for fresh experiments and play . The break from classic realism was clear and unmistakable . <p> Ajit Barua ? clearly at pains to get over the vague generalities characteristic of the poetry of the earlier decades ? fell back upon GM Hopkins ? mode of individuation and derived strength from TS Eliot ? s advice to his contemporaries ? to force , to dislocate if necessary , language into the meaning ? . Chaliha was perhaps too shy to admit of any model that he found himself emulating , either consciously or unwittingly . In any case , dislocation is perhaps the keyword in terms of which one may now approach the works of these two archetypal modernists of Assamese literature . It was , one recalls , Ajit Barua ? s ? Man Kuwali Samay ? ( 1948 ) and Saurabh Kumar Chaliha ? s ? Ashanta Electron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assamese literature . <p> Small wonder , critics have since found themselves looking for correlates in various arts to understand these two writers . Insofar as Chaliha 's works are concerned , one usually has recourse to several different frames of reference : impressionism , cubism , surrealism and interior monologue among others . And Saurabh Kumar Chaliha is one of the few Assamese writers whose texts invariably call for a kind of networking with , or recourse to , other arts : music ( western classical music in particular ) , painting , sculpture , architecture and cinema . Indeed , some of the stray references in his stories to either the ? geometric design ? of a wall or Picasso 's ? Harlequin 's Family ? adorning some room , description of a table gradually broadening itself ? as in a close-up shot ? , or characters in his tales either alluding or listening to Mozart , Salieri , Beethoven , Dvorak , Tagore songs , jazz and barcarole invite the reader to relate these narratives to an exceptionally broad range of associations . The details of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contribute to an overall effect that is peculiar to poetry alone in its communion with other arts , music notably . Chaliha , endowed with auditory imagination of an exceptional type , delighted in the use of counterpoints as a strategy of representation : an exciting game of chess ( in Ehat Daba ) gradually draws to a close with the sound of naam chanted to the accompaniment of khol somewhere in the distance . Paul Claudel in his commentary on Mallarme 's prose drama Igitur noted that the poet here confronted the world as a text , not as a series of mere spectacles . It is precisely this treatment of reality as a text that informs the works of Saurabh Kumar Chaliha all through . The world represented in ? Bina Kutir ? is a curious mix of what is ? given ? and what is constructed , or fantasised , by the narrator . What is given , or reported , comes into play with a series of tacit interpretations ( meditations perhaps ) adroitly woven round various components of the texture of his tale . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ textual character of reality . <p> Chaliha ? s resolute attempts at keeping ? the man who suffers ? distinct from ? the mind that creates ? link him up with the struggle of the modern for privileging the medium over the message , language over life . For a little over six decades he guarded the creator within from the man of flesh and bone and never allowed the word to become flesh and make his dwelling amongst us . It is this voice , this mystery of a disembodied spirit , that is the theme of one of the most powerful Assamese stories written in our time , namely , Harekrishna Deka ? s ? Gaurav Chalihar Sate Sakhyat ? ( Meeting Gaurav Chaliha ) . Tracing the mystery of the spirit back to the cultural milieu of the early sixties , Deka ? s story plays not only with the early history of literary reception of Chaliha ? s works , but also the ideas of absence , voice , death of the author , text and textuality . Saurabh Kumar Chaliha 's works resist stereotyping of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering beneath laughter , irony and play ? and the comic in his stories is nearly always in tension with an overarching tragic vision of life . A writer incessantly questioning his own feelings and never at rest , Saurabh Kumar Chaliha was always careful not to repeat himself . <p> If some of his earlier stories represent an extreme continence of affirmation , there are also writings both fictional and non-fictional ( the dividing line here being very thin ) that suggest his vision of a new birth : ? Kharang ? ( Drought ) and ? Adagdha ? ( Unburnt ) being two examples . Story of a poor , struggling student in a remote village in Assam with his cherished dream of learning , ? Kharang ? brings to the fore a grim battle with destiny that seems to the author to lend meaning and purpose to life itself . ? Adagdha ? ( the word clearly derived from the Bhagavata Purana , 5.14.4 - ? yath ? hy anuvatsaram krsyam ? nam apy adagdha-b ? jam ... ? ) is about an old institution throwing up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a ? new birth ? . His last collection of stories , published in 2008 , was significantly titled Navajanma , new birth . Indeed , Saurabh Kumar Chaliha 's name is likely to remain associated in days to come with the idea of a new birth , a renaissance to be sure , in Assamese literature , or , as Premendra Mitra once pointed out , in the history of Indian literature in general .

However depending on factors like liquidity , tax implication etc , should FMP be a part of your portfolio ? Financial advisor Renu Pothen answers the question by providing insight on FMP investment . <p> Post your opinion here <p> RBI increases Repo and Reverse Repo rates by 50 bps ! The headline on Television and Print media after the monetary policy meet of the Central Bank is a cause of concern not only for the stock markets or corporate India but also for a person on the street who is indirectly linked to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realization that a rate hike would in turn , translate to higher EMIs as loans taken for property/vehicles , etc. would become costlier after the tightening of monetary policy . However , there is one section of Aam Janta who is happy with this decision as banks are vying with each other to divert surplus household/corporate savings by offering the highest deposit rates . <p> Along with banks the financial space also has mutual funds competing for the surplus money of the retail investors and corporate . The mutual funds advocate the money to be moved into a debt product , namely Fixed Maturity Plans ( FMPs ) ; which is being considered as a substitute for Fixed Deposits ( FDs ) . FMPs which underwent a bad phase in 2008 , once again gained hype in the mutual fund industry in 2010 . This was on the back of the huge liquidity crisis faced in the economy and the tight monetary policy carried by RBI to tame inflationary pressures . This can be seen from the number of FMPs launched in 2010 ( 340 ) and 2011 YTD ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are close-ended debt funds which invest into short-term papers like Certificate of Deposits ( CDs ) , Commercial Papers , etc.The instruments in the portfolio are held till maturity as a result of which interest rate risk is negligible . All FMPs have to be listed on a Stock Exchange so as to allow premature withdrawal for investors . In a rising interest rate scenario , FMPs are usually recommended to investors in the highest tax bracket . This is because , FMPs are considered to be more tax efficient and yield better post-tax returns . As far as taxation is concerned , if an investor holds an FMP , whose time horizon is more than a year then he would be taxed 10% without indexation and 20% with indexation . In the case of Short-Term FMPs ( that is less than a year ) ; the investors can look at dividend option where the dividend distribution tax is at 13.52% . This is against FDs , wherein , the investor is taxed as per the income tax slab . For instance , if an FD and FMP yield a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , then the post-tax return would be 5.36% and 7.20% , respectively . FMPs are a substitute for FDs ; however the latter have been considered as a safer investment option by our parents and grandparents due to the safety and assured returns that came with them . However , in the case of FMPs , neither the returns nor the portfolio is known to the investor and this makes it difficult for them to authenticate it . <p> AMCs and experts are pushing FMPs among investors , however we advise investors to keep the following points in mind before purchasing the product . <p> 1 . FMPs work well when the macro-economic scenario is unfavourable , i.e. when interest rates are on an upward trajectory due to inflationary concerns , and the liquidity in the system is negative . In the case of an improvement in the scenario FMPs should not be preferred by the investors . <p> 2 . From , the time SEBI prohibited the fund houses from declaring indicative yields and portfolios , the investors have no information except than the name and the tenure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the investors to look at the portfolios of the FMPs that have already been launched . This would give them an idea of the instruments into which the investor money has been allocated . The investors should also look at the pedigree of the fund house and their strategy in managing short-term funds . <p> 3 . Although , SEBI has made it compulsory for fund houses to list the FMPs so that investors who want to go for premature withdrawal can do so . However , we believe that this option is not as liquid as it is considered to be ; as a premature exit from an FMP would also prevent the investor to take advantage of the rising interest rate scenario . Hence , only those investors who do not require money for a stipulated time period should go for this product . <p> To conclude , investors with a time horizon of 1-2 years and who fall in the highest tax bracket can park their surplus money in FMPs . <p> DISCLAIMERiFAST and/or its content and research team ? s licensed representatives may own or have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Management Company mentioned or referred to in the article , and may from time to time add or dispose of , or be materially interested in any such .

These parameters were considered while planning the complex . <p> The complex has been divided into two blocks - Main and Admin . The separate Admin Block will house all the administrative offices of KSRTC except those which will need interaction with the public . The Main Block will have eleven storeys with a basement . <p> On the ground floor , the passengers will have to enter through a commercial area . Only passengers will be allowed beyond a point into the bus bay ; thus controlling the crowd into the terminal . The first floor will be completely used for commercial purposes .

While the 25 bases within the main bus bay will function for services either starting from and plying via Thampanoor bus station . A small inlet will be provided outside the building to function as a bus stand for city services . <p> The movement of buses within the terminal is restricted to one way , thus preventing cross traffic . The complex is being built at an elevation anticipating the floods that occasionally disrupt the area . A recent proposal - which is not yet approved -- is to build a foot bridge connecting the first railway station platform to the bus terminal . <p> Tribute Paid <p> The bus terminal has been designed with the traditional elevation of the Central Railway Station in mind .

As the Enchakkal terminal is yet to come up , the Thampanoor terminal will be used for all bus services contrary to its purpose of catering to just Mofussil services . <p> Yet with all apprehensions , Trivandrum is eagerly waiting for the all new Thampanoor Bus Terminal ; hoping it will bring a much needed breathing space in the city 's traffic scenario .

@@4228233 <h> Tool-making animals <p> Benjamin Franklin , one of America 's Founding Fathers , was not only a statesman but a scientist as well . He fabricated , among other things , the lightning arrester and the bifocal spectacles . While waiting to present his ambassadorial credentials , in 1774 , to the British Crown ( in vain , since the Crown still held America to be its colony ) , he dropped a spoonful of olive oil on the water surface of Clapham Common , and seeing it uniformly covering the entire surface ( half an acre ) of the water , suggested that this would be an efficient way to calm choppy and troubled waters . <p> He noted that the oil surface was extremely thin and widely spread , giving rise to prismatic colours . Agnes Pockels , who repeated this experiment in 1890 , was able to estimate the thickness of each molecule of olive oil ( remarkably correctly ) to be millionth of a millimetre . He is also credited with having made the statement " Man is a tool-making animal . " <h> The realisation <p> Had he been alive today , he would have gladly withdrawn this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesser " animals such as the monkey and the crow are sapient ; they can make tools to serve a given purpose . Chimpanzees , our ancestors , use thin twigs of plants to ease out termites off their mounds and eat them . Until recently , this ability was thought to be in the sole domain of us , primates and at best mammals . But this hubris has also been broken a few years ago . It now appears that birds and bees too make tools ! <p> That the common bird , the crow , can make a tool for a purpose was shown a few years ago by scientists in England . They had placed a piece of meat in a small vessel ( a mini-bucket with an erect handle ) and placed the vessel in a tall glass cylinder . The crow could see the meat but could not reach for it . <p> The scientists had placed a thin piece of metal wire nearby . The crow , torn with the desire to eat the meat , took the wire in mouth , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hockey stick and eased out the bucket off the glass jar and ate the meat ! <p> You can see the entire drama by going on to Google , and asking for YouTube and Tool-making crows . After watching this , an admiring viewer dryly remarks : " The average 4-year-old ( human child ) will stick their hand in these and their hand will most likely get stuck , and then there will be lots of screaming and crying for mommy . " <p> In fact , accessing " crow makes tools " gives us a variety of instances of brainy behaviour by the common ( shall we say sapient ) crow . In one such instance , crows in Japan are seen to drop walnuts ( and similar nuts with thick shells ) on the road , wait for cars to pass over and crack the shell , and carry away the nuts . <p> Tool making by animals goes even further in time , in evolution . In this week 's " Science Now " , Rebecca Kessler describes tool making by fish in water ! She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great barrier Reef heard an odd cracking sound . It was being made by a one-foot-long black spot tusk fish , which was holding a clam in its mouth and whacking it against a rock . As it cracked open , it swallowed the clam and swam on . <h> Fish 's strategy <p> This too can be seen by accessing Google , and asking for Rebecca Kessler and tool by fish . Another fish , this one called archer fish , uses a different strategy . It uses water itself as a tool . It is seen to jet off streams of water at prey on coast , and as the prey is immobilized thus , comes over and dines of it . <p> Go even lower in evolution to the beetles . One particular beetle called the Papuan weevil has legs that turn inwards and outwards , and has circular threads within , which it uses to trap and eat the prey -- the earliest natural chopsticks , if you will . <p> But by far the most stunning example of tool making comes from a spider described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : As night falls , this spider comes out , selects a site and starts manufacturing a hand weapon -- a silk ribbon net . This is to be thrown over its kill to immobilize and eat it . " This strategy appears remarkably similar to the Roman Retiarius gladiators , who did the same to their opponents . The spider is thus named the Retiarius spider . <p> Given all this , we need to ask the question : what constitutes a tool ? A tool is made for a purpose . And if the purpose is changed , will the tool be accordingly modified or will a new tool be made ? Put in another way , are these ' tools ' of the spider or weevil hard-wired into their genes and thus the physiology ? <p> A tool is made for a purpose ; if the purpose changes , will the tool be accordingly modified , or a new tool made ? These latter require a mind to think and make judgements . It is no longer just instinct , but intelligence . Are the spider and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crow and the monkey are .

Samachar.com is now owned by Sify.com . Jain has been keen on launching One.in in a construct similar to the Drudge report , with human selection of content . <p> Most aggregators use crawlers to select news from select sources , to create what is sometimes called a " river of news " , which is then sorted for display . Without human selection , news displayed in the way Google News does . Techmeme , for example , has its river of news here . One.in has its news sources at Narada.oneindia.in . This is all quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an RSS feed and and something like an Aggregator wordpress theme , which we 're using for this site . <p> While collecting news headlines is easy online , what matters when it comes to aggregation and discovery , is clearly editorial curation . This is why Techmeme is infinitely better than the Google News tech section . <p> One.in and Photographs <p> What we noted with One.in , is that it is hotlinking photographs from the news websites : this means that photographs are being served to One.in from the servers of the original publishers , and even though they link back to the main news article , the same way headlines link back to the articles , this could be seen as republishing content . We 've raised this issue with what Web18 's Connect.in.com has been doing with content , where the site creates galleries of images from external sources to get traffic from search results , offering only a link back to the original source below the image . An argument might be that the sites send traffic to the original publisher , but this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copyright violation , because the content is served from the original publisher . <p> Conceptually curated content sounds good . However , this just stops at curating Headlines and then rephrasing them in a catchy manner ( unlike drudge which reproduces them as well ) . I also wonder how would the monetisation happen as there is no ad spot , no content layers or inner pages and even the stories do n't open in an iframe ( drudge is amongst the top sites so a comparison may not be worthy currently ) . This also leads to a question on why or how should the audience come back ( the story opens in a new window but not in an iframe ) after completing the story ( in drudge report the link opens in the same window , so u can press the back button )

Or would you feel better if you are told that Rs10,000 invested in a fund three years back would have now grown to Rs15,208 ? Sebi thinks investors would be comfortable with the latter -- that actual figures sound better than percentages . <p> Jayachandran/Mint <p> In a move to revamp the way MFs advertise their schemes and their performances , Sebi has now mandated fund houses to avoid giving compounded annualized growth rates ( CAGR ) . Expressed in terms of percentage growth , this was how fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many investors do not understand what CAGR means and what to make of it . Communication has to be done in a simple manner , " said U.K. Sinha , chairman , Sebi , at a press conference , soon after its board meeting . <p> Additionally , Sebi has mandated that the performances of schemes must be measured against the Sensex or the Nifty , the two most popularly followed equity indices in India or against a government of India security in case of a debt fund . <p> Some fund houses feel it 's a good move . <p> Says Milind Barve , managing director , HDFC Asset Management Co . ( AMC ) Ltd : " The term ' CAGR ' does not connect with the common man . People like us in the financial world can take it for granted . Although mathematically it is an accurate way to depict returns , the common man truly does n't understand . " <p> Not all are convinced . " The new way of giving returns will unnecessarily paint a rosy picture . It 's easy to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is advertised to have grown from Rs10,000 . Besides , banks give out their interest rates that investors can earn from fixed deposits ; they never say your money will double in five years ' or some such thing . Even the public provident fund gives out a rate in terms of percentage , " says Jaydeep Kashikar , director , Brainpoint Investment Centre Ltd , a Mumbai-based financial planning firm . <p> But Barve believes that is exactly the kind of message the fund houses should not give . He says : " When you give returns in terms of percentage , it could be misconstrued that the past performance figure is what investors will get . That 's not what an MF wants to say , is it ? " <p> That 's not all . Henceforth , any scheme 's advertisement will also need to be accompanied by the performance of all the schemes managed by the same fund manager . " Normally , fund houses highlight the performance of one scheme that has been doing well while ignoring the performance of , say , 10 other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underperformers do n't even beat the Sensex or Nifty , and you never come to know of them , " says Kashikar , who believes that this will help investors ' decision . <p> Apart from having to disclose some uncomfortable truths , fund houses -- especially the larger ones -- are also going to find it tricky to accommodate a lot of data in their advertisements . Says Waqar Naqvi , chief executive officer , Taurus AMC Ltd : " Some larger fund houses have a single fund manager managing about four to five schemes . The size of the advertisements may become larger ; the cost could go up . " <p> Common account statement <p> Already the two largest registrars of the MF industry -- Computer Age Management Services Ltd ( Cams ) and Karvy Computershare Pvt . Ltd -- provide consolidated account statements across fund houses whenever you demand . Sebi has now mandated fund houses -- and by that virtue its registrars -- to issue consolidated account statements across fund houses , every time you invest in a fund . Earlier , fund houses used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment . But this would be limited to only the fund house in which you would invest . <p> Going forward , you will get an account statement across fund houses managed by a single registrar . <p> Distributor regulation <p> Sebi wants to regulate MF distributors and in its board meeting , it took baby steps towards that . In the absence of any regulations so far , it has put the onus on fund houses though . <p> Sebi has asked fund houses to disclose the commission they pay to distributors . Additionally , the Association of Mutual Funds of India ( Amfi ) , MF industry 's trade body , will need to disclose the aggregate amount of commissions that the fund houses pay to such distributors . <p> To begin with , only those distributors who are present in at least 20 locations or with assets under management ( AUM ) higher than Rs100 crore across all MFs ( only retail money ) or commissions of over Rs1 crore per annum across all MFs or commissions earned over Rs50 crore from a single fund house will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around half of the industry 's AUM contributed by distributors . <p> Some fund officials like Naqvi do n't see much of a point in this exercise . " How will the investors benefit if they come to know that one distributor is getting , say Rs2 crore from one fund and then , say , Rs5 crore from all fund houses ? " Naqvi believes that there could be a bigger agenda behind this exercise . <p> However , a senior fund official , who did not want to be named , said that there has been discussions at Amfi recently on whether fund houses should appoint " tied agents " the way the insurance sector does -- all fund houses appoint exclusive agents who work only for them and no other fund house . This official believes that if Amfi or Sebi , after collecting this distributor data , observes that many large distributors ' business comes from one or very few fund houses , it could give a boost to tied agents ' argument . Or if the biggest distributors are getting a certain level of commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that schemes charge investors , Sebi may look at that . <p> Distributor transaction charge <p> Perhaps the biggest norm is the comeback of the charges you pay to your distributor , almost two years after Sebi had abolished entry loads in August 2009 . Though we wrote about it extensively in our edition dated 29 July , here 's a recap for those who have just joined the Sebi-MF show . Every time you invest RS10,000 or more in an MF scheme , you will need to pay your distributor a transaction charge of RS100 . The same goes for your systematic investment plans if the total amount committed is Rs10,000 or more . " In competing industries ( such as unit-linked insurance plans ) , distributors get higher commission hence they are more incentivised to sell those products . The tribe of MF distributors had become smaller . Now at least , to some extent , this problem will be rectified , " says Debasish Mallick , managing director , IDBI AMC. @ @ @ @ 
@@4253233 <h> Sensor Networks for Arctic Environmental Monitoring <p> By Andrew Rettig <p> " Top of the World , Point Barrow Alaska , " as it is known by the local Inupiat Eskimo , is the northern most point on the continent of North America . Just a few miles to the south-west of the point is Barrow , Alaska , home to four thousand people . In March 2010 , Barrow was highlighted in a Smithsonian article entitled , " Barrow , Alaska : Ground Zero for Climate Change . " Scientists from all over the world ascend to Barrow every year to research the Arctic as well as learn from the Eskimo elders and hunters . It was for just these reasons that the Arctic Climatology Sensor Network Prototype ( ACSNP ) was developed . The University of Cincinnati excels at Arctic research and Dr. Richard Beck wanted to implement an Arctic Sensor Network that would stream data , in near-real-time , from the Arctic to Cincinnati and eventually into the cloud . <p> Sensor test site 1 on top of the Barrow Arctic Research Center . <p> The project began out of necessity . Arctic research takes place in very extreme environments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periods can easily be damaged by the harsh environmental conditions or by an adventurous polar bear or Arctic fox , often recognized by their tracks and teeth marks . Even trying to physically access sensors in extreme environments can cause problems such as the cracking of cables or unsealing of access points . Also , with no external monitoring of the sensors there is no way to be aware of discontinued data feeds . Lastly , reliable Arctic scientific sensors for extended monitoring are very costly . Our approach was to experiment with less expensive sensors , using more of them and streaming the data in near-real-time . <p> The goal for this network was to make it interoperable , scalable and extensible . Initially to create an interoperable network , standardized sensors that worked over TCP/IP were needed to collect the data . With this initial standardization , the sensors could be easily connected to embedded Linux devices for FTP connectivity . The ACSNP has both meteorology sensors and cameras at each of the three test sites . The meteorology sensor is the Davis Vantage Pro II , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cameras with heaters and blowers at each of our three test sites . Each site also has one Stardot netcam XL , which is a standalone network camera with a built-in Web server , email and FTP client . The Stardot also has the ability to record and stream meteorological data . All of our sensors have survived the Arctic winters and are continually being tested for durability . <p> Arctic tundra sensor site . <p> Connecting to these sensors on the tundra was an additional challenge . The wireless broadband network is a 700 MHz WipLL augmented with Iridium Open Port Units , which allow for global connectivity . The 700 MHz system has a radius of 16 kilometers encompassing the entire infrastructure for the city of Barrow as well as open tundra and ice . The Iridium units , on the other hand , are associated with the only complete global commercial communication satellites . With global wireless access , the only current sensor installation limitation for the ACSNP is electricity . <p> ACSNP was designed using the best of current technology , adding scalability to the network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information technology ( IT ) company and a data transfer company . The IT company , INTRUST Group Inc. based in Cincinnati , Ohio , incorporated high availability virtualization into the project with Avance by Stratus . The mirrored server configuration of Avance accommodated the remoteness of our Arctic FTP servers . The Arctic servers created a local buffer which helped to assure the data integrity even when the connection to the " lower 48 " went down . The data transfer company , Linoma Software , donated the software , GoAnywhere Director . GoAnywhere automated the FTP processes and parsing data to the SQL database . With the addition of these partnerships , our network became an elegant solution with user-friendly interfaces , self-updating software and an easily duplicated method for universities , businesses and government agencies . <p> With the network infrastructure in place , ACSNP could connect through international standards to sensors in Barrow or further out on the tundra . The data are transferred through FTP and parsed into a Microsoft SQL Server database in Cincinnati . The ACSNP IPs are constantly monitored and the transfer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into SQL , the process gets much easier . The ACSNP can store the information in a current reading table and pass the old record into the history table . Using a unique ID for each sensor , the sensor table is joined to the spatial data table for geocoding . The ACSNP uses ArcGIS Server to manage the spatial data utilizing the Open Geospatial Consortium ( OGC ) specifications incorporated into the data storage , enabling interoperability at the database level . The server can also publish the information as a Web application or as standardized Web services such as KML and WMS , among others . These standards are interoperable in common geobrowsers , such as Google Earth , creating the desired " common operational picture " ( COP ) for decision making processes . <p> Unfortunately , streaming live video was not an option due to throughput limitations . Generally , the cameras in the ACSNP would record images every 10 minutes . However , the time lapse is relative to the desired event being recorded . The ACSNP cameras were placed on the Meade River to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global warming . Time intervals any larger than 10 minutes would have diminished the results , missing upstream dam breaks and the physical processes involved in the breakup . Again , the ACSNP utilized the GoAnywhere Director to easily manage and automate the movement of these pictures . A small amount of code was written in ArcGIS to associate the image with the spatial data for easy Web server publication and visualization . <p> The ACSNP solution fills the gap between actually taking the reading with a sensor and automating that reading into the cloud to be published as standardized geospatial services . The solution has already been implemented on other University of Cincinnati research projects . The Department of Defense and the university were working on a barge in Lake Erie streaming data from an aerostat , an unmanned blimp . Cameras and environmental sensors were attached to the barge , as well as the aerostat , streaming data to an FTP server . An undergraduate student was able to easily adapt the ACSNP to add the sensors to the network . The user interfaces and flexibility of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our hope is for the ACSNP to continue to assist with research at the university while providing a working prototype for educating others on the possibilities of filling the infrastructure gap between the sensor reading and the utilization of standardized Web services .

@@4253236 <h> Getting for the poor their due in private hospitals <p> The recent direction of the Supreme Court of India to government hospitals in Delhi to refer poor patients to private hospitals gains significance not only as one more pro-poor judicial pronouncement but also because it highlights one of the major contradictions in India 's health care service : even as there has been a mushrooming of huge , well-equipped , multi-discipline hospitals in big cities serving the rich , thousands of rural India 's poor patients have to go without even a semblance of medical care when they desperately need it . <p> A two-member bench of the apex court comprising Justice R.V.

During an earlier hearing of the appeal , the court came down heavily on the private hospitals . Stating that they behaved like " star hotels , " they were highly critical of these hospitals for collecting abnormal charges from the poor .

What exactly they mean by giving free heath care . No one goes in to the nitty gritty of the costing of health services but every one wants to criticize the heath care industry .

The health care industry has to spend money on equipment , their operational costs , land costs , water , electricity , man power costs and so on . Who will pay for all this ? Investors expect dividends , professionals after years of burning mid night oil and long working hours would need proper remuneration , and employees proper salary . An MBA or even a soft ware engineer , often with much less intelligence and hard work can get a fat pay check but doctors should not get .

There is no ' inherent contradiction ' in India 's health care service . The reason is because India does not have a health care service . What you are referring to is healthcare ' industry ' , and if so then there is nothing contractictory in pursuit of profit . Unethical ? may be . 2 . The order of SC to direct government hospitals is toothless . I disagree with the fact that government hospitals have hitherto been disinterested in referring poor patients to pvt hospitals . They may have been ignorant about it , or hesistant to refer since if such referrals are refused by the pvt hosp then it puts the Doc in bad light . The Supreme Court would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other media agencies to carry out publicity of existence of such policies . 3 . I think the entire focus of healthcare reform in India is misguided . We keep hearing and reading that the government is trying to intrude in private healthcare space and make some arrangement for treatment of the poor . This , in my opinion , is a ' compromise ' approach to the problem . It stinks of the understatement that we can not build a quality public medical infrastructure system ever . That aside , assuming all pvt hospitals loan a part of their services to the poor as a part of policy , the sum total of this service will still be insufficient to address the medical concerns of the poor . The debt which the state may incur in the life of policy is a different matter . So , why do n't we focus on creation and improvement of public medical infrastructure ? The political apathy towards taking bold and concrete step is striking . The public apathy , disheartening . <p> from : Anay Shukla <p> Posted on : Aug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Hindu for highlighting innovative judgement of the Supreme Court to provide treatments to poor patients in private hospitals . Earlier the Delhi high court has had also directed the private hospitals for such treatment on quota basis in percentage . Some time it is really heartening SC delivers some judgements on social issues aflicting the poor in India instead of making oral observation , lambasting govt , people ignoring such observations must come up in writings . SC has rightly directed the govt to prepare modalities for such treatment to poor free of cost .

Hinting at the opportunity for games that target exclusively iPhone and iPad in India , he adds that this refers to the premium segment , comprising passionate gamers , who may be less price-sensitive , but tech-savvy and high-earning . " The size of this iSegment is 100 million globally , and the size of iPhone4 alone is 1.8 million in India . If you go by the growth of Apple , this segment is growing very fast , importantly , with the same demographic structure , " avers Dhiren , during a recent interaction with Business Line . Our conversation continues over the email . <p> Excerpts from the interview . <p> How do you see the opportunities before the gaming industry in India ? <p> In the last 15 years , India has witnessed considerable economic growth . This , in addition to its demographic structure , offers immense potential for the gaming industry . An amalgamation of our culture , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth offer the perfect platform for the gaming industry . IT and telecom considerably drive the gaming industry . In fact , by 2013 , the telecom subscriber base is expected to increase to 725 million with a mobile penetration of 60 per cent . <p> While the global gaming industry is growing at 22 per cent , the Indian gaming industry is valued at Rs 10 billion and is expected to grow to reach Rs 38 billion by 2015 . India offers a huge pool of talent in the IT and programming sector which plays a substantial role in the development of quality games at reasonably lower costs . Additionally , while the gaming industry is picking up , serious players and investors are entering into the industry , consequently facilitating its further growth . <p> Recently , 3G rollout in India , an increasing number of high-end mobile phone users , and broadband and DTH penetration into homes , contributed to the strong market currents that the Indian gaming industry is now riding on . Over the years , the price of games has come down significantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mobile phone consumers , for instance , a growing iPhone consumer base , point towards a promising future for the mushrooming gaming industry . These buyers thus become a very lucrative segment which includes a premium , tech-savvy population which , evidently , has higher disposable incomes . <p> Would you like to specify a few key areas of gaming in which India has the right potential ? <p> Outsourcing came as a big break for the Indian gaming industry . Primarily , India 's outsourcing businesses cater to the US and the UK gaming market . With its existing IT infrastructure and talent , India can be a dominant player in the global games production segment . The strong infrastructure and capability to deliver high quality work can act as driving factors to increase our outsourcing pie in the international gaming market . <p> India offers a significant cost advantage to the global gaming industry . When the global market witnessed an economic slowdown , expenditure reached the top of the priority lists of game manufacturers in developed countries . Indian gaming industry can take the advantage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gaming production houses while maintaining the global standard of work . <p> However , content plays an important factor in the gaming world . An industry which is primarily dominated by mid- to small-sized players is not doing enough to create and distribute its own content . Intellectual property ( IP ) is one of the core areas where our gaming industry needs to work with greater focus . Furthermore , for the international market , it is also very important to understand their culture and interests while creating gaming content . Content localisation and distribution can play a vital role in the industry . <p> These factors coupled with extensive industry support in the form of funding , and an environment for domestic market development , can steadily further the progress of an emerging gaming industry . <p> Are Indian companies leveraging gaming for building their brands and business ? <p> At the moment , the gaming industry is an emerging segment in India . It also offers innovation in brand building and a new way of interacting with the target groups of customers in any brand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of multilevel interactions , which help create high recall value . <p> Some big business houses have already carried out in-game advertising campaigns for their brands . ( Recently , Mile Nine Studios developed a game for Tata Indica Vista called Paint Ball Hitch to bring out the brand proposition effectively and build steady recall in the consumers ' mind aligned with the company 's current communication . ) <p> Currently , around 45 per cent casual gamers in India are women ; and women are increasingly and more frequently playing games in India . Therefore , advertising in any gaming content developed for targeting women gamers can be a very attractive proposition for a women 's brand to reach the TG with customised interaction . Success of in-games advertising will be a win-win situation for both the brands and the gaming companies . <p> What are the factors that stand in the way of India realising its potential in gaming and what are the antidotes ? <p> Indian gaming industry will only be negatively affected if the growing demand of gaming professionals is not met . Going by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of skilled gaming professionals . Talent is the key to achieving the true potential of the gaming industry in India . <p> Along with quantity , the quality of games produced is just as crucial . Highly skilled professionals are required to produce stunning designs and fresh concepts using the best in technology . Training and development programmes for the gaming industry professionals are crucial to meet future demand and supply needs . There is a scarcity of skilled gaming professionals in India and this is restricting the growth of the industry . <p> Piracy is another important threat , as in any other entertainment segment . It discourages investors and professionals to take necessary risk for the growth of the industry . If incentive gets reduced by the piracy , the growth story of the gaming industry can be derailed . The Government should address the piracy issue through effective policy and regulations . <p> In addition , tax and customs duty imposed on the gaming industry are considerably high in India . A sound Government policy that focuses on the reduction of taxes can be a strong catalyst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making the Indian gaming industry more competitive at the international level . <p> To those who aspire to be the part of the gaming industry , your tips on the skills they should have . <p> The success of the gaming industry largely relies on an ideal blend of technology , talent , creativity , marketing , and distribution . The people who want to be a part of this advancement have to find their niche in these fundamental areas . But the technical professionals who are into production and development need a high level of creativity and technical skill , in addition to a strong passion to produce stunning games for the world of gamers.

On Sunday , corpses were scattered in the streets and hospitals were overwhelmed with bloodied casualties , suggesting the death toll could rise sharply , witnesses said . <p> Ramadan , which begins Monday , will present a critical test for the government , which has unleashed deadly firepower since March but still has not been able to put down the revolt .

The tickets were so cheap it cost us more for the bus to the Aarhus Airport ! <p> A port in northern Poland , Gdansk has a lot to offer tourists . The Royal Route takes visitors past some beautiful buildings in varied pastel shades . While Gdansk is home to St. Mary 's , the largest brick church in the world , walking along the city 's beach offers you the rare chance to pick up Poland 's famous amber that washes up on its shores . Our self-guided tour of the city was quick as we planned to take a train early next morning to Warsaw , the capital .

They 're old and shabby , have smelly toilets and since Poland is hosting the Euro Cup next year , much of their stations and rail network are under construction , causing much delay in the arrival and departure of trains . <p> Warsaw is big , business-like and has the distinct impression of being the capital . As we stepped out of the railway station , the first thing we noticed was a giant clock tower built by Joseph Stalin in the 1950s .

Krakow is to me what many travellers have found and loved in Prague . Its main market square is the centre of activity with plenty of outdoor restaurants that is so typical of Europe , with street artists providing entertainment for passersby . Nestled in the middle of the square is the Renaissance Sukiennice or Cloth Hall .

With none of us having heard of or eaten a zapiekanka , we decided to stand in the line to see what the fuss was all about . Zapiekankas are halved baguettes topped with mushroom , cheese and a choice of meat or vegetables . Easy to make , zapiekankas offer students and those on the move a quick snack . With melted cheese dripping from every bite , this delicious snack had us asking for more .

As an Indian , I had only watched in movies what had taken place during World War II . <p> On returning to Krakow , my friends and I took the last train to Gdansk .

@@4262240 <h> The brave heart <h> As Tigmanshu Dhulia continues to nix the jinx in his career , he recaps his journey for Anuj Kumar . <p> Today Anurag Kashyap and Dibakar Banerjee are considered the vanguards of new age cinema . The media raves about them as small town boys who made it big in Bollywood . But few know that it was Tigmanshu Dhulia who started the trend way back in 2003 with Haasil but lack of multiplexes and a rather jinxed career has kept this talented director out of the spotlight . With Sahib Biwi Aur Gangster and Paan Singh Tomar ready for release and two more films in the pipeline , Tigmanshu is looking for a new dawn in an industry that is notorious for not giving second chances . <p> Tigmanshu grew up in Allahabad , the Allahabad which was once the cultural centre of North India . " I remember as a kid going to the house of Sumitra Nandan Pant and Mahadevi Varma for literary soirees . In those days Allahabad was buzzing with activity . On one hand we had a beautiful literary scene and on the other , rock music was thriving . My Mumbai friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , Rock Street Journal , was first published from Allahabad . And then there was a strong film scene where you could watch The Godfather in the theatre and Godard 's cinema in film societies . The city provided the complete intellectual stimulus .

You take the train in the night and by next morning you are in the Capital of the country . Soon the cream of the city -- the lawyers , the artistes and the literary giants -- started shifting to Delhi . In many ways Allahabad 's loss has been Delhi 's gain . " <p> On a more serious note , he holds the rise of coalition politics responsible for the neglect . " I am no fan of the Left but the fact is that Allahabad used to have a strong presence of the Left and it provided a general liberal , secular atmosphere required during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Delhi and joined the National School of Drama . Here his ideas got solidified into flesh and blood . He remained active in the city 's theatre circuit for many years and assisted Ketan Mehta and Pradip Krishen but Shekhar Kapur 's camping in Delhi to scout for talent for Bandit Queen changed his life forever . " He showed us that Bombay is a reality and that Delhi boys can make it to Bollywood . Mandi House used to wear a deserted look in those days because almost everybody was preparing for a career in Hindi films . " <p> Though he also contributed dialogues to the film , he only got credited as casting director -- a new designation in the Hindi film industry but something he thoroughly deserved . After all he had helped Shekhar find his queen in Seema Biswas and the likes of Manoj Bajpai for support . But his biggest find is Irrfan Khan whom he suggested for The Warrior . Tigmanshu says he has not only given intense actors to the industry . " Bhumika Chawla who went on to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had first cast her in one of the episodes of Star Bestsellers .

" Shekhar was supposed to helm it . The first serial I shot was Hum Mumbai Nahin Jayenege . We shot a few episodes but one day we got the news that Shekhar is going to direct Elizabeth . He left the country , the channel closed and we became orphans in Mumbai . The silver lining was that the episodes became the show reels for actors -- the likes of Sanjay Mishra , Manoj Bajpai and Nirmal Pandey . Whenever they showed it to some producer or director he would invariably ask who has directed it and they would take my name .

At that time Bobby Bedi , who produced Bandit Queen , offered me to direct the tele-serial Rajdhani and get it passed at Star as I was in their good books , and in return he offered to back Haasil . " <p> The serial started but Bedi apparently did n't show any interest . " My climax was to be shot at the Kumbh Mela and it was almost over . Ultimately with the help of my friends I raised around 4-5 lakh rupees and shot the climax . Then we showed the footage to producers . That 's how the film got started .

" They are looking for the right opening for the film after they suffered losses with Tees Maar Khan and 7 Khoon Maaf . " <p> Is n't it the same banner which made Anurag Kashyap 's Dev.D , which then became the talk of the town ? Tigmanshu calls it the play of destiny . " Dev.D changed the course for Anurag as it was not only critically successful but also proved commercially viable , " says Tigmanshu , who is playing the role of the main villain in friend Anurag 's next film Gangs of Waseypur after Anurag played a gangster in Shagird . In a lighter vein , he reminds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For now he is busy with the promotion of Sahib Biwi Aur Gangster , which he calls a contemporary take on Sahib Biwi Aur Ghulam . " It is about the politics of sex , set in Rajasthan .

" How many times can you show a young couple making love in a car in a big city ? Love still has many obstacles in small towns .

What are these people up to today ? Are they busy ? Are they leisurely shopping ? Is this person looking grumpy ? Is this one too arrogant ? <p> These were the questions running through my head at speeds unimaginable to even my mind , and I thought I was the one with wild ideas . <p> So when I attempted to approach someone , who did n't bother to slow down one bit as I opened my mouth just to say " Good Morning " or a simple " Hi " , I realised , " Hey , this is way tougher than I thought . " <p> When I actually went to talk to someone about the toys and games in my hand and bag , there were a few people who politely declined saying they had already bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mention that we were all wearing a uniformed t-shirt of the Mandi ? Well , I had just faced a rejection and this was my first proper reject . <p> I moved on thanking the old lady and approached someone else but was n't too comfortable just walking up to a stranger again . <h> We were referred as the ' disturbing elements ' <p> Once again , I reluctantly searched the crowd for a face that I can try to read , a person who might just seem patient enough to listen . <p> I reluctantly tried again and approached a group of 4 to 5 girls who were probably leaving a store after making some purchase . <p> I started a conversation with them talking about the NGO and the products I carry in my bag . They seemed reluctant at buying something from a salesperson at first but somehow I was able to get the conversation going based on some common associations with one of them who happened to be not only from my city , but my school too . <p> I had finally met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the products I carried in my bag . I thanked the four ladies who bought a product despite their hesitations , and felt proud to have crossed the first hurdle . It felt GOOD ! ! ! <p> Meanwhile , my teammate , Anshul , had come up with an alternate idea . I saw that after selling the toys , Anshul , who was carrying a camera would request the consumer to get a picture clicked along with the newly bought toys . I realised that his gesture was an interesting one and made a lot of difference to how the consumer felt after buying the product . <p> When things went out of hand <p> Further , I went on to find our next customer around the same shopping complex , and while attempting to talk to someone outside a supermarket , a group of security guards started objecting to our presence . <p> Despite our attempts to pacify them , it was clear that their aggression was not really going away until we were gone . We tried to tell them that we were students on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our ID cards and the letters of permit we were carrying , but by now the matter was quite escalated . <p> Step by step we got pushed farther away from the supermarket and by late afternoon , we had reached the street , but that was not enough for the guards . <p> They wanted us gone from the street as well . We did not lose hope and decided to hold our ground in defence . Not to mention the torrential arguments that criss-crossed between us ; we , the students and the guards . <p> Shouting at each other would be an understatement . Just then two people walked up to us to confirm if we were from NITIE . We got to know that they were our alumni . They took notice of the NITIE logo in the middle of a commotion and thought they should step in to see what the whole matter was all about . <p> Suddenly , my teammate and I found a new source of energy . Soon , the guards also got their reinforcements . A bunch of goons ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these reinforcements ) came with the objective to rid the property of the " disturbing elements " . <p> Yeah , that 's right , my friends and I were constantly referred to as the " disturbing elements " . <p> Seriously , who gave them that idea ? ? Within seconds our voices were restored to normal decibel levels . They informed us that the roughly one kilometre street on which we were holding ground , was actually a private property . <p> My teammate and I along with our alumni dispersed from the spot but since we were continuously being followed by the reinforcements , it would be apt to say , that we were being escorted off the property . <p> After that was a lot of running around in the hopes of finding a possible ' Safe ' market . At the end of the day , we had covered roughly 160km without selling much . <p> Did I succeed in selling the products in my bag ? <p> Well , more than selling the products , we had just realised what it takes to sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must conclude that selling a toy on the streets is not that easy as I initially thought it to be . <p> Reader Invite <p> Have you participated in a B-school event recently ?

In fact , they had a few significant reasons to celebrate after clinching the FA Cup and also automatic entry into the group stages of the Champions League for this season . With characters like Mario Balotelli and Carlos Tevez on board , Mancini never had an easy job but after achieving all their aims and aspirations as far as last season was concerned , have they evolved into an empire that should be feared by the rest of Europe 's elite ? <p> A victorious 2010-11 campaign <p> A Season That Marked Their True Resurgence .. <p> Roberto Mancini 's celebratory style at Wembley after City lifted the FA Cup spoke for the progress that has seen the club rise to prominence within a few years . Of course , it was with the endless financial backing from the mega-rich Arabians but nevertheless , Mancini did play a massive part in their successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conquer the battle for an automatic Champions League spot for showcased by their signing of David Silva , who then became a central figure in all their success . Yaya Toure is another one that definitely deserves a mention . Frankly speaking , Mancini and co. had a rather consistent season with only a few minor blights . Perhaps , the Tevez crisis and Kolo Toure ban were the only road bumps they encountered on their path . Not forgetting Mario Balotelli odd antics , of course . <p> There is not much creativity in this City side but what Mancini has at his disposal is a group of solid and hardworking players . Having born fighters like Kompany and Yaya Toure was the element that made the difference for them ultimately . Roberto Mancini might not be a ' Joga Bonito ' professor but the Italian is certainly a mastermind of tactics- impeccably proved at Eastlands last season . <p> That extra solidity eventually shone towards the end of the season when both Spurs and Arsenal faltered while City maintained their composure to nick that automatic Champions League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it concluded in style with a historic cup to parade . <p> Completed Transfers So Far <p> Stefan Savic : The young defender looks to be an orthodox solid defender and City scored the coup by signing him on a four year deal last month . Ironically , Savic had a 10-day trial with Arsenal last year but a permanent move failed to materialize and he joined Partizan Belgrade instead . Now , City have brought him to Eastlands and only time will tell whether he will be a success or not . <p> Gael Clichy : While Aleksandar Kolarov was brought in for a huge amount of fee last year , the Serbian failed to impress largely due to injuries and other issues . Kolarov is also a terrific option going forward but defensively , he was n't the best option that they had . Therefore , Clichy has been brought in to deal with the issue . The former Arsenal man is indeed a well-established left-back and looks to be a fantastic signing for them . Will definitely add more solidity into the team this season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sergio Aguero : With the future of Carlos Tevez yet to be decided , City acted quickly by bringing in a talented forward in the form of Sergio Aguero . The Argentine striker is capable of being rampant in attack when on song and he is also flexible enough to feature on either flanks upfront . One thing for sure though , goals and galore can be guaranteed with Aguero in their side . He is definitely a player that can change the momentum of a particular game at any time . <p> Pre-Season Performances <p> City were pretty solid in pre-season with convincing wins over Club America and Inter Milan . Their only hiccup came in a nervy 1-1 draw with LA Galaxy but otherwise , it looked encouraging for Roberto Mancini . The Community Shield defeat to United is their first defeat since pre-season started and on a overall note , they scored a total of 13 goals in six matches . <p> As Roy Keane recently quoted , " City are the real deal now " . After years of playing second fiddle to United , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as potential title challengers for this season . I expect to see more activity in transfers before the window closes , including the departure of Tevez . One thing for sure though , City will be a lot stronger than the last season . With more solidity at the back and a talented forward line , Mancini certainly has bigger targets this season . <p> The Talisman <p> Yaya Toure <p> Tevez would have been my choice but with his future still being hotly debated , I decided to look beyond the Argentine . Next on the list has to be Yaya Toure . You can speak all you want about the creativity of David Silva or perhaps the strength of Vincent Kompany at the back . But I chose Yaya Toure because for me , he was the heartbeat of City 's midfield last season . He was transformed into an attacking midfielder last season and by all means , what a difference he has made for them ... ! All his explosive breakthroughs in midfield created chances and his aerial stature was a problem for opposing midfielders . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goal that brought City the FA Cup after a 35 years trophy drought . And I expect it to continue this season . The Community Shield match was an example of how pale City can be when Toure is off the mood but with time , his form will grow and he will be back to lead their charge once again this season . <p> Possible Formations <p> 4-2-3-1 <p> This is Mancini 's preferred formation as it uses two defensive midfielders . Barry and De Jong will most likely be doing all the dirty work down in midfield , allowing the likes of Yaya Toure and David Silva to push upfront . Sergio Aguero will also easily fit into this formation as he is capable of playing on the flanks as well . Dzeko or even Balotelli will be mostly used as the target man while Toure could be dangerous with his blazing runs on the ball . <p> 4-1-2-2-1 <p> This formation will allow City to parade their three strikers upfront . Dzeko will be the target man while Aguero and Balotelli will provide support through the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win over Stoke City while playing in this sort of formation and he could definitely employed in that situation again . Aguero as we said is capable of playing on the flanks and Milner adds pure agility into the side . This formation will enable the midfield trio of Toure , De Jong and Milner to switch positions regularly . <p> Realistic targets <p> Eastlands is currently brimming with optimism but as the season progresses , there will be a definite idea of how they should be able to portray themselves . Title challenge is currently the talk of folks over there and I do n't see anything bemusing in it . It 's perfectly justifiable considering what they have achieved over the past 12 months . Progress has been made and aspirations has to be increased to another level . It will be interesting to see how they perform in the Champions League but once again , it could be a stepping stone towards another landmark season perhaps ?

The ' Pass and Move ' philosophy which had served the Reds so well during their glory years was back and so were the smiles at Anfield . Kenny 's Red Army demolished every hurdle in their path as new signings Carroll and Suarez , more than made up for the acrimonious exit of Kop hero , Fernando Torres . Anfield became the impenetrable fortress it was once and Liverpool eventually finished sixth , quite impressive when you consider the relegation dog-fight Hodgson would have led them into . So , while the Reds finished on a high , the agony of watching arch-rivals Manchester United picking up the record 19th league title must not have lost on them and expect them to be back with vengeance . <p> Transfers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liverpool 's squad last season was mediocre and the Reds have plugged some holes with quality signings in the form of Jordan Henderson , Charlie Adam , Stewart Downing and Alexander Doni . The Reds have also signed pre-contract with young stalwarts , Nacho and Bueno . <p> Here 's a brief overview of important transfer deals so far . <p> Players In <p> Jordan Henderson : Widely tipped to be Gerrard 's long-term successor by none-other-than Gerrard himself , this young ? 20million talent from Wearside has got what all it takes to be a success in the Premier League . Already having played an influential part in 2 seasons with Sunderland , this 20-year old 's exquisite range of passing makes him a deadly proposition for the Reds . <p> Charlie Adam : After a drawn-out affair with Blackpool over the acquisition of their talismanic skipper , King Kenny finally acquired his much-coveted target at a bargain price of ? 7.5m . The Scot 's delicious long-balls and his incisive set-pieces last season were a treat to watch and he could fill the void left by Xabi Alonso @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Liverpool agreed a ? 20million fee with Aston Villa for their Player of the Year . But , he may well be the most important piece of business the Reds have accomplished this summer . Downing 's exquisite crossing coupled with his trickery and eye for goal makes him one of the most sought-after players in the league . His importance assumes astronomical proportions when you consider the Andy Carroll factor . The big Geordie must be licking his lips at the prospect of providing finishes to the astute service provided to him by Downing . <p> Alexander Doni : An experienced understudy to Pepe-Reina . <p> Players Out <p> Milan Jovanovic : The Serbian was sold to Anderlecht on a Bosman transfer after enduring an abysmal debut season with the Reds . <p> Pre-Season <p> If Liverpool 's defensive set-up needed an awakening , it got one .

The understanding between Downing and Carroll in the Valencia game must have satisfied Kenny and Comolli for a shrewd piece of business . <p> What to Expect <p> There is no doubt that the Reds will be firing on all cylinders once the season starts . For one , the Anfield faithful were hardly amused by Manchester United lifting the 19th title and will be expecting their team to set the ground running . To add to the burgeoning payload of hopes , the mere thought of a full-season under Kop Legend Kenny Dalglish transports an Anfield faithful into reverie . <p> The attacking triumvirate of Suarez , Carroll and Downing makes for a scary read for opposition defenders and the creative sparks from Gerrard , Adam and Aquilani may shatter the stingiest of defences .

The South American 's street-cred and dogged determination has worked wonders and expect him to be fired up for more success after a historic title win at Copa America .

The company has reported net sales of Rs 283.54 crore for the Q1 this year against Rs 246.48 crore for Q1 last year . Its Q1 net profit was at Rs 27.59 crore against Rs 27.29 crore for the Q1 last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ekta Batra , Ashok Kumar Bansal , chairman and managing director of Hanung Toys and Textiles said that rising interest rates have affected the company ? s profit . <p> Below is the edited transcript of the interview . Also watch the accompanying video . <p> Q : What were the highlights of your first quarterperformance and how come you were able to maintain your margins ? <p> A : Last quarter we were able to achieve a turnover of Rs 283 crore against Rs 246 crore , so there is growth of 15% . We were able to maintain numbers only because of the high finance cost . <p> Last year , we marked a profit of Rs 27.29 and this year it is Rs 27.59 crore , so just 1% growth in profitability . Interest rates have been going up since last six-nine months and it that affected out bottom-line a bit . <p> Q : Do you expect your interest cost to rise ? <p> A : The central bank has reached an optimum level . Going forward , we should see rates coming down gradually . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by way of interest charges in the quarter gone by . Will this more or less be the pro-rata interest cost or should we factor in a higher interest cost ? <p> A : Much higher . We are slightly rationalising our interest costs by switching over from the exiting Indian Rupee norm to ECB ( European Central Bank ) or similar structure where we are going to save another 3-4% of interest . <p> Q : Have you already swapped any loan ? <p> A : Those loans are in process and will be swapped within this month . So , the interest rate cost will come down instead of increasing . <p> Q : Your sales part has actually seen growth this time . Take us through the segments as how you have done in terms of exports and may be the domestic market ? <p> A : We are doing almost 75% exports and 25% domestic sales . Out of 75% more than 50% is from US market and around 25-30% from European market and remaining is from the rest of the world . <p> As far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different lines ; one is the soft toys and second is the furnishing . 65% revenue comes from the furnishing and 35% comes from the toys . <p> Q : Since you have such a strong exposure to exports , tell us what the sentiment is like considering what we are seeing in the US and Europe ? Is there any sort of order contraction , renegotiation , etc , happening ? <p> A : No , as of now from the consumer point of view , they have not discussed anything like that . The main issue is at the sovereign level and not at the consumer level so far . Hence , we have not received any renegotiation of orders or deferment of orders . <p> Q : Do you have Chinese competition or do you have any manufacturing outlets in that country ? <p> A : We don ? t have any manufacturing outlet in China but definitely we buy all the raw material for toys from China , where we are getting for very competitive prices because of our large volumes . <p> So it gives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China because we are not into mass market , we are into mid market , we have lot of value additions there in the toys . So , our product line is different that way and our margins are higher as compared to China . <p> Q : You must be facing competition from other Asian countries ; do you have a currency advantage at all ? <p> A : Our currency is more or less stable . <p> Q : It ? s not a factor at all in your net profit margin ? <p> A : Almost 65-75% is naturally hedged because 25% sales come from the domestic market . Around 30-35% is our import content and we are investing it in Indian Rupees which is close to 15-20% . <p> Q : You had a plan for a GDR ( Global Depository Receipt ) issue what happened to that , are you shelving it ? <p> A : At that time , the market was not conducive , so we withdrew GDR . At present , we don ? t have any plans for the GDR because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt . So for next one year or so there are no plans for any further GDR issue . <p> Q : So how much will your debt increase by the year-end since your GDR plan was fairly big . It was about USD 32 million , does that completely get replaced by debt ? <p> A : That money can get substituted by internal accruals in two years . <p> Q : What about your retail plans because we understand you are planning to open around 400 stores , just takes us through that quickly ? <p> A : No , right now that ? s not our agenda because we have only 10-15 stores . The market conditions are also not that favorable , so we don ? t have any plans to go for 400 outlets .

But the report does not contain any specific suggestion to meet several special requirements of the elderly -- the Committee has only made a few generalised statements <p> The report on banking customer services submitted by the Damodaran Committee constituted by the RBI ( Reserve Bank of India ) contains a few good recommendations as far as pensioners are concerned . But it has touched only a few of the problems faced by senior citizens and pensioners , and a lot more could have been done to improve the service extended to these special category of customers , who have been at the receiving end of banks ' apathy towards customers in general and senior citizens in particular . <p> The report , unfortunately , does not contain any specific suggestion to meet several special requirements of senior citizens and physically challenged customers of banks . Instead of making clear , workable and practical recommendations , the Committee has made a few generalised statements , which do not meet with the expectations of senior citizens . In fact , what senior citizens expect is personalised service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not all of them are tech-savvy and hence they need special attention when they visit the branches of banks .

" <p> This is only a generalised statement which gives room for each bank to do what it considers reasonable , though it may not fully serve the needs of senior citizens . This could have been more specific , as stated in one of the suggestions given here below later in this article . <p> Another recommendation reads as under : <p> " Banks should streamline and fine-tune the functioning of their Centralised Pension Processing Centres to ensure timely disbursal of pension , commencement of family pension on time and error-free calculation of pension . " <p> This looks good on paper but what if the banks continue to delay payment of pension for reasons of their own ? Should the banks not be liable to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not due to the fault of the pensioner ? <p> The RBI has now called for feedback from the public on this report . In deference to this , following suggestions covering some of the additional requirements of senior citizens and physically challenged customers are submitted for the consideration of the RBI . It would be appreciated if the apex bank asks banks to ensure compliance of these suggestions as well , in addition to what is contained in the report submitted by the committee . 1 . Each branch of a bank should have a separate counter earmarked for attending to senior citizens/physically challenged customers , who should be given priority over other customers at that special counter . 2 . Senior citizens and physically challenged customers should be provided with single window service , without their having to move from counter to counter to complete all their banking transactions . 3 . All the requests/requirements of senior citizens and physically challenged customers must be attended to then and there , without them being asked to come the next day , as is the practice in most bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , updating of pass books , pension payments , issue of deposit receipts , issue of interest/TDS ( tax deduction at source ) certificates , and all other requests should be complied with instantly on the same day without them having to visit the branch again and again . 4 . Senior citizens are at present offered an additional interest of up to 1% on all fixed deposits . The same benefit of additional interest should be offered to them on their savings deposits also , as there is no reason to exempt savings accounts from the preferential interest rates offered to them . 5 . The penalty , if levied on withdrawal of deposits before maturity , should not be applied to senior **30;277;TOOLONG customers , who should be given the normal rate of interest applicable for the period for which the deposit has run , without any deductions . This is based on the assumption that in most cases , their medical requirements might force them to encash their deposits before maturity . 6 . A certain percentage of safe deposits lockers , say 10% , may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they are have a reasonable chance of getting a locker facility in the same branch where they maintain their savings accounts . 7 . Senior citizens must be properly guided without exception , the facility of submitting Form 15H for non-deduction of tax at source , if they are not in the tax bracket . This would facilitate them , if they wish , to submit the forms in time to avoid TDS on their deposits . 8 . Every bank should send a written communication to every senior citizen in the beginning of the year , enclosing Form 15H , and requesting him/her to submit the same within the stipulated time , if the depositor is not liable to pay tax on the interest earned on the deposit during that financial year . 9 . Form 15H submitted by a senior citizen once , as required in the beginning of the year , should be valid and must hold good for all the subsequent deposits also placed by the depositor during the same financial year . The CBDT ( Central Board of Direct Taxes ) may be advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 10 . In case the payment of pension to the customer is delayed due to the fault or mistake of the bank , the pensioner should be properly compensated by giving appropriate savings bank interest on the amount for the delayed period . If the delay is beyond a reasonable period , say seven days , the bank should be asked to pay a penalty of Rs100 per day of delay , as is the system followed in failed ATM transactions . 11 . At present , pensions are disbursed only through the public sector banks , due to which many pensioners have to travel long distances to get their monthly pension , causing considerable strain on the pensioners . To prevent this problem , the RBI should arrange with both the Central and state governments to disburse pensions through all banks in the private sector also , so that the pensioners have the option of getting pension from any commercial bank , public or private bank , nearer their place of residence . 12 .

@@4366235 <p> Any musical offering from the Sanjay Leela Bhansali camp is something that music lovers look forward to eagerly , and right from his very first film , SLB movies have always delivered music that is just class apart . He being a composer with a keen ear for music helps the cause further . Moreover the involvement of corporate giants UTV Motion Pictures too is an added bonus . Despite this there are not many expectations from the music of MY FRIEND PINTO , and the reason being that this is a film being directed by an outside director and secondly there are not many known faces ( read big stars ) in the film and it has not really been promoted as aggressively as the rest of SLB movies . However there can still be a surprise lurking somewhere , as this still is a Sanjay Leela Bhansali project , and so let 's press on the play button and see if are our expectations are met with . <p> The first song of the album is a totally philosophical composition , ' Take It Easy ' , sung by Kunal Ganjawala and Gayatri Ganjawala . It 's almost a solo with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent jugalbandi with Kunal towards the latter part . The best part of the song is that the philosophical part is not preachy and still manages to convey the beauty of life and also shows the way to handle it by taking things cool and easy . And this is done by some lovely wordings that are penned by Amitabh Bhattacharya who does a brilliant job . And if we do n't look up to see who the lyricist is we might even think it is either Prasoon Joshi or Gulzar Sahab - ' Kabhi kabhi sorry feel karti hi zara si , Kabhi kabhi deti hai smile bhi zara si , Ye zindagi hazaar rang mein dhali hai , Ye cute hai har ek rang me bhali hai .. ' The arrangements by Ajay-Atul are in sync with the situation of the song ; lots of light guitar strums , drums , whistles and bead sounds but the orchestra that comes in the middle takes the song to another level . <p> The philosophical yet lively mood continues with ' Yaadon Ki Album ' and nostalgia reigns supreme in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corridor ( not inspired ) as Jagjit Singh 's ' Ye Kagaz Ki Kashti ' . A song that will be appreciated more for its superb lyrics that takes one back to our childhood days and the simple things that gave us joy like exchanging notes , eating candies and riding cycles with friends . While the situational song would find more favour after the release of the film , and seeing it 's context yet it 's a number that can be enjoyed by all those who are still kids at heart and long for that ' bachpan ke din ' . <p> Guest composer Shamir Tandon and Kavita Seth come in for ' Intezaar ' and it 's a stark departure from the first two philosophical numbers as this is a totally filmy romantic number that can qualify as the best of the lot . The song in totality is excellent , the singing by the combo artists from the Nirmitee Group ( Ranjana Raja , Vian Fernandes , Siddharth Menon and Pranil More ) of X factor fame is superb , their taal mel extraordinary and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both Hindi ( Charan Jeet ) and additional English lyrics ( by Deepa Seshadri ) are quite good . Just the number one expected from the Sanjay Leela Bhansali camp and a song that has the potential to hit the charts but needs aggressive promotion . <p> The album takes a u-turn with the all out rock and roll ' Do Kabootar ' which is once again philosophical and situational . The swinging beats and the nice rock and roll rhythm along with organ sounds and harmonica take centre stage in a song that is once again very noble in its effort as it tries to convey a very important message , and that is to let it be and not try to change your beloved by making him/her just like yourself . Somewhere on the lines of ' Rahna Tu Jaisa Tu ' . Kunal Ganjawala is typical himself , the kind we heard in the first song of the album , may be because it 's in the same mould as the first . <p> However unlike Kunal in the previous track , Sunidhi Chauhan sings quite contrary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Tu ' that borders on pensive musings and is slightly inspirational as well . The highlight of the track is Sunidhi 's almost in ' whispers ' singing that is just excellent . The serene and sedate atmosphere created by light musical arrangements is exemplary . Hitesh Sonik may not have exactly chosen a new tune but the way he has arranged it and made Sundhi sing is brilliant . <p> It 's once again back to the swinging sixties with the all retro rock and roll ' Dhinchak Zindagi ' and piano , guitar , drums , keyboards and trumpets making things livelier and merrier . Though we have had many ' aaj raat zindagi ' types set exactly in the same mould as this number , but this is quite interesting because of its lively orchestra and catchy tune and also the lyrics that are very contemporary and identifiable . Kunal Ganjawala is good as always and his enthused singing helps the cause in a big way . <p> Ajay-Atul 's last major outing , the super hit SINGHAM , proved why they are called the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they showed was applause worthy . However in this album they have just stuck to one type of music ( may be the makers or the situation demanded it ) , and all the songs are of the same genre and despite the fact that they have tried their level best , still monotony sets in . Too much of a good thing is not good , so the album tends to get repetitive after a while . The two guest composers do bring in a change of mood . Our favourites are ' Intazaar ' , ' Dhinchak Zindagi ' and ' Tu ' . The album needs heavy duty promotion and one still feels that since the songs are mostly situational the album might see a pickup in sale after the release of the film which is all set to be showcased this Friday .

@@4366238 <h> Post office , PPF rates set to rise , but not by too much <p> For a finance ministry that has been advising the Reserve Bank of India ( RBI ) to think " out-of-the-box " on interest rates , here 's a reality check on double-standards : faced with a sharp drop in collections under post office savings schemes , it may end up recommending a hike in interest rates . <p> Data for April-June 2011-12 show a Rs 26,500 crore decline in postal savings collections compared to a rise of Rs 13,250 crore in the year before . The finance ministry has used this number to argue two things : one , that it now needs to borrow more from the market since small savings collections are falling , and two , it must raise interest rates on small savings . <p> The first argument , of course , is specious , since 80 percent of small savings collections go to the states .

However , the Chinese FA have made it clear they want the Spaniard for the long-term irrespective of how they fare in their 2014 World Cup qualifying campaign , although it 's likely they did n't envisage such an early exit . <p> And while those two slugged it out , there was a sense of irony as former Iraq international Adnan Hamad continued his fine success with Jordan - who he guided to the 2011 Asian Cup quarter-finals - as they maintained their 100 per cent record with a 3-0 win in Singapore . <p> GROUP B <p> W <p> D <p> L @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 <p> 0 <p> +7 <p> 7 <p> KUWAIT <p> 1 <p> 2 <p> 0 <p> +1 <p> 5 <p> LEBANON <p> 1 <p> 1 <p> 1 <p> -4 <p> 4 <p> UNITED ARAB EMIRATES <p> 0 <p> 0 <p> 3 <p> -4 <p> 0 <p> A reported 40,000 fans turned up in Beirut to witness German Theo Bucker 's Lebanon go within a whisker of producing another huge shock as they drew 2-2 with Kuwait on Tuesday .

This seasoned man of drama has been on orbit for over 40 years now , with impressive results . The times have definitely left a mark on this self-admittedly " too thin , simply bones " lanky figure on the Delhi stage of the 1960s . Stepping into the sunset years of his life , Maharishi now flaunts a crop of salt and pepper hair to prove his life experience , wears a knowing smile , while his deep baritone bordering on the nasal , continues to impress .

The play , often given the credit for injecting a much-needed life into Hindi plays in the ' 60s , flowed from the pen of celebrated Hindi writer Dharamvir Bharati , who gave us many novels , poems and short stories but just one play . <p> In Alkazi 's production , Maharishi played Sanjay .

We used to rehearse in a room at Rabindra Bhawan and had to act on a huge stage . But that is the advantage of working with people like Alkazi ; he taught us how to negotiate the space . " In the forthcoming production of " Andha Yug " , " The stage is 120 ft , " he says , chuckling .

" <p> Maharishi recalls directing " Andha Yug " in Mauritius when he was Theatre Advisor to that Government in the ' 70s . The actors were Mauritian . " That shows the universality of the play , " he points out . He deleted some parts of the play then . " I took Dharamvir Bharati to Mauritius to watch it . I was apprehensive of his reaction to the changes I did in the story but he liked it .

" <p> On Saturday 's presentation , director Bhanu Bharti will begin the story with Sanjay . " Sanjay is the main character that way in Bhanu 's production . He is between us and the audience .

Fitch has also taken the following rating actions on FINO 's bank facilities : <p> The ratings are based on a consolidated view of FINO , its subsidiaries and group company FINO Fintech Foundation . The ratings reflect the company 's current strong liquidity position post the INR1,500m investment by Blackstone GPV Capital Partners ( Mauritius ) VI-B FDI Ltd ( Blackstone ) in July 2011 , the high growth potential of India 's financial IT services industry and the market leadership enjoyed by the company . The ratings also factor in FINO 's ability to offer a wide range of last-mile services relating to banking , insurance , government services and retail across India , based on its technology as well as its nationwide network of 20,000 business correspondents ( BCs ) . <p> Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direct investments , including INR2,440m through preference shares in three tranches . Based on its criteria " Treatment of Hybrids in Corporate and REIT Credit Analysis " , Fitch has considered INR240m Class A &amp; INR700m Class B preference shares as debt , and provided 50% equity credit to INR1.5bn Class C preference shares . Fitch expects FINO to report a sharp increase in revenues in the financial year ending March 2012 given the expansion of its network of BCs in the past 12 months and increased number of services offered . In Fitch 's assessment , this is likely to translate into a concomitant large increase in EBITDAR profits for the year as well as an improvement in leverage ( adjusted debt net of cash/operating EBITDAR ) to below 3.5x for FY12 ( FY11 : 6.79x ) . <p> The ratings are constrained by revenue concentration in few clients ( the top three clients accounted for 66.7% of revenues in FY11 ) , significant working capital requirements and expected moderation in profit margins due to increasing competition and higher operating costs . FINO has had a stretched receivables position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by clients ( banks and government ) . Its large inventory levels are attributed to stocks of imported smart cards required to support its business requirements as well as stocks of imported equipment for sale . With the industry attracting several new entrants , Fitch expects a moderation in the company 's operating margins over the next three to five years . <p> Increase in scale of operations while maintaining leverage at less than 3.5x through FY13 may result in positive rating action . Conversely , a slowdown in revenue growth accompanied by decline in margin contribution from its various business segments may result in negative rating action . In particular , increase in leverage to over 5.0x or decrease in operating EBITDAR/ ( gross interest expense + rent ) to less than 1.5x on sustained basis may undermine ratings . <p> Incorporated in 2006 , FINO provides end-to-end technology and operational solutions to banks , insurance companies and the government to extend their outreach to low-income people who do not have access to insurance and banking . For FY11 , the company reported consolidated revenues of INR1,862.5m ( INR1,002m @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -1.84% ) . <p> Disclaimer : The views and investment tips expressed by investment experts/broking houses/rating agencies on moneycontrol.com are their own , and not that of the website or its management .

@@4372234 <p> A powerful half-century from Shane Watson helped Australia make an encouraging start to their tour of South Africa as they won the opening Twenty20 in Cape Town by five wickets . The teenage debutant Patrick Cummins collected three wickets as South Africa reached 146 for 7 , led by a solid innings from JP Duminy , and the target was n't enough to prevent Australia from turning around their recent poor T20 form . <p> Although Australia 's chase was on track for most of the innings , a couple of good late overs from Morne Morkel and Lonwabo Tsotsobe gave South Africa a sniff in the dying stages . Australia needed six from the final over , bowler by Rusty Theron , and a single from Matthew Wade was followed by a square-driven boundary and a single from Steven Smith to get Australia home with three balls to spare , their second win from their past nine T20s . <p> It was also their second win under the captaincy of Cameron White , who took over from Michael Clarke in January . White made a valuable contribution of 28 from 22 deliveries to keep Australia 's chase ticking along , and David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slower ball from Tsotsobe in the second last over . <p> Earlier in the over , Hussey had slammed Tsotsobe straight back over his head for an enormous six that all but ensured Australia 's victory . Two balls prior he had been dropped by Johan Botha at backward point , one of two spilled chances by Botha , who also gave White a reprieve at cover . <p> Theron was n't the only South African who could be called rusty , which perhaps was understandable given they had not played an international match since they exited the World Cup in March . The most important of three missed chances in the field came in the second over when Graeme Smith put down Watson at slip off the bowling of Morne Morkel . <p> Watson was on 2 at the time and he certainly made the South Africans pay . He used his muscle to pull Tsotsobe for six but he also played some classical strokes , including a perfect straight drive for four off Theron , who went for 42 from his three and a half overs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he fell soon after , from a leading edge caught at cover off Morkel for 52 , he had done enough to set Australia on the path to victory . <p> The chase had started poorly for Australia when David Warner , fresh from a pair of centuries in his final two Champions League innings , was run out without scoring in the first over . Warner mistimed a pull and took off for a single but was caught short at the bowler 's end by a wonderful direct hit form Morkel at backward square leg . <p> Watson and Shaun Marsh ( 25 ) then combined for an 82-run stand that more than steadied the Australians , who had worked hard in the field to ensure a gettable target . Only twice before had Australia chased down bigger totals to win T20 internationals , and the target could have been greater but for a triple-wicket over in the 19th of the innings from Cummins . <p> At 18 , Cummins became Australia 's second-youngest debutant of all time in any format , but he showed plenty of poise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He collected the important wicket of Duminy , who on 67 failed to negotiate the slower ball from Cummins and skied a catch to Watson at cover . <p> Cummins was soon on a hat-trick when he had David Miller ( 20 ) caught at long-off trying to clear the rope , and while the hat-trick ball was clipped for four through square leg by Botha , Cummins struck again later in the over . Again it was the slower ball that worked for Cummins , who had Botha caught at cover , and when Watson bowled Robin Peterson in the final over , Australia 's bowlers had done well to keep the target from ballooning . <p> Earlier , Duminy had spent some time getting himself in , and was soon striking the ball cleanly and finding the middle of the bat . He welcomed the left-arm spinner Steve O'Keefe with a six over long-on first ball , and took to the offerings of another of Australia 's debutants , James Pattinson , who ended up with 1 for 32 . <p> Pattinson 's final over leaked 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then launched a pair of sixes over midwicket and deep cover . Duminy had support from two of the newer members of South Africa 's batting order , in a 58-run partnership with Colin Ingram that was followed by a 65-run stand with Miller . <p> Miller had come to the crease after the departure of Ingram for 33 off 28 deliveries , when he was deceived by the slower ball from Pattinson and lofted the ball to Cummins at deep cover . Ingram had scored at a decent rate , driving square through point when given width and clipping through leg when the bowlers overcorrected . <p> He lifted David Hussey over long-on for six , just clearing the rope when Warner jumped and got a hand to the ball but failed to cling on to what would have been a brilliant catch . Warner had already done something wonderful in the field , with an excellent throw from the deep having caught the stand-in captain Hashim Amla short for 4 . <p> Amla was coming back for a third run but could n't beat the accurate throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save the boundary . Another of Australia 's four debutants , the wicketkeeper Wade , collected Warner 's return and whipped the bails off quickly to leave South Africa in trouble at 10 for 2 in the third over . <p> Their problems had started in the first over when Smith looked rusty in South Africa 's first international match since the World Cup in March . No runs came off the bat in the first over , which ended with Smith dragging the ball on from well outside off to hand Doug Bollinger , remarkably playing his first T20 international , his first wicket in the format . <p> Australia were on top , and South Africa never quite recovered from the early losses . <p> @hyclass - the thing with Waugh v Langar is , that Langar actually use to belt attacks at the start of the innings &amp; often would outscore Hayden early on , once the field spread he 'd slow down .

This young fellow is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 6:35 GMT <p> SA Proteas and their personal problems always have controversial team choices . Seems like they never ever wants to pick their best XI for an occasion . Did the selectors watch CLT20 ? ? Have they learned from their mistakes the last World Cup ? ? It does n't seem so . Where are Gibbs and Albie Morkel ( SA 's T20 &amp; Limited Overs specialist ) . And why is Graeme Smith still playing Limited Overs ? He should concentrate on Unlimited Overs . The South African arrogance , again , shines thru . After The Wallabies have crushed The Springboks out of The Rugby World Cup , I thought it was payback time for South Africa on home soil . Not to be . Shane Watson looks like he will be the next Jacques Kallis . <p> RandyOZ on October 15 , 2011 , 2:33 GMT <p> @hyclass , very well put and I could not agree more . Aussies hate being clamped down and hopefully now we can unleash natural talent ( even if unorthodox ) and dominate once again . <p> on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seem to take the pre-50 over T20 matches seriously . Its either you go in with your best team or you go in with a team of up and coming youngsters . SA did neither . You just have to have a " bowler destroyer " up front . And that person has to be given free reign and has to be guaranteed a place in the team regardless of runs scored . That 's high risk cricket , and that 's T20 cricket . For the life of me can not understand why Herschelle Gibbs gets overlooked every time . We need him to open the batting ! Amla not suited for T20 and not suited for captaincy either . He 's not intimidating at all , and he 's not " in your face " and chirpy . You need to have some degree of arrogance to lead a team . Steve Waugh , Ricky Ponting , Graeme Smith , Andrew Strauss . All good examples . Van Wyk had to play in place of Heino . And we need to find a new finisher . Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't look like it yesterday . Albie has also lost a bit of " Klusener-ness " . Go level the series boys ! <p> Gordo85 on October 14 , 2011 , 11:32 GMT <p> It looks like it will be a drawn twenty/20 series at 1-1 all . From what I have seen Smith is still facing the same problems he did before he got injured . In all seriousness I do n't know that he will make the Test squad . However of course if he does turn it around and start making some runs in the shortest form of the game and the 50 over game by all means retain him in the test squad . <p> bestbuddy on October 14 , 2011 , 8:39 GMT <p> No surprise in the result here - SA picked a t20 side without a single player capable of taking apart the opposition bowling , left out their best spinner ( Tahir ) from the squad altogether , picked a couple of " quicks " ( sic ) that were totally out of form in Tsotsobe and theron and were captained by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lineup ( as good as amla is in other forms , he has done nothing in any form of t20 ) and who had never captained in this form of the game before .

Mark Waughs strike rate of 52 is 2 behind Langers S/R of 54 and 8 behind Matthew haydens S/R of 60 . As for Hadlee and Lillee , they were great players but the record shows Hadlee taking a wicket every 50.8 balls vs Lillees 52 balls.Measure for measure , I deem strike rate to be the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Murali seeks to dispel doubts about his action , by running through his repertoire.Late in the video , 3 Test match wickets are shown with a wide angle camera that tell a compellingly different story.I will always question his legitimacy . <p> davidallan on October 14 , 2011 , 7:57 GMT <p> One again for country WARNER failed and WATSON successful , any comment boyz <p> hyclass on October 14 , 2011 , 7:09 GMT <p> @RandyOz ... our stocks have often been brilliant but without national selection , have been unable to express it.Imagine the results if , O'Keefe , Rogers , David Hussey , Cosgrove , Hodge and Stuart Clark , had gotten the games their records deserved.Im also pretty sure that we lost 2 x T20I and 2 x ODI in SL . It was 4 games all at the end of the tour.What I liked about that tour , is that Nielsen stepped down.It had the effect of releasing the batting of both Clarke and Hughes in a way that has nt been seen for years.I think Clarke brings alot to the captaincy and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ponting will return to his better days.Hes coming off 33 and 87 for Tasmania v WA and has shown consistency all along without endurance or domination which were his trademarks . I think the current Test squad is owed some latitude over the Nielsen and Hilditch years.More settled selection policies , better coaching , better team physios and better planning will change everything . <p> peterchad on October 14 , 2011 , 6:46 GMT <p> Jeepers but it is a long time since I witnessed a SA side with such a weak bowling attack .... come on guys Rusty Theron is a plonker and Robbie Peterson is long past his sell by date , this is not India , he wont get any assitance from the pitch so is going to be exposed as rather ordinary , and get smashed over the boundary by quality players such as Watson and Warner etc , rather bowl JP for 4 overs and strenghten the batting ... Jacques Rudolph should be in the squad , and should be playing , Biff had a shocker.A duck , a dropped catch and some very ordinary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wicket keeper that can smash the ball , Heino Kuhn is so completely unsuited to 20/20 cricket that is is laughable that he is picked .... no big hitter down the order and no quality death bowlers , so not surprising the result.Seems like nothing has changed in SA cricket since the World Cup , here we go again ........ <p> NoExcuses on October 14 , 2011 , 6:40 GMT <p> Interesting point Hyclass . The lack of quality support can go either way - it can leave you Murali style with an opportunity to pick up all the wickets as none of your team mates are doing much damage . Style has an impact on one 's " greatness " . Kallis is statistically superior to Tendulkar , Ponting , Lara etc but most would regard Tendulkar as the best batsman . Likewise Andy Flower has a better record than Gilchrist but everyone talks up Gilchrist . Lillee was a flamboyant tearaway whereas Hadlee , though sharp , was more tradesman like in his approach . <p> hyclass on October 14 , 2011 , 6:38 GMT <p> @Marcio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them. @NoExcuses.Cummins is young and quick ... really the equivalent at this point of a bowling machine without the skill of a Waqar Younis ... He has alot of developing to do and Shield is the place to do it.I agree with your assessment of Englands handling of their bowlers.Theres no question its been excellent and put them where they are. @AidanFX ... everyone enjoys the romantic notion that they were there to witness the birth of a great player.I do nt think the selection malaise has been confined to youth or age.It has simply been mindlessly erratic and predominantly ignored form.If we can return to a stable and consistent selection process that sets standards so that everyone is aware of where to aim to aspire to national selection , then the whole process will right itself. @straightdrive4.Spot on.Ponting was 20 when he debuted.With Cummins , lets see how he handles a couple of long hot Shield summers.Then we will know more <p> @ Meety - The guy is not quite ready for Tests , maybe a couple yrs if he does well at Shield level and plays most available @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of me that would like some of these guys to start young and have long careers ( ala McGrath , Waugh twins , Warne , Ponting ) the Aus selectors have other than those guys have tended to shun younger players and wait till they are 28/31 age bracket . The selectors need to prioritise selecting players on consistent form but I do also hope they do n't show the same disdain for younger players that they have been showing the past decade . Cummins is suited for this format not yet ready for tests . <p> NoExcuses on October 14 , 2011 , 4:58 GMT <p> Cummins looks like a prospect but we ( Aust ) should n't be expecting too much from him or overbowling him at this stage . We should be giving him a taste and then sending him home for strengthening and on the job training with NSW . The Poms have managed their young bowlers well in recent times and as a result have a complement of 6-8 handy seamers who can step up when needed . <p> hyclass on October 14 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being presented here , that Lillee was better than Hadlee . Hadlee has more wickets(431-355) , a better strike rate ( 50.8-52 ) and a better average(22.29-23.92) and bowled without quality support for the majority of his career.He retired from Test cricket after 1990 in England in which he took 16 wickets at 24 from a rain interrupted series-he only bowled in 4 completed innings.During the 3rd Test , his last , he took 8 for 150 from 59 overs and 5 for 53 in his last innings.He turned 39 during that Test.As for extra pace being the panacea , read Troy Cooleys story on cricnfo.Cricket is littered with bowlers who were fast but ineffective.Duncan Spencer was rated by Viv Richards as the fastest bowler he ever faced.Denis Hickey was another that rose and then vanished.Devon Malcolm was as fast as anyone going around , but averaged 37 in Tests at a S/R of 66 . Interestingly , despite the plethora of coaches , he was almost retired before it was discovered that he was nearly blind . <p> straightdrive4 on October 14 , 2011 , 4:34 GMT <p> im @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple years at shield level . assuming he has 2 massive seasons and takes heaps of wickets , he can still come into the side at 20 years old and end up becoming one of those superstars that started " young " . im pretty sure ponting was 20 when he made his debut . <p> azmaftab on October 14 , 2011 , 4:29 GMT <p> I just ca n't understand kepler wessels ! If any other team had put up such a performance in the field he would be all over them citing historical incapabilities in certain departments as a reason for the poor show but when SA does it , it 's just that they are rusty !

The truth is Australia played much better than SA. it 's that simple ! <p> landl47 on October 14 , 2011 , 3:12 GMT <p> Quite an interesting game for a T20I , but it did n't have much to do with cricket . The two batsmen I wanted to see , Warner and Amla @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 wickets , but they were all in the slog-at-everything 19th over and before than he 'd been all over the place . I agree with Meety , he needs to learn to bowl , not just run up and sling it down . I think he 's got great potential , but he 's a fair way from being a test bowler yet . SA showed they really do n't have much depth ; with Kallis and De Villiers out and Smith and Amla failing they never looked like getting enough runs . Well done Aus , now get the second T20I out of the way and then let 's see some cricket . <p> ajayrcs on October 14 , 2011 , 3:12 GMT <p> The best thing about this match was Wastson scored runs and Showed Country comes first . He was pretty flop in champions league . Great Lesson for Gayle and others . <p> Marcio on October 14 , 2011 , 2:58 GMT <p> Good to see the boys get up for a win . These games do n't mean that much though . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dominant on the ODIs and tests , just as I predicted . It may turn out the reverse in this tour , as SA will get better as the format lengthens . Both sides have a lot of improvement in them from this performance . Frustrating to see Warner run out without scoring , though . He 's one guy who is good to watch . The good thing for AUS is they also have Watson , who can be equally explosive . Cameron White was looking good too , which is a nice change from the World Cup where he looked out of his depth . Steve Smith is coming good again . He is well suited to the shorter versions of the game . Stop bagging him ! <p> Dashgar on October 14 , 2011 , 2:45 GMT <p> Good win by the boys .

Our education system is essentially based on the colonial system . It has n't changed much over the years . The pattern resembles that of the erstwhile slavery system in a certain way .

@@4381232 <p> Report by Rashmi r Parida ; Bhubaneswar : Chief Minsister , Shri Naveen Patnaik today launched the ambitious Mamata Scheme , a conditional electronic cash transfer programme for the benefit of the pregnant women of the state . Under the scheme , pregnant women registered with Anganwadi centres will receive Rs.5000 in four instalments . While the scheme aims at reducing the IMR &amp; MMR in a big way , it will also help in improvement in the nutrition status of pregnant women and new born babies . More than 50 thousand pregnant women today received their first instalment today . <p> Launching the programme , Chief Minister shri Patnaik said , ? I am delighted to launch Mamata today . As you all know , this scheme was announced some time ago and registration of pregnant women started on 5th September . It is heartening to note that within a span of one month nearly two lakh pregnant women have registered under this scheme . And today around Fifty thousand women across the State will be getting their first instalment of Rupees one thousand five hundred through electronic transfer of funds . <p> The State Government has always given top priority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and children . A number of schemes and initiatives have been launched by the Government according top priority to the social sector . <p> We started Mission Shakti in 2001 and it has gradually resulted in a silent revolution at the grassroots with nearly 50 lakh women SHG members . Mission Shakti has had a major role to play in the social and economic empowerment of women in Orissa . From managing MDM in schools to procuring paddy , running PDS shops and managing ambulances- the SHGs are also effectively functioning as an arm of government in providing essential services to the people . <p> We are one of the first states in the country to have reservation for women in Panchayati Raj institutions . In order to increase the participation of women in decision making , we have now accorded 50% reservation to women in Panchayati Raj institutions . It is my belief that this will result in the emergence of strong and effective women leaders at the grassroots . <p> To increase female literacy and reduce the drop out rate among girls especially in the interior tribal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hostels for tribal girl students . Today , more than one lakh tribal girls pursue their education residing in the hostels across the State . <p> Mobility is empowerment . The school bicycle programme aims to enable tenth standard girl students to have better access education facilities . <p> All these initiatives of the State Government have been aimed at improving the lives of women in Orissa . A key area of concern has been the health and nutrition needs of women and children . The latest SRS data shows that Infant Mortality Rate in Orissa has reduced to 65 from 98 in the last 10 years and Maternal Mortality Rate has reduced to 258 from 358 a decade ago . The National Family Health Survey 3 data shows that Orissa has had a decline of 10 points in child undernutrition- probably the biggest drop in the country . A lot still needs to be done . <p> With the aim of improving maternal and child health care practices , the State Government decided to launch MAMATA- a conditional cash transfer to pregnant women . This scheme aims to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural projects of our state . An assistance of Rs. 5000 will be given in instalments to every eligible pregnant woman . The instalments have been designed to ensure that a pregnant woman gets cash assistance every 3 months after her second trimester . The last instalment would be given on completion of measles immunisation . This , I hope would greatly improve the total immunisation coverage of all our children . <p> As you know , Mamata will be the largest State scheme after the Rs. 2/kg rice scheme . Nearly 6 lakh pregnant women will be covered every year under Mamata resulting in an annual disbursement of Rupees 350 crores . A unique feature of this scheme , is that fund transfer to beneficiaries will only be done through electronic means directly to their accounts . This is the first time that direct electronic transfer of funds to beneficiary accounts through online banking has been attempted on such a large scale in the country in any social sector programme . With this we set a benchmark for transparency and effective delivery of public services . We know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I hope with all your support and cooperation we will be able to meet the challenge . <p> The opening of individual bank accounts in the name of women on such a large scale has never before been attempted . Through this scheme nearly six lakh accounts will be opened every year . I call upon all the bankers of the State to come forward and partner Government in this revolution . This is true financial inclusion and a definite step towards financial empowerment of rural women . <p> This scheme has been initiated to have an impact on IMR and MMR and improve health seeking behaviour among women . It aims to provide pregnant women with wage loss compensation so as to enable them to get adequate rest and nutrition critical to their health . I hope this will have a positive impact on the health of the children and women of Orissa . <p> The Health and Family Welfare Department and the Women and Child Development Department must work in convergence to ensure the success of this scheme . I appeal to the all our frontline workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take this up as a mission and ensure that every eligible pregnant woman even in the most interior pockets gets the benefits of this scheme ? . <p> During the function , the Chief Minister interacted with the beneficiaries of different places like Ganjam , Koraput , Kalahandi , Mayurbhanj &amp; Jajpur through video conferencing . The women expressed their happiness with this innovative scheme that will make up for their loss of wages during the pregnancy and post-delivery period .

AMU VC had sent the proposal to Bihar Government for opening Special Centre two years back after getting the approval from Union Ministry of HRD and President of India .

It aired the report with heading " Students block railway tracks , 18 trains held up in Bihar " ( URL of report : http : **67;468;TOOLONG ... ) . The heading somehow provides a tiny idea about the incident , but the report inside is really misleading . The report says that the " students affiliated to the All Islamic Students Union blocked railway tracks in Bihar 's Kishanganj district " .

He had not added a single line about the real issue and demand of agitators , and the anchor summed up it by saying it ' Muslim Vote Bank ' issue . In truth the locals were always supporting the movement and all kept their shops closed for the entire day . The report of Zee News is available on this link : http : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=tYAUPwcpUOI <p> The dharna was called off midnight after the assurance of Purnia Division Commissioner Brajesh Mishra to resolve the land transfer issue within a month . <p> However , the response of leading political parties ' leaders on the dharna for AMU Centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his main opposition RJD and also the political leaders from neighbouring West Bengal state for joining the dharna .

However , the statement of Railway Minister Dinesh Trivedi published in Azad Hind newspaper ( Kolkata , October 15 , 2011 ) about the dharna is very sad and biased as well . The Trinamool Congress ( TMC ) MP said the dharna happened at Kishanganj for AMU Centre is like a ' Terrorist Act ' .

@@4383233 <p> Twice a year , India 's Ministry of Commerce and Industry consolidates and updates the country 's foreign direct investment ( " FDI " ) policy framework . Pundits had been expecting the October 2011 update to allow FDI into multi-brand retail and other moves to further deregulate foreign investment into India . The Indian government , however , has surprised the market by moving in the other direction . Not only does multi-brand retail remain off limits to FDI , but the October policy statement has effectively eliminated a common aspect of private equity and venture capital investment in India -- the right of foreign investors to force a " redemption " of shares by having the right to put the shares to the issuer or its founder or promoter at a fixed price or internal rate of return ( " IRR " ) . <h> Background <p> Private equity investments in India are commonly structured as minority investments in closely held companies controlled by a founding family or promoters . Private equity investors , looking for liquidity and to protect against downside risk , often negotiate the right to put their shares to the company or the promoters after a fixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that occurs before then . The put right is usually at the higher of the purchase price or the fair market value of the company at the time the put right is exercised . <p> Over the past several years , the Reserve Bank of India ( the " RBI " ) has taken the position that instruments that include a guaranteed return should be treated as debt , not equity , and should be required to comply with the rather onerous regulations that apply to external commercial borrowings ( commonly referred to as ECB ) in India . For example , in June 2007 , the RBI adopted a regulation which made all optionally convertible preference shares equivalent to ECB , and stated that only compulsorily convertible preference shares , convertible into equity within a specified time , and with no redemption option , would be treated as equity for FDI purposes . Over the past several months the RBI has gone further , challenging the validity of preferred equity instruments that contain put options in shareholder agreements with foreign investors and restricting the exercise of existing put options @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Indian government modified the FDI policy to provide that equity instruments with " in-built " options or supported by options sold by third parties , if issued or transferred to foreign investors , would lose their equity character and such instruments would have to comply with ECB guidelines . Prior to this change , there had been some question about whether it was permissible to include an option on shares in public companies , because the option could constitute a futures contract , and futures contracts are valid only for exchange traded derivatives . By including a no options clause in the FDI policy , the Indian government has effectively prohibited the inclusion of any form of options in FDI contracts , because doing so would make the investment subject to the ECB guidelines . <p> The new regulation , which was adopted without the typical comment period , effectively prohibits private equity investors from negotiating redemption or put rights that are typical in other countries . Further , the language of the regulation is broad and vague , and does not expressly grandfather existing instruments , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the regulation could have significant collateral , and perhaps unintended , consequences for new and existing private equity investments from foreign investors . <p> Some potential impacts of the change , in addition to the effective elimination of put options as an exit route , could include : <p> Vague , Undefined Concepts . The language of the new regulations is quite broad and vague . Most practitioners believe the intent is to prohibit put options at a fixed price or IRR . However , a literal reading of the language could be seem to apply to all kinds of options , including drag along rights , rights of first offer , qualified IPO provisions with a minimum price threshold and other similar provisions . <p> Joint Venture Structuring . In cases of joint ventures , in the event of breach , change of law or deadlock , the availability of a put or call option on the shares is an essential structuring tool . In many cases , the option attached to the security may be a call held by the foreign investor or a put option held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read to require such options comply with the ECB guidelines . <p> Retrospective Operation . Though the FDI policy takes effect from the date of its issuance and is applied prospectively , because there is no express grandfathering of existing put rights , it is unclear whether such rights would be enforceable . This has already caused significant uncertainty in the private equity community . In addition , the RBI has been challenging the exercise of existing put rights , further muddying the waters in this area . <h> Conclusion <p> Options are investment safeguards traditionally provided to investors across the world . The volatility of the stock markets and the complexity of liquidation in India compromises the ability of foreign investors to easily exit their investments . In the short term , the regulations have already caused significant uncertainty regarding enforceability of existing agreements and for new agreements .

You would n't ask this question after a session with Master Barista Fritz Storm , who was in the city brewing up ( I want to say a storm ! ) brilliant cups of coffee at Le Meridien on Wednesday evening . He 'll convince you that making a great cup of coffee is n't as easy as pressing a button . <p> To explain the nuances of good coffee , Storm took us right to the beginning of the coffee-making process . " As many as 5,000 beans make a kilo of coffee , " revealed the former world champion . " This means that someone needs to physically handpick 2,500 ripe beans just to make that one pack of coffee . " <p> The most important part of making good coffee is sourcing the right beans or the right blend of beans . This is something you can pick up at a good store @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right coffee . " Make sure it has been packed as recently as possible , " he said . This is because the longer the beans lie in a packet or tin the more flavour they start to lose . And anything that has been packaged more than three months ago is a no-no . <p> Once you 've brought your " good " coffee home , do n't labour under the illusion that you 'll open it and then save it for special occasions . Once the packet is open , the coffee will slowly but steadily lose its flavour . So make sure you consume the coffee as soon as possible . It is probably also a good idea to start purchasing smaller packs . <p> And definitely invest in a good coffee grinder when you get yourself a fancy coffee machine . Storm believes that people usually scrounge on the grinder , but that , he said , is probably more important than even the coffee machine . <p> " I want my cappuccino steaming hot " is what you probably tell the barista at your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is almost at a boil , you 've just managed to ruin your coffee . " A cup of cappuccino should only be around 60 degrees , " explained Storm . <p> Heating the milk too much , he added , kills a lot of essential proteins in it and also alters its taste , which could further kill some of the subtler flavours of the coffee beans . He also recommends the use of whole milk to get a nice creamy cappuccino . <p> " Even the water you use to brew your coffee is very important , " Storm said , " Your espresso , after all , does mainly consist of water . " He warned against the use of hard water , especially tap water , because the minerals in it may not only affect how your coffee tastes , but also eventually ruin your machine . <p> What , then , is the point of having a barista ? Let 's just put it in Storm 's words and say , " A good barista can make the coffee taste only as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can ruin a great coffee in under a couple of minutes . "

@@4407238 <h> Weekend Panorama : What Rajat Gupta Tells Us About Ourselves <p> Last week in New York , Rajat Gupta , the man who led McKinsey for almost a decade and was a board member at Goldman Sachs and Procter &amp; Gamble , was accused by U.S. prosecutors of leaking insider information . <p> Stephen Chernin/Getty Images <p> Rajat Gupta spoke during a Global Business Coalition forum on HIV/AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria , at the United Nations headquarters in New York , 13 June 2007 . <p> The six-count indictment alleges that Mr. Gupta used his position on the boards of premier institutions in the U.S. to " become the illegal eyes and ears for his friend and business associate , Raj Rajaratnam , " founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund , who himself was found guilty of insider trading last month and faces a prison sentence of 11 years . <p> Advertisement <p> Even as Mr. Gupta was being released on $10 million bail by a New York court ( he had pleaded not guilty to all charges ) , the Occupy Wall Street protests were spreading to more cities . These protests have dramatically framed the anger and angst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the " game " is rigged from the start , and that too much power and money rests with Wall Street , a conviction reinforced by the indictment . <p> In Mr. Gupta 's case , it was a stunning reversal for a man whose rise in the global corporate world foretold India 's own rising fortunes in the last three decades . Mr. Gupta at some point appears to have crossed his own Rubicon , prompting him to allegedly share information that was confidential with a friend . <p> Last year 's leaked " NiiraRadia " tapes revealed an India where leading business figures and television anchors -- aided by lobbyists and public-relations professionals -- were too cozy by half with political leaders . Similarly , the conversations between Mr. Rajaratnam and Mr. Gupta at the very least reveal an intimate relationship built on passing privileged information , and , in Mr. Gupta 's case , portray a diminished individual in gross violation of the values supposedly at the core of the firm he once led . <p> Mr. Gupta 's actions had consequences , unlike the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of whom continue to give us daily lectures on morality and ethics , on television and in print . <p> In the U.S. , a disturbing popular commentary tried to paint the allegations against Mr. Gupta and the conviction of Mr. Rajaratnam as being symptomatic of the values of the South Asian community at large . Writing in Newsweek , Suketu Mehta , the author of " Maximum City , " attempted a multi-layered sociological explanation , claiming that " the whole story speaks to the South Asian-American community : its pursuit of success and money at any cost ; the differences between immigrants and the first generation . " <p> It seems ridiculous to attribute a pattern of behavior to a particular community at a time when the most egregious stories on Wall Street over the last three years have been about misbehavior , misdemeanor and misappropriation at firms large and small , the collective sum of which triggered the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression . If anything , the central characters in the story have spent much of their adult lives in the U.S. and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chase Manhattan to Harvard and Wharton . <p> If there is a narrative thread in their stories , it is one with fewer roots in India than in the insider-trading scandals of junk bond titans Michael Milken and Ivan Boesky in the 1980s . <p> The reaction of India Inc. to Mr. Gupta 's indictment has been mixed . On one hand , many business leaders are aghast at the allegations and Mr. Gupta 's fall , most genuinely sad and disappointed to see someone held in deep respect in this position . Others seem surprised that behavior that is part and parcel of doing business in India could actually be considered illegal in another part of the world , with a prison sentence to boot ! <p> Of course , in a deeply ironic twist , some of the most outspoken criticism of Mr. Gupta ( and the accompanying name-calling ) has come from the same lobbyist-fixer-media pundits whose own booming voices were all over the Radia tapes . <p> However , nothing has been more amusing than the chutzpah of the many individuals and institutions in India that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exist in reality . Many were quite comfortable using Mr. Gupta 's access and relationships when they were useful and now are busy attempting to scrub clean a history of deep and close association . ( Full disclosure : I can only add , on a personal note , that in the limited interactions I had with him , he was a thoughtful and constructive supporter of a non-profit initiative I was leading ) . <p> We know that it is human nature to want to build up heroes and then to tear them apart without mercy . Even so , as we recognize the serious nature of the allegations against Mr. Gupta , we must acknowledge , too , that he has been behind the creation of at least one world class institution , the Indian School of Business ( perhaps the only educational institution of excellence in independent India crafted with the energy of the country 's private sector ) , and another , the Public Health Foundation of India , that could yet play a meaningful role in public health reforms in the country . As much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greed , a part of it will always be about a stellar contribution to his country of birth . <p> The allegations are really about Wall Street and America . But the underlying issues exposed by the revelations -- and the broader framing of those issues by the Occupy Wall Street protests -- are relevant to India , too . <p> At the centre of the debate is the question of transparency in the rules of the game and the way in which valuable information is accessed and leveraged . Here , India is closer to oligarchic Russia than it is to the comparatively rules-based West . With the government still playing a central role in directing industrial policy and framing economic opportunities , there is enormous value in gaining access to inside information and knowledge on the complex web of policies , regulations and executive orders . <p> The practice that is an offense on Wall Street is , in many ways , the benchmark by which astuteness is judged in the private sector in India : the ability to glean and leverage information not easily available in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this has given rise to a new entrepreneurial breed in the country : the one that mixes executive roles , political power and private enterprise . <p> Examples are legion of associates of leading industrial houses becoming state and government ministers , and then continuing to run their businesses on the side ; ministers incubating and growing private enterprises ; second generation businessmen running for office on the back of access to the heft and influence of the family enterprises ; and , of course , the lobbyists , the fixers ( and the occasional television commentators ) who help bring all of these savvy entrepreneurs together to add economic value for all involved . <p> Not that this behavior is limited to the top echelons of power . The business of information is an attractive , nationwide enterprise . From the district collector who passes early information on the conversion of rural land to an affiliated investor to the office clerk who reveals the status of a permit approval in process , India is full of savvy " entrepreneurs " who know how to put the right value on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic growth over the last two decades has come on the back of exploiting the low-hanging fruit : comparatively easy structural reforms and opportunities presented by the demographic dividend . <p> The next wave of growth will have to come from unleashing the real entrepreneurial energy of India 's talented millions .

@@4407239 <h> The Jim Corbett National Park is more about the naturalist-author than about the animal he hunted <p> It is 4 in the morning and our eyes are still getting used to the darkness around . An icy breeze tugs at us , and wakes up the silent waters of the River Kosi flowing through our resort . Standing on the banks of the river , I watch the moon-lit ridges of the mountains , towering above , almost touching the bejewelled sky . While some of my fellow travellers are star gazing , a few are attempting night photography . I , for one , am just lost in the silence . <h> The long wait <p> As summons arrive , we hurry to keep our date with the tiger in the forests of Corbett . It is our second attempt to meet the most coveted denizen of the jungle , having spent an entire day in the wild . During our earlier attempt , the tiger was probably aware that almost 20 vehicles would enter through the Jhirna zone for a rendezvous . So , it left us high and dry , with just pugmarks , as we saw several jeeps bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke into a jig at the sight of even a deer ! We did spot several birds , butterflies and smaller mammals , but , for the " tiger tourists " , the sightings were just not enough . <p> Today however , as we board our jeeps , there is a feeling of hope . It is an auspicious moment , as the Bijrani Gate of the Jim Corbett National Park is to be opened , months after the monsoons . The other gates , we 're told , are still closed . <p> As we drive away in the darkness hoping for an encounter , we have no idea what is in store for us . The experience begins at the government office in Ramnagar . There 's a never-ending queue to get the permits and documents for the safari , and a couple of members from our group has been waiting in the queue for an hour . This is when I learn a bit about the trappings of tiger tourism . We wait there for what seems like hours . <p> Finally , there are smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And then , another long wait begins , as 20-odd jeeps queue up . Dawn breaks with sunlight , and restlessness sets in . Drivers exchange notes , and the topic of discussion veers to the recent strike by forest guides who are demanding more rights . " In fact , " says my driver " the opening of the gates was postponed by a few days because of the strike . " I ask him why we are still waiting , and he says a few officials must arrive . We laugh wondering if there is some form of an opening ceremony , and to my surprise , a television crew lands . The interviews with the officials are on ; the cameraman gets a footage of us -- all sleepy-eyed and hungry , waiting to enter the park . Finally , after tea , pakodas , and nearly two hours of wait , there 's green signal . <p> Sunlight filters through the tall sal trees as we drive along , squinting through dense foliage . The naturalist in our group keeps us engaged , spotting birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has about 600 species of birds , of the 1,200 recorded in India . We spot a mongoose , while our friends spot the rare yellow-throated marten , besides langurs and deer . But no sign of the tiger -- it has moved on , leaving behind its footprints . As we head back , the birders in our group are happy , but the tiger tourists are a tad disappointed . <p> As for me , Corbett is more to do with the man Jim Corbett himself than about the tigers he hunted . Corbett National Park , the oldest in India , was known as Hailey National Park before it took the name of the famous naturalist and author of several books . And having grown up on his " Man Eaters of Kumaon " , the villages and the forests in front of my eyes are as I had imagined while reading the book . <h> Lingering thoughts <p> My favourite memory of Corbett is visiting his house , now a museum in Kaladhungi , walking around it , looking at the paintings , and imagining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hamlets .

" <p> However , I 'm sure , I will get a glimpse of this " large hearted gentleman " some day in the forests .

@@4408239 , 2011 ( Washington Bangla Radio / Penning Creations ) These are good times for the Bengali film industry . Money is being splashed around by film-makers in an honest effort to raise the production values of their movies , and it sure shows on-screen . The interest of viewers to watch Bengali movies in theaters is back too , thanks to the marketing blitz that precedes every big-budget film release . As yours truly stood in the ticket queue for ' Romeo ' , the latest offering from Shree Venkatesh Films , it was indeed heartening to see the demand for tickets for the movie to be almost at par with the one-week old Bolly biggie , ' Ra.One ' . So , does the film live up to the enormous hype it had created prior to release ? It does , but only in parts . <p> ' Romeo ' does not offer much novelty in its plot . Dev plays a young Casanova , a diligent MBA student , who , apparently , has enough time to shake a leg with PYTs ( Pretty Young Things , silly ! ) and woo his lady love . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the big screen after a hiatus of four years . The twists and turns in the story are rather predictable too , proving the fact that N. K. Salil , while a master at rolling out clap-inducing dialogues , still has a long way to go as far as story-writing is concerned . <p> What makes ' Romeo ' tick , however , are its stars . The head of a leading chain of theaters recently referred to Dev as ' the SRK of Bengal ' and the ' Khokababu ' shows his mettle as a superstar . There is nothing in the movie that Dev has not done before on-screen , but his boyish charm and sheer screen presence add a new dimension to his performances . And yes , going by the reactions of the group of young ladies in the front row , the man can indeed be called a ' teen heartthrob ' . <p> Subhashree is back with a bang , and that too , in an all-new , ' size-zero ' avatar . Oozing glamor in every frame that she appears in , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strong performance , showing how much she has improved since her ' Challenge ' and ' Poran Jaay Jolia Re ' days . The close friendship of the leading couple shows up in the movie too , where they share a sparkling chemistry . The others are well-casted and are adequate in their roles . <p> Probably the biggest highlight of ' Romeo ' is its cinematography . In Kumud Verma , Tollywood finally has a person who knows how to wield a camera , with the best possible results . The entire movie looks easy on the eye , so much so that , when the audience is asked to take rather outlandish leaps of faith ( I wo n't be providing any spoilers here ! ) , they are only too happy to do so . <p> The hit-machine called Jeet Ganguly scores yet again with ' Romeo ' . While ' Ami holam Romeo ' and ' Mala Re ' have already become chart-busters , ' Ei Mon Toke Dilam ' also stays with you , with its touching lyrics and lilting melody . The film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautifully . ' Romeo ' is director Sujit Mondol 's third film with Dev , and the comfort level that the two share , helps the cause of the movie too . <p> Video : Watch the Full ROMEO Bengali Movie Music Release Online <p> The title-track of the movie , shot at Mumbai 's Esel Studio , is worth a special mention . The track features the usage of Motion Control Camera , or MILO cam , for the first time in the Bengali film industry . For those wondering what on earth is this all about , throw your mind back to the Ranbir Kapoor-starrer ' Bachna Ae Haseeno ' a few years back . MILO cam was used to show the hero change shirts during the title track in that movie and is used here to show multiple Dev-s on screen . Yes , Tollywood is indeed fast catching up with its big brother in Mumbai . <p> Finally , ' Romeo ' is Dev 's film all the way .

However , he still needs to work on his emoting skills . <p> The production values of ' Romeo ' are excellent , and every penny of the Rs. 50 crore budget of the movie has been utilized to enhance the look and feel of the movie in the best manner possible .

Simply put , it 's a story of complications in relationships . Roy has been an accomplished filmmaker but has given the Bengali film industry some not-so-major hits like " Dujone Milibo Abar " ( 2011 ) and " Sukher Basha " ( 2009 ) . <p> " Premer Kothakoli " , a mainstream commercial directed by Alok Roy , illuminates different layers of relationships . The story of an extraordinary love affair in an individual 's life is the basic theme of this film . Produced by Surakha and presented by Sujoy Mukherjee , this movie will strike a chord with many a romantic heart of thousands of Bengalis . Purple Motion Pictures presents the movie featuring Dolon Ray , Arunima Ghosh , Pallabi Chatterjee , Dron Mukherjee , Shantilal Mukherjee , Arjun Chakraborty and Sujoy Mukherjee . The actors have portrayed themselves and performed their roles in quite a decent manner . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conviction and the remaining cast is just about passable . <p> This film shows how the character of a man dwindles and he falls for both the mother and the daughter . It shows how a married woman is forced to go beyond the established norms of marriage and her desire to quench her physical needs makes her fall for a much younger guy . And the twist is ... the guy is none other than the man her daughter is in love with ! A mixology of passion , emotion and the conventional spicing-up of hot and steamy scenes make for a decent watch for anyone who enjoys typical masala potboilers . <p> The screenplay could have been better yet the film has a strong storyline that will make up for the loss . With Tollywood soaring high with romantic films , " Premer Kothakoli " can be expected to taste success with such an erotic representation of love and its myriad complications that has caught the fancy of today 's Bengali movie goers . To feel the emotional tug , one will have to wait to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three individuals . Arunima and Dron though madly in love , just ca n't seem to get it together , thanks to the lust and desire of the mother . <p> The contemporary compositions written by Goutam Susmit and portions of Rabindra Sangeet makes the film stand out distinctly . Rupankar , Kumar Sanu , Ipsita , Riddhi , Mahua Bose , Subhankar Bhaskar , Aninda and Kamalika Chatterjee have lent their voices in the film and the songs though not catchy , are hummable . <p> The earlier ventures of Roy did not produce anticipated results and could not make it big in the box office .

I consider myself really fortunate that I have come across seniors like them . From telling me how to face the camera to how to handle a role , from making me understand how to create a character to telling me how to behave , I learnt so much from my seniors . This time around , when I came to shoot for Riingo 's movie , I have had a very busy schedule . But the day I got an off , I was out with my camera trying to shoot the architectural splendour of the state .

But that does n't mean we need to overdo anything to please people . It 's been years since I stopped dressing up before attending a wedding . I mean , I do n't make any effort to take special care to get decked up because I am going somewhere . The day I am in a mood to dress up , I go all decked up .

That 's my strength . But what 's changed in me now is that today I do n't hurt people by being upfront if it 's not required . <p> You 've confessed on " Sach Ka Saamna " that you had tried to commit suicide .

Yes , I still trust people . I 've seen both the good and the bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to people , there will be people who will be good to me . Love is an eternal feeling .

In " NH " , my character manages to exude so much of love despite going through such a lot of turmoil . <p> How do you like the music of " Na Hayante " that 's been scored by Sriram ? Why ? Will you ask me the same question for all the movies that I 'm doing ? ( laughs ) The music is fantastic . <p> Nationally , people still remember you as Draupadi .

I sincerely feel that The Mahabharat has lot of contemporary relevance . Even the method in which Karna was born is akin to the process of artificial insemination . <p> Having worked in Mumbai for so long , you 've suddenly given up all that and returned to Kolkata . How is your second innings in Bengali cinema ? I 'd say , this is my fourth innings . I have been pretty fortunate about being accepted in the industry after having quit it .

Is that true ? Yes , the character is very close to me . In fact , there is one line in the film where I tell : " Tomar boier molat gulo dewa holo na " . I have exactly gone through this phase with my son . For me , this was so important . I remember , once I had taken a late-night flight from Mumbai to Kolkata so that I could myself work on getting his book jackets in order .

But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue to be that way . <p> Bengali cinema is seeing a lot of you now . Are you breaking the myth that there are few good roles available for female actors who do n't want to dance around trees ? Yes , it 's true that I am doing quite a lot of work now . I have always believed in the importance of the perfect time . Unlike Riingo 's " NH " or Aditi 's " Aboseshey " , the other movies do n't feature me in roles that require me to shoot for long . I am doing Srijit 's next film that will be shot in the Andamans . Then , there is a family drama with Anjan Dutt and a film by Abhijit Dasgupta . Ashok Viswanathan 's " Santiniketan " has me in an interesting role . <p> With so much work happening on the professional front now , do you have any regrets ? Very few .

@@4461239 <h> Recycling ideas <p> Last updated : 09 December , 2011 <p> THE RECYCLISTS <p> Although Indians have traditionally reused and recycled , the waste bin is a relatively recent , modern and largely urban phenomenon.Sameer Shisodia speaks to a few people who are doing their best to reverse the trash menace <p> Over my first couple of trips to the certifiably developed US of A , I came back with two enduring images -- the first was large parking lots with hundreds of cars parked in front of every mall , office , block of apartments and just about everywhere , and the other was cool people sipping ' soda ' , or coffee , from gigantic paper cups with lids , and then chucking those -- usually with about half the contents still in there -- into huge bins that you could find just about anywhere ! I presume hordes of us came back home with such symbols of development . The trash can quickly rose up the ranks of development indices . Our economic growth brought along with it the idea of disposable incomes , consumption cycles , large supply chains , packaging and in tow behind all this , mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , in the Indian context , the idea of garbage , and the waste bin , is a relatively recent , modern and largely urban one . People used to rarely need to throw stuff away , and pretty much everything had another use , or was recycled into something else , after its primary use was done with . Even amidst the growing affluence and numbers of trash cans , there is thankfully a bunch who , at their core , have not felt comfortable with this change in behaviour and are doing not only their own personal damnedest to reverse the trash menace , and sometimes even changing mindsets around them . <p> Dr Meenakshi Bharath was always uncomfortable with the heaps of garbage and especially the heaps of it lying around Bangalore that were making many people fall ill -- with dengue and chikungunya . In 2008 she first started segregating waste and composting at her own house , and also tackling it at a city level to impact policy making through an organisation called Solid Waste Management Round Table that she 's involved with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food waste at home has been converted into wonderful manure and an equal amount of dry waste has been sent for recycling . The 5,000 tonnes of garbage generated in Bangalore is eminently manageable if all of us take the responsibility of segregating it at the point of generation " , she says . <p> Poonam Bir Kasturi is one of the pioneers of home composting -- on all fronts of creating products for it , educating people through information and even a garbage tour of Bangalore which helps one connect with what happens to what one throws away . Her company , Daily Dump , has been creating products and services to easily compost wet organic waste at home -- even if you just have a corner in a balcony . This itself reduces the volume of your waste significantly , and you produce something that can improve the quality of soil around you a lot ! Poonam herself believes in more wholesome , local choices which automatically imply less wastage in the whole cycle of production and consumption -- " I prefer to spend less , repair more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more local , more fresh and less packaged . " <p> But it is also efforts of folks who do regular jobs , but just passionately follow better waste management at home which help . <p> To her surprise , Usha Srinath found the amount of garbage generated at home go down by 60 per cent merely through reuse of plastic packets when shopping , giving away boxes etc. to those who could make use of it , and composting . She 's very conscious and proud of the way of life she grew up with -- much like the rest of India -- where consumption was more or less related to need , and recycling was second nature irrespective of one 's economic status. ? " I often wonder how we dropped our traditional Indian practices that were intrinsically so eco-friendly . And am amused that now we have to re-learn them from the West ! " she adds . <p> Similarly , Deepa Mohan has grown up in the pre-plastic-packaged times , and values the then natural thrift of the home-maker and the Indian culture of " jugaad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she also noticed , over time , the growing aspirational value of consumption. ? " Some of the things I routinely did -- taking the bus instead of the car , cycling to do my daily shopping , recycling envelopes by turning them inside out , bath-with-a-bucket instead of a shower , and cloth diapers instead of disposable ones for my baby -- these started to be snidely referred to as ' being cheap ' . Now I find more and more that these are ' cool ' things to do ! " <p> So is there a wider acceptance of what was traditionally acceptable thrift , and is now the ecologically right set of choices ? <p> Reena Chengappa and Anu Gummaraju have been instrumental in setting up Second To None , a community that is not just promoting recycling and upcycling - the creation of objects of art and utility out of waste -- but also helping organise markets and facilitating commercial activity around this . This has already found resonance with a wide audience . <p> Yet , it 's early days for this mindset . Reena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to those about the weirdness and the snobbishness of it all . However , she 's happy about how folks are accepting it -- " All 's well now and folks are willing to look at this choice as an option " . Sejal Shah , who creates and promotes eco-friendly upcycled jewelry , has received a lot of encouragement from people , but only a lukewarm response from actual buying customers . <p> Even at home , it 's often a crusade. ? Chidambaram Subramaniam faced a bunch of challenges in both his efforts , and the reaction of people at home when the maggots in the compost bin multiplied and crawled in one day ! Over time , his persistence with composting , and creating a kitchen garden in his balcony have not only found converts at home , but evoked curiosity amongst the neighbours as well . <p> At our local convenience store , one sees more people come in with their own bags . There was news of an apartment complex winning an award for its waste management efforts . Kids at school are carrying home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are mere dents in the armour of the marketing and packaging machinery that just injects so much into our lives that we end up wasting , but these are good signs and we might see bigger change if folks like Meenakshi succeed in bringing about positive changes in policy . <p> It 's good to know that for a growing tribe of Bangaloreans , taking garbage out of sight is not getting it out of mind . <p> Getting started <p> * Daily Dump : http : //dailydump.org or help with composting at home <p> * Zero Waste Management Group : http : **33;294;TOOLONG for advice on how to help your community adopt better waste practices

I saw it with Mr. RC Sakthi , and after the film , we did n't talk all the way back to my house , a distance of about two kilometres .

Why do they go to the hotel , then ? <p> What , in your opinion , is the use of a film festival ? <p> Cinema is a language . You have to practise it to understand it , to become more fluent with it -- not just the critics but also the audience . When Pudovkin came in with his cuts , I 'm sure audiences must have found them very jerky and not easy to comprehend . But over time , we have come to accept cuts midway through scenes and narrations in reverse order .

I would say -- and this is as much a whip crack at my own screenwriting as of others -- make the film short . Make it only an hour-and-a-half long , as long as the bladder of even the worst diabetic can stand it . Allow audiences to buy food when they go into the theatre . That way , you conveniently do six shows in the same time you do four . <p> Long ago , the film world was fascinated by names such as Bergman , Fellini , Antonioni .

If Honda were to launch a diesel Brio , things would 've been different , perhaps .

The proposal which was sent by the petroleum ministry to the Finance Minister 's office earlier in the week might get halted after an intervention by the Union Heavy Industries Minister Praful Patel . Even , folks from the auto industry believe that the new regulation will target diesel cars unfairly as they have n't been the drivers behind the sudden spike in the popularity of oil burners . <p> That said , the high petrol prices and constant changes in interest rates have had an enormous effect on the local auto industry . The tides have changed in the favor of diesel cars and all of a sudden sales of diesel powered cars have increased exponentially .

@@4484238 <p> Australia 's batsmen scrambled to 6 for 277 against a shrewd and opportunistic India on day one of the Boxing Day Test , and would not have progressed that far without a meritorious debut from Ed Cowan in front of 70,068 spectators at the MCG . <p> Losing Michael Hussey to a decision that would have been reversed with the aid of technology - Cowan also had reason to query his exit - the hosts were still some way short of a substantial total by the close . Brad Haddin and Peter Siddle were established however , and their contributions will be critical when play resumes . <p> Cowan 's 68 , in 294 minutes and 177 balls , was no more or less than he had promised to deliver as a circumspect , organised opening bat . But its influence on proceedings was lessened by the others ' failure to bat around him , save for an innings of 62 from Ricky Ponting that alternated between edgy and elegant . <p> India 's captain MS Dhoni rotated his bowlers expertly , recovering from the hour after lunch when Ponting and Cowan had threatened to carry the day . India 's refusal to accept the DRS also allowed the visitors to place pressure on the umpires Marais Erasmus and Ian Gould in the time-honoured style , achieving the desired result in the final session . <p> Zaheer Khan turned the day India 's way with the removal of Michael Clarke and Hussey to successive , reverse-swinging balls , after Umesh Yadav demonstrated his knack for speed and wickets with a trio either side of a profligate post-lunch spell . R Ashwin accounted for Cowan in the following over and gained appreciable turn at times to suggest he will be a threat across this series . <p> Opening after Clarke won a quite ambiguous toss , Cowan and David Warner walked to the middle under overcast skies to a surface the offered the promise of early seam to augment the swing offered by the atmosphere . First strike was taken by the debutant , and Cowan responded by playing out Zaheer 's well-directed opening over with plenty of nerves but just as much good sense . His first run arrived in the second over with a tap wide of mid on , before Warner commenced with a streaky inside edge to the fine-leg boundary . <p> From this inauspicious beginning Warner was quickly into stride , cuffing a handful of boundaries in between sensible pushes and nudges around the ground 's vast expanses . Zaheer moved the ball and Ishant Sharma bounced it , but Australia 's openers negotiated their opening spells with as much confidence as could be expected . The introduction of Yadav prompted Cowan to unfurl one glorious straight drive amid his otherwise abstemious defence , and Warner followed up in the same over by biffing the bowler through cover , then hooking uproariously into the crowd . <p> A brief rain delay broke the rhythm of the stand , and when the players returned Warner perished immediately , attempting to repeat his hook at Yadav and gloving gently behind to Dhoni . Yadav had his tail up , firing down his deliveries with plenty of speed , and had Marsh struck on the pad first up . Having played only one Twenty20 innings since his return to fitness after a painful back complaint that afflicted him in South Africa , Marsh did not look at ease , and to his seventh ball he walked too late into a drive and sliced it to gully . <h> Smart stats <p> Ed Cowan 's 68 is the highest score by an Australian opener in his debut Test innings since Wayne Phillips ' 159 against Pakistan in 1983 . During this period , Michael Slater is the only other opener to score a half-century in his first innings . <p> Ricky Ponting 's 62 is his third half-century in his last five Test innings . It 's also his fifth half-century at No.4 , but he has never scored more than 78 batting at that slot . <p> Ponting is third in the all-time list of run-getters in Tests at the MCG , behind Don Bradman ( 1671 ) and Steve Waugh ( 1284 ) . Ponting currently has 1278 . <p> Michael Hussey 's duck is his 12th in Tests since the beginning of 2008 , which is as many as Chris Martin 's tally during this period . Only Mitchell Johnson ( 14 ) has more . <p> Australia 's average second-wicket partnership in Tests in 2011 is 22.06 , which is the lowest among all teams this year . <p> The 113-run stand between Cowan and Ponting is Australia 's second-highest for the third wicket against India at the MCG , next to only the 169-run stand between Bradman and Lindsay Hassett in 1948 . <p> Suddenly 0 for 46 had become two for the same score , and Ponting 's arrival brought a crowd response that suggested both appreciation and trepidation for Australia 's former captain . Off his second ball Ponting swivelled to hook a short ball , but was struck a stunning blow to the jaw . Ponting was still alert enough to side-foot the rebound away from his stumps , but it was another reminder of how his command over the bouncer has slipped ever since West Indies ' Kemar Roach pinned him on the arm at Perth in 2009 . <p> Through it all Cowan maintained his composure , cracking Ishant through the covers with some flourish to add a second boundary after taking a blow to the body from Yadav , and Ponting gradually began to find a little more equilibrium . He slipped over while pulling at Zaheer , but the ungainly follow-through was less important than the sight of the ball skimming to the backward square-leg boundary . <p> Resumption was delayed by further showers , and when it arrived India 's bowlers lapsed in line , length and attitude . Cowan was granted the chance to gather momentum with a handful of boundaries , one a chancy cut over gully but the rest pleasingly fluent , and Ponting also took advantage of some wayward stuff from Yadav in particular . Swiftly the 50-run stand and the Australian 100 were raised , in a union between a Tasmanian living in Sydney ( Ponting ) and a New South Welshman renewed in Hobart ( Cowan ) . <p> Some of Ponting 's strokes were reprised from the pages of his regal best , one back foot punch off the toes from Ishant more than enough to get the crowd cooing . They were on their feet soon after as his half-century was raised , via a rather more ungainly slog sweep for three . The rain delayed the tea break and Cowan took his time to reach his own 50 , but a nudge into the offside brought it in 120 new-ball-blunting balls . <p> Yadav returned to the attack for a spell near the interval , and found something approaching the vim of his morning burst . Ponting was unnerved by his first ball , rearing off a length , and dismissed by the third , which swerved away on a line just close enough to off stump for an uncertain batsman . VVS Laxman held the nick , the union was broken at 113 , and Ponting 's interminable wait for another Test century continued . <p> Clarke offered useful company to Cowan for a time , the pair adding 46 either side of the interval . India responded by tightening up , and only four runs had been accrued from three overs when Zaheer beat Clarke 's outside edge with a delivery that zipped away , then forced a cuff onto the stumps from the next when the batsman shaped to cut far too close to his body . <p> The sin of Clarke 's dismissal for 31 was compounded next ball , Hussey fending at a short-pitcher from Zaheer that passed close to , but did not appear to touch , bat or glove on the way through to Dhoni . The umpire Erasmus intuited an edge and raised his finger , and with no DRS recourse , Hussey had to go . <p> While Haddin averted the hat-trick , Cowan now let his guard down , cutting impatiently at Ashwin and was adjudged by Gould to have offered the thinnest of edges to Dhoni . Hot-spot showed no evidence of contact , adding another unhappy chapter to the saga of technology and its inconsistent use . Batting as though they were aware of the total 's inadequacy , Haddin and Siddle dug in , and eluded a tight lbw appeal each . They will face a refreshed India in the morning . <p> Ishant and Zaheer had both been ruled fit and were joined in the attack by Yadav and Ashwin , who won the spinner 's spot ahead of Pragyan Ojha . Australia 's line-up was confirmed two days ago and there were no late changes , with Ben Hilfenhaus in for Mitchell Starc and Cowan named at the top of the order . Australia 's 427th Test cricketer , Cowan was presented with his baggy green by Dean Jones , before the toss . <p> Hahahaha ...... DRS or not ..... The Aussies do n't seem too troubled . India is down for the count now . <p> on December 27 , 2011 , 11:18 GMT <p> When the DRS was introduced the rules should have just made it mandatory . I think today people were confused that after Dravid was out it was referred to make sure it was n't a no ball . Because the decision was referred and Dravid was not out it has made the situation even worse . Also the excessive appealing is in every country we have seen it time and time again . That was one of the reasons the introduction of the DRS was introduced . No other country has denied its use as I think it is fair towards both teams . So many times in the past have we seen bad calls now we have a chance to improve the game a little better by making it fairer . I do n't understand why they do not wish to use it , especially if it comes down to winning the series and a bad decision is made against them a lot will just call it Karma and Australians will be branded in the Indian papers as Cheats . So the ICC should have a majority vote with the cricketing nations to see if it should be mandatory . <p> bobmartin on December 27 , 2011 , 9:24 GMT <p> Here 's a thought for all those who are still opposed to the use of DRS using the old " you win some , you lose some .. they eventually cancel themselves out " excuse . That is a fallacy . An incorrect NOT OUT decision can never compensate for an incorrect OUT decision , nor vice versa , because the simple fact is that they are two wrong decisions , and as every sane person knows , two wrongs never make a right . <p> passionateindian on December 27 , 2011 , 7:50 GMT <p> @Dinosaurus .... It is not that India said no DRS only for this series . They say no to every series . If Australia or any country has a problem with that ... they are free not to organize a series . After such consistent approach throughout all series at home and away , just because Australia wants to use it , does not mean every country should agree to it . Looking at the past , Indian team should not agree to anything Australian team has to offer . People like Clarke have a tendency to wait for umpire 's decision when they nick it to 1st slip ... and then expect others to take their word whether they have taken a clean catch or not .. and if you look at the records ... he said it was a clean catch when replays suggested that it was not clean .... At that time every one called indians as whingers ... now we all know who are the whingers .. ! ! <p> bobmartin on December 27 , 2011 , 7:40 GMT <p> @Rama Prasad .... " Both teams agreed to one set of rules " Wrong. ! ! ! Both teams DID NOT agree a set of rules . The conditions set down by the ICC state that BOTH teams must agree to the use of the DRS . If one team ( in this and almost every other case to date ) India disagreed to it 's use . So in fact it was the non-agreement of both teams that precluded it 's use in this series . <p> on December 27 , 2011 , 4:46 GMT <p> @phoenixsteve You need n't mention Sachin in the same breath as Bradman . Bradman himself did it : ) <p> on December 27 , 2011 , 4:41 GMT <p> @Hayden Field - The same argument of excessive appealing can be applied to the Australian team as well . The last time India toured here Dravid was given out caught behind when he had missed the ball by a foot . Yes , by a foot . The Australians had appealed like their lives depended on it . I wonder whether you advocated dropping Australia from world cricket then . Or even thought about fining the team $100,000 each for claiming 2 clearly grassed catches . From what you say , it sounds like ' excessive appealing ' is a problem only when India does it . <p> jameswayne on December 27 , 2011 , 3:08 GMT <p> I suppose by now everyone should have realized why the Indians do not want the DRS.The example was there for all to see today.Take the case of Ed Cowan and Hussey.They clearly did not hit the ball which even most of the Indian fielders knew but they keep on appealing like mad men and put pressure on the umpires to give them out.This is the famed Indian style of taking wickets by intimidating the umpires rather than legally take wickets.That is how this poor Indian attack get their wickets and that is how these Indians have been winning most of their matches in India where they play 90% of their cricket.They could not win even 1 match against England because they were too good for the Indians and are rightly No. 1 in Test cricket.If the umpires rule against them like Bucknor or Harper , the BCCI with the help of the ICC will kick them out of the Umpires panel . <p> Severian on December 27 , 2011 , 2:34 GMT <p> Do n't know what you were watching , cricdoc22 , or what yarns your commentators were spinning , but millions of viewers have repeatedly seen Haddins ' LBW-not-out pitch on middle and " hit " middle two-thirds up - routine HawkEye stuff . Most trainee umpires would have got that one right every time . <p> mcj.cricinfo on December 27 , 2011 , 1:55 GMT <p> All this rubbish about technology being 100% is just a distraction . Nothing in life is 100% , nothing is perfect , however a system which only overturns the umpires decision when it is obvious that the umpire is wrong is a good one , and a better system than what we had before . Regarding the argument that it is the same for each team , well why do n't they pick umpires with only one eye - it would be the same for both teams right ? Picking a more defective system and then justifying it as equal is rubbish . The technology is more likely to produce a fair result . Why do n't the BCCI want a fair result ? <p> on December 29 , 2011 , 3:33 GMT <p> Hahahaha ...... DRS or not ..... The Aussies do n't seem too troubled . India is down for the count now . <p> on December 27 , 2011 , 11:18 GMT <p> When the DRS was introduced the rules should have just made it mandatory . I think today people were confused that after Dravid was out it was referred to make sure it was n't a no ball . Because the decision was referred and Dravid was not out it has made the situation even worse . Also the excessive appealing is in every country we have seen it time and time again . That was one of the reasons the introduction of the DRS was introduced . No other country has denied its use as I think it is fair towards both teams . So many times in the past have we seen bad calls now we have a chance to improve the game a little better by making it fairer . I do n't understand why they do not wish to use it , especially if it comes down to winning the series and a bad decision is made against them a lot will just call it Karma and Australians will be branded in the Indian papers as Cheats . So the ICC should have a majority vote with the cricketing nations to see if it should be mandatory . <p> bobmartin on December 27 , 2011 , 9:24 GMT <p> Here 's a thought for all those who are still opposed to the use of DRS using the old " you win some , you lose some .. they eventually cancel themselves out " excuse . That is a fallacy . An incorrect NOT OUT decision can never compensate for an incorrect OUT decision , nor vice versa , because the simple fact is that they are two wrong decisions , and as every sane person knows , two wrongs never make a right . <p> passionateindian on December 27 , 2011 , 7:50 GMT <p> @Dinosaurus .... It is not that India said no DRS only for this series . They say no to every series . If Australia or any country has a problem with that ... they are free not to organize a series . After such consistent approach throughout all series at home and away , just because Australia wants to use it , does not mean every country should agree to it . Looking at the past , Indian team should not agree to anything Australian team has to offer . People like Clarke have a tendency to wait for umpire 's decision when they nick it to 1st slip ... and then expect others to take their word whether they have taken a clean catch or not .. and if you look at the records ... he said it was a clean catch when replays suggested that it was not clean .... At that time every one called indians as whingers ... now we all know who are the whingers .. ! ! <p> bobmartin on December 27 , 2011 , 7:40 GMT <p> @Rama Prasad .... " Both teams agreed to one set of rules " Wrong. ! ! ! Both teams DID NOT agree a set of rules . The conditions set down by the ICC state that BOTH teams must agree to the use of the DRS . If one team ( in this and almost every other case to date ) India disagreed to it 's use . So in fact it was the non-agreement of both teams that precluded it 's use in this series . <p> on December 27 , 2011 , 4:46 GMT <p> @phoenixsteve You need n't mention Sachin in the same breath as Bradman . Bradman himself did it : ) <p> on December 27 , 2011 , 4:41 GMT <p> @Hayden Field - The same argument of excessive appealing can be applied to the Australian team as well . The last time India toured here Dravid was given out caught behind when he had missed the ball by a foot . Yes , by a foot . The Australians had appealed like their lives depended on it . I wonder whether you advocated dropping Australia from world cricket then . Or even thought about fining the team $100,000 each for claiming 2 clearly grassed catches . From what you say , it sounds like ' excessive appealing ' is a problem only when India does it . <p> jameswayne on December 27 , 2011 , 3:08 GMT <p> I suppose by now everyone should have realized why the Indians do not want the DRS.The example was there for all to see today.Take the case of Ed Cowan and Hussey.They clearly did not hit the ball which even most of the Indian fielders knew but they keep on appealing like mad men and put pressure on the umpires to give them out.This is the famed Indian style of taking wickets by intimidating the umpires rather than legally take wickets.That is how this poor Indian attack get their wickets and that is how these Indians have been winning most of their matches in India where they play 90% of their cricket.They could not win even 1 match against England because they were too good for the Indians and are rightly No. 1 in Test cricket.If the umpires rule against them like Bucknor or Harper , the BCCI with the help of the ICC will kick them out of the Umpires panel . <p> Severian on December 27 , 2011 , 2:34 GMT <p> Do n't know what you were watching , cricdoc22 , or what yarns your commentators were spinning , but millions of viewers have repeatedly seen Haddins ' LBW-not-out pitch on middle and " hit " middle two-thirds up - routine HawkEye stuff . Most trainee umpires would have got that one right every time . <p> mcj.cricinfo on December 27 , 2011 , 1:55 GMT <p> All this rubbish about technology being 100% is just a distraction . Nothing in life is 100% , nothing is perfect , however a system which only overturns the umpires decision when it is obvious that the umpire is wrong is a good one , and a better system than what we had before . Regarding the argument that it is the same for each team , well why do n't they pick umpires with only one eye - it would be the same for both teams right ? Picking a more defective system and then justifying it as equal is rubbish . The technology is more likely to produce a fair result . Why do n't the BCCI want a fair result ? <p> The obvious question to be asked is what those who oppose the DRS system are afraid of or have to hide.DRS has manifold advantages in that it removes opinion and the perception of bias from the fraught decision making process . DRS is incapable of making a disputed decision less correct . It lacks the capacity for an agenda , dealing soley in technology based evidence . It has two possibilities . One-that it will resolve a contentious decision which , to the naked eye appears in doubt . Two-it will confirm that there is so little evidence to determine the validity of an umpires choice , even with the aid of technology , that the original decision is as valid as any that may be made , given the known facts . In all cases , it only improves upon human judgement . One wonders , after the scandalous mis-treatment of Umpire Harper , why DRS isnt mandated . Daryl Harpers record in India Tests was peerless.Despite a supporter outcry , DRS technology in the commentary box vindicated 8 of 9 of Harpers disputed decisions <p> naitikphysio2002 on December 27 , 2011 , 0:22 GMT <p> Question for all the oldies commentating S " TOP CRYING ABOUT DRS " .... Did you have DRS when you played cricket . then why now .. keep it simple ........ its test cricket , the puriest form of the game then why do n't we keep it like that way . why are you making all the fuss about DRS . Test cricket is test cricket no matter who is given out , mike hussey or Sachin Tendulkar or even Sir Donald Bradman . In that case why even have umpies on the field when you can do everything sitting outside the ground by cameras and DRS . <p> on December 27 , 2011 , 0:09 GMT <p> Why do people cry over DRS , its already been agreed even before the game has started . Its not implemented in the middle of the game . Peace . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 23:39 GMT <p> Both teams agreed to one set of rules . Both teams started playing . One too many decision went against Aussies . And they started doing what they are good at - whinging ... Go Aussies .. <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 23:23 GMT <p> How I wish Varon was fit .. instead of Mithun/Vinay-Venkatesh prasad clones <p> LillianThomson on December 26 , 2011 , 23:19 GMT <p> I 'm a bit over the " India v Everyone Else " DRS debate . But we should talk about India 's quicks . I was not that impressed by Yadav - he reminded me of Waqar Younis in the Caribbean in 1992-93 : good strike rate but so expensive that he let the other team get more runs on the board than they should . I do n't rate any fast bowler shorter than Malcolm Marshall ! Meanwhile Ishant and Zaheer were both pretty good , but these are back-to-back Tests , so we need to wait and see whether they can sustain this . It will be a better series if they can . The real disappointment was Ashwin . Finger spinners rarely dismiss the top order in Australia in the First Innings , but their job is to contain and bowl 20-8-40-1 , not 26-2-71-1 . He looks much more like Mohammed Hafeez than Saeed Ajmal ! If Yadav and Ashwin had been able to bowl more accurately and if Dhoni had given them better fields 277-6 could have been 215-6 , which is a different ball game . <p> heathrf1974 on December 26 , 2011 , 23:05 GMT <p> One thing 's for sure , when Australia play India the temperature in both fan 's camps rises a bit . I do believe the UDRS or DRS ( whatever it is called ) should be brought into international cricket . Even though it may not be 100% accurate surely it gets more decisions correct than relying on an umpires eyes and ears ? <p> Dismayed on December 26 , 2011 , 23:03 GMT <p> DravidGravitas our boards did not agree . The Indian board refused after many pleas by the Australian board . The simple fact is the ICC is run by the Indian board to the detriment of the game . That is why we have so much T20 and meaningless 5 and 7 series ODI 's . To provide television revenues . Nothing to do with what is best for cricket . The fact you sit at your computer(technology) and espouse muddled conflicting statements and conveniently question what is the best technology available today highlights your one eyed barracking hypocracy . <p> Jason1979 on December 26 , 2011 , 23:01 GMT <p> cant believe how much the aussie fans are whining about those 2 decisions and India 's refusal to use the UDRS. shows how nervous they are about their team 's prospects in this series . 277/6 looks like a decent enough score on a first day MCG pitch to build on with your tail and bat india out of the game . india have traditionally done poorly at the MCG and i do nt seem them getting past 300 even once in this test . <p> Silloh on December 26 , 2011 , 22:33 GMT <p> For one of the leading countries in the world when it comes to technology it is mind baffling why when it comes to cricket , the Indian cricket board is not supportive of DRS . To me use of the technology based on some criteria can only serve to improve the standard of umpiring decvisions . In the West Indies past great era some umpires could not make decisions at times due to the terrific speed of Holding , Garner , Roberts and Marshall . Now , there is an opportunity to address that for the mutual benefit of all , the question is why is there a reluctance by the Indian Board , with the full understanding it 's not a 100% proof . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 22:27 GMT <p> Think of it this way , if DRS were there , India would have won the Sydney Test in the last series and indeed the first series win in Australia ! ! ! Remember the Test saw 10 decisions go against India and 3 against Australia ! ! ! So , we Indians are the ones who should have been asking for DRS ! ! ! <p> cryinggame on December 26 , 2011 , 22:26 GMT <p> To all those supporting DRS : If it is the solution to all problems and will clean up all controversies , why restrict reviews to two per innings ? After the two are used up , what happens ? it is things back to normal ? If it is the be all end all , then there should be no restrictions on reviews , right ? If it is an issue of time waste where captains excessively ask for reviews then there is already a penalty for over rates for fielding teams and the batting team can be penalised for going over a certain number of reviews turned down . In any case , the hot spot was found wanting in the dravid incident in England . So why is it so reliable for Cowen now ? <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 22:22 GMT <p> Hot Spot is a useless technology . Very fine edges do not get picked up . Batsman have even said they have nicked it themselves yet nothing appears on Hot Spot . This is why India refuse the DRS I am sure of it . I wrekon Cowan nicked that one today . If we had use of the snickometer it would have shown a fine edge . Snickometer in my opinion is far more reliable than the Hot Spot , if DRS is going to be used to determine weather or not a batsman has edged a delivery this is the way the ICC should be heading . <p> hhillbumper on December 26 , 2011 , 22:10 GMT <p> Tendulkar the greatest player ever ? Lets see Sobers , Bradman , Hammond , Richards all of these are better.Against good bowlers with match on the line how many has he ever won ? <p> a1234s on December 26 , 2011 , 22:04 GMT <p> the problem with UDRS was highlighted by Cowan 's decision . He was clearly out . There was a loud click when the ball passed his bat . <p> But the hotspot showed absolutely nothing . <p> You can expect umpires to err . But a machine which has been certified 100% fool-proof has to be spot-on every single time . <p> BCCI 's hesitance is due to this very thing . UDRS has to be 100% accurate . Otherwise , it will create even more controversies . <p> CMCMCM on December 26 , 2011 , 21:51 GMT <p> If the main doubts from DRS arise from accuracy of the system wrt LBW decisions , why not just make DRS available for all decisions aside from LBW . Catches , runouts , stumpings , no-balls etc are all black and white , and removal of human error in those fields would remove most of the angst that comes from incorrect decisions . Personally I am happy that the umpire is in the best position to judge LBW - not a camera up in the stands - and am happy to accept the occasional borderline call on LBW ... <p> BlackArcher on December 26 , 2011 , 21:44 GMT <p> The author talks about the lack of edges on hotspot but says that Haddin escaped a " tight appeal " ? That is clear and obvious hypocrisy ! Had their been DRS , he had no chance of surviving that one , it was as plumb as they come . <p> Nampally on December 26 , 2011 , 21:40 GMT <p> @dinosaurus : Common Sir , Get Real . Cowan scored only 68 and you are saying that a bad Umpiring decision cost him his century on Debut ? If you do your Maths right he needed 32 more runs to reach his century . Sachin Tendulkar over his life time in international matches got out over 30 times in his 90 's ! . What are the odds of Cowan reaching his Century is anybody 's guess ! . You must also note Cowan had several close LBW appeals against him turned down.RahulDravid of India was given out by the Umpires even after DRS did not rule him Out , three times in a Row this year in England series of Tests.If that type of DRS is applied here it is likely Cowan might have been given OUT anyway , irrespective of DRS . I proposed a solution - Make DRS decision Final - in case of inconclusive decision , the benefit of doubt goes to the batsman.Let CA , BCCI &amp; ICC discuss the UDRS of this type for the next 3 tests.Do you Agree ? <p> map27871 on December 26 , 2011 , 21:39 GMT <p> It 's a joke.If the ICC want the technology used , it should be used for all test matches , no exceptions ! But , I forgot , India pretty much runs the game ! If they did n't get their way they would probably go on strike or pull out all together and just play their boring , money hungry IPL.ICC needs to show some balls ! I think 300 could be a reasonable score on this wicket with enough movement and bounce to trouble the Indians.It will depend if we get bloody Sewag out early or not and hopefully get Tendulkar out cheaply.While Dravid is a very good player , his performances in Aus have been ordinary to say the least and hopefully Laxman fails for once against us ! <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 21:36 GMT <p> These young players are rising ........ enjoyed their performances but no one is that exiciting than Patt Cummins ....... man you are bowling to that line of batting consisting of Amla , Smith , Kallis , de villers ........ Now I am DIE HARD fan of AUSSIES <p> mcj.cricinfo on December 26 , 2011 , 21:28 GMT <p> Two decisions on the first day left a bad taste in my mouth , all because of the BCCI . Politics is responsible for two bad decisions not being overturned . Politics is responsible for team supporters feeling ripped off because we know that in every other series the the technology would assist the umpires and that the decisions would reflect to a much better degree what actually happened . All this rubbish about technology being 100% is just crap . Nothing in life is 100% , nothing is perfect , however a system which only overturns the umpires decision when it is obvious that the umpire is wrong is a good one , and a better system than what we had before . Regarding the argument that it is the same for each team , well why do n't they pick umpires with only one eye - it would be the same for both teams right ? Picking a more defective system and then justifying it as equal is rubbish . The technology is more likely to produce a fair result . Why do n't the BCCI want a fair result ? <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 21:27 GMT <p> If India were to receive those decisions against them , I could imagine them complaining once again , and refusing to play until the umpires had been replaced by different ones ! This constant appealing to the umpires borders on being against the spirit of the game . Appeal only when you are sure the batsman should be given out , the whole world is watching and your reputations as gentlemen are at stake . <p> sonicattack on December 26 , 2011 , 21:10 GMT <p> Well , I thought that it was a good day of Test Cricket . Comments here show how low Australian cricket has sunk in the last few years in that most of the chat is about poor umpiring and lack of DRS - if Aus had ended up 350-1 ( in their heyday it might have been ) umpires would not have got a mention . <p> @Alexk400 , have you heard the old proverbial , " Luck favours the brave " . Make sense of your comments . Dhoni is a cricinfo appointed captain of the world . When you have bowlers coming in from injury you can not risk overutilizing them . Guess in your dictionary there is more digits than 100 when you refer percent . Stop exagerating ! Meanwhile talk about the subject and stop dragging Sachin and BCCI into everything . For that matter BCCI is not my favourite . Also all you Aussie whiners get a life . Remember the days when Aussie ruled cricket , everything was their way or no way . Today you guys are in the spot we were . It 's hot there is'nt it ? By the way be a cricket fan . Enjoy the determination and guts of Ed Cowan and Ricky Ponting , the bowling of the Indians . Have faith in your cricketers , and lets enjoy cricket dished out and stop behaving like kindergardeners . Cricket is like a roller coaster and that is what makes it interesting . No Indian , no Australian , just plain cricket . Be articulate . <p> cool2cool on December 26 , 2011 , 20:59 GMT <p> @HawK89 : Everyone knows who was benefiited more because of horrible decisions during India 's tours of Australia in 2007-08 , 2003-04 and 1999-2000 . Also , India is against UDRS because it is error prone . England did manage to change India 's mind during India 's ( horrible ) tour of England and the sub-set of UDRS was available for that series . If Australia is in favor of UDRS , why they did n't convince India to use it during this series ? May be Australia is little cautious about it seeing how bowlers were benefited in SA . So why blame India alone ? <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 20:53 GMT <p> " Sachin is the most gifted cricketer the world has ever seen ! " Steady on there , he is not that good . In fact , he is not even the most gifted Indian cricketer , an honour that should be split three ways between K.S. Ranjitsinhji , Sunil Gavaskar and Kapil Dev . But your outcry is highly indicative of how Indian fans view Tendulkar and the peril the Indian Board faces if it were to suport UDRS in the face of the " Little Master 's " known feelings on the matter . This is why Mr Tendulkar himself should speak out in support of DRS but does he ? No ! One is left to wonder why ... <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 20:50 GMT <p> UDRS or No UDRS ; On current form , Hussey could n't have survived for long . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 20:39 GMT <p> @stalefesh - I do n't like bcci but this is the best thing for cricket ... **it needs little controversies. ** For your kind Information , this is a sport and NOT a Reality Show to have controversies to boost TRPs .. Sports need to fair in decision making - coming up with correct decisions .. <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 20:37 GMT <p> It always helps to have technology , makes the game clean and controversy free . <p> dinosaurus on December 26 , 2011 , 20:36 GMT <p> Ed Cowan is a gentleman . Of course he is n't going to put on a crybaby act . But that does n't mean that he is ignorant of the fact that he was n't out . And he misses out on a century on debut also ! <p> DravidPujaraGravitas on December 26 , 2011 , 20:32 GMT <p> Enough of this fun now comrades : ) . Get over it dear fellow fans , both Aussie and Indian . Our boards have agreed to play without DRS and the conditions are the same for both of us . If there are way too many howlers that go blatantly against any one team , be it Australia or India , let us stand united as fans of this game and come up with constructive proposals rather than bashing BCCI or CA or ICC for marginal decisions that might go either way on any given day . For now , let us realise that the match is delicately poised and a good first session by Australia may put India on the verge of defeat and a good first session by India may give that final death blow to Australia 's chances in this match . Keeping my fingers crossed for an exciting 2nd day . <p> RichardW on December 26 , 2011 , 20:21 GMT <p> To Siraj Durrani , who thinks that Jacques Kallis is a more gifted cricketer than Sachin Tendulkar.You Sir , are completely and utterly correct , he is an absolute legend of the game who deserves far more respect than he receives . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 20:08 GMT <p> Amazing bowling by Umesh made for an exciting day . It was fun to see the Aussies finding it difficult to negotiate pace bowling <p> bobmartin on December 26 , 2011 , 19:59 GMT <p> Whether you like the DRS or not , surely there should be some better way of deciding it 's use in a series other than by both sides having to agree . Since all visiting sides have to play using the home teams facilities , then if those facilities include DRS , so be it , the visitors should just have to accept it . It seems that India get to choose whether or not the DRS is in use in all series in which they are taking part , which strikes me as grossly unfair on the teams that want to use it . And let 's not forget the people who are also forced not to use it ... the umpires .. They are all in favour of it , yet they are denied it 's use and then have to face a barrage of criticism when they get a decision wrong that could have been corrected . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 19:44 GMT <p> @alexk400 ... dude why dis kolaveri di ? ? <p> common man , DRS has nothing to do with who is who 's fan ... and after all ' To Err is Human ' ... where 's the charm watching test cricket without errors .... support your Fav .. but enjoy the game .. <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 19:38 GMT <p> All this uproar over the UDRS is meaningless . Erroneous umpiring decisions will be for both sides and so it all even outs in the end . Moreover , Cowan 's dismissal puts a shadow on the accuracy of technology as the umpire and everybody around seemed entirely convinced immediately that it was out . Even Ed Cowan did nt look too surprised and has nt unequivocally stated that he was NOT OUT in the post-day conference . He is not sure himself about it . I think Aussies are in a very good position with 277/6 and will probably reach 350 . Indian batsman will really struggle to even reach 250 . They will be hoping to get away with a draw . <p> cricdoc22 on December 26 , 2011 , 19:33 GMT <p> This hoopla about DRS is unnecessary . India is adamant on few issues with it , justifiably so ... rest of the world have their viewpoint and they have their point too . Contrary to popular opinion tht the first day was an example in which the DRS would have been useful , I think that both viewpoints had their moments . The blatant caught behind off hussey and the more close call on cowan are the ones in favour of the ' yes ' sayers . Also their was a confident lbw appeal against haddin that was ruled not out , but on replay showed that was clearly out . in this instance the ball tracker was not available because of the fact that their were too many variations in the intensity of light on the pitch owing to the shadows falling across . thus even on referral it was goin to be out .. thus find a middle ground or make technology foolproof ... <p> Nampally on December 26 , 2011 , 19:26 GMT <p> To all the guys , including Clarke &amp; Cowan , moaning for DRS to be introduced uniformly in all games I suggest they also consider pushing for UDRS to be FINAL . All Indian Fans &amp; Indian players would love to have UDRS Not DRS , where Umpires can not over rule the decision of DRS . Thats the issue here . When this expensive technology is in place , Umpires keep your hands off . Technology is reviewing Umpires decision &amp; is the Final authority . I again quote how Dravid was given out thrice by Umpires in the recent Indian test series Vs . England by over ruling DRS.This is totally unacceptable way to use the DRS . Now Aussies are getting ruffled just because they think the Umpires erred by ruling 2 CBW in favour of India . But then How many LBW decisions went against India too ? It is best if ICC , CA &amp; BCCI get together &amp; decide the fate of UDRS in next 3 Tests . That will be the right solution to this alleged Flawed Umpiring ! . <p> theRule19 on December 26 , 2011 , 19:08 GMT <p> Being an Indian fan , I am against the BCCI for not using UDRS , because although not 100% full proof , it is atleast 90-95% accurate in bringing the correct decision and justice to the game . Any player be it Sachin or Ponting , or any other bowler even , can be hard done by an umpire 's wrong decision when ( they themselves are ) not sure and the last tour of Aus. proved it . I heard Shastri and other commentators who are strongly against it which is not right . Once again it should be considered by the ICC above all and not worry about what the cricket boards of individual nations think in order to bring justice to the game . <p> stalefresh on December 26 , 2011 , 19:07 GMT <p> Indian should have bowled out aus for 200 , and now they will loose . For all ausies screaming about drs let me remind you cricket has been played like this for 100 years and the rules are same for both teams . I do n't like bcci but this is the best thing for cricket ... it needs little controversies . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 19:06 GMT <p> If therre is any doubt , then everybody should use technology irrespective of how many chances are there to use the technology . And Ed Cowan is out . But what can we comment about his dismissal on technology . When india toured Aus last time , what happened to UDRS ? So many great 's are sitting in commentory box , analyzing the players mistakes , and mean time what the third umpire is doing ? For every out or not out decision why ca n't he call the umpires ' on field about their mistakes and make it correct immediately . <p> HawK89 on December 26 , 2011 , 19:04 GMT <p> I remember last time india was in AU. zaheer swung the ball away from matty hayden 's cover drive and was given out with the ball miles away from the bat . This is why india do n't want UDRS , because they get those types of decisions towards them . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 18:59 GMT <p> Haha , sachin the most gifted cricket the world has even seen , I think kallis is more gifted , more than 10,000 runs over 250 wickets , and a better fielder , shows what you know ? ! <p> SmellyCat on December 26 , 2011 , 18:54 GMT <p> I think the cricket was good .. as fans thats what we love .. DRS or no DRS ... Do n't blame BCCI for everything .. or as others said .. stand up and be counted .. <p> If India can finish off well tomorrow and limit Oz to 325 and the openers give a solid enough stand of 50+ .. then they can dictate terms .. the inexperience Oz bowling may crack .. <p> Prized-Ass on December 26 , 2011 , 18:53 GMT <p> Just alittle Karma for Mr Cricket It was on Indias last tour of Australia in the Sydney Test match that Mr Hussey knicked the cover off the ball &amp; stood there , which then turned the match on a sour note ... Remember take the good with the bad &amp; umpires are only human too ... So the only hyprocites to all this is the Australian journalism .. When technology &amp; the DRS system can be put into place around every Test playing nation with equally advanced technology equipment etc hot spot Then thats when the ICC should step in &amp; make it compulsory for all countries Cause as we have seen in some Test matches &amp; the DRS being used places like Sri Lanka &amp; Bangladesh had no access to Hot spot being used .. And just watch the Australian media jump all over it if the decisions in this Test match start to even out <p> DravidPujaraGravitas on December 26 , 2011 , 18:51 GMT <p> @Alexk400 , I 'm a die-hard Dravid fan and I 'm against DRS . Not just Sachin fans but many Indians are against DRS irrespective of whom they idolise . <p> Mitcher on December 26 , 2011 , 18:50 GMT <p> Nevermind DRS ... Yadav seems a very promising bowler . But is that one of the worst haircuts in Test cricket history ? I wish technology could eliminate that howler ! ! ! <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 18:44 GMT <p> all the aussie supporters on here complaining . Test cricket used to be like this and the thing with tests unlike one day is if you have a decision go against you it shouldnt matter as much , its the nature of a test match . Firstly hussey has nt been in the greatest of form anyway so yes his dismissal perhaps a touch unfair but delaying the inevitable . And as for cowan how can we be sure that hot spot just has nt picked it up ? It happened when india toured england . Dravid got a slight nick , drs did nt pick it up but umpire gave it out due to deviation of the ball . and when broad got an edge out of laxman and nothing appeared . AT THE END OF THE DAY ITS UNLUCKY , MUCH AS IT IS UNLUCKY THAT THE BALL MISSES AN EDGE BY A MATTER OF MILLIMETRES OR ISHANT SHARMA BOWLING WELL TODAY AND NOT GETTING A WICKET . So quit your complaining , and enjoy the test . Oh and p.s i 'm england fan through and through . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 18:36 GMT <p> indian must have to accept DRS like other and i will tell you 100% india never win this series don , t forget my word they are just able to win in home <p> phoenixsteve on December 26 , 2011 , 18:35 GMT <p> @IndiaNumeroUno .... You 're partly right ? Tendulkar is probably the most talented(gifted) INDIAN to ever play for India ! He does n't deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as the like of the great Sir Donald Bradman though ! Come on Aussies ! <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 18:32 GMT <p> @Alexk400 I am a Sachin fan and am a huge fan of DRS .... so hows that for your theory ....... I am a Sachin fan coz he is a delight to watch . And for DRS = , we should have DRS coz it minimizes error eventhough not eliminate it . Also I am sure there are some Dravid fans who hate DRS after what happened in England <p> ShanKarthic on December 26 , 2011 , 18:31 GMT <p> Hussey 's was a bad decision but for Cowan there a clear audible wood on ball noise around the time the ball passed him . Unfortunately there is no Snickometer to provide an analysis but I believe that would have provided a conflicting evidence/result to Hotspot . That conflict/lack of uniformity &amp; reliability is the core reason for people opposed to DRS ( forget about BCCI who may or may not have different reasons ) . <p> If DRS supporters can prove that all technologies will provide the same result in all situations and that result will be more than 99% accurate , then the debate can be ended . Otherwise it is all hand-waving salesman pitch . Why ca n't they , without DRS , use all technologies for all balls in all matches for a year , and then present a report showing each technology result/prediction , actual event , conflict % &amp; accuracy % ? That would end this . <p> 4thslip on December 26 , 2011 , 18:30 GMT <p> @ DravidGravitas Yes Haddin 's LBW was a howler and it should have been given out . lets get the umpire sacked for the series and threaten to quit the tour since it was clearly biased in favor of Aussies . Ind would have had a massive lead by now : ) Its amazing how Indian fans call it part of the game when it goes for them but still moan and throw tantrums about Bucknor having a bad game ( Sydney test ) . I completely agree with alexk400 . <p> cric7 on December 26 , 2011 , 18:30 GMT <p> @Alexk400 , you can think whatever you want . Here is the stand dude , When it comes to technology , it must be error free to implement ; because the decisions are critical ; what is happening here ? the technology seeks human intervention to announce the end result and finally it is the result of human aided by technology . Now in the case of onfield umpires , they do make mistakes and it is human . that is ok here because humans make mistakes . So what India asks is give us a DRS , whether you look at that or I look at that or 3rd umpire look at that , the result should be same . When we go for tech , that has to be the only deciding factor . No human thoughts in it . Btw , luckily , ICC does not have people like you ; then it will be the street cricket I played . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 18:26 GMT <p> Excuse me guys ! I see some real silly stuff by people like @Alexkk . Sachin has fallen many a times due to umpiring errors . These trivial things do n't matter as he being a genius , will make a 100 if not in one match , then in the other match . As for your suggestions on DRS , that 's lame . As for the match , its evenly placed . Early breakthroughs tomorrow will put us on driver seat . As for Aussie fans , guys you win some and lose some . Hussey 's out was evened out by Haddin 's not out . As for Cowan , the guy was definitely out . Once again Hot Spot and Snicko failed by not recognizing a thin edge . Umpires for big series have a huge success %age of about 94-97% . And with DRS being close to 90-95% effective , what the use of it ? had it been 100% effective , India would have accepted it . But foolproof the technology first , else the purpose is lost . Cricinfo please publish . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 18:24 GMT <p> Oh comeon ! ! ! .. australian fans ! ! .. now please do nt say hussey would be scoring a century if he wasnt given out : p ... andIndian batsmen are also going to play without DRS itself ..... and btw u people already lost the right to talk about umpire decisions from sydney test itself . and dude Alex i appreciate u r so called excellent idea : p <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 18:23 GMT <p> @moBlue .. Ya .. I could get that .. The story it tells is , this Aus is not the side which I saw growing up .. And it will never be in near future .. The arrogance and the confidence which I used to see in their faces is NO MORE .. Bt , any thinking captain ( even wid weak bowling options ) would hv put India to bat given the conditions .. Best way to put pressure on India is to ask them to bat in seaming conditions on the FIRST day of the tour .. I do n't mean to say Indians will fail in that case .. Bt , it puts pressure on Indians than to ask them to bowl .. Dhoni would hv taken this decision wid big Smile .. : ) ) <p> DravidPujaraGravitas on December 26 , 2011 , 18:20 GMT <p> @LillianThomson , two blatantly wrong dismissals ? ? ? Those were marginal and they can go either way . That 's the beauty of this game as it was invented - A great game of great uncertainties played by gentlemen . You take those and walk back instead of foul mouthing all and sundry . But somehow down the line somewhere the zeal to win at any cost shown up its ugly head and we just lost track that this is a great game with great uncertainties . We stopped enjoying the game for what it is meant to be . Next , there was only one blatant dismissal that was denied - that of Haddin 's . That was plumb . It was India who were at the losing end because of that blatant howler by the umpire , yet again . Aussies should have been allout by now . Australia should consider themselves lucky that Haddin is still there and the scorecard reads 277/6 instead of 260/10 . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 18:04 GMT <p> The Indians appeal in such an extreme way in unison it makes umpires unsure of themselves . The manner they do it is excessive . I am sure the " Indian Board " know this and realise that they will get a negative results if they used the system . <p> I believe everyone behind the wicket knew that Hussey did not hit the ball ( I did not see the Cowan wicket so I can not judge ) . Fine them $100,000 each . <p> Likewise fine a batsman who does not walk if he hits it and gets caught . <p> Maybe we should look at dropping India from World Cricket and watch the uproar .... the only reason the ICC does not stand up is that the BCCI line their pockets with gold . This is a fair system , and it will take the majority of dodgy decisions out of the game . For those who are saying Hussey hit the ball - invest in some new glasses - the ball was two inches from the bat . <p> DravidPujaraGravitas on December 26 , 2011 , 18:03 GMT <p> UDRS - Unreliable Deplorable Review System . Oh , wait a minute . Dravid supports it . So , as his fan , I too will support it : ) . What a shame that people are so myopic that not realising that they are supporting a non-standardised system , they are accusing BCCI of bullying and Indian fans as misinformed ignorants fed by Indian media . Little do they realise that a system can not be certified as accurate by just basing on popular vote but by verifying it in detail . Let us not get into that unfounded whining mode of the ' informed ' which does n't help us ' ignorants ' understand how you guys have tested it 's accuracy . Let us discuss about UDRS , comprehensively , in its present format , its technological components , and see how it is valid and reliable . For the starters , what happens after the 2 reviews are exhausted ? ! @IndiaNumberoUno and moBlue , ca n't tell you how much I agree with both of you . Absolutely spot on . <p> hussainiiiii on December 26 , 2011 , 18:00 GMT <p> Good day for both teamz .. but i must say bad bad umpiring . Bad umpiring also make it india 's day . ICC must appoint big umpires like Aleem dar or Tony Hill in these big matches . ICC wake up . <p> Kiap on December 26 , 2011 , 17:57 GMT <p> Ed Cowan 's 68 is NOT the highest score by an Australian opener in his debut Test innings since 1983 . <p> Marcus North scored 117 on 1st innings debut in the first Test at the Wanderers in 2009 . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 17:56 GMT <p> Certainly Hussey received a rough one . Cowan , I am not sure . Haddin appeal went against India . So why no mention of Haddin LBW . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 17:54 GMT <p> My questions .. 1 . Why limit number of reviews .. ? ? 2 . Why use Umpires. ? ? Ask for their opinion first and then challenge it. ? ? 3 . Why there is no Uniformity in DRS .. ? ? No , I do n't mean the usage of DRS .. Some boards who ca n't afford for all technologies r given choice to pick their own .. Why so. ? ? Where is the uniformity there. ? ? 4 . Why no consistency in DRS results. ? ? In England , even whn the DRS supports on field umpire call , why is it overturned. ? ? 5 . Wt makes hotspot and hawkeye as benchmarks for perfection. ? ? Simply coz it is non-human. ? ? 6 . Why blame BCCI for ur own board 's incompetency. ? ? I mean , wt makes them to bend and lay down to BCCI ( as many of u state here ) .. ? ? DRS supporters. , any1 dare to answer .. ? ? <p> cyniket on December 26 , 2011 , 17:43 GMT <p> I 've been dreading india 's visit for precisely these reasons . no drs , inevitable controversy , and , most of all , their legion of moaning one-eyed followers . makes the whole process so painful even though we always win . ca n't wait til we 've won ( again ) and they 've gone . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 17:38 GMT <p> India = controversy ( DRS &amp; Hot Spot ) ridiculous <p> PBs09 on December 26 , 2011 , 17:32 GMT <p> Ok let 's forget about the DRS debate for a minute and think about this however , if the system was indeed set up to eliminate the howler , then why not just use the simple and inexpensive " television replays " ? ! Eliminates the howler ! <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 17:31 GMT <p> Ed Cowan is right , ICC has to take a uniform decision on UDRS across the series . We all know the deficiancies of UDRS and it was evident in England tour of India but it has to be uniform across all series . Let us fans atleast hope for few umpiring errors like today ( includes Hussey 's and Ed 's ? ! ? and Brad Haddin 's LBW ) instead of blunders like 2007 Sydney where umpires did not even refer key decisions to 3rd umpire . <p> cricketisagame on December 26 , 2011 , 17:24 GMT <p> @ jmcilhinney , well Mr. Physicist ... would you be please kind enough to explain why then the heat sensing technology is a part of DRS ? I am not telling that DRS has bug but my point is that its not foolproof and when you have a technology that is not a foolproof , why you spend millions of dollars to implement it ? Why cant we accept the umpire 's decisions like we did throughout the cricket history ? If we have to implement the technology with millions of dollars , then it must be foolproof and serve fairly for both batsmen and the bowler . We have already experienced the Hot spot , sniko and hawk eye went wrong with the rules like 2.5 meters for example . <p> bigjai on December 26 , 2011 , 16:58 GMT <p> Why are Aussies crying over DRS thing . They knew it from start that DRS is not going to be used and they agreed to it , so why this fuss now ? ? They should take it in a sportsman spirit and not complain about these things . Regarding the reaction of Mr. Hussey on being given out , Ian Chappel very rightly said - would a batsman give similar reaction if he is given not out , and if he knows it very well that he is out ? ? <p> nikhilw on December 26 , 2011 , 16:52 GMT <p> @Henrik Lov ? n : The indian team refuses to accept DRS because it is not conclusive . See various examples during India 's tour of England where the hotspot did not show for genuine edges . To your point ( which is baseless btw ) , it is unreasonable and irresponsible to accept a technology which is not 100% to override an umpire 's decision on the ground , delay the play and override a neutral system which has worked for centuries . <p> bolerocf on December 26 , 2011 , 16:46 GMT <p> Does the MCG pitch crack on the 4th and 5th day ? <p> Nampally on December 26 , 2011 , 16:38 GMT <p> India had a great chance to get the Aussies out under 250 but for Dhoni 's tactless captaincy ruined India 's chances . If he wanted any defensive tactics it should be sensible - like bowling to Siddle with a deep point &amp; a deep third man , for edged shots of Yadev . Changing ZAK after he took 2 wkts in 2 balls &amp; replacing him with Ashwin , simply does not add up.Is Dhoni mentally fatigued ? Clearly it was a sporting wicket where real pace succeeded as opposed to medium pace , as shown by Yadev . After all the hoopla , Ishant was a non factor . Only consolation was he did not walk out crippled.It was understood that ZAK is working his way back to full fitness &amp; he did bowl steadily within himself &amp; captured 2 Wkts.India need to finish the Aussie tail fast to restrict them to &lt;300 . Indian openers should give India a good start to put up a total which negates the disadvantage of batting in the fourth innings.Not withstanding Dhoni 's blunders , India had a good day at MCG . Good Luck Indian batsmen ! . <p> AvidCricFan on December 26 , 2011 , 16:38 GMT <p> Why is commentary as well as live telecast not showing ball speed ? I hardly see ball speed in this game . <p> TRAM on December 26 , 2011 , 16:38 GMT <p> I am watching cricket since early 70 's ... Todays game = Sub-standard bowling , sub-standard batting and sub-standard umpiring ! ! One in 10 ball will be a good line and length , mostly short /wide when full balls were the need ... defensive fielding , pathetic ground fielding ( zaheer , Sewahg ) ... in spite of that Aus lost 6 wkts , with umpire contributing with his " umpiring-uncertainty " ... Horrible to watch . Except the media hype , all are low standard . Those who enjoy the " score fluctuations " and those who have their " heros " play will always enjoy of course . <p> SaneVoice on December 26 , 2011 , 16:32 GMT <p> What defines a howler ? It is a decision which can be clearly seen on tv replays . A faint nick that ca n't be caught on replays ca n't be termed as a howler . Frankly , do we need Hot-spot and hawk-eye to eliminate howlers ? What is ICC really upto ? They keep saying that we need all this technology to eliminate howlers ! Really ? Whether 75% ( or whatever ) of the ball pitched outside leg is a howler ? <p> In England they relied upon snicko to give batsman out when hot-spot showed nothing . Howlers are not feather-nicks that even hot-spot finds it difficult to spot but a clear inside edge ( visible through normal TV replays ) onto pads given as an LBW . <p> Never seen such lack of common sense in a professional sport as old as Cricket ! Sad ! ! Very Sad ! <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 16:27 GMT <p> DHONI is Too defensive at 214/6 , offered too many easy singles &amp; keep strike rotating . Why keep deep point and squre leg for Siddle ? He should have gone with short cover &amp; short midwicket and attack more . Also if two decision were gone India 's way then Brad Haddin 's LBW in the 87th Over bowled by Zaheer is also very crucial . So it 's a poetic justice at the end of the Day . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 16:25 GMT <p> It 's amazing to see India continuing to get lucky in tests without the use of UDRS . I think there should be 2 sets of statistics/records for the game : one with UDRS and another one without it . <p> ChrisP on December 26 , 2011 , 16:23 GMT <p> @cricketisagame It is due to those incorrect decisions that UDR was set up . I would caution raising one instance when there are a myriad of others that have gone against all countires and we all know of the umpiring efforts in India prior to neutral umpires . So let 's leave that side as it will open up a huge can of worms and let 's just discuss the merits of technology and why it is n't being considered when it has shown far greater consistency and margin of correctness that tne human eye.And given the elite panel of umpires have unanimously endorsed it , I ca n't see any valid reason why it should n't be used . <p> zesh92 on December 26 , 2011 , 16:18 GMT <p> for all those people who are criticising DRS must listen that when umpire are umpiring there 's 90% decision will be correct and when we use DRS almost 95% decision will be correct and BTW nothing is perfect in this world so there might be some flaws in it.and it will also reduce pressure on umps as well . so I prefer DRS should be used and should be mandatory <p> cricketcrazy555 on December 26 , 2011 , 16:15 GMT <p> Indian test team fielding standard is very very poor <p> MeraBharatMahaan on December 26 , 2011 , 16:14 GMT <p> I am surprised to see most of the indians openly supporting the withdrawal of UDRS and efending against poor umpiring decisions . They were the first ones to go overboard and use verbal abuse when few decision went against India earlier . The saddest part is Sachin tendulkar . Shame on Sachin for working against UDRS for his selfish reasons . He has become a disgrace to this gentleman 's game and cricket ethics/spirit unlike our great Dravid . <p> truebleuecricfan on December 26 , 2011 , 16:13 GMT <p> I think Hussey was unlucky for sure . Not sure about Cowan . DRS is definitely useful when there is a big gap between bat and ball , as in Hussey 's case . Not too sure about it usefulness when there is a feather touch that isnt picked up by hotspot or snicko . And Hawkeye definitely is at best an approximation of the ball 's trajectory . I do nt think it serves the purpose of giving out a correct decision . I believe it is best to use DRS without hawkeye in every series , but its usage must be selective . For example , in Cowan 's case , DRS would not have shown any snick , but everyone believed there was an edge . In such cases , the umpire 's original decision should stand . The right or wrong of the desicion should not come into picture and the batsman or bowler should take it sportingly , as in the pre DRS days . <p> cricketcrazy555 on December 26 , 2011 , 16:08 GMT <p> India should have take 2 or 3 more wkts today , I am not impressed with Mr. Dhoni 's captaincy today specially after 6th wicket . should have attack more . <p> meursault on December 26 , 2011 , 16:05 GMT <p> @India NumeroUno : Where 's the flawed logic in presuming that of two umpires with equal skills and experience , the one with access to multiple replays , slow-mos and the pause button has a better chance of getting it right than the one who has to do it all on only a first , live impression ? If replays were useless , why have viewers and players alike been looking at them to see what happened for many years ? Your plea for educated , rational comments is somewhat ironic . <p> GreenTeam-Elite on December 26 , 2011 , 16:05 GMT <p> Why India is against DRS ? ? ? Can Someone Answer ? ? ? <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 16:03 GMT <p> It 's deeply regretful even for me , an Indian , that Hussey and Cowan were given out incorrectly . I , however , still oppose DRS . I feel , an increased role of the third umpire and the right to ask for a simple replay is required . Moreover , the third umpire should take responsibility ; meaning , a decision ( or lack thereof ) should be monitored individually by the third umpire ( or get two , for that fact ) . That , I feel , should solve most of the problems . Regarding doubts , the benefit of doubt should n't go automatically to the batsmen , but the it should be seen individually . Seriously , just two things - increased role for third umpire , and slow-mo replays - could well put an end to this elongated debate . Again , I feel it 's unfair on the players who are victims of wrong decisions , but till a better system is devised ( not DRS in its current form ) , I think fans should n't make a big deal of it , whether it be Sydney 08 or today . FYI , SRT has been given out incorrectly on 99 , vs Eng @ Bristol , 07 . <p> VijayPS on December 26 , 2011 , 15:58 GMT <p> Good luck to all those who want to wait until the technology gets 100% foolproof cos that is never going to happen . No matter how advanced it gets , there is always going to be some amount of error in it . What we need to appreciate is that 1 . In spite of its flaws , it gives more accurate results than human empires , 2 . If it errs , usually those decisions are so close that they could have gone either way , which is acceptable , 3 . It eliminates glaring howlers like Hussey 's wicket which are unacceptable . <p> Deepak on December 26 , 2011 , 15:56 GMT <p> Seems like a biased match report to me . I watched each and every ball . " Shrewd &amp; opportunistic indian bowling " Wow . That 's sadly a supreme mis-representation of the Indian bowling . How about " smart &amp; balanced " . Another thing - you did n't mention anything about Haddin 's wicket that could have been . He was plumb lbw and would have been given in DRS . And Cowan was clearly out ; the " hot-spot " turned cold . So , in all fairness , it was only 1-1 for the DRS vs. umpires . Please be fair , Daniel . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 15:56 GMT <p> @cricketisagame ... the use of udrs would atleast minimise the wrong umpiring calls.who cares if it is fullproof or not .... <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 15:39 GMT <p> @johnnybox .......... It 's shame that people point out only when some thing goes India 's way <p> ansram on December 26 , 2011 , 15:37 GMT <p> India let slip a golden chance of bundling out the Aussies for 250 by choosing defensive tactics at the wrong time . This might cost them the game or at least a first innings deficit . Hope they get Australia under 300 then they are still in the game . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 15:35 GMT <p> What was so opportunistic about India 's performance today ? If two incorrect decisions against Australia and one against India makes it opportunistic cricket by Indians , then there is a whole world of derogatory adjectives one can think of for the history of the game , especially the Australian brand . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 15:35 GMT <p> @johnnybox ........ its shame that people point out only when something goes India 's way . <p> shishirji on December 26 , 2011 , 15:31 GMT <p> some of the aussie fans cribbing about fairplay ....... look who 's talking ! ! ! ! ! ! <p> jmcilhinney on December 26 , 2011 , 15:28 GMT <p> I 'm a DRS supporter but it 's not being used in this series so that 's that . In the days before DRS we would have just had to live with the decisions that were made on the field today so this is no different to that . I feel for Hussey but I bet the same fans that are complaining loudest about his being given out are the same ones who were calling for him to be dropped for this test anyway . By their logic , he would have been out soon after anyway so what 's the difference ? It is kinda funny though that Hussey lost a chance to make good for his recent poor form due to what I consider to be an umpiring error and Haddin received a chance . All teams have had their fair share of calls go for them and against them anyway . If your team is really so much better than the other then they will win anyway . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 15:25 GMT <p> It 's quite childish to assume how BCCI would react to one such poor decision against Sachin or Sehwag - All cricketers in the world have had poor decisions ; Sachin has probably had more of those than any one else , and they 're experienced enough to take it in their stride . It 's only when things go ridiculously wrong like the Sydney test last tour that the BCCI makes a big deal about things , and rightly so . <p> SmellyCat on December 26 , 2011 , 15:18 GMT <p> Do nt know why DRS is made such a big issue .. its the same for both the teams - use or no use . There was cricket played with technology and no one complained . The author clearly biased in his analysis .. clearly missed the Haddin was plumb but did not recount that . <p> Just get on with it .. you wont have job without India being such a powerful business center and cricinfo 's main ad revenue coming from the sub continent . <p> Not sure if this post will be approved .. <p> Wefinishthis on December 26 , 2011 , 15:17 GMT <p> Well said about Shaun Marsh hyclass , although to be consistent with my selection philosophy , he has been performing for Australia and he should not be dropped until he starts consistently underperforming. moBlue , with Hilfenhaus and Siddle in the side , India must be favourites for the series . With regards to the DRS , what they 're doing with sheild games where the 3rd umpire can quickly review and correct the decision before the next ball is bowled is a brilliant idea and works fantastically . It 's definitely the way forward providing that Hawk-Eye , Snicko , Super-slo-mo and Hot-Spot can be available for all series since they are all fallible , but together they make a very good case for a correct decision . <p> kiranphy on December 26 , 2011 , 15:17 GMT <p> it would have been more furstrating for AUS if there was drs because hussy anyway out of form and not going to score but thye could have lost siddle as well because drs and who knows they might have been i worst condition <p> vishx on December 26 , 2011 , 15:17 GMT <p> Hussey was unlucky , but it was a great delivery from Zaheer . Cowan looked out . Haddin ( and possibly Siddle ) , on the other hand , was lucky with the LBW . So it evens out . Both boards agreed not to use technology . Those are the playing conditions for this series . Players on both sides should get on with it and not whine when the odd decision goes against them . Yes , a bad decision can shift the momentum or even decide a series . But that 's the way it is . Cowan looks like he 's here to stay and so does Yadav . Dhoni should have attacked a bit more in the last hour . It looks like a good batting wicket . This is going to be a closely fought series . <p> sandeep1978 on December 26 , 2011 , 15:16 GMT <p> And if it had been India who had invented the DRS and implemented it , everyone else would then have said that it was deliberately bought in to help india 's weak bowling attack to get wickets with marginal LBW decisions.Otherwise how will they get 20 wickets , and so on and so forth.India should know that off the field nowadays they will always be criticised.IPL is a crime but the BIG BASH is not bashed . Now , of course , if they agree to UDRS , it will be said that it will be cuz they r scared of sachin getting a howler on 99 . <p> vertical on December 26 , 2011 , 15:15 GMT <p> @cricketisagame technology is never full proof why do you think all those boeings keep coming down . The point is DRS is good enough and should be used.Rejecting a solution because it does not solve the problem completely is a logical fallacy. -- IND fan <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 15:12 GMT <p> DRS : A foolish system to ruin dignity of the game . We have been playing , enjoying the game and accepting the umpire 's erroneous decisions at times .. But when this non-reliable technology system comes into picture umpires lost the confidence which they used to have years back . People commenting justice is not good for game 's existence . winning or losing is part of the game and we need to enjoy with the existing norms rather than believing and depending on technology . Already the decisions like 20-20 , power-play , only 2 bouncers etc. , have screwed up the essence of the game . <p> Romenevans on December 26 , 2011 , 15:08 GMT <p> Is there a button on my TV remote which i can use to mute only when Wasim Akram starts with his rubbish commentary ? I mean , this guy is always trying to find something to say against India . Why they hire a Pakistani in an India Australia series . His English is terrible and he have no idea what 's he 's talking about . Ian Chappel asked him about how to bowl reverse swing with old ball and he was answering about how to swing a new ball . I mean He is pathetic and biased when it comes to talking about India . Indian 's are down ... No energy ... ( Of course after a 6 over spell a fast bowler will get tired LOL , What a joker ! ) Bowlers should run-in hard ... i used to do this , that blah blah ... Common we do n't want to hear what you used to do Wasim .. Get a break dude , please ! <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 15:06 GMT <p> Why is Sachin being blamed for India 's refusal to accept UDRS . It is because UDRS is not fool proof and there is the possibility that it can be can be manipulated . People still ca n't believe how Sachin escaped the lbw decision against Ajmal in the world cup semi final and no technology in the world can convince Ajmal and the Pakistanis that Sachin was not out then . There are sinister theories floating around about that decision and how it was manipulated so the Australians need to respect the decision taken by India and accept it . Why do you want to force it on another nation ? If there are going to be changes the Asians will get involved and England and Australia have to accept their concerns with grace . Is that not what sportsmanship is all about ? Level playing field and all that jazz . And Sachin is an important player like your Don Bradman was . You have to accept that and not live in the past . Cricket is no longer the personal preserve of England and Australia . <p> sandeep1978 on December 26 , 2011 , 15:05 GMT <p> I agree with what people say abt UDRS needing to be used but i also think UDRS tends to create more bad blood between teams sometimes . Ex . England , where Broad checked Laxman 's bat for vaseline , which really pissed off many of us.It somehow brings allegations of cheating into into the picture , whereas in case of umpiring decisions it is put down more to luck . And abt sachin being given on 99 to a howler , we r used to him getting howlers for 20 yrs . <p> Momanno1 on December 26 , 2011 , 15:04 GMT <p> If Hussey gets dropped it will a travesty of justice . To get out when you clearly did not hit the ball , then then chopped from the team is a damn disgrace . Just on the DRS- either every team uses it for every match , or no one uses it ever . For India to be above the law whenever they feel like it is insulting to the rest of us cricketing nations . And for the record , I 'm an Aussie . <p> DrNasir .. on December 26 , 2011 , 15:03 GMT <p> is it indian strategi to not use one of the best umpire ( aleem dar ) in their own matchs ..... wat is hapening in international crickt 3 best umpires ( DAR .. RAUF .. ND TAUFEL ) are not standing in recent on going matches ... SA .. SL nd INDIA .. AUS .... <p> realitycheck27 on December 26 , 2011 , 15:03 GMT <p> what nonsense why was dravid given out incorrectly in england more than couple of times when hot spot failed to pick up and nick still he was given out so how is drs effective and had we had drs in 2007/08 series that sydney test would have been won by india i do nt see anyone talking about that crickinfo do post this <p> realitycheck27 on December 26 , 2011 , 15:02 GMT <p> what nonsense why was dravid given out incorrectly in england more than couple of times when hot spot failed to pick up and nick still he was given out so how is drs effective and had we had drs in 2007/08 series that sydney test would have been won by india i do nt see anyone talking about that <p> Shrewd and opportunistic ? ... Very biased in reporting .... I wonder whether the same would be written if Australia were to get a few fortunate dismissals . <p> cool2cool on December 26 , 2011 , 14:42 GMT <p> 1 Not sure about Cowan , but Hussey was definitely unlucky , but what 's the fuss about it ? So many horrible decisions were made against India during 2007-08 , 2003-04 and 1999-2000 tours and those were supposed to be the " part and parcel " of the game that time , then what not today . India will definitely be at the receiving end again ( already got one back ) , but it will again be " part and parcel " of the game . 2 UDRS is to use as per the mutual agreement between the two teams . India is against UDRS because it is error prone . England did manage to change India 's mind during India 's ( horrible ) tour of England and the sub-set of UDRS was available for that series . If Australia is in favor of UDRS , why they did n't force India to use it during this series ? May be Australia is little cautious seeing the how bowlers were benefited in SA . So why blame India alone ? <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 14:34 GMT <p> Good news is ZAK &amp; Ishanth are in good state ... <p> amitgarg78 on December 26 , 2011 , 14:22 GMT <p> @henrik Just in case you forgot , that ( introduction of 3rd umpire ) was nearly 2 decades ago . What has this got to with DRS in its current form ? I do n't think I have ever heard ppl complain about the use of third umpire . But that 's human too ! <p> Why do sm ppl feel the urge to implicate sachin in this talk on DRS ? He is not a fan of it and I believe , is well entitled to a view like you and I are , except that it is bound to be more informed than a normal tv viewer . Human errors are fine with me , but technology needs to be accurate at all times else what 's the point ? Is n't this how the game has always been played ? Just accept the umpires call and get o n with it ! <p> If any Indian player gets a wrong decision , at least no one can blame technology for it ! <p> VenkatGowrishankar on December 26 , 2011 , 14:18 GMT <p> Why is it that nobody talks of the brad haddin LBW shout off Z. Khan . It was plumb and hit him on the back leg . That 's how the game is played , you get a few in your way and you get some against- The game is a great equalizer . If you want uniformity and blah blah , then lets discuss all dismissals including the one 's that have gone in favor . Ed cowan 's was Out , just because HotSpot does not show mean he is not out . I feel bad for Hussey though , he got an absolute stinker of a decision . Another question , Why do you use DRS for Intl events only , it could help someone 's career in the domestic circuit by avoiding these kind of decisions . <p> i believe the third umpire is equipped with the snickos and the hawk eye ... y do u need hot spot ? i remember the time when the ICC had allowed referrals for an LBW .. i think it was 2002/03 the icc champions trophy in sri lanka was it ? nt quite sure ... we dint have hot spot then .. u think its an LBW just ask the umpire to consult the third umpire .. simple as that .. again the benefit of the doubt should go to the batsman ... the third umpire shudnt be there just for the run outs ... <p> Beertjie on December 26 , 2011 , 13:58 GMT <p> Posted by F on ( December 26 2011 , 09:37 AM GMT ) , please check the last Aus-India test at Adelaide 2008 before writing " Yet there was not a single test match in last ten years when an Indian Captain went on with five bowlers " . In that match Kumble had as his other bowlers : RP Singh , Sharma , Pathan , and Harbhajan ! But , of course , as you point out , he was a bowler ! <p> Full-Blooded-Wallop on December 26 , 2011 , 13:57 GMT <p> haha .. so aussies already looking for excuses ... <p> bigcheese on December 26 , 2011 , 13:56 GMT <p> Wow ! That was one helluva report . India benefited ( Zaheer to Huss ) from lack of DRS - mentioned twice but Australia benefited ( Zaheer to Haddin in 85th over ) from the same - NO MENTION ? ( A close LBW call ? ) that was plumb in front Mr.Brettig . What do we gain from this biased reporting ? Personal satisfaction , yes but is that all ? I would rather read Roebuckesque reporting with Integrity - only if I had a choice . <p> enigma77543 on December 26 , 2011 , 13:50 GMT <p> And the moaning &amp; whining begins ....... Well , personally , I do n't really care whether DRS is used or not because either way both teams still have the SAME probabilities of getting bad decisions ....... so why all the moaning when one or the other side gets the worse of it ..... after all , did n't Steve Waugh say that both teams have to play on the same 22-yard strip or something like that ? As for " putting pressure on umpires " , why ca n't the Aussies do it ? Afterall , Aussies have done not only that but WORSE , over the years ....... India has every right to refuse DRS if they want to but on the other hand , other teams have a right to refuse to play India without DRS so the other teams should try &amp; exercise that right ....... Do you think when Eng-Aus held sway back in the days that every other team got a fair shake ? ? ? ? ? We all desire more bargaining power than we actually have ........ but folks , life is unfair ....... so just get on with the game . <p> oranjizer on December 26 , 2011 , 13:47 GMT <p> Everyone who is fighting for DRS should ask themselves a few basic questions ... Was cricket played with such technology for all these years ? why in the first place was DRS thought of , was it due to bad umpiring ? If so who is responsible for improving the quality of umpiring ? If you are depending on a system which acts as evidence then do nt you want it to be foolproof ? How can you believe in a erroneous system when you cant believe the umpire ? " Go for the DRS but only if it is foolproof " isnt this a proper and valid statement ? ? How do you prove this wrong . the only simple thing i can think of is .. use third umpire replays .. if replays are sufficient to overturn then go with it , if inconclusive then carry on ... same as what we do for run-outs ! ! why need additional technology .. cant you live without it ? Still , if in future we can come up with a foolproof technology which will only reduce to a great extent the number of wrong decisions , then im too fine with accepting it . foolproof <p> Sano27 on December 26 , 2011 , 13:46 GMT <p> @Naresh28:well said dude .... supporting a team blindly is a good thing .... but we cant turnoff our heads against realities ..... guys like Randy OZ might understand this atleast from now onwards ..... ! <p> manav599 on December 26 , 2011 , 13:42 GMT <p> A very good Day 's Play here.The perfect test match . Great kickoff to the series . Fabulous debue for Cowan and amazing outing for Yadav.Couldnt expect anything better this boxindg day ( which also is my birthday-A perfect birthday gift for me by the two teams ) . This would have been it but for the DRS . So you see uniformity in DRS is so necessary . It is really dissapointing for the fans that some of their players could be not out against one openent but not the same in case of others . If there is no DRS at all , there wouldnt be much trouble accepting these umpiring errors . As of now , Day 1-Umpires put India on top a India 's stratergy of no DRS completely baffles the Australian batsmen . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 13:39 GMT <p> Two close decisions by umpires took away all the credit from the Indian bowlers . <p> SriniIndian on December 26 , 2011 , 13:38 GMT <p> @ jmcilhinney : Your comment makes no sense . If hot spot does n't detect , then there is no edge ? I ll explain you . Hot spot uses high power , resolution infrared cameras which picks up the light falling on the object and convert it to temperature variations . When the batsmen edge the ball , due to friction at the time of contact , the whitish mark appears . So when the batsmen faint nicks , there is not enough friction to produce the temperature difference and hence hot spot fails in detecting the faint nicks . The hot spot also fails when the day is very hot due to the above reasons . <p> avi82 on December 26 , 2011 , 13:36 GMT <p> After watching the day1 of 1st test I am sure the so called howlers like hussey 's decision could easily have been overturned by seeing the slow motion replays alone . You do n't need the expensive hot spot or hawk eye to arrive at that decision . Similarly in lbw decisions also if there is an inside edge it can most probably be detected by slow motion replays . This is the most cost effective solution at the moment . Remember the srilankan board does not even have money to give salary to its players , who will bear the additional cost of Hawkeye or hotspot . Also , even in the recently concluded India-England test series Rahul Dravid was given out twice based on replays even though hot spot could not detect any edge . <p> Alexk400 on December 26 , 2011 , 13:34 GMT <p> To counter BCCI refusal to allow UDRS , ICC must change rule so that batting team decide UDRS for their batting . That way no one care about BCCI decision . Please implement so aussies can have UDRS when they bat and BCCI do n't have UDRS when bat that way both can live with their decision ! . Excellant Idea ! <p> 12thUmpire on December 26 , 2011 , 13:34 GMT <p> BCCI would have no problems with DRS if there 's a provision on the number of referrals per innings - Two for India and zero for their opposition ! Also the Indian batsmen should decide when they are out , and their bowlers decide when the opposition batsmen are out ! That would reduce the pressure on umpires ; ) <p> DravidPujaraGravitas on December 26 , 2011 , 13:30 GMT <p> @IndiaNumeroUno , brilliant comments on DRS : ) ! But it seems Dravid supports DRS . So as his fan , I will also support it ; ) ... BTW , why would anybody call Hussey 's or Cowan 's as howlers ? Those are very close calls . In fact , Haddin 's was a howler . So , India lost a lot in this match till now because of that Haddin 's decision . Australia would have been all out by now if the umpire did n't come up with that howler regarding Haddin me thinks ; ) .. <p> Alexk400 on December 26 , 2011 , 13:30 GMT <p> I have come to a conclusion that Dhoni is not a good captain in terms of tactical stuff , he is just plain lucky . he loosen the noose many times on aussies . After lunch .. etc many instances he refuse to attack and played waiting game . Some people are always lucky . End is what matters . I think he will win this test if aussie do not score 400 runs . DHoni may not have tactical stuff but he is a greatest Man manager ever in history of sports . He is future coach of indian team . <p> SLBiggestJoke on December 26 , 2011 , 13:26 GMT <p> DRS or no DRS - Sachin is the most gifted cricketer the world has ever seen ! ! <p> Alexk400 on December 26 , 2011 , 13:25 GMT <p> I am 100% sure only indian fans against DRS are 100% sachin fans . I am 10000% sure of it . Only sachin need influence of umpires for him to be Not out . He can in India with BCCI help . I hope sachin fans do n't come and whine about how sachin give out blatantly to a ball he never knicked or ball go over stump etc etc ... Sachin is not GOD outside india . he is a selfish player for everyone other than sachin fans . People need to grow up . BCCI job is satisfy sachin needs so it gets public support and even govt support . So if BCCI against UDRS it is not them , they do not anything about cricket , it is what sachin wants . Sachin is kinda sneaky guy who score runs when no one seems interested . He is a oppurtunistic guy . He has been successful with his methods even at detrimental of the team interests . I am indian and i do n't mind sachin gets out to zero and to even umpire mistake . I wholeheartedly support it . <p> muthuthewaves on December 26 , 2011 , 13:23 GMT <p> technology should be 100% accurate . With the presence of drs india got three wrong decisions in england . Hot spots have 90-95% accuracy . We cant rely completely on snicko 's as well . In hawk eye we have prob with 2.5 meters rule and on field calls . When u apply a technology to reduce human error it should be 100% accurate . India never says that they do nt need drs but they need with 100% accuracy . <p> DravidPujaraGravitas on December 26 , 2011 , 13:18 GMT <p> @Karthik Raja , very well said . Agree with you completely ; ) These guys should first try to preach things to their boards . moBlue is also having a cracker of a time I guess ; ) Look at his ' analysis ' for Clarke electing to bat ! Mint ! ; ) <p> pikk0n on December 26 , 2011 , 13:12 GMT <p> On a side note , never have I seen so many Australian players in the ' Most number of Ducks since 2008 ' category . Was going through the list and it just gives me chills to see our middle order of Hussey , Ponting and Clarke being amongst the leaders . Then you 've got our tail of Johnson , Siddle and Hilfy leading the way . Basically , 6 walking wickets . Totally unheard of in the previous era . I suppose this gives justice to my low expectation every time our openers get dismissed . : p <p> Severian on December 26 , 2011 , 13:11 GMT <p> It is fascinating to see a leading cricketing country taking such a strong stand against the use of umpiring enhancement technology - DRS - while also making so little contribution to umpiring thru the Elite Umpires Panel , without which Test Cricket would cease . India has only ever had one umpire briefly on the Panel , none for the past 7 years , and is unlikely to have any in the near future . Perhaps the ICC should only assign neutral umpires to visiting countries whose umpires actually contribute to the international game . That will surely bring on a dramatic change to both the problems outlined above . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 13:06 GMT <p> Umesh bowled better than Zak and Ishant . Our opening bowlers would have been bowled better . Totally it is not a bad day for the indians . I do n't understand why MSD set defensive field setting for the seventh wkt . If we go for attacking even if the score 300+ with the lost of another 2 wkts we may clean the tails by tomorrow . Last WI tour tail enders continuosly irritated the indian bowling attack . India needs to be more careful in this . If we bowled aussies under 350 we need to bat well to put pressure on aussies . <p> Umesh and aaron would have included in the Eng tour itself . One thing is very clear Aussies top order looks fragile , if Zak fit for the entire series we have a good chance win this series . <p> Umesh impressive he needs to be more focussed and to avoid two many boundary deliveries . <p> The mixed results for the matches without DRS India lucky enough to get out Hussey and Cowan at the same time they missed closed LBW against Siddle and Haddin . <p> Vedahametham on December 26 , 2011 , 13:02 GMT <p> As per law of averages when umpires make mistakes both teams are almost always benefited equally . Technology is good to use but robotics make a lively game mundane . You can see with the automated systems and no-reply emails cluttering your in-box how much frustrating it is . We can experiment with technology with limited number of referrals per innings.Again giving a decision making capability to the rival captains with collective responsibility . Always leave the judgement to the human which is rather interesting . if Sachin is spared in a bad decision and imagine Ponting is also spared in a similar kind , wo n't you be witnessing the artistry of batting . Think it as if luck had it . Same as a fielder dropped a catch where as 99 out of 100 he would have caught it . Do you use technology when purchasing lottery tickets . Even with so many algorithms and lots of technology you lose in stock markets . To err is human and to forgive is divine . In my view we just named it that divine is also human <p> saumitra.marathe on December 26 , 2011 , 12:59 GMT <p> @Henrik Loven : I doubt whether it would affect Indian ckt mgmt if SRT was the first victim , while considering whether to support DRS or not . It may be commerce but surely not pro-Sachin behaviour . Sachin 's legacy will certainly not get affected by this , as far as I am concerned . It 's too trivial for his fan to even think abt it . However , as an Indian , it 's nice to see that we can now influence key ICC decisions as well , which may be difficult for others to digest , who are habitual of seeing them bending it their way .. Also , do you feel that Hotspot is foolproof ? ? <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 12:57 GMT <p> First day was very interesting while UMESH YADAV very impressive taking first 2 important wickets and other hand debut COWAN Played with patience and guarding one end . Ishant sharma bowled very well but unlucky to get a wicket and pointing still not able to complete century since last 2 years . Well , australian should not complaint about BCCI decision not accepting DRS for this series which cost them MICHEAL HUSSY and COWAN wickets , same thing will happen when INDIA will be batting tomorrow . Tomorrow India should bowled them out under 300-320 and bat for 2nd and 3rd day and make at least 500 runs which they are capable of doing with there strong batting line-up . <p> VinodGupte on December 26 , 2011 , 12:52 GMT <p> if AUS scores 350 , it is game ON . i have a feeling that IND will struggle on this pitch tomorrow . and IND needs to clean up the tail . they are letting siddle score too many important runs . 350 will be a fantastic total on this pitch . <p> nav84 on December 26 , 2011 , 12:51 GMT <p> cowan 's dismissal if anything proved what a farce hot spot and snickometer are . only an ignorant wld say cowan did not nick the ball . it was written all over cowan 's face that he was out . comeon aussies , stop whining . u r still in a pretty good position . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 12:49 GMT <p> its gona be a good contest between 2 good sides well best of luck to both countries and a great day for india go india a fan from PAKISTAN .... : - ) <p> A.A.N on December 26 , 2011 , 12:45 GMT <p> Two wrong decisions , yes , this is the part of game my dear , but why some people were complaining about the biased umpiring against India before the start of the series . You have to accept it , and not to show lame excuses about umpiring after loosing the match . <p> DravidPujaraGravitas on December 26 , 2011 , 12:41 GMT <p> I would want to believe what Ed said about his dismissal and feel sorry to Ed that he got a bad decision . Having said that , it was a close one but not a blatant howler ala Bucknor/Benson style . Ed Cowan also said , " umpiring decisions always change momentum in the game " . Thanks Ed for telling the obvious . People are lecturing me on how talking about umpires ' influence on this great game is nothing but giving excuses . Ed , I can completely understand how you must be feeling because I have not forgotten how India was n't able to close the game in 03/04 against your Champion side because of four 4th inning blatant howlers that kept on changing the momentum again and again and again and again . <p> ramli on December 26 , 2011 , 12:39 GMT <p> Blaming Dhoni for defensive captaincy is useless ... with **40;129;TOOLONG bowlers in your team ... what can you do ... you have to give sufficient rest to them ... you have to bowl Ashwin for longer spells with obviously defensive fields ... this is where India is missing an all-rounder ( like Kallis , Mathews , etc. ) ... till then .. be patient ... cheers <p> ramli on December 26 , 2011 , 12:32 GMT <p> India is NOT objecting to DRS just because Sachin says so ... Sachin has been erroneously ruled out without DRS any number of times ... it is not that ... India likes to be different and not willing to fall in line ? ? ? That is all ... cheers <p> sundar411 on December 26 , 2011 , 12:32 GMT <p> Absence of same DRS saved Haddin . Why Daniel has no comments on that ? ? <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 12:32 GMT <p> @jmcilhinney - I guess you were sleeping during the Ind -Eng series . There were instances where no edges showed even when the pro-England claimed it . Vaseline they said . I say that is utter rubbish . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 12:29 GMT <p> oh ... figured out it is india vs. australia going on in the discussion forum as well on DRS or is it india vs. the rest ! ! ! <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 12:27 GMT <p> This is quite funny . Every ozzie fan is whinning about DRS . Just give it a rest . The technology is not perfect , so are our umpires . If it isnt perfect , why use it ? Just give it a rest . Before you say we use it to improve it - I have a suggestion . Get Lyons to open the batting . His batting can also be improved by playing him under real test circumstances . He can be the next Ponting . Give it a try . It might just work . Take the glass half full approach and nuture him . Play him as a batsman to improve him . <p> MrBrightside92 on December 26 , 2011 , 12:21 GMT <p> It was ironic ( I think ) that watching the first session , there was a banner in the crowd enquiring about the whereabouts of Mr Bucknor . I am assuming it was related to Sydney 2008 ( I may be completely wrong ) , anyway , there were some poor decisions that went against India in 2008 , and reading these boards they 're still talking about it 3+ years later ! How do you minimise poor decisions ? DRS ! Does anyone want to completely rely on a guy over 50 who 's been standing in the sun all day ? Players make mistakes all the time and they 're professional sportsmen , usually in their 20 's ! No one is saying its perfect .... but it makes LESS WRONG decisions . Are the cameras for run outs 100% accurate ? No ... they aid the officials in minimising WRONG decisions .. We should n't be counting who it effects ... how do we know it 's 1-1 ? Through looking at the replays ? I just hope it does n't affect the series ... errr ... like the last time India were in Australia .... <p> Gupta.Ankur on December 26 , 2011 , 12:20 GMT <p> Wonderful day for India , frustrating to see tailenders build up a partnership in the end ... <p> As for DRS , aussies will do well to ask their own board as to why it agreed to a " home " series without it . <p> keshav021 on December 26 , 2011 , 12:18 GMT <p> Why is everyone complaining about INDIA not using DRS ? ? ? Its the same for everyone , dear aussies even india ca n't use DRS against their decisions and you have the same umpires when you are bowling as well .. so stop complaining and enjoy the cricket . If you are so worried about wrong decisions than get quality umpires .... if anyone has to be blamed than its the umpires who gave them out . Is their any rule in place for the umpires to not check with third umpire if they are unsure about the decision ? ? ? I 'm will wait and see how many will complain if indian batsman are giving OUT ... Finally talking about BCCI ... get into reality mates ... YOU HAVE POWER .. YOU RULE ... : ) : ) <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 12:16 GMT <p> why only Indians are against of UDRS ? ? What has BCCI has to say on it ? God Knows ! ! ! ! ! when will we see fair cricket ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Goshhh <p> SLBiggestJoke on December 26 , 2011 , 12:16 GMT <p> The way DRS should be implemented : <p> 1 . All components should be owned by ICC . Cost should be borne by all countries . <p> 2 . All DRS components/ equipment should be standardised . <p> 3 . There should be independent periodic verification/ assessment of all DRS components . <p> 4 . An " ICC DRS Wing " should be setup by ICC which trains umpires , engineers , technicians etc from different countries w.r.t the DRS technology , usage , rules etc . <p> 5 . The DRS Wing should produce multiple DRS " units " with each unit comprising of DRS tech , DRS engineers , DRS umpires etc . There should be enough " neutral DRS units " available to oversee international fixtures ( much like umpiring currently ) . <p> 6 . A DRS rulebook should be produced by ICC - downloadable by all . <p> frank2011 on December 26 , 2011 , 12:14 GMT <p> @Ian Walker - Ohh please ... Mike Hussey has a wonderful record of nicking the ball behind the wicket and standing his ground , waiting for the umpire to make his decision . Well Mike , the umpire made his decision today so you can go back to the dressing room and concentrate on your batting for the next innings ( or game ) . Besides , I reckon decisions like this evens things out . If Mr Incredible ( or yourself ) ca n't take it , well tough luck to you guys : " THATS CRICKET " . Get over it and get on with the game . <p> Okakaboka on December 26 , 2011 , 12:13 GMT <p> Geez . Some of you try to justify the non use of DRS because India received a bad call too . Some even claim Siddle was out plumb LBW . Durrr ! If it pitches outside the line it is n't out ..... um .... It pitched outside . Replay showed this ... oh .. woops you do n't believe in using the technology . How do you know Siddle or Haddin was out ? Did you study the replays ... oh dear ... but you used technology ? ? ? ? Around and around in circles we go . Okay : Hussey WAS NOT OUT - FACT ! Cowan WAS NOT OUT - FACT ! Haddin WAS OUT - FACT ! Siddle WAS NOT OUT - FACT ! The Earth ai n't flat ! ! ! ! ! Yes , and if your dear Sachin gets a dodgy call you will flood this forum with a flood of complaints . Send a message to administrators and tell them to stop high-jacking the game . Do you think the system used in tennis is flawed ... It is brilliant ... Stops a silly old fart making a clanger call that costs a player a match and maybe $500,000 ! I 'm a tennis coach .. at the tennis all the time and this system does NOT stuff up - ever ! ! <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 12:13 GMT <p> Good day for indians expecting yadav to be a bit more consistent <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 12:13 GMT <p> DRS - Damaged Life jacket . U can use it , but u cant save ur life .... <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 12:08 GMT <p> @maddy20 1-1 on the howlers ? might have been if it was the same batsman but i know who i would have chosen to still be out there ... anyways do both teams need to agree the use of DRS or does the ICC need to be involved . we have never had DRS before so these mistakes have been made for years ... however i think either they should all have it or all not have it to end this debate ... honours even i think ... <p> dunger.bob on December 26 , 2011 , 12:08 GMT <p> What I saw today for India <p> Yadav . Strong and snappy . Hit 150 a couple of times , averaged 143 . Move his designation up to " Fast " , drop the the " Medium " they had trailing it . Seemed to get extra bounce . Ian Chappel mentioned his rubbery wrists a few hundred times , and that would explain his ability to trampoline the ball now and then . The ball the really got Ponting was the ball before the one he nicked . Beautifully setup . He 's got a real box-head too , which is always a good trait in a quicker . I reckon Brett Lee would have got an extra 60 wickets if he was a bit rougher looking . <p> Ravi , the spinner . Yep , looks to be a spinner . That Rotator gimmick said he revs at 40 rps . Thats 33% higher than average according to the AIS or someone like that . Got a few to spit did n't he . Looks alright to me , but I did n't see any drift in the air either . Maybe later . <p> At the MCG the 2nd and 3rd innings usually cancel one another out , so the result comes down to whether the team batting last can outscore the first innings of the team batting first . So whatever Australia turns 277-6 into tomorrow pretty much equates to the target India must chase on day 5 . Or , to cut to the chase , while the second new ball is only 10 overs old Ishant and Zaheer need to knock over the last four wickets tomorrow before the score gets significantly over 300 . It 's currently pretty even , with 2 of Australia 's 6 specialist batsmen wrongly given out ( plus the keeper wrongly not given lbw ) . But the morning session tomorrow is crucial . For India , 290 all out will be fine . But 350 all out would be a disaster . <p> kabeag7 on December 26 , 2011 , 12:00 GMT <p> The report mentions on multiple occasions the wrong dismissal of Hussey but does n't state explicitly that Haddin would have been out if UDRS was there . Also " India 's refusal to accept the DRS also allowed the visitors to place pressure on the umpires Marais Erasmus and Ian Gould in the time-honoured style " , what is that supposed to mean ? BCCI is wrong to dismiss UDRS , but India have suffered as much as they have benefited from it . Why do people ( including Dan here ) keep insinuating as if there is a conspiracy to not use DRS and then pressurize umpires ? When India get bad decisions same people come and say that India ' deserved ' it and refuse to accept that at the end of the day , the umpiring errors usually even out . Very sly . <p> SaneVoice on December 26 , 2011 , 11:56 GMT <p> What defines a howler ? It is a decision which can be clearly seen on tv replays . A faint nick that ca n't be caught on replays ca n't be termed as a howler . Frankly , do we need Hot-spot and hawk-eye to eliminate howlers ? What is ICC really upto ? They keep saying that we need all this technology to eliminate howlers ! Really ? Whether 75% ( or whatever ) of the ball pitched outside leg is a howler ? In England they relied upon snicko to give batsman out when hot-spot showed nothing . Howlers are not feather-nicks that even hot-spot finds it difficult to spot but a clear inside edge ( visible through normal TV replays ) onto pads given as an LBW . Never seen suck lack of common sense in a professional sport as old as Cricket ! Sad ! ! Very Sad ! <p> sillypt on December 26 , 2011 , 11:55 GMT <p> Well , Hussey was not out , but from the view he got &amp; sound he heard , umpire could n't do better . Some will say that 's the best time to use the technology but it is n't full proof as we know from the experience &amp; also from Cowan 's case where there was a faint edge but hotspot was showing a mark on his thighs instead of bat which was anything but near to the ball . One can also refer to the Dravid 's last dismissal on English tour when hotspot showed no mark but Dravid later admitted to have got a faint edge . Numerous such instances can be showed . So there is no point in using a technology which is n't perfect . However I want ICC to take a lead on the decision of its use instead of playing boards , but before that it should address accuracy issue . Better place a committee involving technical experts to study its accuracy &amp; when it get 's accurate enough use it uniformly at your(ICC) own expense.Cricinfo publish . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 11:54 GMT <p> mr.snork do nt play favouratism we indians are always treat other country sportman with great spirit and pride.you could not forget and all the world could not even when india last played in australia symonds was out two times and steve buknor just closed his eyes against it . symonds went on making 145 runs to get good lead . this is not sportmanship . And today cowans was clearly out and hussey had slight knick which was showed in hotspot clearly . so please do not make unneccessary hassle in the midst of a healthy series between a friendly countries we respect Australia as much as we respect other countries <p> cricfanparag on December 26 , 2011 , 11:54 GMT <p> Where is Harsha ? Really missed his commentary . I think espnstar should provide channel 9 Feed rather than this boring commentary . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 11:52 GMT <p> a series full of bad decisions in 2007-08 but u took the win then , just a couple of bad decisions and you are whining already ...... poor poor aussies ...... so DESPERATE ! ! ! ! Ca n't digest the loss against the Kiwis eh ? And where is Phil we got swing bowlers and gully catchers too : P ! ! <p> If I recall correctly , Dravid was declared out by the 3rd umpire in England even though the evidence by Hot-Spot and Snicko showed otherwise . The umpire went by the sound that he heard as the ball passed the bat and not on the basis of the technology on offer . Here , the decision by the on-field umpire was overturned by the 3rd umpire . DRS is good , but ICC should make it very clear how it should be applied and not leave it to the umpires . I also agree with one of the opinions that the 3rd umpire should have the power to intervene and overrule any obviously wrong decision . For this to happen all technology evidence should be available as soon as possible and not after a couple of balls have been delivered ( the evidence from snicko seems to be a delayed one always ) <p> LillianThomson on December 26 , 2011 , 11:51 GMT <p> On a day like this , you notice the absent Big Guns - Cummins , Watson and DRS . What a shame that 277-6 is the artificial scorecard instead of 277-4 , thanks to two blatantly wrong decisions which would have been overturned against any other opposition apart from India . Millwall FC 's fans in London sing " Everyone Hates Us , We Do n't Care " , and if India keeps bullying everyone else into not having DRS they are going to have to adopt that song for themselves . Yet India 's fans try to ignore that everyone else uses and appreciates DRS . Are they trying to ruin their own reputation ? <p> AidanFX on December 26 , 2011 , 11:49 GMT <p> Hmm Ponting played well for about 60 - but looked sketchy early in the innings at times . Played some terrific pull shots ; but i do n't know he is an enigma at the moment . Obviously Ponting has made lots of scores of 50- 99 in his career - but the Ponting of old under those circumstance you expect him from where he was to get a big one ... the way he got out was a bit awkward and there were a few balls that stood out where he also looked awkward . Clarke on the other hand looked brilliant from ball until he was dismissed . He looked almost almost entirely untroubled and then he just got out . He is performing good with bat by and large but some of his dismissals are a bit lazy . Cowan looked good and solid ( almost Katich like ) . Oh and do n't get me started about the DRS - too angry right now as a spectator of this beautiful sport . <p> haq33 on December 26 , 2011 , 11:49 GMT <p> I fail to understand why India 's army of fans blindy defends the BCCI 's rejection of technology that the rest of the world accepts . It is cow-towing to the extreme , such exceptionism for 1 country is UNTHINKABLE in any other sport where no one team holds such a monopoly as India does in cricket , and it invites criticism on dodgy-decision-days like this - which will be EVERY day of test cricket until you accept the technology . It is only logical to follow the rest of the world on this issue , and it is also proven by facts that the extra technology improves decision accuracy overall . It is no good hoping that all the bad decisions simply balance each other out in Indian test matches , when other teams play tests with a higher accuracy of decisions that are better games of cricket as a result . Wake up Indian CRICKET fans and stop worshipping the BCCI . <p> spence1324 on December 26 , 2011 , 11:48 GMT <p> @Randyoz yeah mate there were 70000 people in the MCG today but were are the Australia 's , because it looks like a home test for india to me ha ha <p> SLBiggestJoke on December 26 , 2011 , 11:47 GMT <p> Funny thing is had it been CA or ECB against DRS then we would be hearing things like : <p> 1 . The umpire is mean to be trusted , that 's the basic tradition of the game . 2 . Technology is good but should be proven and standardised . 3 . All components of the technology must be verified by independent assessors . 4 . Brilliant stance by ECB/CA not to be pressurised into using technology , but making a informed and mature decision till the tech is proven worthy of implementation . 5 . The decision of the umpire is for both teams , just because there is no DRS does n't mean one of the teams is suddenly disadvantaged . <p> ... and so on : - ) ) <p> I mean they did ban bouncers from fear of West Indian bowling did n't they ? ! ! <p> shankarboysPalani on December 26 , 2011 , 11:46 GMT <p> The way Indians bowled today was exactly the same how the Spatans 11 played their game in KPL . Really happy to see that Zaheer is completely fit and this is the time for Acid test to Indian batsman . Let 's see how they handle the pressure . <p> mkamb on December 26 , 2011 , 11:44 GMT <p> my india always on beneficial side for wrong decisions , india in south africa series , australia in india , india in england.so its clear why india do nt want udrs <p> SLBiggestJoke on December 26 , 2011 , 11:41 GMT <p> @Hayden Jones : " The Hotspot used in Australia and India are different .

This is precisely one of the gripes with DRS ! ! ! ! <p> Why is it not STANDARDISED ? ! ! ! <p> ( sorry for capital letters .. but people seem to be deaf here : - ) <p> I 'm happy BCCI is taking a stance against DRS ( in its present form ) . <p> SLBiggestJoke on December 26 , 2011 , 11:37 GMT <p> @Snork : " Can you imagine if Sehwag &amp; Tendulkar were given out like Huss &amp; Cowan ? ? " We have seen enough of these over the years .. especially in Australia .. I think they still play in the spirit of the game - without sledging . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 11:30 GMT <p> Sachin Tendulkar was the first " victim " of upstairs umpiring and as long as he continues to play , India will persist with their unreasoned and irresponsible opposition . This also lessens the man and his legacy , which is a self-inflicted shame . <p> dunger.bob on December 26 , 2011 , 11:28 GMT <p> @moBlue <p> I just want to check that I 've got this straight . You 're saying that it would be easy for the crooks to pull a swifty with this technology , which the broadcasters usually also have access to as well but on a separate data feed ( there 's a rudimentary audit , in real time , right there I believe ) . They would have to achieve this without the third umpire noticing anything amiss by the way , because the third umpire runs the show up there . Presumably you 're talking about the crooks infiltrating the technical staff , not the actual umpire . Finally , the ball can be followed at around a thousand frames a second , so any sudden deviation should stick out like the proverbial you know whats . You ca n't simply deviate the ball willy nilly , you would have to substitute a completely different delivery . <p> Mate , at the end of the day would n't it just be easier to get to the players if you were interested in some skullduudgery . I understand what you are saying , but I ca n't agree with it all . <p> johnnybox on December 26 , 2011 , 11:23 GMT <p> It is a shame that India will only accept the review system when Tendulkar is incorrectly given out on 99 . <p> atthipatti on December 26 , 2011 , 11:19 GMT <p> @RandyOz ... There is a nice word that I want to give to HotSpot ... but the comment may go Godforsaken . I would rather have a human error than a technology erring . As for your hope of Sachin getting a howler on 99 , I would take it any day ! ! ! Would Prove SRT 's still the King of Kings ! <p> Marcio on December 26 , 2011 , 11:19 GMT <p> Have no idea why Clarke chose to bat in those conditions-.I said the only way India will win game in this series is if they bowl first on green pitch in the rain . Maybe Clarke knows something I do n't . Still 250-300 . Was always going to be a reasonable score in such conditions . If AUS make 350 it will be very good . Looks like the pitch is not going to flatten out as much as last years pitches , so AUS will be confident of getting a first innings lead here , ESP if the rain clouds hang round . <p> Aussasinator on December 26 , 2011 , 11:18 GMT <p> Should be an interesting test . <p> dariuscorny on December 26 , 2011 , 11:14 GMT <p> someone tell Dhoni , why 's he so defencive ? 214/6 spread the field Siddle-Haddin add 63 runs what was that ? he is been commiting thse blunders for a while now.Wht kind of benefit did India draw on previous occassions using these tactics , is a mystery.Just bring in the killer instinct into ur approach Dhoni ti will benefit India.please do listen.attack <p> dickyboy on December 26 , 2011 , 11:10 GMT <p> Randy oz one thing is for sure oz is a great multiple world cup winning team Unlike England who every one knows just won .

The people who support the DRS knows themselves that the system is not foolproof and we saw that in India-Eng series and few games in thw world cup notably Ind-Eng . If you do not have a foolproof system , why you need them . Cricket has been played for long time enough to accept the umpire 's decision until a foolproof technology comes into effect . People are quick to talk about the OUT decisions given to Aussie batsmen but not those not outs . No one even talked about how S.Bucknor helped Aussie save the series but all of sudden the one bad decision makes all big talks here . <p> SirViv1973 on December 26 , 2011 , 11:07 GMT <p> @RandyOz , Why bother bringing Eng in to this ? besides I do n't think your Maths is really up to it ! England has 9 test grounds with the following capacity 's Lords 28K , Edgbaston 25K , Rose bowl 25K , Oval 23.5K , OT 22K , Durham 19K , Leeds 17.5K , TB 17K , Cardiff 15.5 K , which is a total of 192,500 . I 'm no mathematician but i can quite clearly see this is a few more than 70,000 ! <p> SLBiggestJoke on December 26 , 2011 , 11:06 GMT <p> 1 . The statement " DRS is more accurate than human umpires " is based on flawed logic , since DRS itself is being used as the benchmark to verify &amp; quantify accuracy . Most people fail to grasp this simple fact . <p> 2 . Lots of Match referees have questioned the accuracy of certain components of DRS . Top of the list being HotSpot and Hawk Eye ( or should we say Cold Spot and Cataract ? ) <p> 3 . There is still no agreement on who pays the cost of using DRS . <p> 4 . DRS itself is not standardised and is subject to vagaries of local technology . <p> 5 . DRS components have not been verified , certified or have had any due diligence done by independent agencies . We have to take the word of the makers ( sellers ) of the technology at face value . <p> 6 . DRS rules are not clearly stated . Prime example is the 2.5m rule for LBW .. no one seems to know about this and when it was invoked there were challenges as to why 2.5m ? why not 3m or 3.25m ? <p> Please keep these things in view in order to give educated comments . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 11:04 GMT <p> @randyOZ , we do nt regret to getting out for a howler for sachin.Because there are many more nineties to come and go for sachin.Even Bradman might also got out for atleast one howler.Resulting that his average slipped to 99.94 without touching the feet.But thats the beauty of the game.Can you apply a DRS for footbal game . never time permits . Already while we are doing for five days , You are requesting a slot for around half a day for DRS . Just enjoy the beauty of the game . If you are still on DRS , just remove the field umpires , and we may see the each and every result at TV screen through off field umpires . <p> Siddiee on December 26 , 2011 , 11:01 GMT <p> @ Kavindeven - spot on , it 's inexplicable to set an in out field aginst an opponent who has lost its top order without many on scoreboard . <p> **30;171;TOOLONG on December 26 , 2011 , 10:57 GMT <p> It is much better performance by aussies batting as compared to the one against black caps . India have certain edge in batting due to Fab4. 277 is good score despite out sorts batting form and aussie response will improve through the series . If aussies bowling picks up then they can save this series easily . <p> hattima on December 26 , 2011 , 10:51 GMT <p> Haddin would have been given not out as the ' virtual eye ' was not working at that time because of ' light situations ' , and India would have lost a referral . If people want ' consistency ' , should n't we demand ' consistency ' in the performance of technology as well ? At least what happened was much fairer to both teams ! <p> NeoTheSaviour on December 26 , 2011 , 10:48 GMT <p> Being Indian fan , I can not understand why Indian players have got problem with DRS . You should be wise enough to use your reviews and it is definite help to everyone . But I must add , persons providing footage/pics to third umpire should also be neutral . In current age its not difficult to tamper with video footage and finally its only matter of 1 or 2 degrees this side or that side . ICC should make it compulsory in all matches . <p> LordDravid on December 26 , 2011 , 10:48 GMT <p> hang on ! ! ! clarke did say he either wants drs consistently to be used or dosent mind playing the old ways without drs .. so here we go we 're playing this series without it so whats the fuss ? ? i do nt believe in technology anyway look what happend with hotspot in england its soo unreliable .. cowan i think was out ! BUT good and bad decisions even out anyway so aussies stop moaning ! ! ! ! <p> trumpoz on December 26 , 2011 , 10:46 GMT <p> 1 howler against Australia 1 against India ..... I do n't care about people thinking ' it is fair , it balances out ' ..... the DRS is there to assist to erradicate howlers from the game . There were 2 terrible decisions today . The DRS would have allowed them to be overturned . TheICC needs to grow a set and not only madate the technology , but standardise the installation and use of the equipment at all grounds in the world so everyone has the same technology for every international venue . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 10:41 GMT <p> Surprised by the amount of support for the Cowan decision . The guy who said it was n't a howler is right , but it is the kind of decision that the DRS has helped be overturned . The Hussey decision was bad , though . And I must say it 's been another painful day of viewing for an Australian fan - our batsmen should n't have to fight tooth and nail to make 300 runs . Ironically the young blokes are the only ones looking like they know what they 're doing . Warner and Cowan are the goods . <p> CricketLover-SARU on December 26 , 2011 , 10:41 GMT <p> Mr. Micgyver ! I am sure you are not a cricket fan ! Because else you will not ask that question , as who INDIA think they are ? They r the SUPERPOWER of CRICKET . <p> CaptainOblivious on December 26 , 2011 , 10:39 GMT <p> If there 's any more bad decisions against the Aussies , they should have the umpire in question axed and threaten to cancel the tour . <p> AKmAK on December 26 , 2011 , 10:39 GMT <p> @Micgyver- Why that because without India in cricket it is popular only like rugby or netball .. Does any one cares ? ? ? ? ... that 's all . No need to bend to any technology unless it was proved cent percent accurate . Of course many accepted DRS , why coz they do n't have any other choice in all means . <p> jmcilhinney on December 26 , 2011 , 10:38 GMT <p> To those claiming that HotSpot is buggy and has been shown to be incorrect , I say rubbish . There are no bugs . HotSpot detects heat . It displays different temperatures with different shades of grey . If there 's no heat to detect then HotSpot ca n't show it . That 's not a bug . It 's the laws of physics . Also , the fact that there have been occasions that players are sure there was an edge and HotSpot did n't show it does not mean that HotSpot was wrong . More likely it means that there was n't an edge . In Cowan 's case today , I thought I heard an edge and that he was out but there was no evidence of an edge on standard replay , HotSpot or Snicko . That was just a mistake by the umpire , but certainly one that I can understand . Remember that HotSpot is a heat detector , not an edge detector . It 's more sensitive than an human umpire though . <p> allblue on December 26 , 2011 , 10:37 GMT <p> Another compelling day 's Test cricket , and most of the discussion here is about DRS . It 's a shame it has to be this way , but the cat 's out the bag now , the technology exists whether the umpires are using it or not and when clear mistakes from the on-field umpires are not corrected because DRS is not being used it leaves a bad feeling all round . It occurred to me reading the comments here that I am old enough to remember before we had neutral umpires in Tests . Back then every country had reason to feel hard done by on occasion , because even if not intentional , home umpires did tend to favour the home side . So now we have neutral umpires . Are they perfect ? No . Are they better than what was before ? Yes . I feel the same way about DRS . It 's not perfect , but it does prevent some errors so it is better for all concerned to have it than not . <p> Slysta on December 26 , 2011 , 10:32 GMT <p> Ow . India 's day in the end , and if Hussey and Cowan had some bad luck , it was poor dismissals from Ponting and Clarke that opened the door . I 'm afraid that for me , Siddle + Haddin = 63 runs in 22 overs = flat flat pitch , and Australia will need 350 this innings to keep the deficit manageable . India will score big in their first innings , and we will need to be disciplined in the second dig . Regarding UDRS : people are not comparing apples with apples . The cheap Hotspot technology in England is a farce : people need to understand that Australia is the home of these technologies , and that we do them far better than anyone else , because we spend the money . I loved that guy who said Cowan was " clean out " - what a joke . No actual evidence at all . And he knew he was n't out - he even started to call for the referral , until he remembered that he was n't allowed to ... <p> Wozza-CY on December 26 , 2011 , 10:31 GMT <p> Unlike many NZ supporters , I wo n't fall into the trap of condemning their team after one innings of a test match ( like they did after the 150 in Taz ) , but I feel the Ozis should be in a better position at the end of todays play . A lot of starts there without a big score could hurt us . There 's a lot to be admired about the way Ed Cowan goes about his work . A calm assured presence prepared to work hard for his runs is just what Oz needs right now . However , that angled bad causes him some trouble when the RFM comes around the wicket . He missed a couple &amp; inside edged plenty of them . A good debut though . The bounce in the wicket should keep Pattinson &amp; co interested &amp; just quietly I fancy Lyon to get a bag full . When India bowled well they runs were hard to come by , when they bowled poorly runs came fast , so a lot will depend on how our bowlers go . Hope the tail wags because we 'll need every run IMO <p> KissKiss on December 26 , 2011 , 10:28 GMT <p> I was at the ground so it may have been different on tv but I would have been very disappointed if I was an Indian fan . Despite the overcast conditions and first day pitch India appeared to be bowling well too short and wide . They rarely seemed to put constant pressure on the Australians who again got them selves out more often than not . On that pitch in those conditions India should already be batting <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 10:28 GMT <p> DRS needs to be used for all matches now , especially for something as obvious as Hussey 's dismissal today . Most people have gotten used to the DRS system and like the way it has changed the game . India are taking the glass is half empty approach to the technology because it can obviously save more trouble than it causes . What 's especially sad is that it had to be obvious to at least a few , if not all , of those fielders that Hussey did n't hit it . A shame that the series had to hit such a note on the first day of the series but almost inevitable against India it seems these days . <p> rahulcricket007 on December 26 , 2011 , 10:27 GMT <p> @kavin davan . agree with you . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 10:25 GMT <p> Where are the two best Umpires of todays Cricket , Aleem Dar and Asad Rauf ? . They both should be there for this series <p> Naresh28 on December 26 , 2011 , 10:23 GMT <p> @RandyOz - TRY TO BE A BETTER FAN . You kept writing Indian team off . Now you will have to eat your words . Every team should be respected even a minnow can derail your team on their day . Okay India does not have fantastic bowlers but they do give the opposition a go every now and then . Its called respect . The game is still young . India still has to take your tailenders out and then batters face the music . Just enjoy a good game between two top class teams . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 10:23 GMT <p> typical india going back 20 years , they do nt like something so they have a cry and get their way .. the DRS is obviously correct to have in test matches , typical that in the first game ( with australia ) with no DRS that the umpires make horrid calls and guess who has to cop them .. ? if there is still such concern about hawkeye or eagleeye or whatever the stupid name they want to call it , how about this for a proposal : a batsman is not allowed to question an LBW simply to see if the umpire is right , the batsman MUST cop the call , if a batsman nicks one onto his pads and is given out he can tell this to the umpire and then have it referred , but the projection of the ball is not referred .. after all , that is the point of DRS isnt it ? to eliminate the howler .. close calls with LBW are a part of the game , but being given out caught when you did nt hit the damn thing is a joke , so DRS is the smart option .. <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 10:21 GMT <p> I am not a supporter of BCCI 's firmness on DRS but it 's funny how people reason out DRS for Australia 's backstage at the moment . There is almost the same chance for both teams . In fact Haddin got one lucky break with LBW turned down of Zaheer . What about that ? ? ? All Indian batsmen also have the same chance of getting out or let-off as Aussies . <p> kantipur on December 26 , 2011 , 10:19 GMT <p> You know BCCI do n't want DRS because they gets most of the decision . In the series against West indies india got decision even when bowler did n't appeal to the surprise of the bowler . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 10:16 GMT <p> now its umpire mistake and badluck to australia and i wonder what if 2 INDIANS batsman were given out like that ... both the umpires would ruled out from the series : ) GREAT ! <p> Shivh on December 26 , 2011 , 10:16 GMT <p> @rust01 : Hotspot is not flawed ? ? ? I think you have not seen India-Eng test match in Eng . There was one incident of Dravid , if I am not wrong , where in hotspot did not show anything but third umpire believed he was out and was given out . Everybody , including me , agreed that there was a nick . There was a definite sound which was clearly heard . Having said that , use of technology debate should be reached to a conclusion and should be made consistent in all series . <p> g.narsimha on December 26 , 2011 , 10:15 GMT <p> Same old story unable to cotain the tail , how ever not a bad day for us , particularly , we always struggled in tour opener , yadav 's bowling is a treat to watch hope he prove the critics wrong , its also a huse disopointment to our friends , who as usual were dreaming of our humiliation , if we finish the tail early in the morning we will have a chance in this match <p> muthuthewaves on December 26 , 2011 , 10:11 GMT <p> @randyoz do nt cry . India are not worse than aussies take 2008 sydney test as instance . Aussies need retired steve bucknor as umpire to win or they will be getting thrashed like today . Ponting and clarke had no clues on their wicket deliverys . Senior players struggling against mediocre bowling ( according to aussies ) . Wait and see ZAK IS BACK . <p> atuljain1969 on December 26 , 2011 , 10:11 GMT <p> as expected , India allowed Ponting to regain his form and another of India 's inability came to fore , that is to get the tailenders bowled out in short span . India was in a dominant situation when 6th wicket had fallen , but allowed Australia to end the day without any further loss . If australia scorees more then 350 tomorrow , then ball will in India 's court to save this match . <p> DravidPujaraGravitas on December 26 , 2011 , 10:06 GMT <p> Let me repeat - If Zaheer and Ishant are fit this is going to be 1-0 to 2-0 in favour of India . If they are not fit , it is going to be 2-0 to 3-0 in favour of Australia . Fingers crossed ( O O ) ! It 's a treat to watch the skill of Zaheer Khan . I think he is the most cunning fast bowler in the world today ! <p> whitesXI on December 26 , 2011 , 10:01 GMT <p> @maddy20 - yes Hussey and Cowan out , Siddle and Haddin in , I know which two I would prefer batting . As for Cowan and hotspot , this series and the Aus/NZ series have the upgraded hotspot which is much more accurate than the hotspot 1.0 that the IND/ENG series had and if there is doubt then the decision should go to the batsmen . I love how ppl discredit hotspot but swear by snicko , which is far more innaccurate , we here plenty of noise when the ball clearly misses the bat and ignore it but when the ball comes close then there must have been an edge bcoz of the sound ? ! ! ! In the umppires defence if you hear a nick then you make the call , tough luck for Cowan , but get he did have a good debut all the same . <p> Drew12 on December 26 , 2011 , 10:01 GMT <p> OK weighting things up ... Cowan and Hussey vs Haddin . I would take the first two any day especially considering they fell together . With DRS the Indians would have no appeal on the Haddin decision anyway because the umpires probably would have been rightly more circumspect in their analysis of the previous cases - any doubt goes to the batsmen . No doubt in my mind Hussey would have been given not out by Erasmus had DRS been in play . I feel strongly that the Indian team and management are cheating all other teams they compete against by refusing to use DRS . I rarely concur with Tony Greig 's coments but this time I do completely - straight after the Hussey decision : ' We now know why India do n't want to use the DRS ' . Every country who can afford it should put their foot down and refuse to play ( tour or host ) India unless they agree to use DRS . See how quickly the BCCI change their stance then . IPL can continue because the interest outside India ( for spectators ) in that is dying anyway . <p> azzaman333 on December 26 , 2011 , 10:00 GMT <p> The Indian refusal to use technology may have cost Hussey his career . And Cowan clearly did n't hit it , no HotSpot , nothing from Snicko , and the slow-mo zoomed in replay indicated no deviation or change in rotation of the ball . Absolutely ridiculous that we ca n't use the technology to significantly improve the reliability of umpiring decisions , especially when the umpires themselves are in favour of it . India were unlucky with Haddin , but Cowan and Hussey are leagues ahead of Haddin in terms of ability and importance to the Australian batting lineup . <p> DravidPujaraGravitas on December 26 , 2011 , 9:55 GMT <p> Hot spot = blot spot . Good riddance . Never spend bucket loads of money on some junk that lacks consistency . As long as it is not owned by ICC , it can never be fair . I completely agree with moBlue . Cowan was out so easily and note that the broadcaster showed hotspot replay and once it did n't show the edge , they just did n't show the replay again for nearly an hour or so . What a joke this blot spot is ! Haddin was so plumb . Australia got away with one there . I feel for Hussey , especially with the axe hanging over his neck . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:50 GMT <p> The black arm bands were worn , because the Aussie Media manager lost his twin dauughters at childbirth yesterday . Watching here in Canada am appalled not only no URDS , but the commentators , including the great sledger Capppeli , saying what a great a ball by Khan it was when it clearl missed the bat by a metre . Hussey should be upset ! Hope that Sachin does not get run out on 99 on a bad call , or maybe he should so the BCCI would get into the 21st century.URDS makes the game a lot more consistent . BCCI , you do n't own the game , just the IPL . Let us purists enjoy Tests with the correct calls The game should be played by the same rules every time . Am an Aussie who has been lucky to play in 4 continents , see you guys in St. Lucia in March Aussie Pete <p> RandyOZ on December 26 , 2011 , 9:47 GMT <p> It may sound odd , but Mike Hussey needs to hope the bowlers fire big time . This is because if they do n't they will have no choice but to bring in Christian to replace him . Hussey is skating on very , very thin ice . <p> One thing to remember is that whilst Ishant and Zaheer did bowl well today , given their layoffs , they are no guarantee to maintain this fitness for an entire 4 test series . I would say there was certainly something in the wicket , and if Australia can press to 350 , they are a chance to do damage with their pace bowlers and restrict India to a similar scoreline , then the game will be on . Also , with Bhaji no longer in the team , if you can get into the Indian line up early , and this is a new ball wicket , then the tail is not as strong . Ashwin does have a test century of course , with no other scores yet , but on a very different wicket to this ( one where West Indies managed to make 590 ) , and it will be interesting to see how he handles the bat here . It 's all quite intriguing . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:45 GMT <p> Hussey was definitely not out , question closed . I do n't think Cowan is out though . No contact on Hot-Spot , no sound on Snicko . India is an average team with good appealing skills , which enables them to win against average teams , but get smashed by good teams like England <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:44 GMT <p> The Hotspot used in Australia and India are different . Stop saying that it 's flawed . <p> ajayb92 on December 26 , 2011 , 9:42 GMT <p> 277/6 is a better score for the aussies than people think ... alot will depend on sehwag tomorrow , the new ball has done quite a bit traditionally on mcg pitches so if he gets out early then things would be very interesting . Saying that , the pitch will be best for batting on days 2 and 3 <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:41 GMT <p> Interesting days play - ca n't wait for it to start up again tomorrow . I can only hope that the whole series is as enthralling . <p> As for those saying that the DRS is not a hundred percent accurate , consider this : is it more or less accurate than umpire 's decision on the field ? It is more accurate . Ask yourself , then , why would India oppose more accurate decision making ? *submits today 's scorecard as exhibit A* <p> That aside , let 's hope that if the umpires are trigger-happy , they 're at least consistently trigger-happy . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:41 GMT <p> Hats off to Umesh Yadav .... brilliant bowling ! ! ! <p> timpeace on December 26 , 2011 , 9:40 GMT <p> Technology is important but more critical is the correct use of it . What is the assurance that the right replays are being shown to the umpire ? If you remember the Bridgetown test in the West Indies , Dhoni was given out of a no ball because a different ( legitimate ) delivery was shown to the umpire . In this case the error was tracked but how can we be sure that such errors are not missed . The technicians must be well trained and qualified and the replays must be supervised . But it will be tough to ensure this worldwide . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:37 GMT <p> I have a firm a belief that India 's bowling attack is far more menacing then Australia . A half cooked Zaheer was able to dominate players like Hussey , Clarke and Haddin . The question should always be asked of Indian batting . They have had players like Sachin Sehwag , Rahul , Ganguly and Laxman in past ten years . Yet there was not a single test match in last ten years when an Indian Captain went on with five bowlers.I mean if you have such a star studded batting orders , why do n't you have enough faith on them . Why do you have to pick a Kohli instead of a fifth bowler . The issue of a batsman being a captain has lot to with this aspect of Modern Indian Team . In fact there are not enough bowlers in Cricket today who have the privilege to lead a team . The last one Courney Walse . Having said that Indian Bowlers did bowl very well . All of us know had India batted first on this MCG track they would have succumbed . Indian bowlers will perform good . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:33 GMT <p> It was a battle between a spineless batting and a toothless bowling . But even this was made electric by the capacity crowd at the MCG ... Having watched the day from up close .. i should say it is going towards a thrilling finish , , , FORGET the records ... <p> moBlue on December 26 , 2011 , 9:31 GMT <p> @Karthik raja : you are absolutely right ! IND may have been in trouble had clarke decided to insert IND in after winning the toss . but my guess is that knowing that sehwag scored 195 by tea-time the last time he played at this venue in 2003 - he did not play at the MCG in 2007 against an experienced attack led by brett lee who even tonked him on the helmet without necessarily unfazing him , AUS may not have wanted to gamble , perhaps , especially with their inexperienced bowling attack ? *that* decision of clarke 's is very telling ! the previous AUS teams would have put IND in. this one might not want to bat fourth with good reason - considering the amount of turn ashwin managed to get on day 1 ! : ) because their batting is so fragile , and might have been afraid of the pressure IND may have put them in if they got away to a big score ! hence they batted. but my prediction is that this AUS team is in all sorts of trouble ! ! ! if zaheer stays healthy , this will be our first series win in AUS ! <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:30 GMT <p> 277-6 POSSIBLEY BOTH THE SIDES LITTLE BIT DISSAPPOINTED , With Brilliant Partnership between Ponting and Cawon Australia looked to score around 325+ in first day but ended up below potenatial score , Where as India had nt pushed hard to clean up Aussies when they had them at 216-6 with Haddin and tails are follow.But still India s weak bowling , Great Batting Wicket and Australia at 277-6 India are shade ahead in this teat match <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:28 GMT <p> Exactly who is running cricket these days ? Is it the International Cricket Council or the Board of Control for Cricket in India ? OK ! So the Indians do not like the DRS and have elected not to use it . However , why should that prevent their opponents from using it if they want to ? Personally , I am not a great fan of the DRS being available to any teams . Rather I would prefer the available technology - Hot Spot , Snicker etc. , - to be used as a monitoring device by a third umpire to ensure that the correct decision is given as far as the technology can determine the decision without any doubt . A similar concept is used in tennis where players are allowed three challenges per set relating to line calls . Players are there to play and the decision making should be the sole responsibility of the officials . If players are unable to accept that they should get out of whatever sport they are participating in and go back to being amateur players <p> ajayrcs on December 26 , 2011 , 9:28 GMT <p> I am so amazed why UDRS is not used . If India do n't want to use UDRS let not give'em but Australia wa n't to use then they should be given their 2 challenges . This wrong decisions made this test diappointing and Huge Disaster for Hussey because it will be tough to bat in Second innings Especially batting at 6 . But I think India might loose this test . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:27 GMT <p> A good day of cricket ... will be a real shame if the series does nt live upto its expectations .. @214/6 India were on top .. but hadding and siddle hung in there and managed to make the day even .. ( i dnt knw y bt this pair reminds me of broad and swann ) .. i expect the Indian seamers to go for the kill 2mw .. good to see ponting score some runs .. simply love those hook shots .. got a real beauty from umesh .. and all those cribbin abt hussey- the DRS is flawed ! ! yes he got a poor decision.bt then thts the game .. u need to accept it and just move on .. and it was nt that horrendous as compared to the howlers in 2008 @ sydney .. some1 here said BCCI might try and change the umpire .. well hell yeah .. if instead of goin to the third umpire u ask the captain of the opposition to check whether the ball was grounded then yes .. a change is required ! ! <p> sankar8000 on December 26 , 2011 , 9:27 GMT <p> For Me Hussey was not out but Kowan out ! The same time lbw for siddle and Haddin were not given when they were plumb ... but these does n't matter .... India bowled well but could have been better .... <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:25 GMT <p> mikehussey wasent out it was a bad decision husseys wicket proved costly <p> ssenthil on December 26 , 2011 , 9:24 GMT <p> The Days Honour is even but I m disappointed with Ishant some extend despite he bowled lot better then his numbers showing . But the problem with him was he was inconsistent just like Morne Morkel , does n't follow a good ball with another good ball to apply the pressure . Ashwin was a bit erratic early on , Few short balls and few on the pads but he improved by the day ends . Impressed with Zak bowled well and 23 overs in a day is hell a lot . Proved he is fully fit . Umesh is impressive as well but did n't use much bouncers after hitting Ponting on the helmet and instead he bowled short which is pulled easily . India fast bowlers should never bowl short , they should go for a perfect bouncer or a full length . Ed Cowan was impressive and unmovable while Ponting played well after a long time . Hussey was unfortunate and Siddle was impressive with bat . India need to Polish off the Aus Tail before they could reach 330 . Anything over 350 meant I m dead sure India never win this Test . <p> Romenevans on December 26 , 2011 , 9:19 GMT <p> @RandyOZ - Brad Haddin was also given not out on a plumb LBW . So its 1-1 , go cool off now . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:16 GMT <p> RandyOZ ... dude , if anything India and Sachin in particular have been targets of unruly decisions maximum number of times down under . get the facts and then talk ! I am not against technology but I do n't see any harm if the same is not used . Its not like now when India is bowling the Umpires will rule and when Australia bowls DRS will be used . Rules need to be consistent in a match and thats what it is . Fair for both teams ! And eventually all this bad and good decisions evens out in long run . Today 's ruling for Cowan and Hussey was not a bad one ! It might be hrash one , but not bad .. given that they were damn close calls and umpires are humans . These were no way close to the crazy stuff Bucknor did to India last time down under and before that also there have been senseless Umpiring against the Indians ... so stop cribbing and watch the match ... If anything just teach the Aussi batsmen to respond in a more mature and peacefull way to such howlers as Indians do .. polite and accepting at all time <p> imransmalik on December 26 , 2011 , 9:14 GMT <p> Forget about the DRS fora while India is missing a chance . Now the match is in balance . If Australia reach to 350 tomorrow it will tough for India to handle . The pitch seems to help a little bit the seamers and bounce is very good . Had India not show the tiredness at the end of the match which is becoming usual in their play , I though they had the Australian by the neck . <p> Dismayed on December 26 , 2011 , 9:14 GMT <p> Im with you Hyclass . As for Cowans dismissal the snicko clearly showed the noise was as the ball went into Dhoni 's gloves . Enough is Enough India must stop tyring to own the game . All available technology should be used all the time . Enough of the Indians childish behaviour . Their champions will always be tainted by their appealiing for dismisslas that are obviously not out . True Champions do not behave like this . <p> Aussierise on December 26 , 2011 , 9:13 GMT <p> Ease up on marshy@hyckass ! ... ok so you make some valid points about his previous state form and injury concerns ( but lets not forget how the shane watson saga was for about 6 years ) .... him , ferguson , warner , and clarke , and maybe even cowan after what was seen today ( mid aged batsman who should be entering into there prime and understanding their games a lot better should be the nucleus of our next assault on the top test ranking ) we need to get as many test matches into these blokes as soon as possible . He has the talent ( e.g. as seen in the IPL against the best bowlers in the world ) and just needs a fair run in the side .... I think a big score will not be far away . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:13 GMT <p> who will win this test ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ? <p> Snork on December 26 , 2011 , 9:12 GMT <p> What a joke ! Can you imagine if Sehwag &amp; Tendulkar were given out like Huss &amp; Cowan ? ? The Indians would take their bat and ball and fly home and we ( Australia ) would be called unsportsmanlike ! Zaheer even looked sheepish after it was given out and flashed up on the replay . Cricket is a world game not India 's to pick and choose what rules it wants to adhere to . It is an indicatement on the other Test playing countries that they wo n't stand up to India over this DRS issue . If they do n't like it we should all refuse to play them , not much point having all the broadcasting money/rights if no one is going to play them ! ! <p> Okakaboka on December 26 , 2011 , 9:11 GMT <p> To those of you going on about Hot Spot being dodgy ... Not really . 95 % of the time it is spot on . One should use ALL evidence ... Hot spot , replay , snicko etc to determine if a batsman is out . Blind man Freddy with one of those stick things would have seen Hussey was n't out . Even the seeing eye dog would be jumping up and down screaming ... errrr ..... barking .... " Woof ... NOT OUT .. er .. woof " He probably would have gone out next ball but that 's not the point ! India even had a gall appealing it missed by that far . Um , can some one tell that umpire that cricket balls swing ... they move off a straight path ...... Huh ? Oh , he left his seeing eye dog at home ! <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:11 GMT <p> Would say India bowled a bit too short and never experimented the full length delivery around off stump . Normally in the first hour of play runs down the third man is common but that never happened for some time which indicates the bowlers hit the pitch hard and was waiting to make the batsman a mistake which australia did six times today and one for the umpire . C how comments pour in when india bats and gets a poor decision <p> BradmanBestEver on December 26 , 2011 , 9:10 GMT <p> Agree with rust01 - the Indians need to forget about the method of getting a dismissal where they bowl short at the batsman and all the fielders go up and put pressure on the umpires hoping to get a wicket . Just start playing fair please . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:09 GMT <p> do nt touch yadav 's action only ting required is experince he wil hit better length as series goes on i think he has natural action which is so good no need to do naything with it LOL <p> imi2839 on December 26 , 2011 , 9:09 GMT <p> regarding the decisions .... i am with sourav ganguly its one-all ... hussey 's one would have been reversed by DRS but so too zaheer 's lbw at the end of the day which was plumb ... so it balances , zaheer gets a wicket either way .... <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:07 GMT <p> cowan was clean out .. hussey was not out .. but siddle also given not out .. and siddle is in better form compared to hussey <p> MrBrightside92 on December 26 , 2011 , 9:06 GMT <p> @ RandyOz .. there was n't 70,000 at the G towards the end of the first day of the last boxing day test .... still intriguing match up between India and Oz ... good to see Zak and Ishant on the field and well played Yadav . Zak looked a shadow pace wise though he does have some guile ... would he have played if Praveen was fit ? I do n't think they both should play at Zak pace . How supple will they feel this morning ? Do like the look of Warner/Cowan opening . Neither side have completely messed up .... India do need to stamp their batting authority from the off ... <p> moBlue on December 26 , 2011 , 9:06 GMT <p> @ alexk400 : did you grow up on a staple of ODIs and T-20s , my friend ? test cricket has 5 days of play and 3 sessions during each day , and somewhere around sessions 2 and 3 of each day , the old ball starts to reverse-swing and some bowlers - like akram pointed out as a commentator today - can control the reverse-swinging ball better than they can control the new ball ! you were very premature in your judgment , my friend ... evidently . : ) <p> IND bowlers will do just fine in AUS this time around against these batters as long as zaheer stays healthy . did you notice how much turn ashwin got with bounce , of course on day 1 at the MCG ? ! ? if IND bat reasonably well , AUS will be in trouble in the second inning much more so , perhaps , than when they faced the left-armed terrific vettori ! so ... i am not worried about IND 's bowling at all ! <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:05 GMT <p> Yes India , save for the last 30 odd overs of the day you did very well . My candidate for man of the series , R. Ashwin started quite well getting the wicket of E. Cowan who was beginning to look like a centurion at 68 . After day 1 his figures reads 26 2 71 1 at an economy of 2.73 runs per over ; not bad at all . If M.S. Dhoni knows what is best for India he will employ Ashwin very soon tomorrow where he will continue the Australian demise . Two or three more wickets for you tomorrow Ashwin ! Go boy ! <p> jonesy2 on December 26 , 2011 , 9:04 GMT <p> game completely ruined . disgraceful umpiring , hussey and cowan should still be out there . indian bowling impotent as expected . <p> PrasantNSW on December 26 , 2011 , 9:04 GMT <p> Umesh is the fine finding of the year .. Well done India . India 's performance is outstanding .. Man two ducks ! ! so called in form Shaun and proved out of form Hussey .. They ensured giving constant trouble to Clarke 's men in all sessions .. Poor aussies . Yadav , Man of the Day stood tall , he was like dinosaur to them . : D .. Shaun , what a poor shot .. Selectors now should not take T20 performance into consideration . CA was stupid so as Marsh , he is still in T20 mode ddnt manage to ground the ball . Warner is no compare to Sehwag , world is gon na view the fastest test 100 coming in tomorrow from his blade . Looks like Ponting 's mind has started working after Yadav blown his helmet . May be one more blow will reverse his score into 0 's ultimately to retirement . - Prasant UNSW . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 9:03 GMT <p> dear tim time.well i do nt think cowan was not out.even sniko meter for marsh showed something there for a nick chance.but i believed its a game of uncertainity . <p> SanjivAwesome on December 26 , 2011 , 9:01 GMT <p> Evenly matched on the first day between both teams . Wow 70K people watching test cricket . <p> timpeace on December 26 , 2011 , 9:00 GMT <p> The DRS technology can not be used until it is accurate and consistent . Regarding someone 's wish that Sachin gets out on 99 , he has already been subject to several bad decisions over the last many years but he accepts them like a man and gets on with the game . I 'd like to quote Ian Chappell who asked why batsmen do nt get upset when they are wongly ' not given out ' ( and do not walk as well ) knowing pretty well they were out ! <p> rust01 on December 26 , 2011 , 9:00 GMT <p> Sundeep , hotspot has in no way proven to be flawed . BCCI needs to get with the times . It will be interesting to see your opinion when India gets some bad decisions . Get the umpire sacked perhaps ? <p> Micgyver on December 26 , 2011 , 8:59 GMT <p> Great day of cricket marred by 3 wrong decisions , 2 against Australia and 1 against India.I find it difficult to believe in this day and age if there is technology there to assist the umpires , why not use it ! Every other country is quite happy to see this system in use so i ask the question , who does India think they are ? ? ! ! <p> maddy20 on December 26 , 2011 , 8:59 GMT <p> @RandyOZ Siddle was out plumb too but it was n't given . 1 -1 howlers in favor of either teams . As for Cowan that is clean out . We have all seen how worthless hotspot can be in the Eng-INd series ( wiz : Vaselinegate or whatever it was called ) . Shoot your next excuse kid ! <p> ravihari on December 26 , 2011 , 8:57 GMT <p> A perfect curtain raiser to the next 19 days of test cricket . The series will go this way only - seasaw . Australia can be satisfied that they were not bowled out and their tail wagged well . Two men in trouble showed signs of fighting back - Ponting and Haddin . Hussey was unlucky which means he will have his chance in the second innings . A big one there would give happy headaches for Clarke once Watson is declared fit . Cowan-Warner combination looks good and Marsh should bounce back in the second innings . Which means Watson can take his position at No. 6 . Having come close to 300 Aussies will look to get as close as possible to 350 . That would be a good total if their bowlers do well . If they can bat through the first session , then the pressure on India would be high as they would have to score quickly to get the lead by the end of day 3 . If rain plays spoil sport , this test might end in a hard fought draw . Umesh is the find for India . Pattinson has a job on hand tomorrow as does Lyon . <p> Dhonifanfromadadaera on December 26 , 2011 , 8:56 GMT <p> Cowan is here to stay . same ca n't be said about Ponting . How could he nick that after doing so well to see off the initial threat and settling down ! ! <p> India bowled hot and cold ... they need to be more precise if they really want to salvage pride ... this is the best chance to win a series here and this should not go unnoticed . <p> moBlue on December 26 , 2011 , 8:54 GMT <p> to those who say IND got hussey 's wicket due to there not being the DRS. perhaps so . but cowan seemed out to me - despite hot-spot - because i heard the nick off the stump-mike ... which failure on hot-spot 's part seems to justify IND 's objections to the DRS on the grounds that DRS is not accurate . also , may i point out to you that not having DRS did cost zaheer a plumb lbw of haddin see the cricinfo report for details . so ... that made it even . <p> personally i would like to see DRS be uniformly enforced - but audited as well to eliminate possible corruption which is not impossible with such technology . a frame adjusted here and there could result in a ball " appearing " to pitch outside the leg stump . any of you thinks i am being paranoid ? in this era of spot-fixing ? that is why i 'd rather that the real " howlers " were eliminated via action replays but let us not go to technology that might be manipulated , unless a terrific auditing system is put in place ! right now there is no auditing ! ! ! <p> Sano27 on December 26 , 2011 , 8:52 GMT <p> 277/6 in the 1st day seems that both sides played very well &amp; a little edge goes in favour of the bowling team ..... its good to see ponting in nice rhythm .... Umesh just showed his ability once again as a frontline bowler , Ishant looks impressive evnthough wicketless &amp; the most important thing is to see Zaheer Khan back in action .... Zaheer once again showed his ability with the old ball .... now overall Indian bowling attack looks to be pretty good ..... <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 8:50 GMT <p> RandyOZ , last time round , the howlers wer n't in the Indian 's favour . If you 'd seen the India WI series , you would have seen how many times HotSpot gets it wrong . It is thoroughly unconvincing tech . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 8:50 GMT <p> RandyOZ , last time round , the howlers wer n't in the Indian 's favour . If you 'd seen the India WI series , you would have seen how many times HotSpot gets it wrong . It is thoroughly unconvincing tech . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 8:49 GMT <p> how would you account for haddin 's non-dismissal ? cowan was out neck and crock but there was no hot-spot edge .. goes on to show that there is no substitute for good consistent umpiring ... <p> jmcilhinney on December 26 , 2011 , 8:46 GMT <p> Well , today wo n't do anything to settle the DRS debate . India were a bit lucky but then I would n't call either the Hussey or Cowan decisions howlers . I thought I heard an edge from Cowan , although there 's no evidence to support that there was . Whether he was out or not , that was a great ball from Zaheer to Hussey . I 'd say that both would have been overturned on review , as would Haddin 's LBW . It 's tough on Cowan , who might have gone on to score a hundred . It 's also tough on Hussey , given the precarious position of his career at the moment . I like that Cowan seems to understand what the actual role of an opener is : occupy the crease and put away the bad ball . India bowled well at times but I feel that they could have had Australia all out if they had been a bit more consistent . It 's good to see that Zaheer and Ishant got through the day with no apparent health issues . Where did this all-rounder named Siddle come from ? I 'd say the game is in the balance at the moment . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 8:44 GMT <p> i am from pakistan , dosnt matter india win or lose this test match but am really impressed way Yadav bowled today , since last decade i saw first indian bowler who is bowling yorker length and bouncers very well , this is what indian need to achive in bowling depratment , test cricket is all about beauty of fast bowling , way yadav bowled today it waz very obfuscated for me , little a bit work required on his bowling action but as series will proceed he will learn alot , atleast he shdnt get injured , it waz Mix day . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 8:43 GMT <p> What do you mean by " the absence of DRS allowed the Indians to place pressure on the umpires " ? They appealed , the batsmen were given out . For that matter , Haddin was out lbw too , but he was given not out . I wish the article had n't struck this tone at the beginning . Otherwise , an engrossing day 's play I guess . <p> And for the record , Hotspot is the buggiest piece of cricket tech ever . It went wrong so many times in the India WI series it should have been rejected outright . <p> moBlue on December 26 , 2011 , 8:41 GMT <p> Mark my words : AUS are in trouble in this series ! i 've been saying for a while now to all the naysayers who pooh-poohed IND 's bowling that IND would do just fine if zaheer was healthy , because unlike them , i did not underestimate his ability to reverse-swing the ball , which happens to be more effective at his slower pace and not at a higher pace , ironically , when the ball wo n't reverse-swing as dramatically ... zaheer proved me right today . IND should do fine in this series . the 4 batters who piled up 705 ( ! ! ! ) against an experienced AUS attack led by brett lee in sydney in 2003 and tortured AUS throughout waugh 's last test are all around and in fine nick right now . i also noticed something unexpected ! ashwin got an awful lot of turn - with bounce , of course - on day 1 at the MCG ! ! ! this bodes very well for IND ! he seemed a bigger threat today than bhajji ever had in AUS ! i ca n't wait for ashwin to bowl when AUS bat second ! ! ! IND are in great shape despite the AUS recovery at the end ! <p> SirViv1973 on December 26 , 2011 , 8:39 GMT <p> Honors even after the first day I would say . <p> moBlue on December 26 , 2011 , 8:39 GMT <p> i 've been saying for a while now to all the naysayers who pooh-poohed IND 's bowling that IND would do just fine if zaheer was healthy , because unlike them , i did not underestimate his ability to reverse-swing the ball , which happens to be more effective at his slower pace and not at a higher pace , ironically , when the ball wo n't reverse-swing as dramatically ... zaheer proved me right today .

IND are in great shape despite the AUS recovery at the end ! IND not notoriously slow starters this time arnd . <p> Okakaboka on December 26 , 2011 , 8:39 GMT <p> With raw batting skills , how come Peter Siddle is more valuable with the bat than Johnston ? You have to give it to him ..... bats with grit and tries to stay at the crease . It would fitting IF he could make a 50 given he has saved Australia from total embarrassment in recent times . That said , Australia will need at least 350 to be competitive in this game . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 8:39 GMT <p> Good day for both the teams , with Ind slightly ahead .. Someway , I feel Clarke has missed a trick by not sending in Ind to bat .. Ind would hv been more edgy than Aus under this condition .. Personally , I am happy Ponting has got some runs first up .. I hope , Ind wud wrap Aus tomorrow to less than 300 and take a lead of atleast 100 by end of first innings .. Gud luck for both the teams and make it a competitive one .. <p> AP88 on December 26 , 2011 , 8:38 GMT <p> A riveting first day 's play , both teams will be a bit disappointed given the positions they were in at different times of the day . Solid display from Cowan , seemed very assured against the new ball and should be a very good foil for someone like Warner . Yadav , too displayed raw pace and should be a handful this tour ! <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 8:38 GMT <p> It 's such a shame that a fantastic day of test cricket was marred by the decisions on hussey and cowan . The ICC need to make DRS mandatory for all future test matches no matter who is playing . The ICC has to be strong enough to stand up to the BCCI even if India do n't like the DRS . By the way the Australians wore black arm bands because their media manager 's twin boys both died recently . <p> RandyOZ on December 26 , 2011 , 8:38 GMT <p> As for all the English , the 70,000 there today could 've filled all your grounds simultaneously . Cricket is far from dead here . <p> mmrrr27 on December 26 , 2011 , 8:37 GMT <p> now we all know why the BCCI does nt want DRS. it takes their umpire pressurising tactics out of the equation . ravi shastri was trying his utmost to justify the bcci 's stance during commentary . two major decision 's i.e. hussey and cowen 's dismissal wouldve been over ruled out if drs had been used . <p> Romenevans on December 26 , 2011 , 8:37 GMT <p> Ind vs England Trent Bridge - England 124/8 Dhoni spread the field , Stuart Broad and Bresnan scored runs freely . Chance Missed . Today 214/6 Dhoni spread the field , Siddle and Haddin allowed to take singles easily . What 's wrong with this guy ? If you can take top 6 easily and then chok the tail for runs and wickets will come automatically . I do n't get this from Dhoni , and why he do that always ? Oh Yes he did the same thing vs SA in 3rd test this year in 2nd innings when he spread the fielding for Steyn and Morkal and they scored freely . Test Match Saved ! Something is wrong ! Publish this please ! <p> RandyOZ on December 26 , 2011 , 8:37 GMT <p> This is exactly why India do n't want the UDRS , so when they pay off umpires like this the howlers ca n't be reversed . I seriously hope Sachin gets out on 99 to a howler . <p> RandyOZ on December 26 , 2011 , 8:37 GMT <p> This is exactly why India do n't want the UDRS , so when they pay off umpires like this the howlers ca n't be reversed . I seriously hope Sachin gets out on 99 to a howler . <p> rahulcricket007 on December 26 , 2011 , 8:34 GMT <p> i was extremely disappointed by dhoni ' s tactics in last one hour of play . he should have attack to rip through the aus lower order . instead he set defensive field . and what about ishant. seems like he does n't know how to ball lower order batsmen . bowling outisde wide to siddle allowing him to set on crease . zaheer once again show he is one of the best reverse swingers in the world . umesh yadav was expensive but produces some stunning deleveries , especially the ball to ricky ponting . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 8:33 GMT <p> " India 's refusal to accept the DRS also allowed the visitors to place pressure on the umpires " - come on ! ! ! want to get some media attention by starting a controversy ? ? How can you blame someone not accepting a flawed product ? ? Hotspot is a bunch of joke - it has been proved far too many times . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 8:29 GMT <p> Removing husseys faulty dismissal , I think it 's Aussies day 1 <p> dhonivisiri on December 26 , 2011 , 8:29 GMT <p> @R Krishna Rao .. The Aussie team Media Manager and his wife lost their twin children at birth today morning .. Hence the black arm band <p> Finger crossed ... lets hope Indian will get Punter soon ... or else ... he will be very lethal ... <p> hyclass on December 26 , 2011 , 1:46 GMT <p> I remember objecting to Marshes selection for Test cricket on the grounds of being extremely injury prone and inconsistent . He had nt played more than 4 games in a 1st class season before succumbing to injury and his record showed that on the very rare occasions when he did score a 1st class hundred , his form fell away rapidly.His 3 1st class hundreds of the last 4 years all came against the very weakest attacks on flat wickets-SthAustralia and SL.When he collected a hundred in his first Test , many were ready to say I was incorrect and good luck to them . I predicted within one run , his next two Test scores and that by his 4th match , we could expect single figure scores . His last two Test innings have now been ducks . From his first Test innings , it was clear that he edges from gully to slip , depending on the pace of the wicket , before he reaches double figures.That happens every innings.His sub 40 1st class average over 11 seasons , is an accurate reflection of his game , not an abberration . <p> on December 26 , 2011 , 1:42 GMT <p> @Alexk400 ... 2 wkts for india and there were lots of misses .. what do u have to say ab that .. <p> Olives on December 26 , 2011 , 1:22 GMT <p> Yea right Aussies are killing themselves , 2 already gone <p> Avidcricketlover on December 26 , 2011 , 1:08 GMT <p> Haha .
