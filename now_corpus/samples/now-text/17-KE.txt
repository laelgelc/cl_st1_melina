Girls register better KCSE result <p> Mary Hill Girls ' High School , Thika , posted an improved performance in last year 's KCSE exam in which many schools known for excellence performed dismally . <p> Nationally , only 141 candidates had mean-grades of A. The results were described by many as a shocker , thanks to new rules initiated by Education CS Fred Matiang'i . <p> In Mary Hill , only four out of 295 candidates failed to get C-plus , the minimum university entry grade . This is a 98.5 per cent transition . Like last year , four candidates have A-plain grades , while the A-minus score increased from 59 to 66 and the B-plus score increased from 87 to 92 . <p> Speaking at the school on Friday , deputy principal in charge of academics Rosylene Wakiama said the school does not rely on leaks . She attributed the improved performance to team efforts and hard work by teachers and students . <p> Thank you for participating in discussions on The Star , Kenya .

Stealing cattle was considered a means to elevate one 's status . <p> But in the past few decades , in West Pokot , Baringo , Laikipia , Turkana and Samburu counties , in northwestern and central Kenya , cattle raids have escalated , fuelled by the proliferation of small arms smuggled into the country .

They say the police fear the bandits , but also have little motivation to do their job because of isolated and poor working conditions . Many of the police deployed are reportedly junior officers and do n't have adequate food or water supplies . <p> Chebon says the police have yet to investigate his sons ' killings and his cattle have never been recovered .

My area was scheduled for water supply over a duration of 24 hours on the weekend . The day had changed but the rations held steady . I could not complain . They are several places in Nairobi that do not get running water in weeks . <p> I live in a decent section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1000 litres . I enjoy good water pressure . The only little discomfort I can report is a screeching electric water pump that causes a racket whenever the overhead tank is running on empty . I do not react as harshly to water rationing as I do to power rationing , unscheduled black outs and slow internet speeds . Those are scarce resources . <p> Water can be bought in hard cash from a vendor a phone call away . Every sensible Nairobi family man is now forced to be present when the water starts trickling from the direct city line at 2 in the night . <p> Present enough to rouse the brood into action filling up any container that holds water . Water scarcity is a normal feature in Nairobi as potholes and thieving politicians . When the rains fail and the Ndaikini dam water levels drop , I try not to be a sitting duck . <p> Like most Nairobians , I have begrudgingly embraced my reality and become astute at water sourcing . My back up systems can hold ground for a single week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I am forced to make a call to the " Maji safi ' people . <p> They arrive promptly with a water browser and a take-it-or-leave-it offer before a drop can touch my empty storage tank . I have no way of testing the source of their water . But , it is not a pressing concern , when you have not had water for two days . <p> Nairobi houses are not designed to handle water shortages very well . Sometimes , the caretaker cum groundsman and security detail , tries to pair me up with a seedy neighbour I hardly ever talk to , because the water vendor refuses to burn fuel just to fill a single storage tank with a limited capacity . <p> I have talked to my landlord about building a larger storage tank and he would not give me a straight answer . He claims that the money that I paid him is barely enough to get his family through the month and here I am whinging on about the size of the storage tank . <p> I have morphed into a domestic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short call . That is the kind of wastage that only a swimming pool attendant can afford . Most people do not realize that a quarter of all the clean water that enters our homes is washed down the drain whilst innocently flushing toilets . Old toilets use about 13 litres of water per single flush . The wasted water could be irrigating a farm . <p> I take efficient showers . I am thinking of buying a shower timer that calculates the time spent under the showerhead . I constantly monitor the water levels in my tank . <p> Outdoors , I get easily irritated when I get asked " still or sparkling " . I am not one of those uppity types who no longer drink tap water , if it does come wrapped in plastic and flaunting its mineral qualities . I think bottled water is overrated and overpriced . <p> A glass of water was a basic courtesy before the introduction of bottled water and the commercialization and privatisation of water services . Bottled water is a billion shilling industry . Kenya is in desperate need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Clean water is the world 's most precious resource and what do we do with it ? We horde and waste it . Nairobi 's city water supply , and public services such as healthcare , education , and security have progressively deteriorated and become heavily privatized . Access to clean drinking water and sanitation are basic human rights but for most people in this city , the right to clean water is a privilege that is about to cost more .

@@16345234 <p> The symbolic show of Opposition unity at Bomas of Kenya yesterday set off a political journey well travelled before , albeit with mixed fortunes . <p> While statements of intent about cobbling together a broad-based opposition alliance have been easy to come by , the harder part has been to sustain the unity and to rally the competing interests behind a single candidate . <p> Since the re-introduction of multi-party democracy in 1991 , Kenya 's opposition has always yearned for unity but it has not always been easy clobbering and maintaining a united front . <p> The only two instances the opposition has gone into battle united , it has triumphed beyond the expectations of even the fiercest skeptics . <p> In 2002 , against the expectations of even their most ardent supporters , the opposition crafted Kenya 's most formidable political alliance with the National Rainbow Coalition ( Narc ) registering the most convincing electoral victory in Kenya 's multiparty history . <p> Then in 2005 , a united opposition front , although in a loose coalition , convincingly beat the government in the constitutional referendum aborting the proposed constitution . <p> The Orange revolution gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been a key political factor in the country for the last 10 years . <p> But the subsequent attempt to win power in the 2007 elections was a different ball game with two main coalition insiders -- Kanu 's Uhuru Kenyatta and splinter Orange faction led by Kalonzo Musyoka -- having exited for different reasons . <p> Yet , it has always made sense that only a united opposition can challenge the incumbent government since the re-introduction of multiparty politics in 1991 . <p> Kanu , which had ruled Kenya since independence in 1963 and as the only de jure one party since 1982 , was under siege from international pressure and local agitation to allow political pluralism around 1990 . <p> The nascent opposition had hitherto acted in unison with leading lights such as the late Jaramogi Odinga Oginga , Masinde Muliro , Martin Shikuku , Ahmed Salim Bamahariz , Philip Gachoka , James Orengo , Paul Muite and George Nthenge operating under the Forum for the Restoration of Democracy ( Ford ) , sending pointers that they would be united in removing Kanu when elections are called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaders in detention such as Raila Odinga , Kenneth Matiba and Charles Rubia would have any reasons to betray the cause . <p> Yet with Matiba , Rubia and Raila out of detention , the fallout was fast and furious . Thus the opposition went into the 1992 elections divided into Ford-Kenya under Jaramogi and Muliro while Shikuku and Matiba led the Ford-Asili faction . <p> Kanu therefore comfortably won the 1992 elections although garnering only 1.9 million votes against the joint opposition 's over 3 million votes . <p> At that point , it was still clear that only the elusive unity was preventing the opposition from beating Kanu with the combined votes almost one million more than the winning team . <p> By early 2002 , Kibaki , Ngilu and Ford Kenya leader Wamalwa Kijana had laid some groundwork to field a single opposition presidential candidate under the National Alliance of Kenya ( Nak ) but by then their numbers appeared no match for Kanu which had swallowed Raila Odinga 's National Development Party ( NDP ) and courted Uhuru Kenyatta . <p> A fallout over the Kanu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spearheaded a revolt that took away other leaders including ministers George Saitoti and Kalonzo Musyoka to join Kibaki-Wamalwa-Ngilu 's Nak . <p> Narc delivered the only baby of a joint opposition coalition in Kenya in the 2002 elections in which Kibaki comfortably defeated Kanu 's Uhuru Kenyatta with 3.6 million votes ( 61.3 per cent ) against 1.8 million ( 30.2 per cent ) . <p> Yesterday 's meeting at Bomas , however , provides a real scare for the ruling coalition if the alliance can hold with such diverse leaders in a union . If the alliance prevails , it could herald Kenya 's second change of power from the ruling alliance and the first for a sitting president to lose his re-election bid . <p> The voter registration offers opportunity for either coalition to tilt the scales their way with official records showing 9 million eligible voters are yet to be listed .

A matte finish can also age you . <p> You will notice over time your skin tone turns uneven , with darker arms and decolletage , even when unintended . Sunscreen prevents that . Please note , anything you apply on your skin should have barely negligible levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long forgotten pair of jeans . I only needed to drive for a kilometre . By the time I arrived the top half of my jeans was a distinctly darker blue . I loathe hot weather . I ca n't swim , it shrinks my hair and I feel personally attacked by the rays no matter how high the SPF . As a rule , I move around as little as possible during those glory hours of 11 am to 4 pm . <p> But sometimes hibernation simply is not on and I have had to find hacks to survive in this detestable heat . That is how body oils became part of my skin care arsenal . <p> You would imagine heat drives you away from oils , but it is quite the opposite . Spray on body oils are the secret . You spritz them on when your skin is damp from the shower , massaging them in promptly . Layer with sunscreen . Coconut and olive oil are excellent oils to use . You can go as far as pouring them into a spray bottle . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have not been doing this before , and I do n't know why you have n't , you will need to shower twice a day . There is no way around it . Oils are better absorbed by skin softened with a nice shower . <p> You will have to change how you wear your makeup . Primers are your friend . They keep everything on your face instead of on tissues and dripping sweat . Primer for your eyes keeps eye makeup on , as much as face primers that illuminate and enhance your glow are a godsend for your face . Invest in BB creams if you have dry skin and CC creams if you have blemishes , scars , uneven skin tone and oily skin . CC creams have concealer . When applied with a very light hand atop a primer , it will look natural and smooth . <p> This is precisely what you want . Something that looks like you have been dusted with the golden rays of the sun .

Bronzed , soft , dewy skin not only looks young and youthful , you wo n't feel like you have to fight to keep it . A matte finish can also age you . Which is why if you do not have one , you need a spray to set your makeup once you are done . Ditch the powders unless you need to be camera ready . Wear waterproof mascara and eyeliner so when the sun and sweat get into your eyes it will not run . <p> Sunscreen is critical but you must also be picky . Zinc oxide is great for acne prone skin . A host of sunscreens have a grey or yellowish base which leaves your face looking like you wore a mask . Gel sunscreens or face creams with in-built sunscreen work best . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , dry the skin or irritate the eye area , which you ought to avoid during SPF application .

Sunscreen prevents that . Please note , anything you apply on your skin should have barely negligible levels of glycerin .

Well , as it turns out , this is far more likely to be your saving grace .

After some interactions with other teachers , she called me to her office to get an update of happenings in the school . <p> " Pesa imepotea na gari imekwama , " she told me before I started any updates .

It 's just across the road , and there is plenty of parking immediately outside or in the hotel 's car park . But I was beginning to tell you what Nahshon meant by " three in one " . He is a very enthusiastic Food and Beverage Manager , by the way . He has worked in many places -- in Ghana , Nigeria and Dubai , as well as at other hotels in Kenya . He does n't look old enough to have done all he has done -- but he has . <p> Nahshon was keen to show us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we were sitting -- in what he called the Caf ? .

In the Caf ? he pointed out the two circles of comfy sofas surrounding fireplaces . These will be ideal for group get-togethers , especially when the chilly evenings come again . <p> We moved over to the Garden Restaurant , where a number of the tables are set out on the grass and are shaded with broad umbrellas . Nahshon told us that the restaurant can seat up to 120 .

This is the Sap Bar -- so the tree image is continued . It is quite spacious , with an inviting long bar . It has two distinct spaces . The more public section has television screens for watching , I assume , football . Around a corner , the more private section has tables and sofas screened off for more comfortable and quieter entertainments . Without doubt , The Node -- especially the Sap Bar -- will soon establish its place in the Westlands nightlife . <p> But my wife and I were there to sample Nahshon 's daytime food and beverage offerings .

So you can see that The Node is a much more sophisticated place than the Pizza Garden used to be . <p> For the main course , there is a wide and imaginative choice of the usual meats ( beef , lamb , pork , chicken and fish ) , pastas , pizzas or salads . I chose the Grilled Lamb Cutlets , described as ' French trimmed and thyme marinated ' . Succulent they were , and good value at Sh1,500 , which is in line , I think , with Nairobi establishments of a similar standard . <p> My wife , Lut , is a vegetarian ; she chose , and was happy with , the Roast Pumpkin and Beets Salad : lettuce , sweet roasted pumpkin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swapped the goat 's cheese for cherry tomatoes . She suggested to Nahshon that restaurants will need to be more mindful of the increasing number of vegans . <p> It was a pity that , being a chocolate lover , I was too satisfied to tackle the Chocolate Attack : with all of chocolate fondant , chocolate cheesecake , chocolate mousse and chocolate ice cream . So , given its location , its pleasant and relaxed ambiance , its varied offerings , I reckon The Node -- this three-in-one place -- will do well , both day and night .

The plan by the Indian operator was to hammer Safaricom to the ground . <p> He devised a plan that he called Safaricom 2.0 that would serve as a blueprint for the next phase of growth for the company . The plan revolved around reorganising key managers and business units around key customers that the company would be wooing -- including small business owners , ordinary folks , big firms and the well-to-do , who were mostly corporate managers . <p> One of his earliest challenges was engaging competitors in a price war , in what would have certainly been a race to the bottom for all the players had Safaricom not taken a step back and re-assessed its long and short-term benefits of acquiring customers " at whatever cost " . <p> When Mr Bob Collymore received a call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to seek advice from people he trusted . <p> At the time , Mr Collymore , who turned 58 on Friday , was the head of Corporate Affairs for Vodacom based in South Africa , a position that had exposed him to doing business across Africa . He had also gained considerable experience as a board member of Safaricom . <p> His first call was to his good friend Mr Peter Matlare , a man who had cut his teeth in the corporate world and had since risen to become the CEO of Tiger Brands , one of Africa 's leading consumer goods companies . <p> " Peter told me , ' just be yourself ; do n't try and pretend to be anybody else because if you start acting you 'll get tired very quickly ' , " Mr Collymore told Lifestyle in an interview last week . <p> That assurance must have been at the back of his mind when he made his next call to Ms Nonkululeko Merina Cheryl Nyembezi-Heita , a woman who had climbed the corporate ladder to the very top of Arcelor Mittal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ms Nyembezi-Heita , popularly known as Nku , had vast experience in finance , telecommunications , steel and mining . <p> " Nku , a young black woman running a steel company in South Africa -- that was tough . Her advice was simple : deal with people issues , do n't drag it on , " Mr Collymore said . <p> That somewhat dovetailed into the third piece of advice that came from Mr Michael Joseph , the man who had nurtured Safaricom from a fledgling company in the year 2000 to the regional technology giant that he was about to hand over to Mr Collymore . <p> Bob Collymore , Safaricom Ltd CEO looks back in time to since he took the helm of the most profitable company in Kenya and how they got to their current state through bold decision making and learning from mistakes . PHOTO COURTESY <p> SAFARICOM 2.0 <p> " Joseph told me , just make decisions . Even if you make wrong decisions , which I can guarantee you will , just make decisions , " he said . <p> Mr Joseph assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career , and in particular during the heady and uncertain earlier days when Safaricom was a new company , whose future few , except perhaps the converted , could fathom . <p> In 2000 , when Vodafone was bidding for a mobile licence , the company did not expect to sell more than 50,000 lines in Kenya . To his surprise , Mr Joseph would go ahead and break growth records for any Kenyan company in under a decade after making a series of contrarian decisions . When Mr Collymore spoke to him , he had nothing but words of support and encouragement . <p> " He told me : ' I am always here to support you , do n't worry ' . That was a comforting thing to hear , coming from the guy who helped build Safaricom -- saying that he would be there and he was not going to let me fail , " said Mr Collymore of the transition that gave him the final impetus to take on the challenge . <p> There was a prevailing sentiment then that Safaricom had matured . A series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduced mobile call rates by 75 per cent . In 2010 , just as Mr Collymore 's appointment was being announced , the Indian telecoms giant Bharti Airtel was negotiating to buy Zain Africa for Sh1 trillion ( $1 billion ) . The plan by the Indian operator was to hammer Safaricom to the ground . Investors too had taken a grim view of the company 's prospects and they had sold Safaricom 's shares on the Nairobi Stock Exchange ( now Nairobi Securities Exchange ) to the point where the company was now half the value it had been listed two years earlier in one of Kenya 's largest and most publicised initial public offering of shares . <p> The business growth had plateaued , and many pundits argued -- wrongly , it turned out -- that the mobile telephone market was saturated . <p> " At the time I was coming in , many people thought this is not really the right time to join a company like this because it can only go down from here but I did not find that very daunting . I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how we will get on with it ' , " Mr Collymore said . <p> As a veteran of mature mobile markets , Mr Collymore could have been tempted to agree with those who doubted the growth of the sector in Kenya , but for a foreign manager who had been charged with integrating the acquisition of J-Phone into Vodafone Group , he had witnessed firsthand how technology innovation and massive investment in broadband internet had helped revolutionise the Japanese mobile phone and internet markets , he knew better than that . He saw a business with immense growth opportunities , with some offtakes from existing business in addition to some completely new investments that would push the business to the next level . <p> He devised a plan that he called Safaricom 2.0 that would serve as a blueprint for the next phase of growth for the company . The plan revolved around reorganising key managers and business units around key customers that the company would be wooing -- including small business owners , ordinary folks , big firms and the well-to-do , who were mostly corporate managers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with 21,000 agents scattered in every corner of the country . In the six years that Collymore has been at the helm , the number of subscribers has almost doubled to 26 million served by more than 100,000 agents . <p> PRICE WARS <p> The company has tripled financial access levels in the country from 20 per cent to over 60 per cent and growing . From the simple " Send Money Home " service that it was initially envisaged as , it has become a banking tool for millions of Kenyans who have never entered a bank -- enabling them to save and borrow -- and become a key cog in the economy 's wheel . <p> Last year , Safaricom contributed almost Sh414 billion to the country 's Gross Domestic Product , while M-Pesa has been credited with lifting 800,000 people from poverty , according to management consulting firm KPMG and a recent study authored by Ms Tavneet Suri , an associate professor of applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and Mr William Jack , an assistant professor of Economics at Georgetown University in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is growing exponentially has taught him critical lessons . <p> " It 's been a huge learning experience , " he says on matters technical , marketing and at the psychological level while coping with the challenges of maintaining growth . <p> " We have had our ups and downs but this has been typical of the 16 years of Safaricom , " says Mr Collymore . <p> He is a firm believer in tapping the expertise and experience of those who work with him : it is people who run businesses , he believes , not the billions sunk in them in investments . <p> " You know , there is a kind of a myth around CEOs . A lot of CEO decisions are team decisions and the biggest decisions that I make are about the people that I hire . If you hire the right people then the rest of the operational decisions become relatively easy , " says Mr Collymore . <p> It has not been smooth sailing though for the man at the top , but the occasional turbulence comes with the territory . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collymore , adding that what matters are the lessons one takes away from these mistakes , and using these lessons to strengthen the company . <p> One of his earliest challenges was engaging competitors in a price war , in what would have certainly been a race to the bottom for all the players had Safaricom not taken a step back and re-assessed its long and short-term benefits of acquiring customers " at whatever cost " . <p> Mr Collymore had hardly settled in his new job when the brutal price war broke out , sending call prices tumbling by at least 50 per cent and , in some cases , by as much as 75 per cent . <p> " We were in the middle of a price war that was bringing the whole industry down , " says Collymore . <p> He had to make the tough call ; either hunt with the wolves or run with the hares . If he chose to stay with the cut-throat competition , he risked the very future of the successful company he had taken over . Even the whole industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he took the big bold step to raise the prices back to the levels that made business sense , he risked losing customers -- but , on the flip side , this would put the business back on track to push the sustainable business model he had found . <p> " I know consumers at the time liked it . I mean consumers would like it if everything was free but we have other responsibilities to our shareholders and to the industry as a whole , " he says . <p> BAD CALLS <p> To stop the industry spiraling down into a dramatic catastrophe , Mr Collymore decided to increase prices . <p> " That was one tough decision , " he says . But it paid off handsomely as the company was able to build reserves for which to build the company that it has now become . <p> Securing the future , he says , was the reason for the price increase and other industry players quietly stopped the price war and followed suit away from the limelight . Since then , the company has made huge investments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Our next phase was putting fibre in the ground or putting fibre on poles to serve connected customers because we really do believe in democratisation of data , " he says . <p> Over the last six years , Safaricom has invested about Sh30 billion a year in improving and expanding its network which now covers about 95 per cent of the population . <p> It has been a story of bold decisions that appeared nutty at the time but which have been vindicated by time . <p> " My predecessor took some bold decisions on 3G at a time when people were saying there is no market for 3G in Kenya . I believe that there is demand for 4G , and we continue to invest heavily , " he says . <p> The company has close to 1,000 4G stations today and , recently , paid out $25 million ( Sh2.5 billion ) to the Communications Authority for a 4G licence , he says . <p> He readily admits to making decisions that did n't turn out too well . <p> " We have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered unlimited internet , despite all the experiences that we had with more mature markets . That was not just going to work but still we did it , " Mr Collymore says . <p> At the time , a good number of subscribers must have suffered from what sociologists refer to as the " buffet mentality " ; eat all you can , and some more , because it 's readily available . <p> " One of the things that we have always been good at is admitting our mistakes and moving on . So we admitted it was a mistake and we told people why we were going to stop the unlimited data , " says Mr Collymore . <p> The company was also late in building the fibre network , a decision that should have been made earlier but was n't , but Mr Collymore sees mistakes as learning opportunities . <p> " We should have taken a decision early to put fibre in the ground or overhead . I think we are a little bit late in bringing that to the market but we are trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Collymore says that in business -- as in life -- mistakes are bound to happen but what matters is how we come out of it . <p> " We try to focus on learning than regretting because regret is a negative thing , while learning is a positive thing . So whenever you make a mistake , even if it is in your personal life , you make a mistake and you think , okay , that was probably not the smartest thing to do , " he says . <p> But even when you get things right , he adds , it is always important to go and look back and ask , " why did I get that right ? " <p> " A lot of people do not do that , because sometimes it can just be luck and if you walk with the wrong assumptions , you are going to make big mistakes in the future . When an airplane crashes , the first thing we must do is look for the black box . So , it 's important to stop and search for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you look for that black box is to see what went wrong and why it went wrong so that you can fix it . At all costs , go and find the black box , " he offers . <p> Robert William Collymore was never born with a silver spoon in his mouth . In his own words , Bob started earning at the age of 12 while still living with his grandmother in Guyana . He would make art pieces from plasticine moulds sent to him by his mother who was then in the UK . <p> He remembers his grandmother fondly : " I was always a bright child but I was always a lazy child . I 've said that my grandmother spoilt me and made me get away with things I should n't have done . " <p> He would also make little brooches from coconut shells and from these art pieces for sale . <p> However , he landed his first " real " job when he was 16 when he worked in a department store in the UK , where he would report to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last to leave after sweeping and locking up . <p> He says that this job taught him some of the valuable lessons that have propelled him to his current role . <p> He moved to the UK to join his mother in 1974 , where he completed his formal education . He continued to practise art this time as a painter . <p> However , his mother insisted that he gets a formal job , and used her networks to get him a position at the British Telecom . <p> And , in the last five years , Mr Collymore has been the force behind taking M-Pesa , the world 's most successful mobile money deployment , to scale . <p> And he loves being in Kenya and leading Safaricom . <p> " I would n't voluntarily leave unless the board fires me or my time is up , " he says . <p> He was appointed to his current position in October 2010 , although he had been sitting on the company 's board before while he served as the Governance Director for Africa at Vodafone . <p> Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commentator on the continent . <p> He is very passionate about corporate responsibility and has demonstrated a keen interest in causes relating to maternal health and diabetes through the work of the Safaricom and M-Pesa foundations . <p> He sits on the United Nations Global Compact Board , which champions the need for corporates to embrace sustainability in all their practices . <p> He is also known for his love for flying helicopters , art and jazz music .

After all , your good work should be enough to speak for you right ? Wrong . <p> " Office politics is n't something you can sit out , " says 31-year-old Savannah , a copy writer . Doing so almost cost her job last year . She had been working for her current employer , an ad agency in Nairobi , for a year when their boss asked her to step in for a team leader from another department who was going on leave . " I blindly accepted the offer ( but hell broke loose ) when I did , " she says . <p> Suddenly , two different cliques of colleagues were up in arms against her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boss to talk about how she was n't even doing the job she already had properly . " It was all very shocking . I could n't believe it , " she recalls . <p> Savanna dealt with the shock fast and invited those who were against her for a friendly chat . This chat ended with her letting the gig go but keeping her job . " Now I look at office relations very differently , ' she says . <p> The greatest lesson she learned up from the experience is that love it or loathe it , office politics is a part of every workplace . Now Savanna , who is a natural introvert , has been drawn out of her shell . " I listen very keenly to everyone at the office . I can now say that I know what motivates most of the people I work with . Every day , I try to help them meet their goals so that they can help me meet mine .

Add to this passion for one 's work , and often conflicting ideas and personalities , and you see how office politics is inevitable . Often , the bosses are n't always the ones with the most influence . This was a lesson that Miriam Njine , 30 , learnt -- just in time for the birth of her twins . <p> " I had been the loyal employee who came in first in the morning and volunteered for all the extra tasks at my former job , " she says .

The ones who are not shy about going into the CEO 's office . The ones who are very good at mobilising others . These are the movers and shakers . " <p> This new strategy has n't earned her the top job yet but when she had her twins over a year ago , it was these ' influential ' colleagues who put in a kind word for her with the overall boss .

The significance of this event can not be underplayed especially if you are a resident of Narok or the larger Transmara . <p> You see , before the Narok High Court was inaugurated , residents were forced to travel to Naivasha and Nakuru to access justice . If you lived in the greater Trans Mara Region , you would probably access justice through the Kisii , Kisumu or Kakamega High court stations . 50 years after independence , the people of Narok County had to contend with this state of affairs . <p> The judicial transformation has however provided hope for the resident of Narok County with the construction of the Narok @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to drastically reduce the case backlog currently witnessed Naivasha and Nakuru courts as well as providing easy access to the wheels of justice by the residents in Narok . <p> Devolution is equally on the transformative stages , redefining development in the grassroots after 50 years of ' Nairobi dependency ' . How then Can the Devolved unit work with the Judiciary to improve access to the courts ? Taking a cursory look at the Judicial transformation in Kenya , stakeholders such as donors , NGO 's and the Treasury have played crucial roles in the progress made so far , but a key agent stuck predominantly on the periphery is the County Governments . <p> The issue of separation of powers is a fundamental doctrine in the Kenyan constitution . The devolved Units and the judiciary have distinct roles . I am however of the firm belief that the separation of powers does n't mean that the two parties can not cooperate in undertaking their constitutional mandates . The judiciary and the County government serve the same Kenyans in their own unique way . <p> The sensitive nature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enormous risks especially when it comes to cooperation with other arms of government . The interference with the independence of the judiciary becomes a possibility . On the flipside , for both the Judiciary and the counties , complementing each other ought to be the glue that connects the two parties but with a respect for the limits upon which the relationship can not transcend . Suffice to say , cooperation is quite possible without interfering with the judiciaries independence . <p> In Narok County , The Local Government was among the first of the 47 devolved units to donate two parcels of land for the construction of the High Court . This gesture allowed the judiciary administration to focus on building the court and avoid the hassle and the pitfalls involved in land purchase . <p> Other area of cooperation that Narok County is exploring in complementing the judicial transformation is providing housing amenities for key judicial staff such as Presiding judges and registrars . This will go a long way in assisting the court officials in settling down in their new work station , saving them time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative accommodation . <p> The county governments will be required to play a significant role in the adoption of alternative dispute resolution mechanism by the judiciary . Uganda is one success story of a country utilizing traditional approach in resolving disputes among communities through local community elders and networks . Truth be told , County Governments are political establishment , be that as it may , the leaders represent the people . You can not discount leaders from solving disputes within the communities nor can you discount ADR ( Alternative Dispute Resolution ) from the political sphere . <p> In Narok County for Instance , Governor SamuelTunai has managed to settle land disputes tracing back over 10 years in various land ranches such as Naroosura and Naigara Group Ranch by bringing warring parties together in mediation talks involving the clergy and the community elders . Maybe it 's high time the judiciary explores ways through which leaders in the political sphere can be roped into the transformative agenda . <p> The County leadership can play a huge role in improving the perception and acceptability of the judiciary in the grassroots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil disobedience is the lack of trust in court mediated processes . To earn back the peoples trust , the judiciary should consider using Governors as ambassadors of their change message to the grassroots . <p> Close relations , in particular , working relations between County Governments and the judiciary is required if we are to address the problems facing Kenyans . Both the Devolved units and the Courts can work together to improve the dispensation and access of the justice systems to Kenyans . This will only be realized if a proper mechanism is put in place by both players . It 's an avenue worth exploring for both parties , despite it not being given its proper place in issue of National significance . <p> Thank you for participating in discussions on The Star , Kenya .

If a woman wants to keep on being pursued she should remain attractive , even years in marriage she should work on being exciting to chase after and explore . <h> 23 . " Access " <p> A man can not make any progress with a woman without the woman 's permission and consent . She should let him in her life , stop putting permanent walls between him and you , give him the green light . <h> 22 . " Decisiveness " <p> A woman who knows what she wants is easy to love . Some women are all over the place ; they love the man but then still stuck on the ex , listening to friends and getting confused , saying she wants to love then saying she is not sure , breaking up with him then wanting him back , saying no to him then getting mad when the man moves on , saying one thing but meaning something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fun " <p> Men will always be drawn to the woman who is exciting , the stress-free woman . Men do n't like working too hard to have fun , be the oasis he runs to not the nag he avoids . <h> 20 .

Do n't rush him to speed up proposing to you , that will only push him away ; do n't write him off quickly on grounds that he is not where he wants to be in life yet , his breakthrough is on the way ; do n't put pressure on him yet he is doing his best .

@@16749233 <h> Drug barons exposed : Why Uhuru and Raila allies are not sleeping easy <p> America 's renewed push against local drug lords has turned the spotlight on prominent Kenyans previously accused of links to the narcotics trade . <p> A week after the Akasha brothers were arrested and flown to New York , drug investigators were reported to be looking afresh at the files of Kenyan big names cited in an American Embassy report made public six years ago . <p> The report , which was handed to the then Internal security minister George Saitoti , not only triggered high-level investigations into the Akasha brothers who are now awaiting trial in the US , but also listed well known Kenyans who have since risen to powerful positions . <p> All of them were named in Parliament by Prof Saitoti but denied the accusations and have always insisted the report had no basis . <p> Sources told The Standard on Sunday that having wrapped up their investigations into the Akashas , the Drug Enforcement Authority was re-examining the reports on which the then US ambassador , Mr Michael Ranneberger , based his 2010 communication to the Kenya Government . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the sensitivity of the matter said they were also treating these Kenyans as persons of interest in the global war against drug trafficking . <p> At the same time , no less a person than President Uhuru Kenyatta declared end of the road for big drug dealers following the Akasha 's transatlantic flight to justice , hinting at more arrests . " Their days are over . We are not dealing with peddlers , we will deal with the big fish . We will deal with the drug barons decisively , " Uhuru said early last week . <p> Flown out <p> Two Akasha brothers -- Baktash and Ibrahim -- together with their Pakistan-based associate Gulam Hussein and Vijaygiri Goswami , an Indian resident in Kenya , were flown to New York to stand trial for the production and distribution of heroin and methamphetamine across Africa . They were arrested after an elaborate investigation by the Drug Enforcement Agency , and a sting operation in which Baktash introduced his accomplices to undercover agents while Ibrahim delivered heroin to them on behalf of what came to be known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ranneberger 's dossier in 2010 , Mwau was an Assistant minister in the Kibaki Government , Sonko was Makadara MP , Kabogo was representative for Juja and Joho for Kisauni , Mombasa . Mary Wambui , now Othaya MP , was an activist for the ruling party Narc and was often associated with President Mwai Kibaki . Like them , the Akashas have been on a US watch list over suspected connections with the global narcotics trade . <p> If investigators turn their attention on Joho and Kabogo together with others in the Saitoti list , it would touch off political shock waves because of their key positions in the rival Cord and Jubilee parties . <p> Joho is Raila Odinga 's pointman in the Coast region and is influential in the party because of his wealth and political clout . Although his relations with President Kenyatta are lukewarm , Kabogo is one of the Jubilee heavyweights in Central Kenya , by force of his personality and wealth , and being governor of the President 's home county . <p> Most of the people named in the report were subsequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence . They also protested the inclusion in the list , declared their innocence and accused the US government of mounting a witch-hunt . <p> Mwau , Kabogo , Joho , Sonko , businessman Ali Punjani , Joho 's brother Abubakar and Mbugua were later interviewed by a special police probe chaired by Deputy Commissioner of Police at the time Alfred Ombaba . The police 's interim report dated February 1st , 2011 was later tabled in Parliament . <p> In the police report , Mwau is said to have addressed all issues raised in the Ranneberger dossier , a copy of which he had in his possession at the time of the interview with the police . He denied drug trafficking claims and association with people mentioned in the dossier , including the Akashas . <p> Dossier claims that his daughter was married to Kabogo were disapproved by the police report : " He has no daughter and therefore can not possibly be father-in-law to William Kabogo . He has also never employed Kabogo as his driver . " <p> Kabogo told police that the Ranneberger dossier was posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the report damaged his character and were not true . <p> " No evidence has so far been adduced connecting him to drug trafficking , " police report said . <p> In his interview with the police probe team , Joho exonerated his family from " drug trafficking , murder , corruption , tax evasion , violence , intimidation and land grabbing . " He attributed the claims to a prominent rival businessman in Mombasa wanting to discredit his political prospects . " None of the witness interviewed has linked him to drug trafficking , " the report said . <p> The police report said Sonko panicked when police sought him out over drug claims . He later met them , denied drug trafficking claims and admitted that he was in the " business of land frauds . " The police report did not make a specific finding on drug trafficking . Instead , it fingered him over failure to pay taxes : " He needs to be followed up by Kenya Revenue Authority . " <p> Punjani also denied the charges and just like Joho , blamed a prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied proprietorship of the businesses named in the American dossier . Just like Sonko , no specific finding was made on him by the police in regard to trafficking . Mbugua also denied the claims . <p> On June 1 , 2011 , just six months after the list was presented to Parliament , Harun Mwau was hit by new sanctions . President Barack Obama ordered sanctions on the businesses of seven individuals linked to the drugs trade , among them Mwau and one Naima Mohamed Nyakiniywa . <p> " This report to the Congress , under section 804(a) of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act , 21 U.S.C. 1901-1908 ( the " Kingpin Act " ) , transmits my designations of the following seven foreign individuals as appropriate for sanctions under the Kingpin Act and reports my direction of sanctions against them under the Act , " the letter by Obama to Congress read . <p> Others on the list were from Mexico , Afghanistan , Colombia and Kyrgyzstan . <p> The Kingpin Act blocks all property and interests in property , subject to US jurisdiction , owned or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President . <p> Interviewed by The Standard on Sunday last year , Mwau denied the drug-dealing accusations , argued that it was impossible for him to traffic drugs through Kenya and attributed his vast wealth to hard work . <p> " The question as to why they would have my name on their list belongs to them . Ask them why they have not cleared me after all these years , " he said <p> Mwau was alleged to have used his clearing and forwarding business and his network of inland container terminals as a holding ground once his narcotics consignments reached the country . Adam Szubin , the then Director of the Office of Foreign Assets Control ( Ofac ) in the US Department of Treasury , told journalists at the time : " We view Mwau as among the more powerful and active narcotics traffickers in the region . It 's not a quick or short process . We built a case slowly and carefully to ensure that it is soundly built .

" It was quite unfortunate that even those who made the loudest noise had nothing to offer in terms of giving information of evidential value , " the police report said . Mr Joho is quoted in the police report as blaming the attempts to link him with the drugs trade to political and business rivals . <p> The Police committee had been tasked with unearthing drug trafficking in Kenya , expose those behind the trade and gather sufficient evidence that could stand before a court of law . <p> United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime ( UNODC ) has cited East Africa as an attractive route for international drug cartels.It said : " A review of drug seizures from 1998 to date indicates an increase in the trafficking of heroin to eastern African countries from Pakistan , Thailand and India .

Alexander , who had been living in Kenya with his mother , fell unconscious in a police cell in the coastal city of Mombasa in 2012 after being arrested for smoking cannabis . <p> He died handcuffed to his bed in hospital the next day .

He has written to Boris Johnson urging him to use his powers as foreign secretary and intervene , but he has yet to receive a reply . <p> White mischief <p> Meanwhile , there 's another headline-making case involving a young British man ? in Kenya . Jack Marrian , 31 , is the grandson of the 6th Earl Cawdor and was arrested in August for alleged cocaine smuggling . He is a sugar trader who went to Marlborough and then to Bristol University before moving to Kenya for the British sugar company ED&amp;F Man , and was awaiting a sugar consignment from Brazil . <p> When it arrived in Mombasa , the Kenyan authorities searched it , acting on a tip-off . They found 220 pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar . Jack , as head of trading for the region , was arrested on charges of trafficking . He has since been released on bail of ? 530,000 ( Sh68.7 million ) paid by his company . The trial began in November . <p> Jack , his friends and his family say he 's been set up . " I believe the Americans and the Spanish have an investigative document which they 've handed to the Kenyan police detailing how the deal was done and who was involved , and it proves Jack 's innocence , " says a British friend of Jack 's . " But the Kenyans have refused to release this document -- if there 's one thing Kenyans hate , it 's being bullied by higher powers . " <p> Inevitably , both Alexander 's and Jack 's cases have revived talk of Happy Valley and the exploits of the British expats who drank , drugged and fornicated into oblivion from the 20s until the 40s . Heroin and morphine were as rife as the sex , and a favourite after-dinner game saw men poke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for guests to decide who it belonged to . <p> The scene climaxed in 1941 , when the Happy Valley set 's heartbreaker-in-chief Josslyn Hay , the 22nd Earl of Erroll , was murdered in Nairobi . By Sir Jock Delves Broughton , the husband of his latest conquest ? By a spurned lover ? By MI6 ? Over 70 years later , there is no definitive answer , despite various parties insisting otherwise . <p> The scandal spawned James Fox 's 1982 book White Mischief -- Fox concludes that Delves Broughton was behind the killing -- and the film of the same name , starring Charles Dance and a peachy-bottomed Greta Scacchi . It also encouraged our ongoing obsession with the expat aristocrats and their antics in Africa . <p> The sudden death of Tom Cholmondeley in August last year has fuelled further reminiscing . Tom , who died , aged just 48 , after a routine hip-replacement operation in Nairobi , was the great-grandson of the original white settler in Kenya , the 3rd Lord Delamere . Known as ' D ' to his friends , Lord Delamere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a lion-hunting expedition with 200 camels and 100 porters in 1891 . <p> Chip off the old block <p> He promptly sold his Cheshire estate and bought 100,000 acres of land to the north of Nairobi . He then encouraged several of his friends to do the same , and they formed the basis of the gin-swilling Happy Valley gang , so called because the area they colonised was in a hilly sliver of the Wanjohi Valley , 60 miles north of Nairobi . <p> ' D ' once rode his horse into the Norfolk Hotel in Nairobi and jumped the dining-room table while shooting out the lights ; on another occasion , he gave a party for 250 people who managed to drink 600 bottles of champagne between them . Cyril Connolly referred to the ' three As ' of the place : alcohol , altitude and adultery . <p> And after visiting Kenya ? in the 30s , Evelyn Waugh described the group as " a community of English squires established on the Equator " , although even Waugh , no slouch when it came to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ de Trafford , one of the set , as " v. nice but so BAD and he fights and gambles and gets D.D . disgustingly drunk all the time " . <p> On the face of it , Tom Cholmondeley looked like a chip off the old block . He was accused of murder twice , once in 2005 after he shot an undercover wildlife ranger on ? his land and again in 2009 after he shot ? a poacher . He was cleared of the first charge but convicted of manslaughter for the second shooting and spent three years in detention . But Tom 's friends say the real truth has yet to come out , and that while Tom might have been eccentric , he was a good and loyal man . <p> " At the funeral , there was a nice bit read out by a man who had been in Kamiti Prison with Tom , " says one friend . " And thanks to Tom 's help , he 'd qualified as a lawyer while there , and he gave a very heartfelt tribute ? to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and electricity systems and that sort of thing . I was really very upset by the obituaries , calling him a relic of the colonial era . They traduced Tom . " <p> For all the apparent parallels with the Happy Valley set , the truth about modern Kenya is mostly very different . What was once a bulwark of the British Empire ( from the 1880s , when the European powers began slicing and dicing Africa , until 1963 , when Kenya gained its independence from Britain ) is now a modern , thrusting country with a booming middle class and a busy capital city where Uber Chopper has just launched a helicopter service . <p> Oil was discovered there in 2012 , so expats are pouring in for work , as are plenty of those in the security world , given Kenya 's ongoing hostilities with its eastern neighbour , Somalia . Kenyan troops crossed the country 's border with Somalia in 2011 to try and quash Al Shabaab militants and there have been reprisals ever since , most notably the attack on Nairobi 's Westgate Mall in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University in northern Kenya , in which 148 people died . <p> " There are loads of posh twats here who work in security , " says an Old Etonian who lives in Nairobi . <p> Mention the words " Happy Valley " to any of them , however , and their eyes will swivel in their heads like marbles . " The clich ? is as worn out as a tyre retread down to its canvas , " says Errol Trzebinski , an 80-year-old writer who was born in Britain and moved to Kenya when she was 18 . She then spent 12 years living on the farm that had belonged to Karen Blixen ( the Danish author of Out of Africa ) , before marrying a Polish aristocrat and architect who also lived in Kenya . <p> " Parties spawn affairs , " Trzebinski says when I ask if certain antics still go on today . " Generations of youngsters here have grown up with the sort of hospitality that 's a way of life , and any stranger trekking in out of the blue has always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> All very breezy , but Trzebinski herself is embroiled in legal matters over the death of her son , Antonio . He was found dead beside his car in Nairobi in 2001 -- an unsolved murder that has also drawn Happy Valley comparisons because ' Tonio ' , as he was known , was also caught up in a love triangle between his wife , Anna , and a glamorous Danish game-hunter named Natasha Illum Berg . <p> Trzebinski insists that Tonio was killed by a hitman hired by ? his mother-in-law , and so a new inquest has opened ; Berg and her family deny it and say the idea they 'd hire a hitman is especially preposterous because Tonio 's mother-in-law was herself involved in a m ? nage ? trois at the time . It brings to mind an old joke : " Are you married , or do you live in Kenya ? " <p> Today , there are around 30,000 Brits living in Kenya , admittedly a very small number in a land of 45 million ( although that count may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original British settlers have by now become Kenyan ) . <p> And the country retains a special link with Britain . Prince William proposed to Kate Middleton on Mount Kenya while on holiday there in 2010 , and both he and Prince Harry have holidayed at the 62,000-acre Lewa Wildlife Conservancy , founded by the Craigs , another big British-turned-Kenyan family . Kenya remains one of Britain 's big bilateral trading partners and is also a country into which we pour aid -- a total of ? 150 million ( Sh19.4 billion ) for the year 2016-17 . <p> Lord Valentine Cecil is the brother of the Marquess of Salisbury and lives in Chelsea . But he spends as much time as he can at ? a Kenyan lodge north of Nairobi that he built in the 90s . It 's called Laragai House and has eight bedrooms and a helipad .

Also nearby is the Wildenstein family 's 62,000-acre estate , Ol Jogi , as well as a ranch built by ICAP boss Michael Spencer ( Tatiana 's stepfather ) , which another Brit tells me is " enormous " . <p> Work hard , play hard <p> Valentine has been coming to Kenya for 46 years , " the first time with the Army , on my way to what was then Rhodesia " . When he left the Army , he bought a telecommunications business based in Nairobi . <p> " When I first went there , just eight years after independence , an awful lot of the white-settler community were thinking that this was the end and were advising their children to leave . But now , nearly half a century on , their children and grandchildren are still there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they liked the life " . <p> There is little danger of a Zimbabwe-style land grab , he suggests , in part because the big white-settler families stay out of Kenyan politics . There 's a " work hard , play hard " ethos among expats , he adds , and the lifestyle is a big draw . " You can play polo at a fraction of the cost you could at home , " he says , before going on to laud the safaris , the game-hunting , the fishing , the climate , the coastline and the dinner parties . <p> " It 's much easier to be hospitable when you have staff , " he adds . " I asked some neighbours for dinner the week after New Year , not realising they 'd still have most of their guests staying . So I said to my cook , ' We 're going to be 14 for dinner tomorrow night ' . And then he came to see me the next day to discuss what we would be having , and I said , ' We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , you can imagine saying that in England . But it worked very well . " <p> The downside to modern Kenya , says Valentine , is corruption in the police , because they 're not paid a living wage . People , he says , are often stopped by the traffic police and forced to pay some spurious fine . And according to Valentine , it 's this corruption that has ensnared Jack Marrian . " As I understand it , shipping drugs in sugar has been used quite a lot in recent years , and Mombasa is a tremendous drug-shipping point . <p> A lot of drugs come into the port and are sent elsewhere . The sums of money are huge , and a local official might be paid $300 ( Sh31,170 ) a month . So if you go to him and say , ' I do n't want you to look in this container and here 's $1,000 ( Sh103,900 ) , ' you can understand how difficult it is " . <p> Like most people , Valentine is confident that Marrian will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to be cleared . The figure bandied around by Marrian 's friends in Kenya is three years , a period during which Marrian can not work or leave the country . " My guess is that he 'll get off , " says Valentine . " The Kenyans have been under a lot of pressure from the ? US for not doing anything about the narcotics trade , so I can see why they might have arrested him . It 's a high-profile case -- they wanted to be seen to be reacting to it . But now there 's a bit of embarrassment and loss of face " . <p> The other current issue in Kenya is security , with tourism still suffering after kidnappings of visitors along the coast in 2011 . The British Foreign Office still advises against all but essential travel to certain parts of the coastline and areas close to the Somalian border . <p> " I arrived in Nairobi the day Westgate happened , " says Sandip Patel , an Old Harrovian who moved to Kenya to work in the textile business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , tend to avoid it . He 's sanguine about security . " If you get robbed , it 's probably 3am , you 're a bit pissed and in a dodgy area . It 's the same in London . Worse , actually .

All in chinos and shirts . If you go to the Purdy Arms on a Saturday night , you wonder , ' Am I in Kenya or am I in Fulham ?

" <p> Meanwhile , the Marrian and Monson families await their respective verdicts . " Britain and Kenya have always had a dysfunctional relationship , " says Lord Monson . And , like most dysfunctional relationships , this one will take time to sort out .

He had been intending to start his own business since 2011 , but his investigative work at KTN and on NTV with Mohammed ' Moha ' Ali often rubbed people the wrong way , and they found themselves faced with threats from all sides . In 2012 , they faced the one threat that was serious enough for him to take his family out of the country . " That was the most direct threat on my family and I had to take them away , " he says . However , threats for him have never been more than a concern . " I was not afraid . I was more concerned about the way we were being isolated by government . Moha bore the most heat .

" They resisted strongly at first , but it began to wear them out . " Consistent pressure on some of the stories that Mohammed and I told made it so that there would be almost pedantic scrutiny on our stories , where we felt that people were being too careful , " he says .

Just the entire decision not to take that money was very difficult . People think that integrity and just saying ' no ' is easy , but when you count $10,000 in your hands , it is very different , " he says with a laugh . Eventually , he set out to pursue a project he had dreamt of pursuing since 2011 .

@@17011233 <p> There was this couple who was caught flagrante delicto and completely stuck in a most compromising situation . As is usual in Kenya , this event attracted many onlookers keen to see this couple in their moment of painful humiliation . The only shred of dignity that remained with this couple was the threadbare hideous looking blanket that covered them . <p> The highlight of the video was a feisty female mganga who took all the glory for the stuck couple ( the man was accused of planting in someone else 's shamba ) . In fact , the cameo appearance by the cuckolded husband could in no way beat the sterling performance by the female mganga . <p> It had me thinking about how things have changed . There was a time when men believed that women are all heart , and that once a woman gives you her heart , well you have her private regions secure under lock and key . Most men wanting to boost their egos like to say that women are not prone to straying because they are fiercely loyal and hopelessly romantic . What hogwash ! <p> Here is the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanise , we are at the core very primordial beings driven by very basic instincts and are not as sophisticated and superior to wild animals as we like to think . If in doubt , please examine our behaviour around pleasure , pain and competition . <p> So , for instance , if a woman is married to a man who is limp , one who is colourless and lacking in machismo , she will be on the prowl looking for some alpha male to conquer her . The alpha male might be the guy of the mjengo who spots better abs and tighter bums indicative of serious thrust of power when and where it matters most . <p> The alpha male might be the boss who appears to have a command over everyone and leaves people quivering in their boots when he barks orders . He might be the pastor who breaths fire and brimstone while listening attentively to the needs of his female flock . He oozes machismo , but the amount needed to trigger the cheating action in a woman is really a factor of her standards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current partner . All this determines if she will go out and take the time to get her fix , for , after all , cheating takes a lot of effort and is a risky affair , especially for married women . <p> So those men who have been strutting their stuff thinking that women will just not stray need to re-examine things . Women , as we all know , are very forgiving and tolerant but contrary to wide held belief , they are not that tolerant of bad lays . Simply put , a bad lay is a man who either does not get you to your preferred pleasure destination or one who gets to his pleasure destination too soon and way before you get to yours . This could all be happening against a backdrop of being a poor provider , being obese or being ill-equipped for the task at hand . <p> The woman will stray if she deliberately or accidentally meets him at a point of need . At this point , all common sense escapes the woman and she becomes a helpless addict going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain why women have been known to leave the leafy suburbs to diligently visit a bedsitter in the rather seedy side of town . It all boils down to how good the lay is , especially compared with what she has to work with at home . <p> Women have been getting side action since time immemorial mainly because they tend to be more discreet and calculating than men . So whenever a woman is caught like the one in the video , it is either because she is incredibly careless , hopelessly hooked on the pleasure drug the man is giving her or she is just trying to make a point to her cuckolded and limp partner .

For example , of whether the Somali , Kalenjin , Luhya or Mijikenda consider themselves as a single community in the political arena , or whether different leaders manage to mobilise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while national elections are characterised by clear ethnic voting patterns , some ethnic groups ( such as the Kikuyu and Luo ) have historically been more united than others ( such as the Luhya and Somali ) . The implication , once again , is that the salience of ethnic identities is not an explanation , but instead , always needs to be explained . <p> NOT ALWAYS <p> Fourth , while patronage and direct assistance are clearly important , those who spend the most do not always win . Instead , other factors -- such as people 's evaluations of an individual 's development performance or oratory skills , or their religion , class , and gender -- are clearly important . <p> So how can one best explain ethnic voting patterns ? <p> In my opinion , the answer lies in a combination of what Susanne Mueller has called " exclusionary ethnicity " or who will " not get power and control the state 's resources " ; and what I have called , " speculative loyalty " , or a calculation of the potential advantages of electing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular ' others ' out and of voting for " one of your own " -- is shaped both by history and by popular perceptions of how others will behave . <p> With regards to the former , a sense that some communities have been marginalised , renders it rationale to support " one of your own " as a way to address historical injustices . At the same time , a sense that some have enjoyed disproportionate benefits from having " one of their own " in power , means that members of such communities -- even if they do not feel that they have personally benefited -- may fear the rise to power of an ethnic ' other ' lest resources be redirected to others . <p> This ensures that many issues and policies gain an ethnic logic , as a focus on trickle-down growth , for example , is often seen to favour those communities whose areas are already relatively developed . <p> In turn , while many Kenyans would prefer politics to be non-ethnic , their behaviour is influenced by how they believe others will behave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the 2007 election , Michael Bratton and Mwangi Kimenyi found " that Kenyans do not easily trust co-nationals who hail from ethnic groups other than their own " and that " they worry that their co-nationals are prone to organise politically along exclusive ethnic lines and to govern in discriminatory fashion " . <p> FURTHER ENTRENCHED <p> Unfortunately , such perceptions only seem to have become further entrenched in the last decade -- as Kenyans experienced the post-election violence of 2007-2008 -- and as politics became increasingly polarised in the post-2010 context . <p> This understanding of ethnic voting has at least three implications . First , it means that a high level of political scepticism about the motivations of others encourages many to vote ethnically because they believe that this is how the majority of Kenyans will behave . <p> Second , it means that leaders can not simply rely on votes from their communities , or buy them , but have to persuade their co-ethnics to vote for them . In short , politicians need to present themselves as strong representatives of community . <p> Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily be reinterpreted as an attack on an entire community , as marginalisation of the former is often feared to herald the marginalisation of the latter . <p> Gabrielle Lynch is associate professor of comparative politics , University of Warwick , the United Kingdom and columnist , Saturday Nation . 
@@17224239 <p> The National Super Alliance ( Nasa ) figure heads of Kalonzo Musyoka , Musalia Mudavadi , Raila Odinga , and Moses Wetang'ula have been tiptoeing around each other , avoiding eye contact and not saying who among them shall be the presidential candidate . <p> If you asked me , Odinga is the man . Only Odinga offers real change from Jomo 's son , in political ideology and praxis . <p> The rest are Uhuru 's political stepbrothers who were chaperoned by retired President Daniel arap Moi , who socialised them into pro-systemic conformity , out of which they seem unable to outgrow . <p> Musyoka , Mudavadi and Wetang'ula are reactionaries who have previously and repeatedly been readily seduced by the senior Moi 's errand boys to commit political kamikazes supposedly against revolutionary politicians of Odinga 's pedigree , the same Odinga who has been packaged and sold as the political bogeyman of especially the Bantus of central Kenya and Nilotes of the great Rift Valley . <p> Again , Musyoka and Mudavadi have previously postured towards opposition unity , only to capitulate for reward ; Mudavadi in 2002 and 2013 , Musyoka in 2007 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-term political relevance , even among their contemporaries . <p> Now that their little game is up , Musyoka and Mudavadi hope to salvage their political image by hovering around Odinga , not because they believe in what he believes in , but because of a vain hope that Odinga will funnel his rock-solid voter base to them the way he did to Kibaki 15 years ago . <p> Their hope is nourished by the analytically lazy myth currently circulated by Jubilee supporters that Odinga can never be elected President of Kenya and they are now trailing Odinga like the proverbial hyenas . <p> POLITICAL CONSISTENCY <p> They are disappointed that the Odingaphobia that they took part in propagating is turning into Odingaphilia , thanks to his political consistency and capacity for reinvention , traits that the **27;200;TOOLONG triumvirate can only wish for .

Odinga and Musyoka have relatively experienced and financially endowed supporters as governors and senators as a bonus . Mudavadi and Wetang'ula have little to offer in numbers -- Odinga can get the Luhyia votes without them -- and they have more time at other levels to grow their political pedigree . Perhaps Mudavadi can still earn national constituency as Speaker of the National Assembly , Wetang'ula as the Majority Leader in the Senate .

Jamie Vardy 's incessant chasing of lost causes brought about error after error , and it was the England international 's persistence that brought about the opening goal , winning a free-kick on the edge of the box that Riyad Mahrez expertly picked Wes Morgan out with at the back post . <p> That would have been enough to carry the Premier League champions through , but when Leicester are on their game they are relentless in attack .

( Photo : Courtesy ) <p> For years , Campbell Bridges fought off death threats over his ranch , from where tsavorite , the gemstones he discovered , lie aplenty <p> The day was warm and the skies clear . There was no hint of wind in Kibanga Ranch . Those who were there say the specks on the ground sparkled in the boisterous sun and you could hear hyenas talk . <p> But as evening approached , years of intimidation and politics of ' us versus them ' finally caught up with then 71-year old Campbell Bridges , owner and operator of Kibanga Ranch , one of the few places in the world in which Tsavorite , a precious stone is mined . <p> For years , Mr Bridges had survived a war for the control of his mine , living through numerous death threats .

Campbell was born in the UK , but had lived in Africa for most of his life . He had mined in the area since 1967 , worked for the Central Mining and Investment Corporation and secured credit for discovering tsavorite . He had discovered the brilliant dark green gemstone in the 1960s on the border with Tanzania , reputedly when he landed in a trench after being chased by a buffalo . <p> That day , a group of about a dozen men attacked him , his son and a few of his workers in a bloody ambush at an illegally erected road block on his property . The effects of that attack were to last a lifetime for some and mark the end of a life for him . <p> A group of between eight and 10 men , all of whom he knew , came running down a nearby hill towards them . Those who witnessed the attack said the attackers took out whistles and started blowing them before more people , who were also armed with clubs and knives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a surprise . For close to a month , events around the tsavorite mine indicated that it was only a matter of when the attack would happen . Not if . Days before his murder , Bridges had accosted trespassers on his mine who , court documents show , ignored his order to vacate and in return threatened to kill him if he did not allow them to continue mining , albeit , illegally . <p> On August 6 , following numerous complaints from the Bridges , the Commissioner of Mining issued an order declaring the Bridges the legally recognised holders of an exclusive prospecting licence on the 1,500 acre ranch . The commissioner also sent an eviction notice to one of the mining companies illegally laying claim to the ranch and gave it a two week ultimatum to vacate . <p> In fact , a day before his murder , Bridges had recorded a statement at the Wundanyi police station over the trespass , death threats and constant calls from unknown people to his mobile phone .

Tsavorite was almost solely mined and distributed by Bridges ' company , which counted American jeweler Tiffany 's among its clients . The family says there was immense pressure from local politicians for them to sell their mining rights to them or abandon it altogether . <p> All this culminated in that Tuesday afternoon ambush when time , for a moment , stood still as Bridges , his son Bruce and several of their workers stared back on their attackers . Police statements from those at the scene detail how Bridges lost his life . <p> One of the attackers went at him with a spear , but the 71-year-old pushed it aside with his left hand , opening up that same side to a subsequent attack .

Although the arrest was speedy , the murder trial was a long and protracted affair that lasted five years . <p> In 2014 , four individuals convicted of the murder were slapped with a 40-year jail term . <p> The Bridges , however , say that they believe that there was more than enough evidence to convict an additional three perpetrators originally charged but later acquitted , and that there were two politicians of high position who ought to have been convicted . <p> " We are thankful for the four convictions and their sentencing .

@@17873231 <p> In December 2016 , I announced my decision to run for election as President of the Republic of Kenya . The pronouncement came after almost a long reflection on the terrible state of the circus that characterizes our country 's politics , which is today driven by the scourges of corruption and tribalism . <p> Over time , leadership and by extension the presidency , have become a matter of who can galvanize the tribal numbers or groupings using vast amounts of unexplained , and many times illegally obtained , finance . To effectively mount a bid for the presidency , most aspirants have fallen into the temptation to play by the same rules . In the prevailing state of affairs , our own history has shown us that the natural consequence of a disputed presidential election will be violence , if not outright civil war . <p> This state of affairs does n't bother many Kenyans , as over time , they have been conditioned to live in hope that they will be on the winning ( eating meat ) side . Indeed , Jubilee 's campaign platform is built around the economic opportunities that come with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for party nominations will be given state jobs . Matters are complicated today by Jubilee 's premature campaign message is that it has already won 70% +1 of the votes , and the opposition 's ( Cord and NASA ) reply is that they will not accept a stolen election . A reminder , in case of a dispute , KENYANS WILL ALL LOSE , IT IS A ZERO SUM GAME ! <p> Just how badly Kenya is doing politically , is graphically revealed in a sample of the results of recent nationwide poll conducted by the Jesuit Hakimani Centre ( a Catholic Church institution ) , and published on 30th March 2017 , as follows : <p> a ) 80.3% of the respondents did not believe that electing credible leaders was a personal and constitutional responsibility . <p> b ) 88.3% of the respondents did not find the connection between election and issues . <p> c ) 90.3% of the respondents viewed party manifestos as " public relations rhetoric " only meant for campaigns . <p> d ) 76% of the respondents are of the view that more education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the respondents do not approve of how corruption is addressed . <p> Our country needs a fresh approach to tackling the twin evils of corruption and tribalism , which not only divide , but will eventually destroy us . As Kenyans , we need to remove from power the increasing number of politicians and oligarchs who thrive and profit from the destruction of the delicate national fabric that holds us together . What has been sadly lacking in our top leadership is the political will to resolve the problems . <p> Many have asked me how I intended to solve the two deeply entrenched problems , and my short answer has always been ; my honesty , courage and commitment to good governance coupled with my non-tribal approach is all I would need as an executive president to place our country back on its path to prosperity , and greatness . <p> Articles 10 and 73 of our constitution that prescribes the national values and principles of governance as well as the requirements of leadership for holding public office have been consigned to the dustbin . <p> The voting public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society , have fallen prey to this addictive corruption driven electioneering , and have been conditioned to look forward to the largesse through voter bribery that comes with elections , simply as a means of buying an extra packet of unga . Such voters have learnt to expect and demand hard cash as a condition to participate in campaigns at all levels , including attending rallies . The catch words to describe funding campaign activities are " mobilise and facilitate " . Nothing comes for free . For the middle and upper classes , in many cases , it is a question of which side their bread is buttered . <p> One of the managers in my campaign recently requested me to stop admitting to the public that I did not have the billions of shillings that other leading presidential candidates had at their disposal . He stated that I would get no support at all if I was candid about my limited finances . I replied that we were campaigning on a platform of integrity and honesty , to which he stated that it was important to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg , borrow or steal in order to conform . As a last try , he asked me whether I would accept funds from a drug lord and saw his disappointment at my emphatic NO ! He left soon thereafter in search of a more lucrative campaign . Such is Kenyan politics . <p> There is a whole industry of service providers for election campaigns , all of who assume that the candidates running for office , have come upon limitless funding , and therefore should splash it around without insisting on value for services . It is evident that this feeding frenzy is informed by the fact that significant amounts of the available cash spent during elections in Kenya generally comes from proceeds of corruption , crime , including narcotics trafficking for which no accounting will be required . Almost all service providers to the electioneering industry suddenly present all manner of products at inflated rates . <p> Large sections of the print and electronic media spend four years playing an oversight role over government , and society generally , but in the countdown to elections on the 5th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfortunate purveyors of all things negative to society . Cash handouts determine the direction , extent and flow of news coverage . The Kenya media must restore its credibility , and continue to cover and critique all sides in the political contest . <p> The presidential campaign in Kenya is largely driven by negative tribalism . The main formations coalesce around a tribal leader , after which , everyone else is a traitor or spoiler . Tribalism has today risen to the point where many Kenyans ( 28% ) have declared that they will not vote , to protest against the perceived choices , which they consider indistinguishable from one another , in their negative attributes . <p> This negative voter sentiment transforms to apathy in the belief , sometimes justified , that the outcome is predetermined , by an electoral system that is neither free nor fair .

I insisted that all that Kenyans needed was a credible option , of a candidate who historically had proven him or herself as non tribal and not corrupt .

The IEBC , the official referee in the general elections , has set the official campaign commencement date as June 28 , 2017 . However , President Kenyatta , for the last year or so , has led the country on premature and illegal campaigns . The opposition candidates have reacted by giving chase , so as not to be left behind . Recently , when I requested the IEBC to order a stop to the unlawful campaigns , the lame response from the Chairman was that IEBC had no capacity to enforce the regulation on campaign timelines . <p> Generally , IEBC appears to already have lost control of a contest , which to many , has become a matter of life and death , going by the prevalence of violence . <p> Kenyans should note as follows : <p> i ) This violation of the election rules constitutes grounds for challenging the eventual outcome in the Supreme Court . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to obey , with impunity , we will end up in anarchy and chaos . <p> iii ) The rationale behind the limited period for electioneering worldwide , is designed to ensure minimum disruption to a country 's social and economic affairs . This is particularly true for developing countries , like Kenya , where elections are extremely disruptive . <p> iv ) Failure by IEBC to enforce the limitation to the campaign period is likely to result in tribalism , clanism , and even general competition being inflamed to the point of violence . Kenyans only need to refer back to the PEV in 2008 , and its catastrophic consequences . <p> As matters stand , the lawfully permitted 5 weeks of official campaigns will be very costly . To conduct campaigns for several months is unsustainable for any bona fide candidate , of modest and accountable means . Tragically , most Kenyans do not financially support political causes , and only do so when it appears likely to be successful . Matters have been further complicated by the ever-changing IEBC timelines , making it difficult to plan or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rule of law , I would be remiss if I joined the bandwagon of bending and breaking the law governing the election process , particularly campaigns . A government led by me would ensure the strict enforcement of the election laws and campaign regulations to minimize interference with the lives and economic activities of the Kenyans . <p> In addition , on the December 6 , 2016 , upon declaring my candidature for the presidency , I immediately requested the Mr. Boinett the Inspector General of Police ( IG ) for the provision of an armed police bodyguard for my personal security , both as a former Director of Public Prosecutions and a presidential candidate . Despite attaching a letter from Hon. Uhuru Kenyatta , as then Chairman of PAC dated February 28 , 2006 , and a letter 1st March 2006 from the Amos Wako , the then AG , directing that I should be provided with adequate security , the IG summarily , and casually , rejected my request on grounds that it was not within an alleged police policy to provide me with a bodyguard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presentation of nomination papers to IEBC , sometime in May 2017 . <p> I protested , indicating that the failure by the IG to provide me with security was , inter alia , discriminatory , and the application of double standards , but to no avail . Subsequently , assurances by the Mr Nkaissery , CS Interior and National Coordination that the matter would be looked into , not surprisingly , have come to naught . <p> The lack of personal security has therefore prevented me from traversing ( not necessarily holding campaign rallies ) the country like all other presidential candidates and party leaders , to market UDM as a political party , or my candidature generally , given the current violent nature of campaigns , political activity , and insecurity in the country generally . In most cases , pictures have been published of the politicians ( including opposition ) being protected , or whisked to safety by their police bodyguards . Why have I been denied security ? What is unique about my case ? Whose interest is the IG serving ? <p> It is clear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ensure that , for security reasons , I would not be able to engage in any political activity at all . The effect being that I would only have myself to blame , if I exposed myself to risk . The irony of the IGs decision is that all other aspiring presidential candidates have adequate government security , whether currently serving in government or not . <p> The upshot is that , having reflected , and consulted with my family , friends and supporters , with profound regret , I have decided to pull out of the 2017 presidential race . I however assure Kenyans that this is not the end of my determination to bring about positive , corruption free , detribalised politics to our country . I end with a quote from an American Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina , in the recent US elections ; <p> " This campaign was always about our citizenship -- taking back our country from a political class that serves only the big , the powerful , the wealthy and well connected . Election after election , the same empty promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but nothing changes . While I suspend my candidacy today , will continue to travel this country and fight for those Americans who refuse to settle for the way things are and a status quo that no longer works for them . " <p> So , too , as I suspend my candidacy , I assure all Kenyans that I will continue the difficult journey of pushing for the awakening our citizens to the critical need for radical change if we as a nation are to survive and return to the path of prosperity , self-respect and patriotism . I remain a member of UDM and shall continue to support all its activities , and I encourage aspirants to seek nomination through the party for all categories of elective positions . <p> In the meantime , I thank the many Kenyans I met along the relatively short but difficult journey and who encouraged and supported my quest to bring about positive change to the politics of our great country .

There are many disadvantages of conceiving shortly after a recent pregnancy , with poor health implications for you and your newborn . <p> Following delivery , the potential to conceive may return even before your periods resume . If you are breastfeeding , there is a natural protection mechanism that kicks in to prevent ovulation , but it 's not foolproof .

If breastfeeding , hormonal contraceptives containing estrogens ( commonly called the ' combined pill ' ) should be avoided as they interfere with milk production .

You will get a basic assessment of your prevailing health , and future reproduction plans . It may be that you are suitable for any of the methods available . <p> You will have a choice of short-term or longer-term methods . The longer-term methods give you more flexibility , as you do n't have to remember to take any pills daily , and they keep you protected for several years . <p> Contraception can be commenced as soon as you deliver , and before leaving the hospital .

The longer you wait , the more you are putting yourself at risk of an unplanned pregnancy . <p> Modern contraceptives are very effective . But the effectiveness of short-term methods is limited by the user . We are talking of pills , injectables and patches . If you forget to take your pills , or to change a patch , or miss out on the injection when due , then your protection declines . You should find a way of reminding yourself when the next pill or injection is due . There are plenty of Apps that you can use . If you are the forgetful type , go for the long-term methods . <p> Once a new pregnancy is desired , all you need is to discontinue using contraception .

Most of the Chinese industries that export a lot of goods to us were organised in an almost similar fashion to Jua Kali but upscaled to a level that enables them to gain international exposure . We , too , can do it . <p> Some of the systems in the informal sector are cartels in nature , making entry difficult and resulting in a crime-prone and exploitative environment . <p> To ensure it is profitable and productive enough , there is a need to have policies that are well implemented to bring order and open up markets .

@@18577232 <p> Mombasa Jubilee governor hopeful Suleiman Shahbal has dismissed reports that Kenya 's debt is massive and will lead to an economic crisis . <p> Opposition leaders and members of the public have expressed concern that the country is over-borrowing and repayment will be a challenge . <p> The country 's debt has hit a record Sh4 trillion and it is not clear whether some of the loans are concessional or commercial . <p> If commercial , economic experts say the country is doomed because it will pay more and this will pose a great threat to an economy , whose growth slumped by 0.4 per cent in 2016 , to 5.5 per cent this year . Already , 20 per cent of the national budget is used for offsetting loans . <p> But Shahbal said the debt is manageable and that what matters is not whether the loans are concessional or commercial , but if they bring about transformation . <p> " Everyone prays for concessional loans , but they do n't get them , " he said . <p> Concessional loans are issued by the Development Finance Institution and non-governmental finance organisations .

The government borrowed to fund these projects . <p> " The key thing is if the country can afford to repay the debt . Yes it can . Do n't get upset about the Sh3 billion or Sh4 billion being borrowed .

The international benchmark is that the ratio should not exceed the 50 per cent mark . <p> " If this happens , the country should be worried but we are not yet there , " he said . <p> He said the country spent about Sh327 billion for the SGR Mombasa-Nairobi phase , unlike Ethiopia , which spent far less because there was land compensations . <p> " In Ethiopia , the government owns all the land .

Opinion is divided among the political coalitions on whether the leading flag bearers should embrace the support of the Independent candidates . <p> Whereas the Deputy President openly acknowledged and accepted the support of this group , the NASA principals , while appearing on different platforms , have categorically asked their supporters to shun them . In fact , ANC party leader Musalia Mudavadi asked the Independent candidates to quit the race in favour of those who have party tickets . <p> Those denouncing the independent candidates need to be reminded that in politics , every vote counts . In a democracy like ours -- which puts the presidential threshold very high ( 50% + 1 ) there is need for anyone who aspires to be president to harvest all the possible support that can come his/her way . <p> So to openly denounce a huge constituency on grounds that you want to be seen to be supporting the very same people who benefited from the unfair party primaries is not only unacceptable but immoral . <p> In asking their supporters to vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he does the votes of the independent candidates who are also voters , besides controlling some constituency even if it is at household level ) . <p> Why would , for instance , an independent candidate cast his/her vote for a presidential candidate who is busy decampaigning him/ her ? On this one , the enigma is wrong and should be asked to reconsider his stand . NASA should borrow a leaf from their chief competitor , President Kenyatta who has been on a Gather All Scatter None mission , whereby he has been embracing support from any fringe party that has shown interest in adopting him as their presidential candidate . <p> I humbly submit that it is indeed in the interest of Raila Odinga and Uhuru Kenyatta to have these independent candidates compete fairly with their rivals . They should instead openly say that they are ready to work with whoever the people will elect as long as the presidential votes are put in one basket . <p> This will not only energise their base but also provide all the supporters with an incentive to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their choice , they would be casting their ballot for the president too . Am not a prophet of doom nor a son of one , but I dare say that without doing so , voter apathy will be a reality and with that , #10MillionStrong will remain a mirage . <p> Finally , the country needs to demystify the notion of 6-piece voting . It has be argued that in Kenya , people vote for parties rather than individuals . The risk of doing so is stifling democracy . <p> People should be elected on the basis of how best they are suited to tackle the socio-economic challenges affecting their constituents but not on the basis of possessing a party ticket which could have been fraudulently obtained .

This is the day when Kenya attained internal self-rule from the British . As a country , we have made great strides , recently launching the standard gauge railway , the biggest infrastructural project Kenya has undertaken since Independence . <p> Apart from a few African countries that are rising , the situation is gloomy and heartbreaking . How can we as a people confront the demons of disease , ignorance and hunger without dwelling on a painful past ? <p> The common half-truth narrative that has been packaged and sold to Africans is that everything that afflicts this continent right now is because of the white man . It 's partly true , that the current status of Africa was engineered by the West so that they can continue to exploit our resources . But it 's a statement that is also stuffed with tonnes of misrepresentations . <p> Some African leaders who took over power after the colonialists left ransacked their countries . They looted the public coffers and built empires that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ' have defaulted on the promises that they gave their citizens 50 years ago .

For the last 30 years , Africa has been the captain of her ship . <p> The four Asian Tigers of Hong Kong , Singapore , South Korea and Taiwan were just like many African countries ; colonised and messed up . Yet these regions are now industrialised countries providing hope to their citizenries . <p> The difference between Asian tigers and Africa is that while they focused on nation building , our leaders focused on personal pocket building . The inequalities you see today in Africa are as a result of the insatiable greed that many founding fathers had . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorest in the world yet they are some of the highest paid leaders in the world .

The idea is to awaken the African pride so that we can finally rise up and accomplish the latent potential that lies within us . While I am supportive of the idea that we need to unearth our history and remind the masses of who we are , we should also do more .

Why then do n't we learn from their mistakes and sprint ahead of them ? <p> The change we desperately need will not roll in and take residence on our laps . We must continuously struggle to free ourselves . If not from the white colonialists and neo-colonialists , it must be from our fellow elite black colonisers who have insatiable appetites for national resources . <p> Let the young people across Africa rise up and take positions of leadership .

You only give the money to the stockbroker ; they trade for you and give you the profits later on . <p> Once you give out your money , you become a sleeping partner and the company becomes active . Later on you get profits and dividends . The initial capital you gave , which is your money , is protected . <p> Nowadays there are regulations from the CMA and the NSE that protect shareholders in case a company goes under . <p> Be bold <p> When you want to invest , you have to have some confidence about it . When I started out , I would invest half of my salary in shares .

We depend on them for whatever we do ; buying and selling . <p> Nowadays they are found within banks , which have taken over stock broking through subsidiaries and it is the best way because they keep money and can not be broke . <p> If the stock broker is weak , the bank supports the brokerage side with its own money , unlike before when it was done by companies owned by individual people who would sometimes lose money . Banks have departments to advise you and departments of selling and buying . <p> Buy while the prices are low <p> The best time to invest is when the company prices are low .

Performance of a company also depends on the CEOs and Finance Directors . <p> Business news reports in the press also let you know which individuals are doing well and which ones are not . <p> Keep them on their toes <p> You do this by asking questions . I ask so many questions and sometimes I call companies I have invested in , wanting to talk to CEOs and they give me a chance . <p> AGMs are must attend events for me as it gives me the opportunity to continue asking questions . <p> I tell them what I would like to understand and they explain to me , and sometimes they do that so that you do not take touchy questions to the public domain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the AGMs and meetings where companies announce results , they will give you a big booklet that has balance sheets , cash flow statements , profit and loss statements and so on . <p> I did accounting in 1965 , so I know a bit of it .

@@19344234 <p> But close control and monitoring of the behaviour of a spouse is known to be an important warning sign for physical and emotional violence in a relationship . <p> The most destructive of emotions , jealousy , often flares with such intensity that is blurs the lines of rationality in the brain , pushing us to extreme or uncharacteristic outbursts , and creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that pushes away the very person one desires the most . <p> Data from the Kenya Demographic and Health Survey ( 2014 ) reveals that jealousy is highly prevalent in marital relationships in Kenya , expressed in the form of getting angry when your spouse talks to a person of the opposite sex , frequent accusations of unfaithfulness , trying to limit your partner 's contact with family , or not allowing the spouse to meet their same-sex friends , and insisting on knowing where your partner is at all times . <p> The researchers say the concentration of such behaviour is more noteworthy than the display of any single one , and so a partner having three or more specified actions above would be a red flag . <p> About a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15-49 surveyed said their spouses displayed three or more of these controlling habits -- the most common was jealousy or anger if they talked to other men ( 53 per cent ) of women said their men got jealous or angry ) , followed by insisting on knowing where they were at all times ( 41 per cent ) . <p> The next common ones were husbands who frequently accused them of being unfaithful ( 23 per cent ) and do n't allow them to meet their female friends ( 21 per cent ) . About 11 per cent of women said that their husbands tried to limit contact with their family . <p> The women were then asked if they were ever afraid of their husbands or partners . Notably , among women who said that they were afraid of their husbands most of the time , the proportion who report that their husbands display three or more of these controlling habits is twice as high ( 53 per cent ) than among all women in general . <p> Jealous husbands are most common in Coast and Nairobi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ displayed three or more controlling traits . <p> The relationship between jealousy , education and wealth was more mixed , with women earning cash salaries more likely to experience jealousy from their spouses , compared to those who were unemployed or were employed but not paid in cash . <p> But jealousy is n't a preserve of men , women in Kenya too , are possessive , get angry if their men speak to other women , and try and limit a man 's contact with his family and friends . <p> What is interesting is that the data suggests that women are more likely than men to display at least one controlling behaviour . What is different is that women are less likely to escalate their jealousy and go ahead to display three or more controlling traits . <p> For male respondents , 22 per cent of them report being in a relationship where the wife or partner displays three or more controlling habits . This , interestingly , is just slightly lower than women who report the same ( 24.5 per cent ) , which means jealousy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Similar to women , the main controlling behaviour men ( 58 per cent ) experience from their wives were jealousy and anger if they talked to other women , even higher than women who reported the same at 53 per cent , and their wives insisting on knowing where they were at all times ( 43 per cent , again higher than women who reported the same at 41 per cent ) . <p> One in three ( 30 per cent ) of men reported that their women frequently accused them of being unfaithful , but wives were much less likely than husbands to try and limit their spouse 's contact with friends and family , because all men have much more physical mobility than women -- men , socially and culturally , are not expected to stay in the house , they should be " out there " looking for money . With this , women 's controlling habits in total are less than that of men . <p> Men in their early twenties ( 33 per cent ) ) and men who live in the Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report that their partners display three or more controlling traits . <p> Intriguingly , the more educated a man is , the more likely he is to report controlling behaviour from his wife -- the wife 's jealousy lowest among men with no education compared to those with some education ( 14 percent compared with 22-23 percent ) , possibly because the " patriarchal ideal " of a dominant man is less held less strongly as education increases . But the effect of wealth is more mixed . <p> Psychological view <p> But where does jealousy come from , and why does it torment human relationships so ? Psychologists often pin it on poor attachment styles , where , from infancy , a person has not learned to love and be loved in secure ways . Instead , they are prone to anxiety in love , and will act out those distressing feelings that are really about the fear of abandonment . <p> But some argue it may be a " necessary evil " , a survival mechanism that has its roots in our evolutionary past . Its purpose was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our survival as a social species . <p> It serves a potential deterrent to infidelity that arises in both men and women , a form of social coercion that arose to keep men from the reproductive dead-end of investing his finite resources in raising some other man 's children , and women from losing the commitment and material provision of a man . <p> Still , psychologists say that jealousy may be losing its utility in modern , contemporary life , more useful to our ancestors than us . Our society is more prosperous and abundant , so " locking down " one person 's total attention is really not a matter of life and death , unlike in centuries past where hardship was the norm . <p> Instability <p> Now , jealousy is being seen more as a personality issue , and has been linked with neuroticism , or emotional instability , the liability to such unpleasant emotions as anger , anxiety , and depression . The higher the level of instability , the more one is prone to jealousy . <p> " The formula for jealousy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " is an insecure person times an insecure relationship . " But it 's insecure people who tend to destabilise relationships and make them insecure . And a person who is very insecure is not just sexually jealous but jealous of any kind of friendship or even of a child -- " anything that takes attention off them , " he adds . <p> It 's a mistake to assume that jealousy always involves love , argues Aaron Ben-Ze'ev , a philosopher who heads Israel 's University of Haifa , also quoted in the article written by Hara Estroff Marano . <p> " A man who despises his wife may nevertheless become jealous when someone else looks covetously at her . Here the central feature is losing to a rival . " In this case , he insists , jealousy is much more about power and selfishness than love . <p> People indeed use jealousy as a signal -- to try to control their partner .

Michel Jansen , Managing Director of Total Produce B.V. , which is located in Waalhaven , Rotterdam , had the floor this time . This company is one of the largest players in Europe when it comes to importing fruit from overseas . <p> A clustering of companies , government , and knowledge institutions is needed to achieve , inter alia , multi-modality , ease of control and digitalisation . Co-operation has become even more important . This is due to the arrival of alternative import markets , a growing local market , the demand for cost-effective distribution , and providing sustainable transportation solutions . <p> The transport revolutionTransport is going to , undoubtedly , evolve even further in the coming years . Other modalities are being developed as road transport becomes increasingly difficult and unreliable , and the environment is playing an increasingly important role . Think of , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and short sea connections . Rotterdam is better suited for these than other ports . If Rotterdam works on it and helps facilitate these , it will put the port in an even better position . " We are still at the beginning of these developments . Few trains have electrical connection in order to , for example , keep products cool . There are not enough lines available . There have to be terminals at the right places . The amount of fruit and vegetables that are transported by these alternative modalities is very small .

This means goods are received in the port in an efficient manner and are then transported inland via a fine tuned network . Rotterdam has no influence on the export market outside of Europe . Rotterdam can , however , ensure that a product goes to Rotterdam and not , for example to Antwerp .

This is something we need to improve on . " <p> The ideal future image of regional logisticMichel Jansen 's wish is that : " The port of Rotterdam becomes the starting point of AGF distribution of agro-logistics within a large part of Europe . " This offers a huge competitive edge for businesses in the port of Rotterdam . Customs and Quality Control must be done in a flexible manner to ensure that the port of Rotterdam is , at the very least , as efficient as other ports in this regard . The multi-modular network ultimately provides choices and better alternatives to road transport . More sustainable transport solutions can also be offered to clients . This choice can be made depending on the need : sustainability , cost of speed . <p> Good logistical services benefit from large volumes , combinations and heavy flows .

The most important thing , they said they would amend the Constitution so that four people can get positions and they say Kenya has a hybrid system . Those changes will cost Kenyans Sh20 billion " <p> - Aden Duale at a Jubilee Rally in Machakos County on July 4 , 2017 <p> The National Assembly Majority Leader , Adan Duale , was speaking in Swahili in Machakos County , and referred to the manifesto launched by the opposition National Super Alliance ( Nasa ) . Jubilee has claimed that the positions proposed by Nasa would require a referendum to implement . <p> The procedure for amending the constitution is laid out in Chapter Sixteen . Article 255 ( 1 ) of the constitution says a referendum is necessary if a constitutional amendment relates to : <p> ( d ) the national values and principles of governance referred to in Article 10 ( 2 ) ( a ) to ( d ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ( f ) the term of office of the President ; <p> ( g ) the independence of the Judiciary and the commissions and independent offices to which Chapter Fifteen applies ; <p> ( h ) the functions of Parliament ; <p> ( i ) the objects , principles and structure of devolved government ; or <p> ( j ) the provisions of Chapter Sixteen . <p> Amending the Constitution to create the positions of Premier Cabinet Secretary and two positions of Deputy Premier Cabinet Secretary , in addition to the existing positions of President and Deputy President would not touch on any of the conditions in Article 255 ( 1 ) , and so a referendum would be unnecessary . <p> It is also possible to appoint co-principals of Nasa into the Cabinet without creating the positions in the Constitution , though they would require the approval of the National Assembly , as happened with Najib Balala and Charity Ngilu in 2013 . <p> So it is not necessary to have a referendum in order to create positions for Nasa co-principals , which means Mr Duale 's claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changes that are much more far-reaching than the creation of three positions . On Page 14 the manifesto states that Nasa will work with the Kenyan people to amend the Constitution : <p> " ... to provide for a hybrid executive system based on the Bomas Draft as a mechanism for enhancing cohesion . Nasa recognises that a directly elected president in a presidential system favours larger communities and encourages exclusivity " . <p> Presumably , based on this text , Nasa 's solution is to do away with , or balance , a directly elected presidency , which it finds unsuitable . <p> Newsplex accessed the Bomas Draft . The Bomas Draft envisioned a President and a Prime Minister , who was the head of government . The Prime Minister , who was responsible to Parliament , was supposed to coordinate the work of the ministries and the preparation of legislation and preside over meetings at Cabinet . <p> THE PEOPLE 'S SOVEREIGNTY <p> According to Mr Kibe Mungai , the changes proposed in the Nasa manifesto would satisfy two conditions of Article 255 that would make a referendum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people . <p> " The meaning of the people 's sovereignty , what they decide in an election , and the functions of Parliament , qualify the issue for a referendum , " he told Nation Newsplex . " In the current parliament , no one serves in the legislature and the executive at the same time . The function of Parliament is to check the President in a presidential system of government . But in a parliamentary system , parliament and the executive govern together . That is a fundamental change in everything " he said . In the Bomas Draft ministers were elected members of Parliament . <p> Under the Bomas Draft , the directly elected President would only be head of State , while head of government would be the Prime Minister , or the leader of the party with most votes in the National Assembly . That differs from the current situation where the President is both Head of State and Head of Government . <p> On the sovereignty of the people , he added : " The direct vote of the people decides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes the law . In a parliamentary system , the people do not decide who government is . It is parties who decide . The people in a parliamentary democracy do not decide who the chief executive is . That one is decided after the election , after we have known who the dominant party is . " <p> According to Prof Nzamba Kitonga , who chaired the Committee of Experts that produced the Harmonised draft of the constitution in 2009 , a referendum would be required to amend the constitution along the lines of a Bomas draft . <p> " Bomas Draft had both a parliamentary system of government with a prime minister and a presidential system as the head of executive . " <p> So how much will it cost ? <p> Mr Duale and other Jubilee politicians , including President Kenyatta , say the changes would cost Sh20 billion , although he does not say how he arrives at this figure . Newsplex has made an estimate . <p> In 2017 , there will 40,883 polling stations against the 27,689 polling stations of 2010 , and 12.6 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . <p> That means there are 1.4 times the number of constituencies , 1.5 times the number of polling stations and 1.5 times the number of voters this year as voted in the referendum . <p> Multiplying Sh7.2 billion by 1.5 gives Sh10.8 billion , without accounting for inflation or any other changes . <p> Newsplex looked at data from the World Bank to estimate the effect of inflation . Given that in recent years the consumer price index has increased by nine percentage points each year ( where 2010 is 100 ) , the Consumer Price Index for 2017 would be 168.6 , which means that money quoted in 2010 would now be worth 68 per cent more . That means Sh 10.8 billion would increase to Sh18 billion , which is lower than , but close to Sh20 billion . <p> On the other hand , if the referendum were carried out within a general election , all it would take to carry it out is adding another question to an already existing ballot , which would result in little extra cost . <p> While it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the lines of the Bomas Draft , it would not be necessary to provide jobs to the three Nasa co-principals . <p> Furthermore , although Sh20 billion mirrors previous spending in Kenya , it is not clear that money would have to be spent if the referendum were done within a larger general election . Therefore it is not possible to prove Mr Duale 's claims definitely .

Moses ( 50 ) clocked 49.6 seconds to cruise home ahead of Kenya 's Daniel Kimaiyo and Wilson Kibiego . PHOTO FILE NATION MEDIA GROUP <h> In Summary <p> In terms of star appearance , the greatest athletics event to take place on Kenyan soil happened on June 20 , 1979 . <p> It was a one-off , not as intended but as fate would have it . It paid homage to one of the planet 's great track nations , laid before our eyes a future pregnant with dreams but in the fullness of time only succeeded in leaving us with inerasable memories . <p> This was the Jomo Kenyatta Memorial Athletics Meeting . It was held on the marram track of the Nairobi City Stadium . <p> This name cropped up at the very last minute . Throughout the preparations , the Kenya Amateur Athletic Association , precursor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Special International Athletics Meeting . In fact , the meeting was also called the Jomo Kenyatta Memorial Games , never mind it was an athletics only event . <p> Two world heavyweights topped the card . One was Edwin Moses of the United States , then the world 400m hurdles champion , who was in his second of a ten-year uninterrupted winning streak . By the time he lost to fellow American Danny Harris in 1987 , he had run 122 races without defeat , to this day , history 's longest winning streak . <p> The other was our own Henry Rono , who was the holder of four world records in the 3,000m , 3,000m steeplechase , 5,000m and 10,000m . <h> Related Content <p> Yet Moses and Rono were just but part of a star-studded cast . Steve Williams of the USA was at the height of his powers as the world 's fastest man . He had run the 100 metres in a hand-timed 9.9 seconds and the 200 metres in 19.8 seconds . He was a member of the American team that had set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , naturally , the big gun in the sprints . <p> But the man with whom he had jointly set the world record in the 220 yards in 1975 , Jamaica 's Don Quarrie , was also here . Both had done 19.9seconds . They would raise the murram dust of the City Stadium in the 200m . Other sprinters on the cards were Ghana 's Ernest Obeng , the reigning African champion and Jerome Deal and Leon Coleman both of the United States . <p> The sprints card could not get heavier than that anywhere in the world . It is like having Usain Bolt and the best the world could throw at him and Jamaica in this age . And it was all happening inside the grey walls of the Nairobi City Stadium behind which the old Mombasa train was blowing its whistle and people were eating nyama choma and drinking Tusker Export beer at Kanyim 's Bar in Kaloleni . <p> The middle and long distances were just as strong . The leading distance runners at that time were Alberto Salazar , today Nike Oregon Project coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found Salazar one of the most pleasant people to interview -- but more about that later . Both Salazar and Chapa were here and we smelt a world record , what with Henry Rono properly invincible but the best of the rest wanting to end that enviable period of his career with immediate effect . <p> Mike Boit , one of Kenya 's most beloved athletes , was expected to spearhead the middle distance challenge in his specialty , the 800m . But in both that and the 1,500m , the United States had brought in heavy artillery . Evans White , Gerry Jones and Craig Masback were all in the top tier bracket in the world at that time . Their presence was sure to electrify the proceedings . <p> Any competition of this magnitude was always destined to give a cub reporter like me a blood rush . At that time , I was working for a Sunday broadsheet called The Nairobi Times published alongside the famed Weekly Review and the children 's magazine , Rainbow by the Nation Group 's first African Editor , Hilary Ng'weno @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I will be truthful with you . The man I was obsessed with -- over and above everybody else -- was Edwin Moses . I stalked him and finally tracked him down at his residence , the Pan Afric Hotel along Valley Road barely two hours before he was to go to the City Stadium . I must here tell you that getting to the City Stadium from the Pan Afric Hotel on an early Wednesday afternoon in 1979 was a breeze . Do n't imagine traffic jams , much less boda boda . <p> I found him in the garden restaurant . He was drinking ... ( ahem ! ) -- a Pilsner beer ! I was shocked . Just about the first question I asked him after introductions was , " how can this be ? " By my watch , competition time is ... goodness me ? An hour away ? He looked amused . And he did not directly address my concerns ; he gently steered me into asking him " good questions like -- his life , America , Kenya , the Jomo Kenyatta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so approachable , so polite , so respectful and so knowledgeable that you just had to love him as you would a dear family member . <p> This was the world champion , not so far from his race , apologizing if he had inconvenienced me in my search for him and expressing his privilege at my interviewing him . <p> Even at that age , I could read body language dispassionately . Moses came away to me to me as an honest man . The interview was short but he promised he would be available for me after his race . And he kept his promise -- giving me so much time , that I actually ran out of questions . But there is more before we get to that . He was pitted against our own Dan Kimaiyo . Apparently , Moses had n't researched our man . <p> At the same time , Kimaiyo must have been eating , drinking , breathing , coughing and sleeping nothing else but Edwin Moses . The race was horribly close . The 15,000 people inside our World War II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world over the one-lap obstacle distance almost lost to our unheralded village-mate . It was desperately close . <p> " Who was that guy ? " Moses kept asking journalists after the race . He did n't seem to be paying attention to the questions at first . All he really wanted to know was " who was that guy ? " But he gave his time to us . <p> He said : " I was not happy with my time . I was feeling the effects of the long travel . But I enjoyed the race . I have run on worse tracks than this one and I think I can do better next time . I would very much like to come back again and compete here one day before long . " <p> He made friendship with my colleague , Gishinga Njoroge and kept his promises . He came back the following year , ready to run . But guess what happened ? <p> KAAA officials did not even inform him that there was no second Jomo Kenyatta International Athletics Meeting . He came at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to find out from Gishinga what exactly the status was . Gishinga was a journalist , not a KAAA official . But he took it upon himself to apologise to Moses for all the trouble and expense . Moses took it all in his majestic stride . Of course , he never came back again -- and it was all out fault and loss . <p> However , thanks to the Jomo Kenyatta Memorial Meeting , of the finest people that my profession has given me the privilege to meet , I rank Edwin Moses among the highest . I can not forget the champion 's humility and his sincere bewilderment at an unexpected challenger . I met a great man unblemished by any hint of arrogance . And decades later , I appreciate the camaraderie with which he treated a 20-year-old reporter . <p> Alberto Salazar gave me an early lesson in politics . At the time I met him , I was a fan of the mercurial Cuban revolutionary leader , Fidel Castro . What I did n't know was that I was going to meet an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His race did n't go well and I wanted to know why . I waited for him to warm down . That is when Salazar told me his story . <p> Regarding the race , he said he had a stomach upset . In ordinary circumstances , he would have withdrawn before the competition started . But he had come from so far and he had liked the country so much that he felt the only right thing to do was to tough it out . I told him ' sorry ' , and he nodded with acceptance at my admiration for his endurance . <p> He told me that his father was an admirer of Fidel Castro but when the Cuban Revolution took a turn for Communism , his parents fled with him to the United States . They wanted freedom and raised him wanting freedom , he told me . Salazar spoke softly but compellingly . <p> He said he was happy to be in Kenya , a great athletic nation and that he looked forward to our brotherhood for years to come . I remember telling him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thank you for the time . " Alas , we have never met again ! <p> I have been reading stories about the queries he has been asked about doping lately but I hope , just for old times ' sake , that he is the same nice guy that I met as an athlete so long ago . I admired his endeavour , especially after he told me the truth of his situation . <p> Sorry , I have not given you many results of the first and only Jomo Kenyatta International Athletics Meeting . If space allowed me , I would have told you about our champion , James Atuti and the schoolgirl , Elizabeth Onyambu . I would have told you about Ruth Waithera and Rose Tata-Muya and many other stars who shone that day . But my space is limited . <p> So there you have it . Enjoy the World U-18s .

But after a while , Adam got bored of drinking milk , eating honey , chomping on fruits and , most important , swallowing the sukuma wiki that Eve boiled day after day . <p> Salt had not been discovered then , or Kimbo cooking fat and spices . So Eve 's sukuma wiki , much as it was boiled with love for the man she had no choice but to love , simply tasted like leaves . <p> But things would improve slightly when Adam discovered eggs . Scholars are not quite sure at what point he invented omelette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sukuma wiki , even though the crooks who advertise spices might say otherwise . <p> As usual , the devil crept up to Adam ( this guy had an annoying pre-occupation for entertaining the devil ) , pointed at a chicken and said : " See that thing doing kwe-kwe-kwe ? Strangle it . Eve will make stew . " <p> Adam obliged and wept with joy when he tasted ingokho for the first time . And so , before you could say ' animal rights ' , the fellow was hunting , roasting , boiling and munching every creature that crawled , walked or ran through the Garden of Eden . <p> I suspect it is at this point that he hatched up a conspiracy to sanitise his gruesome slaughter of animals by appointing himself prefect over them . In a couple of years , his children would spin the whole yarn further by claiming that man is more intelligent that animals . <p> This , by the way , is the excuse politicians , pastors and all manner of clever people employ to ' eat ' the less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we sharper than animals ? Evidence says otherwise . You will never find a bull mounting a two-month-old calf , yet ' more intelligent ' human beings rape tots and grannies . Rape by the way is non-existent in the ' daft ' animal kingdom . <p> Equally , a man , who is alleged to be smarter than a goat , can look at a female goat and go : " Mmm ... she has a juicy behind . " And yet no he goat worth its name would give a passing glance at a woman 's behind , even if it was stuffed with nylon bags for advertising and shaken for special effects . <p> That 's why I find it hard to believe that although we think we are cleverer than animals , we pay MCAs more money than an OCPD or doctor . <p> Even a hyena would have thought better . Speaking of which , there are no street kids in national parks . The so called greedy and daft hyenas always protect and care for their offspring .

FILE PHOTO NMG <p> Kenyan voters are being fed a daily diet of grand promises in the lead up to the country 's national elections . If either of the two main coalitions win power in polls scheduled for August 8 , citizens can look forward to free maternity services , free public secondary school , farm subsidies , lower food prices and much more . <p> For better or worse , the education sector has been the easy target of numerous campaign promises . Kenya 's two rival political coalitions are both promising free secondary school education if elected . It 's an attractive offer given that it could ease the financial burden of millions of vulnerable families . <p> The pledge is not without some controversy . The ruling Jubilee Party and the rival National Super Alliance ca n't seem to agree over who gave birth to the idea .

It was n't until 2003 , four decades later , that the promise finally became a reality . <h> Also Read <p> It is clear from the pronouncements made by both parties that not a lot of thought preceded the promises they are making and Kenyans are likely to be disappointed . In retrospect , the implementation of free basic education Kenyans reminds us that haphazard decisions have serious ramifications on the education sector and vulnerable members of society . <p> Already school heads are sounding the alarm bells .

Many are still waiting for the Jubilee government to deliver on its 2013 campaign pledge that more than a million learners would get free laptops in 2014 . <p> Among the challenges along the way included poor planning , procurement disputes and insecurity .

Some even claimed that Nigerian men pretend when they come to Kenya . <p> This writer spent a few days in Nigeria which gave her an opportunity to observe how the Naija brodas behave in their own country and truth be told they even spend more on their women . In fact , some of them confessed that it 's ' cheaper ' to maintain a Kenyan woman compared to Naija girls . We look at some of the reasons why Kenyan women are labeled ' cheap ' . <p> Open for valueless sex <p> To woo a Nigerian woman is a ceremony .

You might even end up buying a house for her before you can take her to bed , " Damilola said . <p> While Kenyan women can easily drown a bottle of Guinness a Nigerian will only drown a bottle of stout in her local . The moment a Nigerian woman walks into a club , there is man already ordering drinks for her . <p> Diana Bada a Russian born Nigerian musician who was in Kenya for a month agrees that Kenyan women are indeed different . <p> " In Nigeria it 's almost obvious that women do n't spend money in a night club .

They therefore offered us a car to drop us home and save us taxi money . We were even given clothes by the people who also own a fashion house . My friend almost had a heart attack thinking that the man wanted more . It took a lot of convincing for her to accept that that 's how women are treated in Nigeria , " Diana told us . <p> Socialites have single handedly convinced young girls that there is good life in Nigeria .

I 'm not saying that we are perfect maybe we are just difficult , " Folorunsho shared with us . <p> Confidence issues <p> Naija girls are very confident . In fact a man insults them for not being submissive they will easily defend themselves . Kenyan girls on the other hand are very reserved . According to Olamide Ojuon , he would date a Kenyan girl but never marry her . <p> " I just feel that Kenyan girls are not confident . I wish I could show you the messages I get from girls I have broken up with and how they react . They always ask where they went wrong .

" A man should provide for you , your friends and family if possible . That 's his responsibility . For a Naija babe to get with a man he must be willing to chop money . Is n't that she same in Kenya ? No romance without finance right ?

As my literature lecturer Prof Austin Bukenya often says , reading not only boosts brain power , it also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social media , millennials rarely engage their minds with in-depth reading that could expand their imagination , creativity and vocabulary . Dr Godwin Siundu , who teaches literature at the University of Nairobi says the Internet has engendered a kind of intellectual indolence in young learners . <p> ' ALL PROBLEMS ' <p> " The youth have formed the opinion that the internet provides answers to all problems , which is not the case . So Google is usually their first and last port of call when they are tasked with anything . This means that they can not go the long yet more productive route of personal imagination , or even the hard slogging of reading a novel from beginning to end . <p> " Generally , they can not form enduring reading and writing habits that are more functional and necessary in the world of work . Mainly because of this , they also have a limited vocabulary with which to express themselves . " <p> Dr Sam Kamau of the Aga Khan University takes a different view , saying millennials are not lazy and that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' LONG PROCESS ' <p> " Because of social media , young people do not appreciate the long process . They prefer summaries . With a swipe on their screens , they can get an idea of what 's happening in the lives of their friends by scanning their status updates and social media posts . They are not lazy , but they want things simplified , they do n't have to write it down because they can record or type it . They do n't want to wait because with technology they can get their answers pretty fast . " <p> Dr Kamau feels that the older generation has failed to understand the youth and has , therefore , taken the easier option of condemning them . <p> " The digital natives are willing to experiment , seek and embrace new ideas . They are creative and inquisitive and quite often frustrated when the world is too organised . They are misunderstood because they do not fit in the traditional conventions .

So they run into real problems when they have to write in academic terms , missing out on sentence construction , grammar and all . Generally , they can not form enduring reading and writing habits that are more functional and necessary in the world of work . Mainly because of this , they also have a limited vocabulary with which to express themselves . " <p> But , he says , it is not all gloom since because of the Internet , students can carry their notes and timetables and assignments in their phones and therefore have much less paper work to deal with than in the pre-digital age . <p> In secondary schools , most teachers will admit they often find themselves at sea dealing with a generation living under a cloud of uncontrolled influences from the online community . The millennials tend to consider their teachers as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American writer and speaker on education Marc Prensky says in his essay " Digital Natives , Digital Immigrants " , teachers are digital immigrant instructors who speak an outdated language ( that of the pre-digital age ) and are struggling to teach a population that speaks an entirely different language . <p> Although most secondary schools have outlawed mobile phones in the institutions , it is an open secret that some learners do sneak them in and use them discreetly . Some even use them as business tools , hiring them out to their colleagues to explore the Internet and jump into social media platforms for a much-sought-after connection with their friends locally and overseas . <p> EVERY OPPORTUNITY <p> At home , most parents with teenage children can give testimonies of how the mobile phone has transformed the way families live and communicate . The teens would rather dive into Facebook or WhatsApp , whether during dinner or breakfast or at lunchtime , than engage in conversation with their parents or siblings . <p> Since the online world is largely unregulated , the learners expose themselves to fraudsters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whale suicide challenge that goads teens into committing suicide . <p> Because the digital age is here to stay , it must fall on our education systems and all other relevant institutions to come up with ways of harnessing its benefits before it completely destroys millennials at the altar of progress . <p> The Nation Media Group ( NMG ) founded by His Highness the Aga Khan in 1959 has become the largest independent media house in East and Central Africa .

First , they have kept the need for electoral reforms on the agenda . <p> Second , they have allowed Kenyans a better insight into the character of leading candidates . <p> Third , the campaigns have been a useful civic education exercise . <p> Particularly pleasing is the emergence of a cadre of serious academic and policy actors who have used their knowledge to influence party policies and present party manifesto into a basis for the choice Kenyans must make . <p> ENGAGEMENT <p> This has helped demystify the idea of academic work as an ivory tower engagement . <p> Those like Dr David Ndii who have had the courage to articulate their thinking and marshal evidence to push their position now have a place in history . <p> But the character of Kenya 's electioneering differs from other countries . <p> Senegal had its legislative elections last week . I only saw evidence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ballot . <p> Even in the homestretch of campaigning , the tension , threats and do-or-die bluster was absent . <p> Nigeria is one place where elections have a similar plot as Kenya . Apart from " doom-laden predictions " , there have been repeated threats of violence . <p> Even though Nigeria went to the 2015 elections with a 2011 post-election violence hangover , the 2015 elections , though surrounded by biased security forces , were judged fair and peaceful . <p> CONSTITUTIONAL DISPENSATION <p> Our refusal to see the new constitutional dispensation as heralding a different state-society contract accounts for the difference . <p> Many Kenyans wonder why , seven years after the promulgation of the new constitution , our electoral processes are more intensely fought out with murderous consequences than previous ones . <p> The truth is that we care less about the constitution and only adhere to it when it serves our partisan interests . <p> Nigeria succeeded in 2015 because of advances made towards electoral reform and the perception that the electoral commission did its best to secure the results . <p> Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most Nigerians the sense that their votes will count . <p> In contrast , Kenyan elections are an exercise in grudging democratic expression . <p> EXTENDING FRANCHISE <p> Elections are not anymore about extending the franchise to an ever-growing politically conscious population ; a population that is demanding and expects to use the ballot to express their will . <p> But this demand goes counter to our political culture that treats the state as an instrument of wealth accumulation and assumes the state is secured by the use , or threat , of force . <p> Thus , a shift has occurred in our politics from public service to personal aggrandisement . <p> We need the state for personal gratification ; ours is a form of gratification that is not only excessive in its greed but also secured by an ideology of order protected by the security forces . <p> This greed has convinced us that hard work , personal sacrifice and frugality can not lead to wealth . <p> Competition during campaigns has therefore become a fight for raw power , not for public service . <p> CONTESTED <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is why the constitution of the election management body is a viciously contested process . <p> Its internal workings are carefully watched and manipulated for political advantage . <p> Free and fair elections are frowned upon and those within IEBC who work towards it are seen as a threat and can only perform diligently at enormous personal risk . <p> To be sure , all political parties have repeatedly undermined IEBC 's capacity to exercise its mandate autonomously . <p> However , the undermining differs between incumbent and the opposition . <p> AUTONOMOUS <p> The political opposition , feeling frustrated by the failure of the IEBC to remain autonomous , decided to use civic action through street protest to push for electoral reforms . <p> While the legal framework allows for such protests , and the opposition legitimately used it , this approach has ensured some electoral reforms but without necessarily strengthening the commission as an institution . <p> The frustration within the IEBC is that political pressure from opposition has not enabled it to institutionalise and prepare for free and fair elections . <p> The incumbent holds two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can compel IEBC to " obey " their wishes especially because they control the Treasury and the security agencies . <p> Control of the Treasury holds the financial muscle that government can use to stall reform and deter the IEBC from enjoying the autonomy the constitution guarantees . <p> If this threat is not in fact , it is in intent . <p> The writer is Executive Secretary of CODESRIA .

Why would you need to when you have a partner you should be intimate with ? However , masturbation remains one of the most unspoken but common occurrences in relationships .

" Masturbation is a fundamental part of the treatment for problems such as premature ejaculation in men , and arousal and orgasm difficulties in women , " he says , adding that masturbation is one of the ways that many people in relationships learn or discover what turns them on .

While some may argue that the two , Nokia and BlackBerry , have a thin device profile to update , their willingness to do so is inspiring and something the rest can emulate . <p> On Nokia 's part , it has not hesitated to accompany the monthly security patch updates with what matters to most users : upgrades to the latest versions of Android . Of the 4 Nokia smartphones running Android out there ( Nokia 3 , Nokia 5 , Nokia 6 and the new Nokia 8 ) , only the low-end Nokia 3 was lagging behind as far as updates went and that was to be rectified last month . <p> At the beginning of the year , HMD Global promised to stick with a 2-year software support schedule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by most Android devices makers and which they struggle to follow anyway . <p> While Nokia fans and Nokia device users will surely be thrilled by this news , the same can not be said of users of old Sony Mobile Xperia smartphones whose bad news arrived the other day disguised as good news for those who will buy their yet-to-hit-the-market latest smartphones from IFA 2017 . <p> For the Kenyan device buyer , this news means that buying any of the 3 Nokia smartphones currently on sale in the country through telecommunications company Safaricom and other retail outlets , may be the only way to be first in line to experience Android Oreo .

" Tax evasion is criminal . <p> Deliberate failure <p> You know you have an obligation to pay your fair share of tax from profits but you deliberately fail to pay the tax .

@@20760233 <h> The Russian Rouble : When politics create mess <p> When analysing the currency of a country such as Russia , the main challenge any analyst or investor would face is to identify the elements that impact the currency . Indeed , there could be so much noise , so much wrong information , so many events that one would think of taking into account . <p> Logical questions one could wonder about would be : does the Ukraine / Crimea conflict impact the Russian Rouble , does the Syria war have an impact on currency rates , do low oil prices put a downward pressure on the World biggest country 's currency ? Does the trade account pushes the currency down or is it the other way around ? <p> Various political analysts are also speculating on the impact of a Syria Conflict 's Resolution on the Russian Rouble . Could it stop the bleeding of Russia 's economy and support its currency ? <p> In order to answer all these questions , lets ' first put things into context , and then assess expectations . <p> Troubled Water <p> While it is true that Russia has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its economy is experiencing difficulties due to a series of events that took place within the last 3 years . These event , most of which are of a geo-political nature , have somewhat isolated the country and disconnected a part of its economy from the western world . <p> Looking at Russia 's Gross Domestic Product , one can clearly detect a recession that started by early 2014 . As we mentioned events taking place , it happens that this date coincides exactly with the annexation of Crimea , the beginning of the Ukraine Conflict and the International sanctions . <p> Indeed as various countries including Eurozone countries and the US did not approve the annexation of Crimea nor the way it was done - sanctions and restrictions were imposed on Russian companies and individuals . Furthermore and as time went by , more and more sanctions came to impact Russia 's financial , energy and arms industry . <p> At the same time , the Syrian conflict which has been ongoing since 2011 , kept impacting the Western / Russian relationships . As the situation worsened and as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 and provide support to Bashar Al Assad 's government . <p> Within this already tense environment , oil prices added downward pressure . Between mid-2014 and early 2016 , Crude Oil prices per barrel lost went south by almost two thirds -- limiting the contribution of a key exports driver and economy booster . <p> We all know that when it comes to currencies , the rule is rather straightforward . The higher the demand for a country 's currency , the greater the currency ' value -- and vice versa . <p> In other words , a country that exports less receives less inflows which negatively impacts its currency . A country that loses many of its commercial partners and gets stuck in never ending conflicts receives less foreign capital and less foreign investments . As a matter of fact , capital gets to flee from that country into safer harbours . <p> All this logically leads to a suffering of that country 's economy and a depreciation of its currency and you guessed well -- the currency we are talking about is the Russian Rouble . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downward pattern . The currency lost around 22% of its value versus the US Dollar since January 2016 . <p> The Missing Piece <p> Now that we are getting a better understanding of the situation , we might still have a question : Why did the Rouble only start depreciating starting 2016 , when the Russian economy got to suffer way earlier ( as early as 2014 ) . <p> The answer to this question lies in the graph below and is called : Foreign Reserves <p> Foreign reserves can enable a country 's central bank to support its currency for some time . As demand decreased for the Rouble , the central bank would sell foreign currency and buy Rouble . In doing so , the central bank would generate demand for the local currecy therefore offsetting downward pressures and keeping the currency stable . <p> However and in doing so , a central bank makes strong use of its foreign reserves which are limited . In the case of Russia and as shown in the graph above Russia lost almost a third of its foreign reserves between 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabled to keep the currency stable in spite of all pressures . <p> However , by 2015 and given the economic recession , the central bank could not support the Rouble at the same pace as it used to . The Bank needed to decrease interest rates in order to counter the recession and provide liquidity while preserving the foreign currency reserves . Deprived of such support , the Russian Rouble started to depreciate while the central bank successfully mitigated the depletion of its foreign currency reserves . <p> So making a long story short , we can summarize the situation as follows : <p> As early as 2011 , The Syrian conflict and divergent views generated tensions between Russia and the US along to Euro Countries . <p> By 2014 and the annexation of Ukraine , tensions peaked and translated into economic sanctions against Russia <p> These economic sanctions combined with a low oil prices environment impacted the Russian economy and put downward pressure on its currency <p> For some time , the Central Bank tried to support the Rouble <p> By end 2015 , the Central Bank could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to strongly depreciate versus both the US Dollar and the Euro <p> Now that things are clear -- can a resolution of the Syrian conflict solve the problem ? <p> The Syrian Conflict <p> Without getting into the causes of this conflict which are obviously geo-political we can only say that the Syrian conflict has severely damaged the Russia -- US Relationship . Some actually believe that the Crimea annexation is just the straw that broke the camel 's back . They would argue that the real reason behind the economic sanctions is Russia 's rigid backing of Bachar Al Assad 's regime . <p> A resolution of the Syrian conflict and a convergence of the political views would definitely foster both understanding and cooperation . It would very likely enable to find common grounds regarding Crimea and contribute to lift some if not all the sanctions . It would obviously not all come at once , yet things would move in the right direction not only for Russia but also for the Eurozone ( especially for Germany which is an important trade partner of Russia ) . <p> An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also send oil prices higher which would benefit the Russian economy . Indeed , as the OPEC countries heavily needed higher oil prices to support their economies , Saudi Arabia has been very resistant to decrease its oil production output . Does such resistance make sense from an economic point of view ? Not really . Is it linked to political factors ? Very likely . <p> Translating things into FX Trading <p> The beauty of FX Markets relates to how they link and react to political and economic factors . If you were to notice the signs of a resolution in Syria , it would make a lot of sense to Buy Russian Rouble ahead of its future appreciation . Looking at things objectively , one can say that all sides need a resolution of this conflict as it has created too much opportunity cost . <p> So why is the conflict still ongoing , what are the causes , how could it be solved , is the Qatar 's recent " Quarantine " anyway related ?

One source of this limitation is that the total global mortality excludes cases of intentional drowning such as suicide or homicide , deaths caused by flooding and water transport accidents . Besides , statistics for non-fatal drowning are either hard to come by or unreliable . <p> Studies conducted in developed countries have , however , revealed that the cost drowning is high for the families of the victims , communities and economies . <p> WHO estimates that 45 per cent of drowning deaths in the United States occur among the most economically active segment of the population . In Australia and Canada , the total annual cost of drowning injury is $85.5 million ( Sh8.9 billion ) and $173 million ( Sh 17.9 billion ) respectively . <p> CAUSES <p> Risky behaviour around water sources , coupled with lack of water safety awareness , is a major risk factor for communities living near water bodies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for specialised training on how to navigate water bodies , " says Mr Joseph Onyango , a Kenya Maritime Authority Inspector in Kisumu , adding that most coxswains and boat owners are also ignorant of the dangers of transporting passengers without personal flotation devices such as life jackets , or employing unlicensed personnel to man their vessels . <p> Indeed , the Kenya Maritime Authority ( KMA ) says there are about 16,000 vessels operating on Kenya 's water bodies , most manned by untrained people . " As a result , our water sources of great strategic naval and economic importance occasionally become death traps , " says Mr Onyango . <p> FLOODING <p> Tropical areas that experience heavy rains and have unfavourable topography are susceptible to floods . A good example is Budalangi in Busia County . Undersea earthquakes also trigger tsunamis , which inundate large swathes of land in coastal regions , killing people and leaving a trail of destruction . <p> Mr Onyango says there is even greater risk of flooding because of climate change . <p> WATER TRAVEL <p> In recent years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and famine in their home countries to seek refuge , mostly in the developed world . Unfortunately , many drown in that quest since they travel in overcrowded vessels without safety equipment .

In addition , males are said to be twice as likely to drown as females . <p> PREVENTION <p> Mr Onyango notes that while the current methods of reducing and preventing drowning are effective , a lot remains to be done .

Working with the weatherman would help us provide real-time information to water users so that they can keep off if there are signs of danger , " says Mr Onyango . <p> He notes that time is a crucial in rescue operations because drowning kills within a short time . <p> In recent years , the government has invested in maritime safety initiatives including the acquisition of navigational aids and the provision of search-and-rescue boats .

But if you do not catch any , you will walk home . I will not give you a ride on my bicycle .

So he quietly laid his own traps and waited . That first day , nine of his 11 traps yielded results . While that was a good thing , it led to a conflict between Karanja and his friend ; apparently , Karanja 's friend had gone to his employer with the moles , claiming some of the credit saying , " He worked under me , he was my assistant . " <p> " No , I do n't want the moles , I want the man ! " ordered the White man.And that 's how lowly Karanja was received into the house . The next three days he caught more moles -- 36 in total .

In Lavington and Karen and the areas in between , new homes were being built , as were golf courses , and moles seemed to be everywhere . With every success Karanja registered , a satisfied owner would spread the word about the catcher with the magic traps at the club . <p> " I went to the home of Wambui Kenyatta ( former president Jomo Kenyatta 's daughter ) in Lavington and the guard stopped me , " says Karanja , smiling at the memory , " so I removed the letter and showed it to him .

Politicians seeking goodwill pose with him for a photo and in the age of the selfie , he has appeared on Facebook , although he might not know it . Motorists who recognise his stoop as he makes his way home from an assignment hoot and wave in greeting , and his local fellowship group , the Catholic Church 's jumuia , will not begin its sessions until he arrives . <p> For 46 years now , Karanja has used his knowledge of moles to earn a living Although he could have retired and lived off the stipend from the constituency development fund or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not about to retire . <p> " The works finds me , I hardly look for it , " he says . <p> A HONED SKILL <p> Karanja 's schedule follows a strict routine .

But at 10am , " around the time moles prefer to rouse from their morning naps " he goes to set traps or inspect those he installed the previous evening . <p> Karanja charges a flat rate of Sh100 per mole , plus an additional fee for transport .

" <p> However , he says , there was a man living in Kibichiku village , across the valley from Kamutiini , who would ask him to deliver a mole or two to his house . The man did n't admit that he ate them but Karanja got to know , nevertheless . When he refused to pay for some deliveries , Karanja stopped supplying the moles . <p> Karanja makes all his traps himself , fashioning them from old metal tins .

" <p> For a man who still remembers Nairobi when mules clopped the growing city 's dirt streets and was already married when the first guns boomed across Europe marking the beginning of the Second World War , Karanja is truly a remarkable man . His memory and recollection of events is nearly encyclopaedic .

That is how he got clearance to officiate at the national rugby sevens circuit organised by the Kenya Rugby Union . <p> He is now having a level one rank in the refereeing circles , which is the entry qualification . The best referees in the game are on level three . <p> He had to sit some online exams administered by World Rugby to earn that accreditation . <p> " First , you need to do the online exams , and you have to score 100 per cent , then do a thing called Rugby Ready ; just giving you what the game expects . <p> " After you 've done that , there is a course that is held in a room for some few hours and also at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basically introduced to the refereeing world -- being told more about the referee and the assistant referee .

He understands the game better than somebody who has n't played at all , " Oduor says.Lorence says he would like to always make the right decisions and that behoves him to be fit , keen and respectful.Fitness helps him to be " close to the ball so that you can see the availability of the ball " . <p> " Sometimes some refs are not close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening there . But at least when you 're close to the ball , you get to know what is happening and you can not miss the offences , " he says.Being keen enables one to make the right call and gesture every time , and that is the reason he feels he can not referee a 15-a-side rugby game yet . <p> " In 15s rugby , you need to get that experience because the players are too many at the breakdown area ; so it 's either you miss offences or sometimes you get confused on what to rule because the players are too many you can not see anything , " he explains . <p> Respect , on the other hand , enables a referee take criticism positively when players complain . <p> " The losing team will always tell you , ' Oh ref , why have you done this ?

But the new law says now the tackler needs to get back onto his or her side so that they can re-gather the ball , " says Lorence . <p> But even as he pushes the acceleration pedal on his sporting activity , the fact remains that he is still in high school and that next year , the Kenya National Examination Council will want to know what he has retained in the eight subjects he is taking that include geography and all the three sciences . <p> " He performs well both in studies and in academics , " his mother says .

I want to get that exposure , know the corrections that I need to make and maybe the weaknesses that I 'll need to work on , " he says . <p> Officiating in rugby , Oduor says , is not the best-paying job .

So , we enjoy what we do and it gives us opportunities to go to places , " says Oduor , who is also one of Lorence 's mentors besides the youngster 's long-time coach and Nakuru-based rugby trainer Lameck Ongati . <p> As he takes in lessons from class and the field , Lorence is enriching his world-view one day at a time , and he hopes for an A-minus in next year 's KCSE examination and that he may one day earn the " firm but fair referee " description given to his role model , South Africa 's Fhatuwani Rasta Rasivhenge.

@@21233239 <h> We must maintain peace on the week repeat poll is scheduled <p> This week will be a defining moment for Kenya . The impasse over the repeat presidential election is still unresolved , even as the electoral agency puts final touches for polling day on Thursday . Part of the uncertainty is because this will be the first time a presidential poll will be repeated -- the August 8 poll was invalidated by the Supreme Court after it agreed with the petitioners that the illegalities and irregularities committed by the IEBC negated the spirit of fairness in that election . <p> The apprehension ahead of this week has been aggravated by the main opposition party 's call for voters to boycott the repeat presidential elections on account of the IEBC 's own admission that it has been unable to reform itself to effectively conduct a free and credible election . With the National Super Alliance 's ( NASA ) insistence that elections will not be held , even though legal provisions to stop it may be difficult to summon , the uncertainty is suppressing business activity and strangling vital economic sectors . <p> Already President Uhuru Kenyatta , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the State will pull out all stops to ensure those who want to vote are unhindered and unmolested . This has come amid claims by the Opposition that their demonstrations -- very often violent -- to force reforms within the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission ( IEBC ) has been met with excessive force by the police . Clearly NASA 's thinly-veiled threat to stop the vote or suppress voter turnout and Jubilee Party 's parliamentary amendments of electoral laws to introduce provisions that will give the incumbent undue advantage have prepared the ground for conflict . <p> Because the stalemate has morphed into a political problem , it is difficult to see a way out outside provisions of the law . <p> The law only envisages a scenario where the constitutional and legal provisions are complied with -- the Supreme Court ruling of September 1 was explicit that the repeat presidential elections must be held by November 1 . Anything else would be outside the law . Therefore , while the action of voting on August 26 carries the force of law , stopping the elections does not . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to stop the poll , but this does not appear probable or even possible . <p> And this is why we ask that President Uhuru Kenyatta and Mr Odinga dialogue and agree on the way forward . If there is no way out of the impasse as things stand now , then elections would have to be held in three days ' time . But because there is little to demonstrate that the IEBC has reformed itself , the results would be open to legal challenge . <p> If elections go ahead as is looking increasingly likely , then the Constitution is unequivocal ; the right of whether or not to vote is protected by the law and must be respected by all Kenyans irrespective of political affiliation or persuasion . Therefore , it will be incumbent upon all Kenyans to ensure these rights are respected . <p> Given the prevailing circumstances , the Opposition 's call for peaceful demonstration on voting day is ill advised . This is because although picketing is allowed by law , the violence that inevitably follows such demonstrations could deny others their legitimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tensions , lighting the fuse in an already volatile situation . <p> The political positions of the protagonists aside , we must begin to have candid conversations about actions by State and non-state actors that contributed to the current impasse . We must discuss the role and character of our independent institutions and establish their contribution to a free and fair electoral process . <p> However , because of the statutory timelines laid out under the Constitution may not provide adequate opportunities for structured dialogue , we may have to settle for complying with the narrow provisions of the law to conclude the electoral process this week .

@@21519237 <h> The Four Human Temperaments- Check Out Which One You Belong To <p> November 06 , 2017 at 12:28 <p> Temperament refers to the characteristics and aspects of personality that we are born with . For this reason , they are similar to traits in that they are both innate ( born with these things ) and enduring . Infants who are anxious and nervous tend to be the same way when they are older . <p> Basically , the human temperament is divided into four types , namely , Choleric , Sanguine , Melancholic and Phlegmatic . <p> Four temperaments is a proto-psycological theory that suggests that there are four fundamental personality types , sanguine ( enthusiastic , active , and social ) , choleric ( short-tempered , fast , or irritable ) , melancholic ( analytical , wise , and quiet ) , and phlegmatic ( relaxed and peaceful ) . Most formulations include the possibility of mixtures of the types where individual share two or more temperaments . <p> Choleric <p> Choleric personality is associated with testosterone and although every temperamental makeup is represented by members of both sexes , most choleric people are men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by stocks , investments , money markets and all kinds of revenue generation methods , just like others are fascinated by art and poetry . These people are very practical and they make for naturally gifted businessmen . Constantly looking for opportunities and always working on themselves , they build successful businesses that thrive and benefit others . <p> This does n't mean that these people are greedy for money , by any means ! From their perspective , work is considered to be fun . However , they never do well in subordinate position -- they are all about independence , financially and otherwise . <p> Women of this type are very rare , but strangely enough are very popular people that , quite simply , have very different ways of dealing with issues . They can and do frustrate their partners by being unavailable , but this is exactly what makes them so desirable . They would n't make mistake most other women do , for example , when they smother their partners with love eventually repelling them . <p> This type of people is very analytical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out things . High testosterone activity in these men and women makes them straightforward and generally , they do n't strive to be polite , respectful or friendly -- they do stuff according to what is convenient to them and , most importantly , is in line with their goals . Wasting words and repeating the obvious seem pointless to them . Forcing them to do so is a surefire way to annoy them ! <p> Sanguine <p> The Sanguine personality is affected by chemical called dopamine , which makes these people intensely curious and creative . Their curiosity can be expressed in their love for reading and different kinds of knowledge and they usually possess high amounts of energy , so they may seem restless and spontaneous . <p> This type of personality loves the life of luxury ; they like to impress others by their expensive clothes , designer accessories and sport cars . If choleric people thrive on money-making process itself , sanguine people know how to enjoy money , luxury and comfort like nobody else . <p> They are big spenders and when given the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world staying in splendid hotels , enjoying exciting safaris and luxury cruises ; deriving full happiness and pleasure from their wealth . <p> They will indulge in their rich , comfortable and sumptuous living effectively ignoring world problems and crises . <p> People with sanguine personality adapt easily and generally can play many roles -- buoyant , lively and optimistic , and they have the ability to absolutely charm the pants off anyone that seeks their attention . Their need for variety and luxury explains why they prefer to live in big cities where they can satisfy their desires much easier . <p> Sanguine people are very poor at tolerating boredom . Routine jobs , repetitive experiences and boring companions annoy and irritate them , and for the most part , they will try to avoid routine and monotony at all costs . In actual fact , they love and thrive on interruptions because they get energized during these small changes in course . <p> Phlegmatic <p> People with phlegmatic personality are unassuming , agreeable and intuitive and they possess the ability of " web thinking " , i.e. to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Phlegmatic Skills <p> They have a wonderful skill to gather the facts , classify them into categories , and then see the relationship between seemingly contradicting elements . Basically , it is the ability to read between the lines . These men and women do n't do very well at memorizing separate unrelated facts , they grow bored and annoyed and to be excited by the process , they need to be able to generalize . <h> It 's all about the estrogen ! <p> Phlegmatic personality traits are linked to estrogen , which is present in both men and women . However , phlegmatic people are predominantly females . The two hemispheres of the brain are connected by millions of nerve fibers , and estrogen builds more nerve connections between the remote areas within each hemisphere , in turn , this assists the ability of " seeing a bigger picture " or " web thinking " . <p> -- These people are imaginative -- they like to think abstractly about the things that only can be imagined . For example , they will try to read your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your half smile . <p> -- The Phlegmatic person will want to know other people 's deepest feelings and strive to build intimate attachments with about everyone in their lives . They are interested in cooperation and interpersonal harmony , and this is why they preserve their family ties and friendships . When there is a conflict , they seek to agree , to satisfy the needs of everyone involved . <p> -- These men and women are very empathetic and compassionate . They try to understand what the other person is thinking and feeling , then to respond accordingly , which allows them to connect with that person . Moreover , people with phlegmatic personality are agreeable . <p> -- They could be described as cooperative , considerate , charitable , sympathetic , trusting and warm . They like to express their feelings , sometimes dramatizing their experience ( another evidence of high estrogen activity ) . <p> -- Phlegmatic men and women seek to contribute to society at large . They strive to fight cancer , donate to orphanages and help the poor and more than that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a must . <p> On the negative side , people with a phlegmatic personality can be indecisive , unable to focus on important details while ruminating on the bigger picture . Their talkativeness can be annoying and because they seek for a connection , they may appear needy , constantly demanding reassurance . <p> While trying to understand you , they also may assume that you see and feel the world the same way they do . They might take criticisms as an insult and pout for days , weeks and months and finally , they are very prone to depression . <p> Melancholic <p> Men and women with melancholic personality share many traits -- they tend to be loyal to their family and friends and extremely careful . Respectability and moral issues are particularly important to them and they will often love to follow typical " norms " of society and family traditions . <p> They are respectful to authority , follow rules and feel comfortable in hierarchies , where structure , rules and order are implemented . It is important for them to feel themselves a part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as a duty . <p> Melancholic personality traits are associated with serotonin , which suppresses aggressive tendencies . This explains why melancholic people are calm and self-confident , deeply attached to their family and community and loyal . As it was mentioned , they are very orderly and do n't like unpredictability -- they enjoy making definite plans and keeping schedules . They love routines , which they find relaxing and this should not come as a big surprise -- any repetitive motion increases serotonin levels . It is relaxing in its nature , but nobody enjoys it more than a melancholic ! <p> These people pay attention to details : <p> They remember special dates , anniversaries and events <p> They will remember details about their neighbors and colleagues . <p> Family and social ties are not seen by melancholics as something that limits their freedom and flexibility , as this could be with a sanguine or a choleric . In fact , to them these are safety nets , kind of a soft place to fall but in a much grander scale . It is also something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family ties are such an important part of their daily lifestyles and routines , they absolutely ca n't see themselves without it . Take this part away from them and they will be devastated . This is why the melancholic is not likely to be somebody who would marry a foreigner or leave to another country for permanent residence . <p> Melancholics need to be orderly even in their speech -- they will express themselves precisely , accurately , providing all of the relevant information and if you interrupt them or ask them a question they will think you are not interested in what they are talking about . <p> Unlike the Sanguine personality , they hate distractions and get frustrated by them . If you want to impress them do n't talk about your big ideas , instead give them precise information and stick to details . Their need for order is expressed even in their jokes -- they wo n't be a fan of nonsense humor or unresolved humor , their jokes reflect order , predictability and closure . <p> Melancholics are persistent and patient . They do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention and repetition . Interestingly , repetitive actions raise levels of serotonin even more and this is why some people repeat one and the same action over and over when they are anxious , like checking to see if the door is closed well or if they turned off the stove or re-checking their suitcase before going to the vacation . Sadly a misbalanced melancholic is most susceptible to OCD ( obsessive-compulsive disorder ) , where a person engages meaningless rituals , like counting , washing hands or excessive cleaning in order to prevent some disaster he imagines . Some of them may suffer in a less obvious way , but probably the hardest -- ruminating over and over about the same thought and rethinking it hundreds , if not thousands of times each and every day . <p> These people do excellent managers and administrators because they follow the rules , stick to the facts , they are reliable and maintain the social ties . They are superb at managing people whether it is at work or at home . One of their strongest needs is the need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , respectable and charitable . Their emotional well-being depends on their social networks . <p> Melancholics are proud of their accomplishments -- they will display their trophies , medals , diplomas , certificates and photos with influential people . Generally , they want to do the things in an accepted way ; they prefer to plan things in advance and to know ahead of the time what they are going to do . <p> On the negative side , people with a melancholic personality may become close-minded , dogmatic and stubborn . They also tend to turn to pessimism which may turn into fatalism , believing that nothing will ever change for better . Sometimes they get overly critical , judgmental , expressing their own moral superiority . <p> Their frugality may turn into stinginess . As well as this , some melancholics can become fixated on the past , where they ruminate for hours how their life would be if they did or choose something else in the past . Also they may have difficulty with stopping what they are doing , so hoarding is often a very common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually a mix of several personality types that make them much more flexible .

@@21539235 <h> Ethnicity still plays a role in the political decisions people make <p> In announcing the presidential results for the October 26 repeat polls , IEBC Chairman Wafula Chebukati said the issue that we need to ponder urgently is why there is always violence during the elections . From 2007 to 2017 , our polls are always bitterly contested . This happens regardless of how far-reaching the electoral reforms instituted . We have also been overhauling the electoral team in every election . However the solution to chaos remains as elusive as a mirage . <p> This can only mean one thing ; that the answer lies elsewhere . It is increasingly becoming clearer that the problem was not Issack Hassan and the composition of his commissioners in 2013 . Neither is it Chebukati and his team in 2017 . If the solution was in reforming the electoral commission , we would be by now having smooth presidential elections . So where did the rain start beating us ? If you asked me , I think the problem is embedded in the tribal nature of our politics . Listening to Raila Odinga and the NASA brigade keenly , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be found in merely reforming the IEBC . <p> It is a fact that Kenyans still vote mainly on the basis of tribe . This is not to discount the fact that we have made important progress in uniting the country and bolstering our democracy . However , we still have some ground to cover before we can achieve ideal democracy . <p> As it is said , building a vibrant democracy is not an event but a process . Therefore at the stage where we are now as a country , ethnicity still plays a role in the political decisions people make . This is why the strongholds of Jubilee are Rift Valley and Central regions while Nasa is Nyanza and Western . Presidential candidates draw their key support from their home turfs . This is not necessarily a bad thing . You have to be celebrated at home before the rest of the country can do so . This is why Raila 's support in Luo Nyanza is always solid as is the case with Uhuru in Central . This is a reality that we can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defines election is that some communities can monopilise politics and power if they strike lasting political pacts and bring their large numbers to bear . Aside from perception issues , there is nothing wrong with this as well because the Constitution guarantees freedom of assembly and association . It is democracy at play , however imperfect it is . This is how tyranny-of-numbers debate has crept into our political discourse . However , this debate is misguided to a large extent as democracy is essentially about numbers -- majority having their way and minority having their say . <h> You may be interested in <p> NASA seems to be unhappy with the merger of URP , a political party with its base in Rift Valley , and TNA with its roots mainly in Central . Yet they themselves are an amalgam of disparate parties drawing their support from ethnic enclaves . So , we are in all these together . <p> Poring through NASA 's recent sentiments , one gets the impression that they perceive URP-TNA merger as a conspiracy by the two parties to monopolise power . Yet this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenyatta when they entered into a political union . The opposite is actually true .

They were also keen on transforming the livelihoods of all Kenyans , a goal that they are well on their way of achieving looking at the Jubilee record in the last five years -- unprecedented development in every nook and cranny of the country . <p> If then NASA is unhappy that Rift Valley and Central have found a formula to work together , they ought to candidly say so . Then we can have an open and honest discussion on how we can redress the matter at hand . Skirting around real issues and coming up with dishonest demands while holding the country at ransom will not redress the political questions that we face . <p> We can only reach an agreement on the political grievances that we have by being honest .

@@21705236 <p> In the densely populated Pipeline Estate in Embakasi , Nairobi , two multi-storey residential buildings just metres apart are coming up . Construction on both has reached the first floor , and from a distance , everything seems just fine . <p> But a closer look at the buildings reveals that they are on swampy ground , with no indication that any measures taken to avert the risks of building in such an area . Just a kilometre away are two other residential buildings , whose ground floors are almost immersed in water , a likely pointer to is likely to happen to the buildings being hurriedly put up in the area . <p> Yet these are not isolated cases ; there are many such buildings coming up all around the city 's middle- and low-income settlements . <p> The population explosion in the city has led to a sharp demand for housing , and it is in an attempt to solve this problem that unscrupulous developers are building these death traps . <p> But how are developers able to continue building these substandard structures , a number of which have collapsed ? <p> According to the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high construction costs , statutory fees , supervision and tedious bureaucratic processes involving multiple agencies has resulted in developers circumventing the approval process , leading to substandard constructions . <p> NCA Executive Director Daniel Manduku cites the use of substandard materials and failure to engage professionals in the supervision as major contributory factors . He notes that after getting professionals to design a building -- which is subsequently approved by the county government , the National Environment Management Authority ( NEMA ) and the NCA -- some developers drop the consultants , who should supervise every stage of the construction , in order to cut costs . <p> He adds that after getting the necessary approvals , some developers disregard the professionals ' advice while others even go to the extent of building by themselves . <p> The NCA says that most problems occur as a result of developers ' failure to incorporate competent professionals such as engineers , architects , quantity surveyors and contractors . <p> " So more often than not , that is the missing link . In fact , every construction failure is as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or you do n't use a registered contractor , or you disregard what was approved , " he says . <p> " For example you find someone has three floors approved for construction but he adds another two floors , so , obviously , you are stressing the foundation and the structure might not withstand the extra load , " he points out . <p> Other mistakes developers make are changing material specifications , using the wrong proportions for concrete , and using substandard or inadequate materials . <p> He explains that standard concrete , calls for cement , sand and ballast in the ratio of 1:2:4 . This means mixing one bag of cement , two cubic metres of sand , and four cubic metres of ballast . However , some developers use a 1:4:8 ratio instead . <p> Similarly , an engineer might recommend the use of steel bars with high tensile strength , only for a developer to use weaker material . <p> While developers who do this save money , they seriously compromise the strength of the building . <p> Mr Manduku says that some developers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Developers who are in a hurry think the recommended 28 days are too many so they reduce the time to , say 10 days . So you find that even if the concrete was properly mixed , it does not attain its required strength and within no time you find structural failure , " he says . <p> Mr Steven Oundo , the chairman of the NCA board concurs , adding that some developers engage unregistered contractors , who lack the necessary competence , while in some cases , corrupt contractors do not take the building materials for testing to make sure that they are appropriate . <p> " When a building collapses , it might be due to of a series of problems . For instance , if you get the foundation wrong , then the building will collapse . Use of untested and substandard materials and failure to follow specified timelines during each stage of the construction also contribute to this , " he explains . <p> Mr Maurice Akech , a structural engineer , says that a building can collapse as a result of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , concrete curing time and a poor foundation . Additional reasons include incorrect ratio or material constituent , non-compaction , and wrong steel strength . <p> He asserts that getting the concrete mix right ( not using low-quality cement or mixing sand with silt ) , as well as its compaction , are paramount , to ensure that it is of the desired strength . <p> " For lack of vibrators , some contractors do not remove air from the concrete , resulting in air pockets in the mix , compromising the quality of the concrete . " <p> Mr Akech explains that good quality steel might be used , but of the wrong strength or size , or might placed at wrong intervals or badly lapped ( overlapping of reinforcing bars ) , resulting in a substandard building . <p> " Make sure that steel is tested to ascertain its quality , placed at intervals of 10-20cms , has long laps and is of the required size , " he says . <p> He add that to ensure that the structure that is built is sound , a geotechnical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size and the depth of foundation to be dug . <p> In addition , blinding ( spreading a thin layer of concrete on the foundation ) , must be done to prevent the steel from getting into contact with the soil . The reinforcement ( steel bars ) should also be of the recommended quality and appropriately placed , depending on the height and use of the building . <p> " After excavation , an engineer should verify whether the levels reached and the type of soil there can support the building . The columns ( pillars ) and reinforcements have to be tied at the same time , and correctly , " Mr Akech says . <p> He adds that the concrete must be allowed the recommended 28 days to cure , and one should only erect columns on a foundation after at least three days , and must have supports for them when placing slabs on the floor above . <p> " In a swampy area , a raft foundation ( a continuous slab that covers the entire footprint of the building ) is recommended as it regulates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should also be properly hydrated to keep its surface wet all the time . " <p> His views are echoed by Mr Manduku , who explains that building in swampy areas requires special attention , adding that what ails buildings in such areas is purely a design issue . <p> He says suggests that a pile foundation , where columns are pushed deep into the ground to provide a solid base for what is constructed on top , be used . <p> " Design the foundation depending on the area . The mistake we make is that we use the traditional strip foundation in a swampy area . We have to get the appropriate foundation for a particular type of soil , " he points out . <p> Mr Manduku explains that one can even have a mix of the foundations , such that some areas have pile while the others are raft and some even strip ( a strip of concrete under the load-bearing walls ) , depending on the results of the geotechnical test . To do this , you must get the right structural engineer to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed . <p> " We know of countries that are swampy but have safe buildings , for example Thailand . Most of the capital city , Bangkok , is in a swampy area but it was appropriately designed , " he says . <p> He also warns against speeding up the construction of a structure against the advice of professionals in order to cut down costs . <p> Mr Manduku advises that before starting construction , you should ensure that the land is ideal for the intended structure . <p> The developer should then confirm that the land matches the zoning requirements , which are stipulated by every county government through the Physical Planning Act , and indicate the types of structures that may be put up in particular areas . <p> RESPECT ZONING LAWS <p> " Construction starts with identifying the correct piece of land , by correct I mean legally , it should be land you own , not disputed and not in the public interest zone , not riparian or a oad reserve . <p> " Then get a brief of what you want to build ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have areas like Karen , where you are allowed to build only dwelling units , so make sure that what you want to build is in line with the zoning regulations , " he adds . <p> He says tenants should look out for problems like visible cracks ; doors that do not lock properly ; windows that jam , meaning there is a shift in the structure ; broken pavements , meaning the columns are puncturing the ground ; and crooked beams , which are structural failures showing that a building is not safe . <p> " Even a layman will see the above structural failures but to ascertain everything , we need to take an x-ray of the columns and beams and we will be able to tell if the building is going to fail , " says Manduku . <p> On the way forward , Mr Manduku cites lack of coordination in an industry with many players , fragmentation of the industry , with each player regulated by its own regulations and legislation , and lack of enforcement and prosecutorial powers vested in the NCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against substandard buildings in Nairobi . <p> " The NCA Act does not give us powers to go beyond what is provided therein .

You need to set an example for people to adhere to the construction rules , " he notes . <p> But he is optimistic that all the hurdles will soon be overcome as the authority has moved to Parliament seeking to amend the NCA Act to give it powers to enforce the rules and also prosecute offenders . <p> " We have moved to court to put a stop to dangerous constructions and I think we will succeed , " he says .

@@21837233 <p> Kenya has arrived at an impasse , and there is no easy way out . Monday 's decision by the Supreme Court , dismissing legal challenges to Uhuru Kenyatta 's re-election , paves the way for the incumbent president to be sworn in next week . Even with the court 's approval , the second term of his presidency will be dogged by a deficit of legitimacy . He will have little hope of reuniting a dangerously polarised nation . <p> Using brute force to impose authority -- which , on recent evidence , is likely to be Mr Kenyatta 's default tactic -- will only exacerbate tensions . When his rival , the former prime minister Raila Odinga , was greeted by thousands of supporters on his return from abroad last Friday , members of the security forces set on his convoy with tear gas and water cannons . Policemen oblivious of the cameras were filmedhurling rocks . At least five people died in the melee . The deaths come on the heels of sinister recent killings in the slums . <p> Mr Odinga appears undeterred . A veteran of the pro-democracy struggle , he thrives on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for new elections on the streets , having successfully called a boycott of October 's repeat polls . These were ordered by the Supreme Court after it deemed initial elections to have been marred by " irregularities " and " illegalities " . <p> To his credit , Mr Odinga has been urging his many supporters to demonstrate peacefully . But there is an ever-present danger that state-sponsored violence will provoke a retaliation that could spiral out of control . <p> Britain might once have provided effective mediation . But when Boris Johnson , the foreign minister , made an unseemly leap to congratulate Mr Kenyatta in the wake of the Supreme Court 's ruling , he entrenched the opposition 's suspicion that the UK is partisan . The US has been equally clumsy in revealing its support for the status quo . <p> Yet neither the endorsement of foreign powers , nor the court ruling , will settle doubts about the credibility of an election process that delivered Mr Kenyatta 98 per cent of the vote . The turnout in the re-run was just 38 per cent . Little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent the kind of skulduggery that took place in the initial polls , in August .

Successive elections since 2007 have been marred by fraud . If public faith in the electoral system was to be restored , it was vital that this time there were no flaws . <p> Instead , large swaths of the population have been left feeling disenfranchised . If they continue to feel so , they will doubtless find other means to make their voices heard . Already there are signs that a commercial boycott of companies linked to the Kenyatta family is taking hold . More ominously , talk of secession is gathering steam in Mr Odinga 's strongholds in the west of the country . <p> The risks that this stand-off degenerates into something worse are real .

When employees participate unwillingly , the consequences and outcome may cause more divisions than unity . <p> There is so much to celebrate outside strange foreign practices : throw a bash and celebrate traditional foods , dress or dance ; or use the occasion to celebrate something meaningful to all of you as colleagues . <p> Visiting some of the students you support and reading together with them to enhance a reading culture may be meaningful to all , so would visiting the sick in hospital or undertaking other acts of kindness . <p> People all over the world have different cultures , so to impose one 's culture on another people because you have some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . <p> As we celebrate and appreciate diversity , we should always know when and where to draw the line .

To stop him from breathing down my neck all the time ? <p> I am curious to know why you turned down a job offer yet you have been searching for two years . <p> Could it be that you are looking to work for a specific employer or that you have a fixed mind on the salary you would like to earn ? <p> Most people started at a low level , and took jobs they were not enthusiastic about and accepted a salary way beyond their expectations . <p> With time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gained experience , a factor that enabled them negotiate competitive remuneration . <p> My advice is that you refocus your job search by getting attachment to gain experience . <p> Most health facilities will be willing to engage you , especially if they are not incurring any cost . <p> You will then be available for locum opportunities to relieve the more experienced technicians when they are away on leave . <p> To your relationship , your boyfriend could be genuinely concerned and eager for you to get employment , but because of your anxiety , you misconstrue his concern for nagging . That said , you need to determine whether his is concern , or if his reaction is because you have become a burden to him . <p> Do you , for instance , rely on him for financial assistance ? If you do , maybe you should look for an alternative source since this could be the reason why it seems like an emergency for him that you get a job , which will relieve him off this responsibility . <p> Since this situation is bothering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him know that it is already stressing to search for a job , and that what you need is his support and understanding to be able to focus . <p> If he does not change , you may have to make a choice between focusing on your current priority or dwelling on the negative emotions your boyfriend is eliciting in you every time he inquires on the progress you have made . <p> Your relationship should not depend on your ability to get a job ; if you got a job and lost it , will it be a bone of contention in your relationship ?

PHOTO SALATON NJAU NATION MEDIA GROUP <h> In Summary <p> Many African countries have yet to undergo the kind of transformation that is necessary for socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable development . <p> In recent decades , some developing countries -- mainly in Asia -- have managed to industrialise . <p> In 2014 , the Asia and Pacific region 's share of value added in global manufacturing was 44.6 per cent , whereas Africa 's was just 1.6 per cent . <p> Each year , 12 million new workers join the labour force , and they will need the tools and skills to ensure their future livelihoods . <p> By LI YONG <p> Since 2000 , Africa has recorded impressive rates of economic growth , owing largely to development assistance and a prolonged commodity boom . <p> While the continent shows great diversity in the socioeconomic trajectories , growth rates have generally masked an underlying lack of structural transformation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of transformation that is necessary for socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable development over the long term : namely , industrialisation . Wherever industrialisation has occurred , it has reliably improved economic diversification and helped to nurture , strengthen , and uphold the conditions for competitive growth and development . <p> In 2014 , the Asia and Pacific region 's share of value added in global manufacturing was 44.6 per cent , whereas Africa 's was just 1.6 per cent . With South Africa as its only industrialised country , Sub-Saharan Africa is the least industrialised region in the world . <p> For African countries to achieve sustainable development , they will have to increase substantially the share of industry -- especially manufacturing -- in their national investment , output , and trade . <p> And , to their credit , most African countries already recognise that such a transformation is necessary to address a wide range of interconnected challenges that they are now confronting . <p> One such challenge is population growth . More than half of the continent 's 1.2 billion people are under the age of 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 15 and 24 . <p> Each year , 12 million new workers join the labour force , and they will need the tools and skills to ensure their future livelihoods . Industrialisation is the key to helping Africa 's fast-growing population realise a demographic dividend . <p> MIGRATION <p> A related challenge is migration . Many of Africa 's most ambitious and entrepreneurially minded young people are joining others in migrating north . But no country , especially in Africa , can afford to lose so much talent and potential . Industrialisation alone can not resolve the migration crisis , but it can address one root cause , by creating jobs in the countries of origin . <p> A third challenge is climate change , which weighs heavily on countries where agriculture is still the primary sector for employment . To confront the threat , Africa will need to develop and adopt green technologies , while channelling more investment into resource efficiency and clean energy . With the right investments , African countries can reduce the cost of delivering power to rural areas , and contribute to global efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In short , Africa must industrialise , and it must do so in a socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable manner . Given that most previous efforts at sustainable development in Africa have failed , there is a clear need for a new approach : a broad-based , country-owned process that taps financial and non-financial resources , promotes regional integration , and fosters cooperation among Africa 's development partners . <p> RESOURCES <p> As it happens , the United Nations General Assembly has declared 2016-2025 to be the Third Industrial Development Decade for Africa .

@@22262235 <p> There has been an endless debate about the relationship between leadership and development . Responsible for this debate is the question of why some countries have managed to lift millions of their citizens from poverty while in others millions remain poor . <p> Here in Kenya " the poor are always with us " in spite of many development programmes designed and implemented by the government and many other agencies . <p> The poor are always with us in spite of numerous policies introduced to reduce poverty . <p> The debate is somehow settled with the experience from Southeast Asia and African countries such as Mauritius and Botswana . <p> In all these countries , leaders in government have been playing an important role in transforming people 's lives . <p> But what type of leadership and what policies did they pursue to address poverty ? Important here is to recognise that not all countries in Southeast Asia were democratic at the time of transformation . <p> DICTATORSHIPS <p> Some were dictatorships and as corrupt as many governments in Africa . However , they had one thing in common -- their leaders had a long term view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be felt everywhere , they chose policies that focused on rural development where a majority of the people lived . <p> They chose to improve rural incomes by expanding agricultural production . Aware of the need to address the problem of hunger , these governments focused on agricultural research with a view to finding out how to increase production . <p> They invested in rural infrastructure to reach the peasants . The governments also provided subsidised inputs such as fertiliser , seeds , and even pesticides . The results were evident . Peasants became food secure . Household incomes increased . Food poor families could now have surplus for markets . <p> INDUSTRIALISATION <p> The governments complemented pro-poor agricultural policies with basic industrialisation . Value addition agricultural industries followed up in the countryside . <p> Cottage industries popped up in rural areas . These were labour intensive and created employment opportunities in the villages . This also impacted on household incomes and by that helped reduce poverty levels in a significant manner . <p> The governments achieved this by choosing policies that mattered for the poor . Indonesia , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dictatorship . <p> The dictatorship tolerated corruption but pursued pro-poor rural development policies including food production subsidy programme . <p> The government looked for ways of raising farm production and incomes . To do so , it concentrated on increasing production of only export and food crops . <p> FOOD CROPS <p> With regard to food crops , the government intensified use of subsidies and provision of credit services to small holder farmers . In the end , production of staple rice went up . This addressed the problem of food sufficiency and helped in procuring incomes for individual families . <p> The Indonesian government also was strict on planning and budgeting . It required the bureaucrats to present only balanced budgets for approval . In these budgets revenue always equalled or even exceeded expenditure . Bureaucrats had to pursue these policies with diligence and high sense of commitment . <p> These governments had a long term vision on the type of development they wanted to deliver . They wanted to transform people 's lives . They wanted to change people 's well being . <p> Whether they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did , is a different matter . But through focused leadership , they helped improve people 's conditions . <p> POVERTY <p> They moved millions out of poverty and reduced the high levels of inequality . In Indonesia , between the 1970s and the 1990s , the number of poor people reduced from half of the population to about 10 per cent . This number has considerably reduced in recent times . <p> This experience is evident that good development can be achieved . But it can be achieved without force . <p> Botswana , Mauritius and Cape Verde in Africa have also lifted their people from poverty but they are not dictatorships . <p> They are also good examples of democracies we have on the continent . Simply put , these examples show that good development can be achieved . <p> Leadership can help in lifting millions of people from poverty . County governments present a unique opportunity . <p> Kenya itself has a better opportunity for development today . The Constitution and policy framework " demand " that the national and county governments provide good development . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It does not matter how much resource they have . It matters how effective and focused the county leadership is . The counties , even with limited resources , are better placed to transform rural economies . <p> DEVELOPMENT <p> But each county government requires effective and focused leadership . This is where the difference in development among counties will lie in the future . <p> But do Kenyan leaders recognise the significance of their role in development ? Many do . Some do not . A close look at what has happened since introduction of the county governments in 2013 shows that some of the counties are transforming their counties than others . <p> Maternal mortality rates in some counties has reduced by close to half while rural infrastructure in some is fast developing . Again this is purely because of leadership . <p> Politicians do recognise this . They know too well that they can transform people 's lives . This is what one gets even in conversations among them . <p> In one recent conversation with a good friend , a former politician , I asked what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He decided to leave politics in 2013 after a very successful parliamentary career . <p> POLITICS <p> Young and articulate , he realised that local politics at the constituency level was organised in the old order in spite of having a new Constitution . <p> He stepped down from competitive politics hoping that he would participate in the development of the constituency in different ways . <p> Nonetheless , I asked him : what do you miss most now that you are out of politics . His answer was simply : " the ability to see that you have changed the life of a person or groups of people through your leadership position " . He specifically mentioned that he would discuss and agree with his constituents on what they would do to move forward . <p> They would mobilise around a simple goal and move together . Through such efforts , the constituency has many students who have completed university education where a number have completed specialised courses such as medical degrees . They had none before . He misses playing this type of leadership to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> INVEST <p> The experiences above show that effective and focused leadership matters in development . An effective government is important in this regard . County governments are themselves important players . They make policies . They invest . They implement development programmes . <p> But the type of policies they make matters most . It matters whether they have a good understanding of the small and simple things that they can embark on to change local conditions . Increasing production in agricultural areas and promoting livestock development among the pastoralists may sound a clich ? but it is an important beginning point . Again this should not be done as an end but as a means to improving rural incomes and addressing poverty . <p> Introducing agricultural based cottage industries , abattoirs in pastoralist counties and a focus on value addition activities in these areas can make a difference . <p> These simple things may be difficult to achieve for county governments if they do not attract good talents . <p> They need to attract well trained , young , and agile local civil servants . <p> RETRENCHMENT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move forward because what they have as staff is the old group inherited from local authorities . This group is old schooled and without ideas . <p> They are too expensive for the county governments . Staffing therefore is an issue the county governments have to begin with . There are no two ways about this . <p> The national government has to allow the county governments to keep the staff they wish to . The national government has to allow for retrenchment no matter the political costs . This will allow for development of an elite cadre of civil servants at the county level . But an elite cadre of civil servants does not come cheap . It is expensive because it is maintained through incentives . These incentives lead to better productivity . <p> We need quality public debates on development . <p> Effective leadership in development is usually accompanied by high level or quality public debates on development . <p> DEBATES <p> It is long since Kenya had a debate on " the Kenya we want " . Counties also missed an opportunity to discuss " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investment meetings . <p> Effective leadership allows quality debates on policies so that the government can stop bad policies and implement good ones . <p> National debates help in identifying fallacies in policies that should be rejected . But the country has not created an environment where ideas on development are exposed . <p> We are yet to debate development programmes and achievements thus far . This is what the county governments should begin by doing . <p> They should create opportunities for public debates on the development that people want , and base projects on these debates . <p> Prof Karuti Kanyinga is based at the Institute for Development Studies ( IDS ) , University of Nairobi ; email protected

How did you get the chance ? The secret is always keeping your eyes and ears open and hanging around the right people . Opportunities are heard through the right people so when the call for application was advertised , I applied and gave my reasons why I should be allowed to participate as a youth and I 'm glad I got the opportunity because it was mind blowing and full of learning experiences . <p> You were behind the Miss Fabulous Beauty pageant show , how was it ? This was a show I organised in 2012 , meant to boost young women 's self-esteem and make them believe in themselves more .

@@22331234 <h> It will take more than good intentions to clear Nairobi 's garbage mountains <p> Nairobi 's new governor , Mike Sonko , has promised to rid Nairobi of its mountains of trash . The city , which is home to an estimated 3.9 million people , generates between 3,000 and 3,200 tons of solid waste daily . But only half is collected . <p> And only about 25% of waste generated reaches the main dumpsite at Dandora east of the Kenyan capital where the evidence points to severe effects on the health of nearby communities . The remainder , about 2,250 tons , is illegally disposed of at undesignated locations such as roadsides , rivers and any open spaces . Piles of uncollected garbage are a common sight across the city . <p> During his election campaign , Sonko pledged to make the garbage collection system more efficient while also creating jobs for unemployed young people . He plans to build a new waste dumpsite to replace the overflowing Dandora site , the closure of which was recommended 10 years ago . <p> Perhaps most ambitiously , the governor has declared that within five years waste will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sonko was voted in during the August 2017 general election and has already mobilised groups of young people to clean up the city 's streets . But it 's still too early to tell whether the governer 's pledges will develop into concrete , long-term actions . <p> Although Sonko has good intentions to make Nairobi the cleanest city in Kenya , he is up against tough odds . These include corruption , political interference and citizens ' attitudes towards environmental cleanliness . There is also the presence of entrenched cartels -- both white and blue collar -- who have a huge influence in the waste management chain . Their presence impedes the necessary reforms in the sector as they benefit from the status quo . <h> Solid waste strategy <p> Nairobi needs a coordinated strategy to address its solid waste management challenges . Its population is growing , and this will mean more rubbish . <p> Collection is just part of the problem . A strategy is needed that encompasses the processes of transfer , treatment and disposal of waste . This is because poorly managed waste carries health @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from unsanitary landfills can seep into the soil and contaminate groundwater . <p> In addition , methane , which is produced from decomposing organic waste , is a potent greenhouse gas that is also highly combustible . Toxins from trash disposed into the city 's waterways can find their way into people 's diets when this same water is used to cultivate vegetables for human consumption . <p> The health risks posed by improper solid waste management in Nairobi is the subject of our study . This study formed part of a larger programme covering urban sub-Saharan Africa . This larger programme seeks to open up an applied research and policy agenda to manage natural and man made hazards . It also aims at strengthening the capacity of local actors to address and manage these risks . <p> Our study was conducted in three locations that represent different types and levels of exposure to risks from poor solid waste management . The first site is close to the city 's main dumpsite . The second is further away , but is exposed to related secondary hazards such as pollution and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ semi-formal settlements . The third , five kilometres farther south , is a formal settlement which was included for comparative analysis . <p> Waste collection services in Nairobi are primarily provided by private companies or community groupings that charge a fee . This has implications especially for low income households that have very little or no money . Such households could end up disposing of their waste inappropriately -- burning or dumping it in rivers , trenches , railroads and roadsides . <p> But it 's not just the poorest households that are affected . Families that reported paying for collection services also admitted that they sometimes disposed of their waste inappropriately . This was because of irregular collection services or because they 'd defaulted on paying service providers . <h> Known health risks <p> Participants were very aware of the health risks posed by poor solid waste management . <p> More than one in four reported that they or a household member had experienced health issues linked to poor solid waste management . The highest proportion of cases -- more than one out of three -- was reported close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commonly reported health issues were diarrheal diseases followed by respiratory problems and malaria . Residents close to the dumpsite cited respiratory problems a lot more often than those at the other sites . This is probably because they were directly exposed to toxins from burning waste and gases released by decomposing garbage . <p> Awareness about these health risks can act as a spur for communities to improve solid waste management practices at the individual and household level . It can also galvanise residents to demand improved service delivery from their leaders . <p> Nairobi 's new leadership is already showing a willingness to address the challenges posed by poor solid waste management . However , mitigation of the health and environmental risks from poor solid waste management will require more than a piecemeal approach . The entire system from generation to disposal has to be examined and necessary interventions must be put in place along the chain . <p> Thank you for participating in discussions on The Star , Kenya website .

Within a few weeks , we had become really close friends . <p> Did you see each other as prospective dating partners when your friendship began ? Victor : No . When we started , there were no romantic feelings involved . Because we spent considerable time together , our friends kept asking whether we were in a relationship and encouraged us to date , saying that we made a good couple.Betty : The thought of us dating was laughable .

We can actually tell when the other is lying or hiding something . <p> Do you believe a platonic relationship is possible between a boy and a girl ? <p> Betty : That depends on how close they get . If you spend a lot of time together or confide in each other , feelings are bound to develop .

Sometimes having similar interests can draw people together . I think the most important thing is for the parties to be open about their feelings for each other . <p> What are the benefits/dangers of being in such a relationship ? Betty : If you are dating , you might be tempted to compare your close friend 's actions with your boyfriend 's . The good thing , in my experience , is that you get to understand the opposite sex better - how they think or do things . <p> Victor : Having a close friend of the opposite sex is good in that you can get varied opinions on different issues . The danger is not knowing how to create boundaries or having to deal with the pain of unrequited love should you decide to disclose how you feel .

FILE PHOTO NMG <p> Increased competition can improve a country 's economic performance , open business opportunities to its citizens and reduce the cost of goods and services . But many laws and regulations restrict competition . <p> A firm 's ability to raise its prices is usually constrained by competitors and the possibility that its customers can switch to alternative sources of supply . When these constraints are weak , a firm is said to have market power and if the market power is great enough , to be in a position of dominance or monopoly ( terminology tied to jurisdiction ) . While mere possession of monopoly power does not constitute violation of competition laws , the abuse of such power -- particularly if it is used to weaken competition further by excluding rivals -- calls for intervention from competition authorities . <p> Establishing a framework of competition law and liberalising sectors is important , but so is assessing the competitive effects of regulations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Competition Authority of Kenya ( CAK ) is about to embark on a study on competition in the shipping , trucking and haulage sector .

Like any other sector in the economy , the transport and logistics sector is not exempt of anti-competitive practices . <p> Hard core cartels ( when firms agree not to compete with one another ) are bound to exist and these are the most serious violations of competition law . They injure customers by raising prices and restricting market entry , thus making goods and services unnecessarily expensive .
