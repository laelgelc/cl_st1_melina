I I see see an an unusual unusual number number of of 7 7 lifepaths lifepaths in in prominent prominent roles roles , , perhaps perhaps because because they they are are here here to to heal heal their their ' ' crown crown ' ' chakra chakra . . <p> <p> Crown Crown Princess Princess Mary Mary is is an an Old Old Soul Soul who who can can manage manage any any crisis crisis . . I I have have no no doubt doubt she she 's 's had had a a past past life life with with Crown Crown Prince Prince Frederik Frederik , , which which could could explain explain their their unusual unusual way way of of meeting meeting . . <p> <p> 2019 2019 was was a a difficult difficult year year for for her her in in numerology numerology . . She She 's 's been been pushing pushing herself herself physically physically and and begun begun taking taking over over duties duties for for Queen Queen Margrethe Margrethe II II . . Things Things will will get get easier easier for for Mary Mary by by 2021 2021 , , when when I I believe believe Queen Queen Margrethe Margrethe will will have have stepped stepped down down and and Mary Mary will will have have more more opportunities opportunities to to make make positive positive changes changes . .

@@31543234 <h> Odds Look Long for Taiwan 's China-Friendly Presidential Contender <p> ( Bloomberg ) -- Trailing in the polls weeks before election day , Taiwan 's opposition presidential candidate Han Kuo-yu was asked a straightforward question during an appearance on a late night talk show . <p> " Which country poses the biggest threat to Taiwan ? " the host asked . <p> Instead of responding " China " -- Taiwan 's only real military rival -- Han gave a long-winded answer before challenging the host to see who could waddle further across the floor on their knees with their legs locked in a lotus pose . Han demonstrated that he could accomplish that physical feat , but appears to have lost further ground in the fight for Taiwan 's top office . <p> Going into 2019 , Han was riding high . His unlikely come-from-behind victory in the race for mayor of Kaohsiung -- Taiwan 's third-largest city -- immediately made him a top contender to unseat incumbent Tsai Ing-wen in the Jan. 11 , 2020 , presidential election . <p> He was the talk of Chinese-speaking communities from Singapore to New York . Driven by the passionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of retirees , he polled at 54% in February , 29 percentage points ahead of Tsai , according to a TVBS survey . <p> Since then , the race has seen a turnaround , with all major polls showing Tsai holding a lead of around 20 percentage points over Han . Her resurgence has been fueled by a resilient economy and stock market , an effective campaign and sometimes violent protests over China 's grip in neighboring Hong Kong , which have confronted Taiwanese voters with the potential perils of closer ties with Beijing . <p> While Tsai enjoys a strong lead , her victory is by no means assured . Her supporters are largely made up of Taiwanese between the ages of 20 and 40 , a demographic less likely to turn out than the older voters who predominantly back Han . And recent opinion surveys may overestimate Tsai 's lead , after Han urged his followers to undermine them by claiming to support Tsai if contacted by pollsters . <p> In the end , turnout is likely to be the deciding factor for whether Han can translate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory over Tsai 's broader -- but less motivated -- base . <p> Fresh Doubt <p> Still , Han 's talk show appearance was the latest in a series of gaffes and bizarre comments that have , for some voters , cast doubt on his viability . His performance as mayor has done little to overcome the public 's skepticism . <p> A video that showed him struggling to answer city councilors ' questions about Kaohsiung went viral in May . He 's also the subject of a local recall motion after upending a vow to see out his term as mayor mere months before launching a presidential campaign . <p> " Han is a populist . Populists usually claim to implement some huge policies that will bring about immediate effect to help the economy , " said Austin Wang , an assistant professor of political science at the University of Nevada . " However , Han has failed to implement any of the important policies he promised in Kaohsiung , such as the Ferris Wheel , drilling in the South China Sea or bringing Disneyland to Kaohsiung . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the reasons he engenders such passion among his supporters , it has driven others away . He was accused of misogyny in October when he spoke disparagingly about Tsai 's weight and complexion , calling her " pale-skinned and fat " -- the implication being that she shunned hard work . <p> He also came under fire from Manila 's top representative to Taiwan in March after using a racially derogatory term while questioning whether Taiwanese parents could accept teachers from the Philippines teaching their children , and denigrating other immigrants to the island . <p> China Challenge <p> Han 's main challenge , as the talk show appearance signaled , has been articulating a clear policy on relations with the mainland . <p> Tsai , whose Democratic Progressive Party supports independence , has vowed that Taiwan will never be unified with China as long she is in power . Han , on the other hand , has struggled to find a consistent message . <p> In recent months , Han has repeated , sometimes reading directly from a written statement , that he thinks the 1992 Consensus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taiwan strait are part of China -- is the best way forward for Taiwan . When pressed for greater detail , he has either repeated the statement word for word or launched into an unrelated story . <p> In an interview with Bloomberg News in November , Han warned Taiwan against testing Beijing 's " red line " by pushing independence . <p> Democracy Would Solve Hong Kong Problems , Taiwan Contender Says <p> " If the 23 million people of Taiwan came to a consensus and voted for independence in a referendum , they would have to deal with the military and political consequences , " Han said . " You ca n't avoid it . We do n't have any resources . We have nothing . " <p> In March , Han traveled to Hong Kong and held a closed-door meeting with China 's powerful Liaison Office in the city , a summit that elicited a warning from the Mainland Affairs Council about the political sensitivity of entering the office to meet with Chinese officials . In his initial response to Hong Kong 's pro-democracy protests , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know much about them . <p> " The DPP successfully managed to shape the public 's stereotype of Han , that of a China-friendly bumpkin , after his visit to the Beijing liaison office in Hong Kong , " said Alexander Huang , an associate professor at Tamkang University and a defense and diplomatic affairs adviser to Han . <p> --With assistance from Cindy Wang and Hannah Dormido . <p> To contact the reporter on this story : Samson Ellis in Taipei at sellis29@bloomberg.net <p> To contact the editors responsible for this story : John Liu at jliu42@bloomberg.net , ; Brendan Scott at bscott66@bloomberg.net , Karen Leigh

@@31544237 <p> by Lindsay Shelton What a way to end the year -- millions of litres of sewage flowing into the harbour , and questions about why Wellington is using sewage pipes that are 90 years old or more . ( A 110 year old pipe was used in the rescue process . ) <p> But a ban on swimming remains around the dive platform on Taranaki Wharf -- because of sewage contamination that the council-owned Wellington Water is unable to explain , and which it has failed to fix for years and years . <p> " We spend about $180 million per year on infrastructure , that 's the three waters . Over a period of time we 're looking to increase that , because as the pipes age then you need to replace more of them . " Foster said there were lessons to be learnt from the overflow , " particularly around the frequency of inspection of critical pipes . It helps us to learn as governors to be able to ask some more questions of Wellington Water and of our asset managers . " <p> Wellington 's sewerage network has been continually improved over the years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And in case anyone is questioning definitions : the Wellington Water website confirms that wastewater = sewage . The DomPost estimated that the total amount of poo that poured into the harbour was equal to two Olympic-sized swimming pools . Not good for Wellington 's image , even if the new mayor 's poo-free public swim was intended to reassure us . <p> The city council also has a new chief executive , chosen from within its ranks . Barbara McKerrow , the council 's former chief operating officer , made special mention of the staff when her new job was announced : <p> " I am proud to work for Wellington , the communities we serve and the talented staff in our organisation . It is a privilege to be entrusted to build on the strong foundations put in place by Kevin Lavery , and to support our Mayor and Council to shape the successful future of our beautiful city . " <p> Also chosen from within the ranks is the new chief executive at Te Papa , Courtney Johnston . She also had something to say about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And unlike her predecessors , she said she did not plan a restructuring . <p> There was no change of chief executive at the regional council , but there are a number of new members and a new chair Daran Ponter who 's taking a stronger and more active role to try to fix the bus problems . He wants Wellington to have eighty more electric buses ( they 'll be " doing a disproportionate amount of the lifting on the city bus network " ) by the end of next year , with the aim of a 100 per cent electric fleet by the end of the decade . <p> But till more electric buses arrive , pollution from diesel buses in the CBD -- we learnt before Christmas -- will continue to be as bad as a clogged multi-lane motorway . A direct legacy of the foolish decision to get rid of trolleys . <p> The regional council approved an " action plan " for buses , with fewer transfers and more direct services . Not to be overlooked , the city council joined the new era with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is an idea that 's been talked about for years . Maybe this year it will happen . ( Helped by the fact that LGWM is also claiming the credit . ) <p> The two councils voted in favour of the LGWM transport plan , which offers them $3.4billion from the government , with a big contribution ( yet to be budgetted ) from ratepayers as well . Andy talked about " really starting moving " and Daran said it was a " once in a lifetime opportunity . " But actual plans were hard to find , as LGWM just went on consulting . In October , it was evident that any specific plans were a long way off . After five years , there was n't even a decision on whether mass rapid transit would be light rail , or the untested trackless trams . Either way , either system will need its own route , free of other traffic . <p> Back in May , LGWM was full of good intentions with a big announcement about a " step change in transport . " But parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some big fails -- most notably failing to do anything about the dismal fact that State Highway 1 runs through the centre of town on Vivian Street , satisfying neither pedestrians ( who wait forever at intersections ) nor drivers ( stopped at every intersection by traffic lights . ) Confusion reigned : the LGWM document talked bravely about " undergrounding State Highway 1 in both directions through Te Aro , " but when Transport Minister Phil Twyford released his list of what the government would pay for , the undergrounding had been deleted . <p> Throughout the year , Wellington.Scoop published a convincing series of articles in which contributors amassed all the evidence to show that building more lanes for traffic does nothing to resolve traffic problems . An internationally recognised fact of transport planning , most recently and persuasively summarised for us in a December article by Guy Marriage . But the National Party chooses to ignore this reality , as shown by Nicola Willis 's blue posters around the Mt Victoria Tunnel . <p> Andy Foster gave hope that there might be information , instead of silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He promised reports on the Central Library and Civic Square in the first two months of this year . We 'll be ready and waiting for them . <p> The abrupt closure of the Central Library left a gap in the lives of thousands . Way more than thousands -- it was visited by more than a million people a year . The most popular building in the city . The most-visited building in the city . Knowing its unchallenged popularity , it was strange to hear conversations that its uses should somehow be changed when it is reopened or rebuilt . <p> " Saving and rehabilitating the library is one of the options . It may well be possible to do this , and because adaptation of an existing building is a more sustainable solution than demolition and replacement , this option would be consistent with the Council 's goal of a ' zero-carbon capital city ' . " <p> At the packed public meeting , a leading architect and a leading structural engineer both insisted that the library could be strengthened and reopened . And they estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated by Justin Lester . We reported from the meeting : <p> Architect Gordon Moller said : " It has not been damaged . It can be remediated . " Structural engineer Adam Thornton , with 40 years ' experience in multi-storey seismic design , said the hollow-core floors would be " an easy mode to repair , " by adding bracing which would be relatively straightforward to install . He said base isolation would not be complicated to add , as the library has a basement which would provide suitable space for the new technology . <p> It was however pointless to argue that the council 's $154million budget for a convention centre would have been better spent on a new library . ( There 's no way that a convention centre will attract even ten per cent of the library 's users . ) By the time of the closure , Willis Bond were starting construction on what many of us believe will fit into the category of a white elephant .

This plan has also been years in the making , with Victoria University first pulling out of a deal to buy the adjacent Municipal Office Building , but then signing a deal to lease it . Leaving the council to pay the necessary strengthening costs . <p> The Town Hall is n't the only major entertainment venue closed for performances .

His achievement was recognised with an ONZM in the New Year Honours . <p> The per capita attendance at our film festival is one of the highest in the world . And we have a world reputation as a movie capital , which was strengthened as James Cameron started work out at Miramar on not one but two sequels to his record-breaking Avatar .

Even competing , successfully , with the NZSO when it strangely scheduled one of its Shed concerts to compete with the local orchestra . Also Wellington based , the NZSO presented some massive works , as well as a sold-out presentation of one of the Star Wars films , with the orchestra playing the score by John Williams . <p> Wellington audiences were fortunate to see not one but two of the great musicals by the American composer Stephen Sondheim .

Georgina Campbell distinguished herself with more Wellington coverage than usual in the NZ Herald . ( Though I wish she 'd stop writing about " the failed Basin flyover ...

What a strange political moment we are in where latent demand for something is a reason not to increase the supply . On that basis we should not build any more houses because it only increases demand for more houses . The driver in both instances is Wellington 's and New Zealand 's rapidly expanding population . This significant increase has happened alongside inadequate investment in infrastructure or services which have fallen behind .

Cars are even further from a single market . They compete to attract people , with walking , cycling and public transport of all kinds . They also compete for road-space with trucks of all sizes . New Zealand has traditionally funded roads , subsidised public transport a little , and ignored other needs . Railways were privatised and asset-stripped . Walking and cycling was deterred by pollution , noise and risk . Now we are , at last , beginning to see the downsides . Cars use road-space very inefficiently , causing traffic jams and polluting cities . Several cities have relieved congestion by closing roads . People get the message , and make the changes they have long been thinking about . Copenhagen , Amsterdam and many other cities move more citizens on less road-space , because most people do not use cars . Walking and cycling are much safer , more relaxing , and good exercise , in much cleaner air . Some cars are used , and many tradesmen need vans , but most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more effective when they are not delayed by cars . Light rail is even better , and trains better still for long distances . London is building cycling super-highways . In Wellington , LGWM surveys show that most people want change , and LGWM has adopted the objective ' more people in fewer vehicles . ' Wellington 's narrow streets effectively demand such a policy . Fewer cars reduces pollution , climate change and emissions , ( cars kill twice as many people with emissions as in crashes ) , increases safety , improves health ( more exercise ) . City streets become much more desirable places to be . City businesses flourish , and people get to know their neighbours . More cars reverse all these processes , at very high cost ; road-building is costly and the space is used very inefficiently . Car-use is heavily subsidised . Half of city roading costs come from rates ( which cyclists also pay ) , and parking is another money-sink .

January 2020 , 9:21 <p> Wellington needs to plan for its transport future from the perspective of improving its connections to the wider region and enhancing its position in the national economy , especially with a view to attracting investment . The LGWM process however appears to take as its starting point the predilections of Wellington 's inner city dwellers , who appear to believe they would stand to benefit from light rail to the airport and that everyone else should use this form of transport or cycle lanes . <p> @Gillybee : the peer-reviewed study is one of many available . It assesses the rate of return on investment in the US Federal Highway system over 40 years which it finds has been substantial and of benefit to national productivity and living standards . <p> @ Traveller : SH1 runs through the centre of Wellington , currently in a chaotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a ring-road or bypass . Ideally SH1 should be four-laned and trenched between the Terrace Tunnel and Mt Victoria , providing an uninterrupted dual carriageway together with grade separation at the Basin . This would reduce congestion and emissions and improve safety , efficiency and Wellington 's economic performance . <p> Kerry , 3 . January 2020 , 9:29 <p> Northland , an interesting question . Karori is n't big enough for light rail , and conventional buses would be fine if they were n't delayed by the cars . Two lanes for cars and two for buses would be ideal , but pricey . Now that bus priority traffic signals are on the golden mile agenda , some sort of three-lane layout might do the trick , with buses in the peak direction using the third lane . It will need some thought about bus stops , where the third lane goes ( not necessarily in the middle ) , traffic signals , turning traffic and so on , and will need extra width in places . Even the Karori tunnel might be manageable , because it is short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a bus could be given priority a few seconds before it reached the signals , to give time for the tunnel to clear . Karori-bound would be harder , but extra width might do the trick . <p> Glen Smith , 3 . January 2020 , 10:15 <p> Trevor H. The article you reference simply states what is self evident -- that a country requires a functional road network . Extrapolating this to say every road in any circumstance is justified ( as you appear to do ) demonstrates childlike analysis . Research in fact shows higher road supply in cities in the USA is associated with lower economic productivity -- see graph 17 page 42 in this excellent Victoria Transport Planning Institute article . Transport network design ( and hence funding allocation ) should aim to optimise overall transport efficiency . As the article wisely points out , this should be " based on overall accessibility ( people 's overall ability to reach desired services and activities ) rather than just mobility ( travel speed ) . " This should include all transport modes and the mode mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is size and density of the population ( see figure 14 page 38 of the article ) . In rural areas population is low ( so unable to sustain PT ) and distances are larger ( making cycling and walking less viable ) so optimal road share is high . In contrast in large dense cities demand is high ( sustaining high efficiency PT ) and distances are shorter ( making cycling/walking more viable ) . As Kerry points out , allocating too much space in cities to roads restricts more efficient modes ( PT , cycling , walking ) and leads to lower overall accessibility . As the graph indicates road share in large dense cities is optimally less than 20% . <p> So given limited funding will overall accessibility for the people of Wellington be increased increased more by investing in extra roads ? or in more efficient alternative modes ? The clear cut answer is alternative modes . Again this does n't say extra roading is n't justified in individual circumstances . E.g. I support extra roading to the east immediately because with projected growth this will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to combine this with the other essential modes ( dedicated PT corridor , cycling , walking ) in a large bore multipurpose second Mt Victoria Tunnel which should be a top priority . On the other hand there is no way that a second Terrace Tunnel or undergrounding SH1 across Te Aro , while on the ' nice to have ' list , can be justified compared to the increased accessibility that would be achieved by investing the same money in the most pressing need -- a high quality rail based across town rapid transit corridor -- and Phil Twyford and the Labour/ Green/ NZ First coalition are right to place these further down the funding priority list . <p> TrevorH , 3 . January 2020 , 15:23 <p> @ Glen Smith : Thank you for the Victoria Transport Planning Institute article . Nadiri and Mamuneas who are referenced in the Victoria study found that while the initial contribution to productivity gained from establishing a highway network was large , additional investments produced impacts which were not of the same scale but which nevertheless remained important . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously . <p> I am pleased you agree there is an urgent need for extra roading to the east and that a second Mt Victoria Tunnel should be a top priority . Reportedly the NZTA originally recommended the second tunnel should proceed before work might begin on a light rail connection in order to minimize disruption from the latter 's construction . It is of concern that this advice appears to have been rejected . <p> Glen Smith , 3 . January 2020 , 16:22 <p> Trevor H. I did n't say that there was an urgent need for increased roading to the east -- the urgency is for high quality dedicated PT ( preferably rail ) , cycling and walking . These , if implemented well , could negate the need for increased road capacity for many years . But based on long term growth , extra road capacity is inevitable and , since the best way to achieve this is a single multi purpose tunnel , this should all proceed together rather than having to retrospectively add additional road capacity later . Hopefully planners are objectively assessing this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> Just an Observer , 3 . January 2020 , 18:42 <p> Perhaps it 's time to give the Regional Council a break on the question of Euro 3 buses a number have recently been sold or transferred north as the NZ Bus double decker fleet came on line . The previous management of NZ Bus played silly buggers for almost two years , firstly dragging the chain on signing the DAU contracts ( signed in March 2017 when the PTOM legislation allowed 90 days from the signing of the tendered unit contracts ) and then by proposing that they should be allowed to convert the trolley buses into hybrids ( the " Wrightspeed " solution ) and then , when that proved a failure , coming up with a second proposal to convert obsolete buses with 40 year old running gear to pure electric and classify these as their " new " fleet in order to meet the PTOM requirement of 50% brand new . <p> I 'm not privy to what the financial proposals were but I 'll bet that these were unacceptable to both GWRC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Technically the GWRC could have withdrawn the DAU offer after the 90 day period ran out but , possibly because this may have been politically unacceptable -- and certainly it would have brought Infratil into the battle -- or because they felt they had to bend over to assist the unsuccessful incumbent remember that NZ Bus had not tendered for the Hutt or Porirua because they did n't want to risk exceeding the 60% rule so confident were the old management that they would clean up the three Wellington City tender units . <p> And virtually the first decision of the new owners of NZ Bus was to dump the trolley bus conversion proposals as unsustainable . Presumably NZ Bus are now negotiating with international suppliers for the new fleet ( around 55 buses I believe ) but it still means that 2 1/2 years will have passed between Tranzit , Uzabus and Mana/Newlands placing their orders for new vehicles and NZ Bus doing so . <p> Ross Clark , 4 .

What they did as an organisation run by astute business people was to adhere to the rules , instructions , and opportunities granted to them by the GWRC and its interpretation of PTOM legislation . NZ Bus being a private business has its first responsibility to its shareholders , as they are not a charity . As to whether NZ Bus are good corporate citizens , that 's another matter . <p> On the other side we had the GWRC governed by 13 part time councillors with not a jot of successful business acumen between them ( well none that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did not understand the consequences of .

Civil servants are the last people to be let loose running commercial operations . The councillors and officers are required to protect the health and safety of their citizens , but what they did with the bus debacle was to imperil the health of those who frequent the Wellington CBD . The air quality was bad enough before the trolley buses were withdrawn , as shown by the recordings the GWRC referenced . What they did was to look at the region as a whole and extrapolate the effects of the replacement of diesel buses outside the Wellington CBD and contend that it would be to the advantage of all everywhere in the region . <p> A rational argument , and risk analysis , would have seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones before they dismantled that system . Euro 3 buses ex Auckland were being introduced as early as 2015 when extra capacity on the then 3 route was pointed out to Metlink by brassed off commuters . The numbers of these old buses increased from that time as trolley buses were taken out of service rather than be given extensive maintenance . <p> Will we see the promised 80 electric buses running Wellington City routes by the end of 2020 if most have yet to be ordered ? Somehow I doubt it . <p> Keith Flinders , 4 . January 2020 , 12:27 <p> When the finger pointing stops as to who caused the collapse of the 80 year old sewer tunnel , who will get the blame ?

The trolley buses with their fixed wires across the city did n't fit the picture , so had to go . Rogernomes like Fran Wilde and Paul Swain fell in line . <p> The " state of the network " a bit like our sewage pipes , was the inevitable result of lack of investment/regular preventative maintenance , like so much of our infrastructure .

Party colleagues knew there were others who would also have stories to tell , were they to be asked . <p> Parliament is a place where such questions are not asked . It was like affairs . People knew they were happening and simply looked the other way . Speaking the answer out loud would mean action must be taken . <p> When it came to Ross , Bridges was running out of places to look . <p> Ross , it was known among National MPs , " did not have a good relationship with his staff " . <p> " A high turnover of staff ... there were people leaving in tears , " says a former colleague of Ross . <p> " You can look at a handful of Members of Parliament and see exactly that . They rattle through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up doing it all themselves because Parliamentary Services wo n't recruit anyone - they 've already had to pay out four or five staff . " <p> It was also known in the caucus Ross had carried out an extra-marital relationship with a fellow MP which had ended badly . <p> The complainants of which Bridges was aware were all women and included the MP with whom Ross had a relationship . She had spoken with concern about adverse behaviour exhibited by her former lover . <p> Ross was in danger of becoming a serious liability . <p> The events which led to Ross ' moment of crisis can be pieced together using blog posts by Ross ' support person , anti-National blogger Cameron Slater , interviews with insiders and an analysis of the unfolding events . <p> It sees Bridges , chief of staff Jamie Gray , and deputy leader Paula Bennett waiting for Ross on September 26 to deliver news which would see the end of his high-flying success in politics . <p> " Concerns around inappropriate behaviour were raised separately to the leak investigation and put to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this week . " At that time there was no evidence to suggest who was behind the leak . " <p> In the meeting which followed , the allegations were laid out . Allegations of harassment and inexcusable treatment of those who worked in Parliamentary offices . <p> Ross was asked to explain . Instead , he demanded details - a point by point series of allegations . He offered no explanation . <p> Instead , there was denial and rejection of wrongdoing . <p> Ross was finished . He was told he had to resign his portfolios , take leave and return in 2019 as a lowly backbencher . <p> Ross later said : " Simon and Paula were judge , jury and executioners and it all happened in a matter of minutes . " <p> Ross walked into the meeting with a career which held - in his view - few limits . He left with nothing . <p> Ross later said he returned to his apartment and was " quite a mess " . Hours later , according to Slater , Ross called Lusk for advice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made at 1.45am . <p> Whatever advice was offered , a text transcript published by Slater shows Ross demanding Bridges meet him alone the next day . <p> Ross : " I will meet you one on one . This is between you and me . " <p> Bridges : " It is n't . It 's not personal . It is about the National caucus and party . " <p> Ross : " It 's about my career and your leadership . I am prepared to meet you one on one . " <p> Bridges : " It is not about my leadership . It is about the National caucus and party . <p> Ross : " I have some things to say that only you should hear . " <p> This meeting was also secretly recorded by Ross with an excerpt later played on NewstalkZB . <p> It is this meeting in which Bridges tells Ross complaints from four women is just the tip of the iceberg . <p> Ross : " You 're expecting me to just accept that you 've heard things and you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bridges : " I think that happened . In all honesty Jami-Lee , if I gave you natural justice on these issues , it would n't be four or five . It would be fifteen . " <p> That was Thursday . Ross returned to Parliament the next week and , on Tuesday , issued an agreed statement . <p> It stated : " Recently I have been dealing with some personal health issues . There are times in life where you have to put your own health and family first . <p> " As a husband and a father I need to do that at this time . That is why I have asked to have some time off on medical leave for a few months . " <p> He would leave the front bench and his portfolio would go to someone else . <p> Ross went home to Auckland , saying later : " I could see my world crashing down around me . " He would speak of having a " mental breakdown " . <p> *** <p> The week of Ross ' dramatic exit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hired PWC to produce . <p> It identified Ross as being the person who most likely leaked the expenses and later sent the anonymous text message expressing mental health issues . <p> In the case of the text message , Ross had said he was with Bridges when it was received . It would mean - if he was in the room - he had sent it while with Bridges . By Ross ' description of events , he then pressed Bridges to drop the inquiry into the expenses leak . <p> Bennett and Bridges travelled to meet with Ross to explain he had been caught and there were consequences . <p> By now , they would have had serious concerns about the man who had occupied such a central role and risen to a position of influence within the party . <p> They left for Wellington and Ross took to Twitter : " Later today Simon Bridges is going to attempt to pin his leak inquiry on me . <p> " Some months ago I fell out with Simon . I have internally been questioning leadership decisions he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is becoming more and more unlikable in the public 's eyes . " <p> Ross then revealed he had secretly recorded Bridges , claiming to capture his leader allegedly discussing " unlawful activity that he was involved in " . <p> " This evidence led Simon to push me out on medical leave a few weeks ago . It was essentially an attempt to stop me from speaking publicly . " <p> In Wellington , gazumped by their already-rogue MP , Bennett and Bridges fronted media to reveal the contents of the report . <p> Bridges spoke of the leak , the text message and other issues involving Ross " conduct " which revealed a " pattern " of behaviour . <p> The National caucus would meet the next day to vote on whether Ross would be suspended , he said . <p> Those issues were separate from Ross ' health , which he took seriously . " Today I have taken steps to ensure Jami-Lee has the necessary support around him at this time . " <p> He dismissed the allegations from Ross . <p> " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about Jami-Lee Ross , who was preparing to drive to Wellington . <p> He had made a plan and the plan was Wellington . It was nine hours of driving , he said .. <p> " I knew I needed to be here because that 's where all of you are , " he told media . " I needed the time out because I needed to clear my head and think about what I needed to do . " <p> Cameron Slater later said Ross had slept in his car . By Ross ' account , he rose and prepared a statement for media . At 10.46am , he turned on his phone ( " there were about 100 messages " ) and announced a press conference for 11am . <p> Shortly after 11am , Ross stepped out on the black and white tiles in the foyer of Parliament and told gathered media : " This day has been coming for months . " <p> And then he set forth on an extraordinary 50-minute press conference in which he repeatedly attacked Simon Bridges . <p> " My dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am the target of a campaign to push me out . " <p> He praised the " good people " in National , spoke kindly of Bennett . Bridges , though , bore the brunt of his attack . <p> " I 've been critical of Simon Bridges ' leadership because he went out to the country to introduce himself and the country said , ' Simon , we do n't like you much ' . " <p> There were tanking poll ratings . <p> " The NZ public is not stupid . They had seen what I failed to see until now . " <p> Ross spoke of how allegations of adverse behaviour towards women had an impact on his mental health . <p> He was fine , he said . " I got assistance . A doctor has says I 'm fit enough to make decisions about my career and my future and to speak publicly so I 'm doing that now . " <p> The allegation had apparently emerged through women emerging over a " few weeks " prior to the confrontation with Bennett and Bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best of my knowledge , I have not harassed any women , " he said . " I have served in public office for 15 years and I have never once had such a complaint made against me until now . " <p> His response was contrary to details which would emerge during the week , including former National Party candidate Katrina Bungard 's allegations of a campaign by Ross during a community board power play . <p> Bungard came forward on October 18 . It was the same day an online news outlet ran claims from four anonymous women about adverse behaviour by Ross . <p> Ross attempted the seize the agenda the following day in an interview on NewstalkZB with Healther du Plessis Allan during which he again asserted his wellness . <p> Having been confronted with actual , specific details , Ross acknowledged he was aware of Bungard 's specific allegation and offered her an public apology . He said the complaint raised by Bungard had been dealt with through mediation , carried out by Goodfellow and regional chairman Andrew Hunt . <p> He had apologised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up " Bungard 's complaints . Bungard , National 's most recent candidate for Manurewa , has said she was content with the resolution and believed the party had done all it could . <p> Ross also admitted to extra-marital affairs , named one of the women he slept with in the interview , and apologised to his wife . <p> " I have n't been a good husband and I need to do a lot of things in the future to make that right and I 'm going to continue doing that . " <p> His infidelity was something of which his wife had been unaware . <p> Ross claimed the details had emerged because he had challenged Bridges . <p> " When you question power ... when you become a liability for the media , you wind up in the media . " <p> As his denials over harassment collapsed into apologies , so were his claims of evidence proving Bridges ' corruption . <p> When the claims are studied alongside the evidence offered by Ross , they collapse . <p> For example , he claimed the $100,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never been declared . Yet when Ross left Wellington police station , he described how the money came from eight different donors and was under $15,000 - meaning the legal limit for public declaration was never reached and it never needed to be made public . <p> When Ross produced text messages as evidence to support his position , the contents actually showed the National Party going through a rigorous process to check the source of the money . <p> And yet Ross insisted to du Plessis Allan the evidence was clear . <p> In Ross ' view , his public shaming had been orchestrated by the National Party as revenge for disclosing its secrets . <p> And he was preparing to disclose more . <p> ******* <p> Then , Ross ' mental health appeared to collapse . <p> Almost 24 hours after the NewstalkZB interview , Slater says Ross found himself alone in his car , " homeless " and scrolling through text messages trying to work out how so much had changed . <p> Among the messages was one one sent by his former MP lover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words : " You deserve to die . " In later blog posts , Slater has tried to claim it was a message urging self-harm but the content of the message carries no explicit instruction . <p> Yet Ross responded with the words : " You get your wish . " He then turned his phone off . <p> It was a message which sparked a frenzy of activity . The woman called Ross repeatedly , sent text messages asking if he was okay and had support . She also called for urgent help . <p> National Party chief of staff Jamie Gray was alerted . It appears it was he who called Ross ' mental health professional - the details had been supplied after Ross took leave from Parliament . <p> Police were called to track down the MP . It is likely it was a situation in which police needed to enact emergency cellphone tracking provisions . Ross was found and taken into care at Middlemore Hospital . <p> It was during this time Slater emerged publicly to openly alongside Ross in opposition to the under seige National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes through briefing journalists or being quoted as an anonymous " friend " of Ross . <p> Slater is a curious character in National Party politics . His father John Slater , a former National Party president , was blue to the bone . Slater grew up playing with children of National Party ministers as their parents discussed affairs of state . <p> Slate discovered blogging after a business failure and an extended period of mental illness so debilitating he was unable to work . The Whaleoil blog became his outlet and treatment . It also became a soapbox for his political views , or for the views of those he supported . <p> This was tolerated until he and Lusk were seen to be meddling in the management of the party and selection of candidates . Then after Dirty Politics in 2014 he became a pariah . No National MP or hopeful candidate wanted to be associated with Slater or his blog . His relevance diminished , as did the prominence of his blog as his access to genuine inside information dwindled to the point where it appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Slater was back in the thick of it . The struggles with mental health was also an area with which he was very familiar . <p> Slater wrote of working with an unnamed individual to help Ross , saying : " We both have a mutual friend who I consider to be one of the wisest people I know . We are both working hard to support Jami-Lee Ross as friends . " Those previously close to Slater say the man he called " like a second father " was Paul Honnor , millionaire and Seventh Day Adventist church leader . Ross and Slater had previously attended Honnor 's weekly prayer meetings at the Seventh Day Adventist Church in Manukau . <p> Honnor has long supported Slater and was even a director of the Whaleoil blog holding company , Social Media Consultants Ltd , for three years.The businessman was believed to have had an influential role in guiding Ross , who grew up without a father.With Ross in care , Slater accused the National Party of a " hit job " through releasing the report into the leaker when Ross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The party had said it had " taken seriously the mental health concerns raised by Mr Ross and the medical professionals he has been involved with " . <p> Slater 's dismissal prompted a phone call from Bridges to offer the blogger assurances there was sincere concern and thought around Ross ' mental health . <p> One senior figure inside National spoke of being astonished Bridges would make such a call , given Slater 's opposition to the party . <p> For National , Slater 's alignment with the rogue MP was a nightmare scenario . It appeared to allow the blogger access to the bereft MP 's text messages , even while he was in care . <p> It was an unnerving position for the National Party , which had spoken internally of its ability to seek a High Court injunction on text messages and secret recordings . The debate was settled prior to Slater 's emergence yet considered again when the blogger began angrily attacking National with the contents of Ross ' phone . <p> In all , Ross spent little more than two days in residential mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively disappeared , announcing on Twitter in recent days : " I appreciate all the recent messages of support . I was well looked after by the fantastic people at Middlemore , and grateful for their care . <p> " On medical advice I remain on leave , but have given National my proxy vote to ensure Botany continues to be represented in Parliament . " <p> Slater , meanwhile , appeared to be developing his campaign with a gradual release of text messages . <p> His last post of the subject was around the identity of Ross ' MP lover and whether it should be made public . 
@@31553234 <p> If we thought term deposit rates were low at this time last year , well 2019 saw them fall even further . <p> About the only positive things to observe as 2020 starts is that at least they are above the inflation rate . And at least they are higher here than in Australia . But that will be cold comfort to savers . <p> And that inflation premium is actually quite tiny - after paying tax , the return will barely cover inflation , no matter what tax rate you are on . <p> It is not a great time to rely on interest income from term deposits . Rates are low and do n't really look like they will be rising significantly any time soon . <p> Term deposits are no longer about ' earnings ' - they are now just a place to park some wealth in a place where the risks of capital loss is relatively low . ( But remember , they are not zero - for risk-free you would need to park it in Kiwi Bonds at 1% . ) <p> During 2019 , six month rates from the main fell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cut between -0.60% and -0.80% and one year rates fell between -0.80% and -0.90% , while eighteen month rates fell the most , between -0.85% and -0.90% . This is consistent with a flattening of the rate curves during the year . <p> For challenger banks , they tended to offer lower rates on average for terms one year and less , but Heartland and ICBC offered the highest of any banks . Challenger banks also tended to trim their rates less over the year . <p> But readers will notice that among these rates , the reductions have been generally larger for tenors of one year and more than the annual OCR change which went from 1.75% to 1.00% in the period . Longer term savers paid the full price of those cuts , and a bit more , ( and that contrasts with mortgage borrowers - details here ) . <p> But despite that depressing situation , you can say that returns in New Zealand are significantly better than those on offer from the same institutions in Australia . <p> $10,000+ , at maturity , pa <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ m <p> Australia <p> % <p> % <p> % <p> % <p> % <p> % <p> % <p> % <p> ANZ <p> 2.10 <p> 1.60 <p> 2.70 <p> 0.85 <p> 2.30 <p> 1.40 <p> 2.30 <p> 0.90 <p> CBA <p> 2.50 <p> 1.25 <p> 1.80 <p> 1.50 <p> 2.20 <p> 1.30 <p> 2.30 <p> 1.10 <p> HSBC <p> 2.05 <p> 1.35 <p> 1.65 <p> 1.25 <p> 1.95 <p> 1.10 <p> 1.95 <p> 1.10 <p> NAB <p> 2.10 <p> 1.10 <p> 2.40 <p> 1.10 <p> 2.40 <p> 1.20 <p> 2.40 <p> 1.20 <p> Suncorp <p> 2.35 <p> 1.50 <p> 2.30 <p> 1.60 <p> 2.55 <p> 1.40 <p> 2.35 <p> 1.30 <p> Westpac <p> 2.05 <p> 1.15 <p> 1.90 <p> 1.10 <p> 2.30 <p> 1.20 <p> 2.30 <p> 1.20 <p> Best main Australian bank <p> 2.50 <p> 1.60 <p> 2.70 <p> 1.60 <p> 2.55 <p> 1.40 <p> 2.40 <p> 1.30 <p> Australian rates are now seriously lower there than what is on offer in New Zealand , and all well below inflation on an after-tax basis . And they have fallen much more than their own OCR rate cuts . <p> Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AU$250,000 but savers pay a sharp price for that protection . When the New Zealand scheme comes into force , expect our term deposit offer rates to fall away as well . <p> In either country , the possibility of getting a meaningfully better rate by shopping around is n't huge . But a quick glance at the tables above shows there are some opportunities . <p> If you do n't use term deposits as your store of wealth , what should you use ? There are options : <p> Firstly , KiwiSaver funds have the advantage of boosted contributions . True , recent market volatility may have knocked some fund values a bit , but if you are in KiwiSaver for the right reason ( long-term retirement saving ) you should look past that volatility . <p> Secondly , some people think residential investment property is an alternative , but it is clear there are significant value risks ( both ways ) , tax risks , effort risks from managing tenants , legal risks from rising obligations under the upgraded Tenancy Act , and leverage risks ( where investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly is n't passive . And liquidity when markets go sour can be a real issue . <p> Also not passive is the option of investing in or owning a small business , but this is another wealth building option . There are many new ' alternative asset ' invetment options these days . Liquidity issues can also be a big negative however . <p> Annuities might be part of your considerations , as might other types of investment funds ( including the low-fee index funds ) . <p> The bottom line is that these things are easier on you if you take control of them and do it early . You ca n't start too early . <p> In a low interest world , the best asset you may have is the wage or salary from a job . Consider this . How much would you have needed to save to get a return of , say , $70,000 per year , pre-tax ? If your term deposit rate is 2.60% pa , then you essentially have an asset in that job worth $2.7 mln . And that shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same income . As scary as that may seem , the best chance you have is to save aggressively . You probably do n't need all of that , as universal NZ Superannuation is worth the equivalent of about $700,000 . Saving aggressively will never hurt , and new higher contribution rates in KiwiSaver will soon aid you in doing that . <p> Meanwhile , if you are a term deposit saver , be thankful for low inflation , and the fact you are n't facing Australian ( or US , or Canadian , or EU , or Japanese , or UK ) term deposit interest rates . <p> Also remember , you have the option of decumulation . Reverse mortgages can be part of that , but despite the enticing advertising , be very , very careful about this choice . It could end in tears just when you have no good options . <p> We welcome your help to improve our coverage of this issue . Any examples or experiences to relate ?

In theory small quantity bank deposits become as secure but I would n't bet on it . And as far as annuities go : to indulge in that game you would have to be 100% sure that the company would not go bust ! <p> Term deposits are no longer about ' earnings ' - they are now just a place to park some wealth in a place where the risks of capital loss is relatively low . ( But remember , they are not zero - for risk-free you would need to park it in Kiwi Bonds at 1% . ) <p> The NZ Government certainly has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sets official savings rates this low out to four years . The three percent , twelve month deposit rate I extracted from my bank late last year can only mean reward for high risk . <p> Well these rates of 1% are linked ( slightly below ) to what the govt is being offered for its bonds on the wholesale market . Which in turn is related to the OCR . Which in turn is related to the required rate of inflation plus some nebulous wellbeing cra .. Supply and demand I suppose . <p> Worse , the notion that " low interest rates justify high stock valuations " assumes that the growth rate of future cash flows is held constant , at historically normal levels . If , as we presently observe , interest rates are low because growth rates are low , no valuation premium is " justified " by low interest rates at all . <p> Presently , the combination of record low interest rates and record high stock market valuations does nothing but add insult to injury . <p> So the country and the speculators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deposits to stocks and other risky ventures which many of them do n't understand or do n't have the inclination to manage ? What a shame ? If the country 's leaders can not come up with worthwhile schemes to develop the economy , other than robbing the oldies of their saved funds , we are in fire straits . Remember even the expert pension fund investors all over the world and fund managers were ribbed by the quants who engendered the GFC , which benefited only Goldman Sucks &amp; Morgan Stealy and Warren Buffet ( the ultimate insider ) . The oldies are not going to be fooled . They have better life experiences . Only thing is they do n't have a common group and a voice to represent them , like the AARP in the US . <p> Agreed Yvil . Those who retired five to ten years ago expecting the returns from their term deposits to supplement their superannuation will be finding that they will be returning well under half what they would have expected and having to reconsider their strategy and especially their risk tolerance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winners here . However , over the past decade the emergence of a low interest rate environment and considerable increase in house values , there will those generation X and Y - who seem very , very quiet - who are real winners purchasing homes in 2010/112 when mortgage interest rates were around the 8% . These generations have been double whammy winners as their mortgage interest rates and payments will have more than halved and their homes doubled in value . <p> Boomers who own property have too been winners , are you suggesting their properties did n't increase at the same magnitude as those Gen X and Y 's over that same period in time ? Many of these Boomers also would have bought in the early 70 's and seen inflation halve their debt burden in 5 years , hence Muldoon had to freeze their wages in the early 80 's . Boomers go on , and on , and on , and on about buying property at 20%+ interest rates , now interest rates are below 4% . <p> Yes it sucks for all those Boomers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote for Muldoon ( in protest of Labour 's " communist " superannuation plan in favour of a universal super ) has backfired , you 've made your bed now lie in it . Millennials are often mocked for their supposed poor financial planning , I implore any Boomers finding retirement a struggle due to their returns on Super or Term Deposits take a look in the mirror for a change . <p> Is n't your conclusion similar in nature to the boomers supposed comments about the millennials needing to suck it up and become responsible for their life and savings ? <p> Maybe empathy for others situations might come back in vogue someday . Based on some comments , I should n't hold my breath waiting for this to happen . <p> Personally , I require return of capital rather than return on capital . As long as returns keep up with inflation , I 'm good for another 40 years or so . Saving aggressively at an early age pays serious rewards . <p> The whole house inflation thing is a bit silly as a generational comparison on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been far superior to housing returns for many decades , albeit with more short term volatility . The returns have been far larger in the last decade , which would benefit the younger generation handsomely if they did n't waste their money trying to climb the property ladder . Look at the returns for a dollar cost averaging investment in an index fund over the past decade or two . This investment approach generated far superior returns than the equivalent unleveraged investment in housing for virtually all time periods . Focusing on just property as the wealth generation method is seriously flawed thinking . The past decade has had a huge gain in the share market , dwarfing the relatively small gains in the property market . Fortunately , the property affordability has n't changed much in the last decade due to the large reduction in interest rates . <p> My suggestion , save aggressively from a young age , invest in indexed funds , and buy a modest house after one has saved enough so that one is n't putting ones entire savings into the down payment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aggressive savings . Live beneath ones means , at least for the first two decades of working . <p> Can you explain to me unless you are down sizing or moving to the provinces ( that has not been " discovered ) how a considerable increase in house values will benefit generation X and Y apart from " feeling wealthy " ? <p> frazz You miss the point . Here we are talking interest rates . Those X and Y who bought houses around 2010/112 would have been paying in the order of 7.5% will now be paying about 3.5% - around about half that . So while those who hold deposits as rates have been falling they have lost out ; however , hand-in-hand with interest rates falling so to has the interest payments on mortgage will have been falling . See the losers and winners ? Also frazz , it is more than just " feeling wealthy " . With rise in house values has meant an increase in equity ; this does not have to be realised , but can be used as leverage to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , start up a business , buy a holiday home or a rental property - and all at historically low interest rates while mortgage payments on that 25 year loan being a lot less than in 2010/12 . So it is a lot more than " just feeling wealthy " . So yes , falling interest rates have benefit a group of generation X and Y considerably in a double whammy . <p> So Gen X and Y are " winners " by topping up their home loans ? I mean sure , topping up your mortgage to buy a $30k car at 3.5% is better than financing it at 9.95% but by no means is it winning . The loan still needs to be paid back . <p> I 've seen a 40%+ increase in equity in the 2.5 years I 've owned my first home , my mortgage broker thought I was a winner until I declined the opportunity to extend my credit to buy a new car or fund house renovations . <p> Paying back a loan at 3.5% rather than 9.5% ( and if a necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance company with the car as security ) is far more preferable and one is better off so seems a " bit of a winner " to me . <p> I was n't aware of any floating exchange rate central banks that worked on any basis other than that , for the banking system as a whole , credit and deposits are created simultaneously . He quoted the Bank of England to that effect : I matched him with the Reserve Bank of New Zealand . Link <p> Deposits are nothing other than someone 's promise to pay in the future . <p> There 's never been a banking crisis due to too much lending to small manufacturing firms . Riskier borrowers are those using the newly created bank credit to purchase assets , financial or property . Ban bank credit to non-GDP transactions &amp; forget all other regulations .

" <p> A Government spokesperson said any move to centralise local government elections would take several years . <p> " If responsibility for local elections is centralised at some future time , that would allow reassessment of the risks and benefits of options to support voter participation at the local level while safeguarding the democratic process .

" <p> It was concerns about the long-term viability of the postal service that caused LGNZ to back calls for online voting during a review of the 2016 local body elections . <p> With the decline of mailboxes councils are putting out ballot boxes for voters to slot in their votes .

" <p> Whether turnout would increase under a different voting system is a moot point , especially given international trends . <p> The excitement surrounding Auckland 's first ' supercity ' election in 2010 boosted turnout by 12 percent but it returned to pre-supercity levels just one election cycle later . <p> Reid said turnout at New Zealand 's local elections had been relatively consistent for the past three elections - around the 40 percent mark .

@@31574233 <h> NZ firm promises solution to Tiwai Point <p> A New Zealand firm says its potline technology could help Rio Tinto keep Tiwai Point open , help the Government cut carbon emissions and help Meridian 's bottom line , Marc Daalder reports <p> Geoff Matthews believes he can save Tiwai Point . <p> The troubled aluminium smelter uses about 12 percent of New Zealand 's electricity every year , pays tens of millions of dollars every year for electricity infrastructure it does n't use and employs 1,000 Kiwis . In late October , its multinational owners , Rio Tinto , announced a strategic review of Tiwai <p> Rio Tinto 's October surprise sent everyone from Wellington to Invercargill scrambling . <p> In Parliament , Energy Minister Megan Woods told reporters that the Government would n't ask the Electricity Authority to speed up its transmission pricing review in order to give the smelter some relief from burdensome transmission fees . She also said it was " highly unlikely " that the Government would bail out Rio Tinto , which paid nearly $10 billion in dividends to shareholders in February . <p> Meanwhile , NZAS , the Kiwi subsidiary to Rio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real possibility that Tiwai would close up shop . " The strategic review is quite serious . It 's more signficant than our previous discussions around the ownership . It 's the first time that Rio Tinto has announced a strategic review of its interests in the smelter , " NZAS chief executive Stew Hamilton said at the time . <p> Closing Tiwai would leave a thousand New Zealanders without jobs and many other contractors would lose work . But it could also lower power prices for Kiwis in the rest of the country because the plant would n't be hogging so much electricity . <p> A 2012 MBIE report on the possibility of closing the smelter found that wholesale electricity prices would have dropped by 10 percent for the period from 2015 to 2030 had Rio Tinto left New Zealand . Moreover , the report stated , " it may bring forward the expected decommissioning of the coal and gas fired Huntly units 1 to 4 , which produces between 20 percent - 50 percent of the sector 's total emissions " . <p> As it stands , Meridian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the event of a " dry year " where its hydro-powered stations ca n't generate enough electricity . <p> A panacea ? <p> That 's where Energia Potior comes in . Matthews , the company 's global head of strategy , insists that its technology can solve almost every one of the above problems . <p> The technology is called EnPot and it is fitted to the potlines on aluminium smelters to allow them to modulate their energy usage . Potlines are the electrolytic cells that smelters use to make aluminium . They use immense amounts of electricity and struggle to operate at anything other than a set level of efficiency 24 hours a day , 365 days a year . Power them down for longer than an hour and you risk " freezing " the contents . <p> EnPot gives potlines flexibility - and can be installed while the pots are still running . With EnPot installed , Matthews says , a smelter can " flex " its energy usage by up to 25 percent in either direction . <p> In the smelting town of Portland , Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In order to keep power running to the city , the local smelters were asking to shut each potline down for an hour at a time , over and over until the issue was rectified . <p> When , the next day , another station dropped off the grid , the smelter was unable to help and thousands of households lost power . With EnPot , this could be avoided . While coal-fired stations do n't usually power houses or the smelter in New Zealand , hydro stations do . <p> If water levels are low , the stations can struggle to generate enough power to keep the lights on . That 's why Meridian keeps the coal-fired units at Huntly running - and emitting . If , instead , Tiwai could reduce its power intake by 25 percent , selling that electricity back to Meridian for a handsome fee , the state-owned generator would n't need to rely on Huntly . <p> In such a scenario , it would be even more profitable for Tiwai to flex down its electricity usage than to keep pumping out aluminium . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked them to turn down 30 percent . The energy arbitrage it would get would be the most profitable tonnes of aluminium they never made , " Matthews said . <p> Then there 's the less common flip side , in which Meridian generates more power than needed and Tiwai takes on the additional load . Australia has turned to a massive 100MW lithium-ion battery made by Tesla to store surplus electricity , costing it around $94 million . Meanwhile , Tiwai could use up an excess of 100 to 150MW and the installation would only cost $50-60 million , Energia Potior said in a submission to the Interim Climate Change Commission . <p> In essence , Tiwai would be turned into a virtual power plant and battery , supplying extra electricity when needed and " storing " excess power if necessary . Meridian would be able to stop paying for Huntly 's coal-fired units , leading to a big carbon emissions win for the Government and the new income for Rio Tinto might even take away the sting of the transmission pricing . <p> Alongside that , the installation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Matthews says . For Tiwai , " the investment would pay , within under a year . It 's an instant payback for the power system because they avoid a massive bill " from Huntly or needing to build a backup power station . <p> Will it work ? <p> The next most important question is a simple one : will it work ? Matthews , as expected , swears by it . EnPot technology has already been fitted on smelters in Germany and , after the Portland outage in January , Australian firms are also looking to hire the firm . <p> In Energia Potior 's submission to the ICCC , the firm says that " Meridian Energy has shown interest in how the EnPot technology works as , if Rio Tinto was prepared to install the technology at Tiwai , it might allow Meridian to contract directly with the smelter for dry year support thus removing or reducing any need for Meridian 's current Swaption contract with the thermal generator Genesis " . <p> " Meridian had said publicly to the ICCC that fitting EnPot to Tiwai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ units at Huntly and it would allow Meridian to deal directly with the smelter to purchase that backup in a dry year , " Matthews said . <p> Meridian did n't go quite as far in a statement provided to Newsroom , but it did acknowledge that it was interested in the potential use of EnPot . <p> " Meridian is aware of the Enpot technology and we have been talking to Rio Tinto about its application at the Tiwai Point Aluminium smelter for some time to understand what potential it might have for the smelter and as a means to integrating an innovative demand response mechanism into the New Zealand market , " a spokesperson said . <p> " For our part we will continue to work with Rio Tinto to see if we can find a way that it might be applied effectively . " <p> The International Energy Agency also sees EnPot as presenting intriguing options . In a February report on transforming China 's energy system , it recommended the fitting of EnPot to Chinese smelters and estimated the investment would pay for itself in less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scholarly journal Light Metals trialed EnPot on a German smelter in Essen . <p> " The Shell Heat Exchanger technology tested on 12 pots at TRIMET Essen gave much greater flexibility in energy input to and dissipation from the pots , " the authors wrote . <p> " This opens up a wider operating window for line current while still maintaining stable operation over both short term rapid modulations and long term sustained modulations , which can be highly advantageous given the electricity market in Germany , and particularly the continuing reliance on volatile renewable generation . " <p> Rio Tinto was less laudatory , in a statement provided to Newsroom . Hamilton did n't answer a question about the viability of EnPot , instead simply saying , " We have previously trialled the technology at our Tiwai Point site , however we have n't taken it forward " . <p> " We currently provide other forms of a demand response service -- for example in dry hydrological years . NZAS and Rio Tinto are further exploring demand response technology that can provide a service that is valued by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand 's needs are different from those of Germany or Australia . " The demand response options needs to take into account the electricity market that it is connected to . The electricity market in Europe has different requirements than in New Zealand , because of the type of load and the type of generation connected to the grid . We think we have other methods for demand response that are more suited to the New Zealand electricity system . " <p> We value fearless , independent journalism .

@@31574234 <p> Even brand new houses have five times the carbon footprint that would be compatible with the Paris Agreement . More terraced houses and apartments may help , but it will take more than that , says a study . Photo supplied . <h> New houses emitting five times too much carbon -- study <p> Researchers have calculated how much carbon dioxide a typical new three-bedroom home can afford to emit in its lifetime and still keep the world within 2C warming.The bad news is , New Zealand houses are five times over-budget . The good news is , we can fix it ( probably ) . <p> A typical new Kiwi home emits five times as much carbon dioxide as it can afford to , if the world is to stay inside 2C warming . <p> A first-of-its-kind New Zealand study says housing must shrink its carbon footprint by 80 percent to do its bit to meet the Paris climate accord . <p> The researchers say their findings are a relief . <p> " I was actually surprised it was n't worse , " says Sarah McLaren , a carbon-budgeting researcher and professor in life cycle management <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Reducing to 20 percent of what we 've got now , I feel it 's doable . If the target was a thousandth of what it is now , it would make you want to give up . This feels like a challenge that can be taken up , " she says . <p> The study was supported by the Building Research Association of New Zealand , whose principal scientist , David Dowdell , also helped do the research . The study 's lead author was Chanjief Chandrakumar and BRANZ 's Roman Jaques also helped . <p> Like McLaren , Dowdell found the results reassuring . " I totally agree . What it has shown us is that this is possible . " <p> The researchers wanted to know how the carbon footprint of a typical , new Kiwi home compared to what an ideal footprint would be , one that 's compatible with the Paris 2C warming limit . <p> The 2C cap was agreed by virtually all countries as a ( theoretically ) realistic target that would avoid the worst impacts of severe ice melt , wildfires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food insecurity from climate change . Buildings are a big part of meeting countries ' emissions goals , since , globally , constructing and using buildings accounts for almost a third of greenhouse gases . Demand for new housing is expected to grow between now and 2050 . <p> But while most people know about the Paris goal , it can be hard to translate the broad 2C number into anyone 's daily life . A slew of studies are now working back from the target , to show people how it might apply to different aspects of their lives . McLaren and Dowdell say they wanted to show what doing our bit to stay within 2C could mean for New Zealand housing . <p> Their study focuses on detached houses , since they make up 80 percent of our stock . <p> New Zealanders tend to build unusually big and spaced-apart houses , which drives up their emissions . The typical Kiwi home is a detached , one-storey , three-bedroom dwelling with a 166 square metre floor area , the study says , and the size of a typical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sq m . <p> To work out an ideal carbon budget for a new , New Zealand home , the researchers first took the total carbon dioxide that everyone in the world could emit by 2050 and still stay inside 2C warming . They divvied up the allowance by head of global population . They then took New Zealand 's national allocation , and divided this between different sectors . <p> Although New Zealand 's overall emissions must shrink by 2050 , the researchers assumed housing would maintain its current share of a shrinking emissions pie . They also assumed new housing and existing housing would maintain their respective shares of overall housing emissions . ( Currently , about 34 percent of housing 's emissions are from newly-constructed buildings , versus 66 percent from existing houses , which greatly outnumber new homes ) . <p> The researchers used projections of how many new homes would be built by 2050 , the year by when New Zealand aims to be carbon neutral . They assumed new homes would be built to the building code , without climate-friendly add-ons such as added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emissions , they factored in the climate impact of the energy used inside houses for heating , lighting , cooking and plugging in appliances . <p> After all this , they had a target : A typical newly-built detached house of 198 m2 in size could afford to emit 55,280 kg of carbon dioxide over its estimated 90-year lifetime . Since there are n't 90 years left between now and 2050 , each home was apportioned a share of its lifetime budget to represent its emissions over next 30 years . <p> How badly are today 's new homes blowing the ideal carbon budget ? Using life cycle analyses of three typical new houses , the researchers calculated the footprint of a new detached house was about five times the limit . <p> But the news was not all bad , McLaren and Dowdell told Newsroom . <p> It 's true that the sheer size of an average new Kiwi house makes it more carbon-intensive than it could be -- both to build , and to keep warm and comfortable . " It means more materials , it means more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more to maintain , " says Dowdell . <p> Yet the study showed New Zealand homes were at the low end internationally for their lifetime carbon emissions , thanks to a combination of a benign climate , at least in Auckland , and the fact New Zealanders have traditionally favoured using more wood and fewer bricks and concrete in their houses . Timber creates lower emissions than bricks and concrete during manufacturing and construction , with the added bonus that trees grown to make timber also suck carbon from the air . <p> Compared with other countries , New Zealand homes also have the advantage of a largely low-emissions electricity grid , which cuts the climate impact of household power use and any locally-manufactured building materials . <p> Energy use inside the home was the biggest portion of the footprint , closely followed by construction . Over the 30 years to 2050 , construction emissions were almost evenly balanced with household energy , while , over the longer-term , household energy use dominated the footprint , says Dowdell . <p> " If you look over the 90-year life of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use in the house , " he says . " The two things contributing the most are plug-loads , so the TV , dishwasher , fridge , washing machine , all those devices , and the other big item is heating of water . The next big one , depending where you are in New Zealand , is heating , and that 's more of an issue in Christchurch and Wellington than it is in Auckland , " Dowdell says . <p> " After energy use , is construction . The materials have a large and immediate effect , because if you 're going to build a new house all the materials that go into that house are being manufactured within a short period of time and being transported to the construction site . So , if we look at emissions over the 30 years -- between now and 2050 -- for a house that 's being built this year , almost half of the emission will be the materials . " <p> The study also looked at the carbon footprint of all housing , including existing homes . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about five times over the 2C budget . The researchers say that highlighted the importance of making existing homes more energy-efficient , as well as building better new ones . <p> " There are things we can do quickly to get the carbon down , " says Dowdell . " The big one is the house size . There is a close relationship between house size and carbon footprint . " <p> " Then , making houses more energy efficient , especially in places like Wellington and further south . Orienting our houses so they get good winter sun and making sure there is shading in summer , using good high-spec double-glazed windows that are well installed . Simple things like that do n't add much to the cost . They cut the carbon , but typically we are not doing them in a routine way . " <p> Dowdell acknowledged it would take more than those few simple things , to shrink New Zealand housing 's carbon footprint to 20 percent of its current size . <p> But broader social changes would also help -- bringing the electricity grid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicles to move building materials , using better materials , and more energy-efficient appliances . <p> Then there 's high density living -- a relatively new concept for many New Zealanders . " The trend is to higher density housing . There are some trade-offs there , in that as we start to build higher , we use material with higher embodied carbon such as concrete or steel . We need to do more work on that . But getting the size down and having higher density living also provides other carbon benefits in terms of allowing people to live in proximity to jobs and transport hubs . Can we start to plan ( cities ) in ways that are lower-carbon and higher density but give people the amenities they want ? It 's a challenge , " says Dowdell . " Nobody is saying we all have to be in apartments , we can still have detached housing , but we need to find ways to do that that allows us to stay in our carbon budget . " <p> The researchers plan to carry out similar calculations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says similar carbon budgeting methods can also be applied to other sectors , such as food production and transport , to help people grasp what committing to 2C might look like . <p> For now , says Dowdell , having a housing carbon budget gives people working in building , design and construction a starting point to discuss . <p> " Suddenly , there is a number there that people can relate to .

" Climate change being taught in our schools is not necessarily a bad thing - it is about our future and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like elements of what 's being suggested should be taught , and there does need to be a way for the young people to have a discourse that can create that debate of what the future looks like for them . <p> " Whether we withdraw it or just make some real changes to it , but I think it 's been handled so badly . " <p> Green Party co-leader and Climate Change Minister James Shaw told Newshub last week there had been high demand from teachers for more help teaching climate change . <p> But Bennett said there was " misinformation " in the resource about the meat industry 's impact on the environment . New Zealand has a large agricultural sector , and numerous studies have shown it takes far more resources to produce meat than the equivalent amount of plant-based food , and the amount of emissions released is far greater . <h> Related News <p> But New Zealand 's agricultural industry is also highly efficient by international standards . Some studies have found it 's more efficient to produce meat in New Zealand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat there . <p> " It 's ridiculous . There 's some absolute parts of it , and that 's one of them , " said Bennett . " It 's just feeding into the hype and hysteria without the research behind it . We all know we 've got some of the best produce in the world - why on Earth would n't we be encouraging our children to have a balanced diet , which is what they 're being taught in other aspects of the curriculum ? ... Do n't get me going on that one . " <p> " A vegan diet is probably the single biggest way to reduce your impact on planet Earth , not just greenhouse gases , but global acidification , eutrophication , land use and water use , " lead researcher Joseph Poore of the University of Oxford told the Guardian . It is far bigger than cutting down on your flights or buying an electric car . " <p> Scientists recently announced the 2010s were the hottest decade on record . The hottest before that was the 2000s , and before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then 1960s - the clear message being that the world is getting hotter , and it 's all down to emissions caused by burning fossil fuels and large-scale agriculture . <p> If it continues , they warn sea levels could rise , storms will get stronger , wildfires harder to control and large parts of the world will experience droughts . <h> Related News <p> But Bennett says kids the resource is aimed at - aged 11 to 14 - are " smart " and should be given the " counterarguments " to what the scientists claim . <p> " I think it 's important that our kids are encouraged to the discourse of all of the different sides of it so they can make up their own minds . It certainly seems to me there is some misinformation through it - there will be controversy and I think the controversy should be embraced and let our young people decide and debate it themselves in the classroom . Not just teach it from one angle and one side , which is what this looks like . "

@@31586230 <h> NZ customers admire our values <p> OPINION : The international trading system is facing one of its biggest challenges in recent times . <p> The building trade war between the US and China and the impasse at the World Trade Organisation ( WTO ) are two significant global events that demand the attention of New Zealand in its dependence on trade for continued success . <p> Alongside these two geopolitical power plays runs a creeping tide of protectionism in the form of nationalist inward-looking policies that challenge the global value chain model which is increasingly becoming the future of food . <p> For NZ it is clear that as a country with a population smaller than Sydney , access to international markets is critically important for our future . <p> While international debate and brinksmanship dominate the world of trade , NZ is quietly getting on with efforts to secure our future . In the big trade issues at the WTO we have been asked to coordinate efforts to reform this crucially important organisation and make it more relevant for the future . <p> NZ has taken on the very important role of depository for the Comprehensive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement . And importantly we are continuing to expand our network of trade agreements globally . We have negotiations underway with Europe for a new trade agreement and preliminary talks with the UK for a new trade agreement with them once the future of Brexit becomes clear . <p> Our strategy for trade is now firmly anchored on higher value opportunities in the context of the rapidly changing shape of the agri-food sector in NZ . Growth in the production of commodity products from livestock is reaching a ceiling as environmental limits and our response to climate change imposes pressure on traditional farming . The focus on producing and marketing higher value goods from NZ is working . <p> In the seven years from 2012 to 2019 , primary sector export revenue grew 43% to an impressive $46 billion . There is plenty more growth to come with the unprecedented growth in horticulture and plant-based products and new industry development and ongoing efforts in value creation from our traditional industries . <p> Present day risks to NZ 's strategy are real . The US-China trade war , and the ongoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Europe have hugely disrupted smaller countries such as ours . China is now our largest trading partner , and disruption in China or the US spills over into international markets affecting NZ exports . <p> In the European theatre , while the UK needs to finalise its future relationship with the EU , the longstanding relationships built up by NZ companies in this part of the world are at risk as uncertainty remains . Numerous visits by those of us involved in trade and commerce to all of our key markets are important as we continue to reinforce our relevance as a constructive and valuable partner on agriculture and trade issues globally . <p> As a number of countries retract and implement protectionist policies , our experience has been that open , trade oriented agricultural policies encourage the development of a competitive , resilient and responsive primary sector . <p> Fifty years ago , about three quarters of NZ 's agricultural exports went to Europe . An active effort to diversify across global markets in the time since then means that this proportion is now down closer to 12% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environmental and social benefits over the longer term . <p> The good news for NZ is that in spite of the real risks to international trade we are seeing unprecedented demand for nearly all of our agri-food and fibre exports . The quality and integrity of our products are highly valued , but it is the values of NZ and its people that now resonate strongly with consumers . <p> As we look to a future where demand for food is strongly anchored to the way food is produced and the values of the people producing it , NZ 's future looks assured . In an increasingly challenging international trade environment we need to chart our own path to prevent the actions of others undermining our future .

" This is really significant , because it is literally not happening at that level anywhere else in the world .

The cost for the sheep ( when it was charged ) was between 25 and 45 cents per sheep , per week . Every grower had sheep among the vines over the winter months , while 13 percent used sheep for leaf plucking and one grower had sheep among the vines from later January through until veraison . <p> When it came down to quantifying benefits , the growers were unanimous about the positive impact sheep had on the grass levels in the vineyard . <p> " What we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mowing benefit , " Niles said .

Having sheep required less nitrogen to be used in the vineyards according to some growers , while others mentioned the drop in fuel usage and the marketing potential of integration . <p> " We quantified some of the cost savings and asked the growers how much money do you anticipate you have saved , " Niles said . " On average across all farms , the growers mowed 2.2 fewer times annually . " <p> That resulted in an average savings of US$10,394 per farm through fuel and labor costs ( at current exchange rates that is NZ$15,595 ) . <p> " There were about 1.3 fewer herbicide applications annually which resulted in savings of about US$56 ( NZ$84 ) per hectare or an average of $US4,931 ( NZ$77,399 ) from input costs and labor " .

There was also the chance the sheep would nibble on irrigation lines and drippers , but some growers had found burying the irrigation lines mitigated that issue . There was also the need to consider chemical withholding periods for the sheep who have been in vineyards . Overall though , growers indicated that the benefits outweighed any potential costs . <p> Niles ' research is on-going as she now wants to study further economic and environmental benefits of integration " Not just the mowing and herbicide benefits , but really getting into more detail . What does it mean for the ecosystem if the industry is putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bio-diversity ? What are the potential labour costs and savings of these systems .

@@31586239 <h> Kiwi dairy ranks well with wary Russians <p> The fine milk and butter products of New Zealand have long had a good reputation in Russia . A journalist in central Russia , Nataliya Shkol'naya , sent Dairy News this exclusive , rare look into the ordinary citizen 's view of dairy markets and embargoes . <p> Even when Russia was in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics , every student knew that New Zealand was the ' land of the long white cloud ' , had the best rugby players and the most delicious milk and butter . <p> But the Fonterra food safety scare of 2013 was well known in this country , and Russia insisted on stopping imports of NZ products until a full investigation was held . <p> At that time NZ supplied anhydrous milk fat , whey protein concentrate and milk protein concentrate -- which was little produced in Russia -- and the volume of supply of Fonterra products ranked second place after Belarus , about 10-20% . <p> Russia is going through a hard time at present : many countries have imposed sanctions and in retaliation Russia restricts the import of food products @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Russia decided to cancel the limits and allow importing of dairy products from 29 NZ dairy processing facilities . <p> This fact speaks for itself on how valuable the products of ' the land of the long while cloud ' are to Russia . <p> But if Fonterra has ever told Russia that the botulism scare of 2013 was a false alarm , the information was never passed to the public . There are a lot of detailed articles about the bacteria , how dangerous it was and how the government was saving us by not importing products . <p> Three years later there has been a small note ( in the news media ) to say they were starting to import again . ( Shkol'naya was told by Dairy News last week that the scare was a false alarm ) . <p> There are so many different varieties of infant formula on the shelves of Russian shops that you do n't know where to start . To make it easier for people to find what they need , the Russian experts make yearly ratings of infant formula . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of moms and dads , who choose products based on colorful packaging and affordable prices . <p> Unfortunately , city residents are unable to directly buy dairy products from farmers , to ensure the quality of such products , given the distance of farms from the cities . So when they choose dairy products in the shops they have to rely on their intuition , neighbours ' advice or television advertisements . <p> Unfortunately , the results of annual tests of dairy product quality are not encouraging : consumers of dairy products continue to be deceived . Sadly , the answer to the question " what products will have highest demand ? " is simple -- cheap and healthy . Russians understood a long time ago that high price does not mean high quality . <p> It is not a secret that before the 2014 embargo on ' certain kinds ' of agricultural products , raw materials and foodstuffs ) , Russia was the world 's fourth-largest importer of dairy products . So we can still argue about who is more affected by the ' war of sanctions ' -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers that exclusion of essential exporting countries led to price stabilisation , and at some points to a decrease in product prices . <p> Data from 2015 show NZ is among the five largest suppliers of dairy products : <p> Note this example of the magnitude of the loss for European Union countries and Australia due to embargo . <p> Recently Russia 's President Vladimir Putin signed an order extending the embargo on food imports , in retaliation to sanctions , until the end of 2017 . In the Russian government 's opinion , the import restriction policy in Russia stimulates the development of the food industry while foreign farmers continue to bear large losses . <p> But in the opinion of average Russian citizens , whose monthly incomes US$150 -- 200 , nothing has really changed . <p> They did n't even notice the absence of Finnish oil , Lithuanian curds or cheese with a delicate crust of penicillin from Italy and France , because they were unaware of their presence in the first place : their incomes discourage them from even approaching the store counters where products are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imports into Russia ) was imposed not to stimulate development of Russian industries , but to try to remind the European Union that it needs Russian markets . <p> Undoubtedly , Russian politicians hope that the exit of the UK from the EU will undermine the already shaky European unity on the issue of sanctions against Russia . It is known that the UK strongly supported those sanctions and Russian diplomats believe that without England there would be no one to zealously uphold the sanctions against Russia . <p> In contrast to officialdom , the average Russian citizen does n't really care . Foreign policy does not apply to the most important issues ; foreign policy is less important than the economy , standard of living , unemployment , health care , inflation , social policy , education and pensions . <p> An analyst at the Center for the Study of the Dairy Market , Ekaterina Zakharova , says that on January 1 , 2016 , in the Russian Federation there were 215,218 farms of all kinds , and the centre says 21,312 ( in late 2014 ) are engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ministry of Agriculture says it wants to develop the dairy industry . But in reality , according to experts , the ministrydoes nothing to achieve that goal . <p> The dairy industry in Russia is now in quite a difficult situation . A decrease in the number of dairy farms due to low investment places the industry behind pig or poultry farming . <p> At the same time , the dairy industry is technologically advanced and capital-intensive , with a long payback period . This helps explain the shortage of dairy products on the Russian market and Russia 's reliance on imports of dairy products . <p> Dairy farming in extremes <p> The main difference between New Zealand and Russia is the short duration of the grazing period says Alexandra Sayapin , a farmer in the Kaluga region of Russia , who recently introduced robotic milking . <p> So the average grazing period would be 100-150 days in the year , he says . <p> Russia has three types of dairy farm : firstly , old farms built back in Soviet era , about 30-40 years ago . Usually these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during winter and let outside during summer . Preferred species are Simmental and Swedish . <p> They are generally inefficient . <p> Secondly is a type of farm started in about 2000 , prompted by the growth of dairying . Animal numbers are much larger -- 800 to 5000 -- and they are housed in barns with rotary milking platforms and feeding equipment . <p> There is no grazing ; the cows are kept inside the whole year and eat hay . The preferred species is Holstein . <p> Thirdly is the farm type which has 20-100 head of cattle . <p> " I 've got this type of farm , but a bit different from original one : I 've got 400 head , " Sayapin says . <p> " Recently , farmers demanded robotic milking systems . The machine is very useful yet very expensive . In order to afford it I had to increase the herd size on my farm where they are grazing the whole year . There was no money left for the stable after buying robots , " Sayapin laughs . <p> " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litter , spread with the use of special technology . <p> " There 's layer upon layer of dry straw , growing layers with time ; the bottom straw begins to ' burn ' , and even minus 35 ? C it is warm for the cows to lie on . My species is Red crossbred cattle . They have high cold resistance . <p> " There are no problems with cleaning up the manure . The building with the milking robots has a slit floor so all manure falls there and after it fills up it gets pumped out . Then it is diluted with water and in this form is taken out to a field . " <p> Milk is processed on the farm and a number of branded products are produced , including cottage cheese and yoghurt . <p> Back in 2004 when Chris Yorke sent out his first New Zealand Winegrower press release , New Zealand wine had reached $300 million worth of exports . His final press release before leaving NZW , announced our wine exports had reached $1.8 billion .

@@31589236 <h> UN landmark case for people displaced by climate change <p> In a ground-breaking asylum case , a UN human rights body has ruled that governments must take into account the human rights violations caused by the climate crisis when considering deportation of asylum seekers , said Amnesty International today . <p> Ioane Teitiota , a man from the Pacific nation of Kiribati , brought a case against the government of New Zealand at the UN Human Rights Committee ( HRC ) in February 2016 after authorities denied his claim of asylum as a ' climate refugee . ' He was deported from New Zealand to Kiribati in September 2015 . The HRC delivered its decision on the case earlier this month . <p> " The decision sets a global precedent , " said Kate Schuetze , Pacific Researcher at Amnesty International . " It says a state will be in breach of its human rights obligations if it returns someone to a country where -- due to the climate crisis -- their life is at risk , or in danger of cruel , inhuman or degrading treatment . " <p> Teitiota says he faced land disputes and difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of the climate crisis , and therefore was forced to migrate with his family to New Zealand where he applied for refugee status after his visa expired in 2010 . He was denied asylum by New Zealand 's Immigration and Protection Tribunal , the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court . He then took his case to the HRC on the grounds that New Zealand violated his right to life under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights , by deporting him to Kiribati . <p> While the Committee found that Teitiota 's deportation had not been unlawful because he did n't face an immediate danger to his life in Kiribati , it recognised that climate change represented a serious threat to the right to life and therefore decision-makers need to take this into account when examining challenges to deportation . <p> The Committee 's decision suggests that future claims might be successful where the evidence shows " the effects of climate change in receiving states may expose individuals to a violation of their rights . " <p> " The message is clear : Pacific Island states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights obligations to protect the right to life , " said Schuetze . <p> All states have the human rights duty to protect people from the harmful effects of the climate crisis , including displacement . It is therefore imperative that urgent action is taken to keep the temperature rise as low as possible and no higher than 1.5 ? C. <p> " The Pacific Islands are the canary in the coal mine for climate induced migrants . Low-lying island states such as Kiribati and Tuvalu are only one or two metres above sea level . The people there are exposed to severe climate impacts today , including limited access to habitable land , clean drinking water and subsistence living . Governments must consider this dangerous reality and a heating planet 's imminent threat to Pacific peoples ' lives and livelihoods . " <p> ENDS <p> The full decision is available here .

My idea is in the genre of science-fiction mafia , a genre that I think has not been sufficiently exploited . In this film , the protagonist wakes up to the fact that without knowing it , he has somehow joined the mafia . I expect people to be able to relate to the story because I believe that this entire country either has become aware or needs to become aware that it has joined the mafia . <p> How do major U.S. newspapers and television news programs refer to the murder of an Iranian general ? Never with the word murder . Often with words like " deal with " or " take out . " Trump had to deal with him . You could read an article like that , about a guy who is famous for hiring someone to put his name on a book called The Art of the Deal , and imagine that Trump had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with whoever was nearby . <p> There have been societies studied by anthropologists that were literally incapable of understanding , much less committing , murder .

I want to live in a society where " took him out " indicates that you went with a friend to a restaurant and had a nice meal . But first , we 're going to have to create a society in which a murder is referred to as murder . Assassination comes close , but it 's beginning to be treated as potentially acceptable , whereas murder still means unacceptable . <p> So-called progressive Senator Chris Murphy , who days earlier had mocked Trump for being weak and not making enough people in the Middle East " fear us , " listened to a secret White House explanation of why the Trump Family ( I use family in the mafia sense ) had taken out Suleimani . Murphy denounced the explanation as utter nonsense , but labeled the murder " a strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get away with a murder on Fifth Avenue ? Maybe he could , but if you -- one of you here tonight -- killed someone on Santa Monica Boulevard , you could n't tell the police , " Well , yes , officer , I shot that man , but it was just a strike of choice , and I never apologize for my strikes of choice , because that would make me look weak , and now would you mind helping me wave my personal flag ? " Nor , of course , could you crib from Obama and say " Let me be clear , officer , the guy is dead now , and it 's our job to look forward not backward . " Nor could you pull a George W. Bush and announce that your victim was an imminent threat or could potentially have become an imminent threat ( given enough time and U.S. weapons ) or that he had himself shot somebody else last week , or that you had a dream in which he was planning to attack four U.S. embassies with a ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say such things , but you 'd be locked up for saying them . <p> Now , the fact that people in the U.S. all talk a little bit like the mafia does n't make them the mafia , any more than their borrowing phrases from Star Wars for their various pretentious Rebellions or their new branches of the U.S. military makes them handsome space warriors who can breathe without oxygen , travel faster than light , and survive technology far worse than nuclear weapons with a culture far more primitive than ISIS and magical powers that seem to turn on and off on the basis of orchestral music that permeates all space-time from an unknown source . <p> The question is why does the United States talk like the mafia ? Well , why would a mafioso avoid using the word " murder " and employ various euphemisms and code words instead ?

We , the people . We are the cops in this analogy . If we read in our newspapers that the 45th U.S. president in a row has committed murder , eventually we might start to question that . If instead we hear that Trump has taken out a scary threat through a strike ( any kind of a strike , there 's nothing much wrong with a strike , after all ) , well , then we can move on to the sports game or the summer weather in winter that we revel in like insects enjoying a rain puddle on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the mafia , because we 're all engaged in murder and all trying to hide the fact from all of us .

That 's what a war is . The other things are the side-effects . They should all be listed on the bottle and read before opening , but they 're not what war is . What war is must never be mentioned , or understood . <p> Last week , Congresswoman Ilhan Omar mentioned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war as a child . Of course , the vast majority of those killed , injured , traumatized , or given PTSD , by war are civilians , and disproportionately they are children and the elderly , and overwhelmingly they are on one side when a rich nation attacks a poor one . But these basic facts have been so diligently hidden , that people screamed out in outrage , that only U.S. troops were permitted the status of having PTSD . <p> Now , I doubt you could find a single such troop who thought of it as a status or would n't gladly give it up . And I think many suffer simultaneously from brain and other injuries , as well as moral injury , compounding the PTSD in particular ways . But the moral injury is because they know what they 've done , because they 've stopped ( sometimes very abruptly stopped ) imagining that war has no victims . Imagine the absurdity of telling Congresswoman Omar that the people bombed and occupied and forced to flee and mourn and go hungry and face disease epidemics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Nevada pushing buttons can be traumatized ( as indeed they can ) while someone living beneath the constant buzzing of a deadly drone that can end life at any instant can not be traumatized .

Americans are n't used to such affairs and need to be given a little more consideration , do n't they ? <p> Now , sometimes it 's admitted that an assassination is a killing , and sometimes that it 's an act of war , and sometimes that some particular actions within a war can be illegal , but virtually never that an assassination is illegal or that war is itself illegal or that assassination is murder or that war is a collection of murders .

If Harvey Weinstein both rapes you and makes you read really bad dialog , we are n't supposed to declare the latter to be a " rape crime " and ignore the rape itself . We do n't have armed robbery crimes , where if you rob a store and knock over a shelf , you 're legally guilty of knocking over the shelf as an armed robbery crime , with the robbery itself being acceptable . We do n't have animal cruelty crimes where if you torture a dog and make too much noise doing it , the latter is an animal cruelty crime while the animal cruelty itself is just a strategic household security imperative . It 's not that I do n't want people outraged about threats to cultural sites . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to human lives , and I want it admitted that war is itself a crime , that it is banned under the UN Charter with narrow exceptions that are never met and under the Kellogg Briand Pact with no exceptions . <p> Both war and murder are crimes . It is a crime under Iraqi law to murder someone in Iraq , just as under U.S. law to murder someone here . It is a crime under international law to commit war in Iraq just as it would be in the United States . War is murder by military . Murder is war without military . The legal and moral distinction between murder and war is not and should not be what people suppose . And the distinction should not be a question of who the victims are . Remember last week , when Trump had murdered people in Iraq , and Iran had threatened to retaliate , and Trump had already threatened to re-retaliate if Iran retaliated , and even after Iran had launched missiles , the big question in the United States was what should be done if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was the overwhelming concern . If mere Iraqis were to die , there seemed to virtually no concern that World War III would be required . ( We saw the same phenomenon during Obama 's drone murder spree . U.S. victims generated the majority of the disturbingly tiny amount of opposition in the corporate media . ) <p> But when Trump murdered Suleimani , the major concern among Democrats in Washington seemed to be that he had n't done it in the way Obama might have . Obama would have properly notified a handful of Congress members . Obama would have refrained from tweeting about it . Obama would have expressed grave regret and cited the moral quandaries of Christian saints rather than Fox News hacks . Obama would have provided his victim with a proper Muslim sea burial . But the Obama era , through his actions , and activists ' inactions , and the corruption of the media and Congress , and other factors , gave us this era we are in . Murder was normalized . Progressive law professors testified to Congress that drone murders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , in which case they were totally fine . Now they 've become so totally fine that we are told that the murder of Suleimani is only a problem if it starts a new war . If it is just a murder , then it is just the family business . Murder Inc . <p> Only , part of the family has been feeling disrespected . Congress members want to have some say about wars , at least sometimes , with some wars , when the president belongs to the other party . The most common claim about the legality of war in the U.S. media is that it is illegal unless authorized by Congress . But , in fact , Congress does n't have the legal power to authorize rape or robbery or dog torture , and war is as illegal as those other things . If Congress will use its power to prevent or end a war , I 'm 100% in favor . But the notion that Congress can use its power to make a war legal is a dangerous one . <p> Senator Tim Kaine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers while claiming to do the opposite . And even his claims have nonsensically normalized war . On my youtube you can watch me questioning him at an event at which he faulted Trump for sending missiles into Syria without asking Congress . Could Congress possibly have legalized the crime of sending missiles into Syria , I asked him . He admitted it could not , but returned immediately to the same nonsense . This month , however , he actually introduced a resolution -- how ever weakly worded -- to force a vote to end war on Iran -- a vote that succeeded in the House before being taken in the Senate . <p> A big focus of the efforts to erase the illegality of recent wars and murders is the notion of " imminent threat . " As with many war lies , there is an answer to the question of whether Suleimani was an imminent threat , but it is the wrong question . There were no weapons in Iraq in 2003 , but the question of whether there were had nothing to do with the morality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the disaster would have been even worse had Iraq actually had those weapons . Suleimani was apparently on a peace mission when he was murdered , but the question of what he was up to has nothing to do with the morality or legality of killing him . If he had been indicted for a crime , he could have been arrested and prosecuted . If he was planning more attacks on ISIS , the United States could have stopped taking that personally . If he was planning attacks on U.S. troops , any number of diplomatic steps , including removing those troops from illegal and catastrophic endless occupations , were possible . But a preemptive strike , also known as an aggressive strike , is a crime made to look heroic in movies yet still criminal and insane in real life . <p> In the mafia , there 's never any discussion of the financial cost of taking care of somebody . On the contrary , taking care of him is necessary for the family 's interests -- or for making sure people " fear us , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on CNN and propose educational or green energy or healthcare or housing programs , what 's the first question I would be asked ? <p> And if I were instead to propose sending more troops to Iraq , would I ever in a million years be asked that question ? <p> War either costs nothing , or we shout about how much it costs by naming some fraction of military spending , as if the rest of military spending is for something other than war . <p> I think this is as good a moment as any to tell you my budget idea . <p> An important job of any U.S. president is to propose an annual budget to Congress . Should n't it be a basic job of every presidential candidate to propose one to the public ? Is n't a budget a critical moral and political document outlining what chunk of our public treasury should go to education or environmental protection or war ? <p> The basic outline of such a budget could consist of a list or a pie chart communicating -- in dollar amounts and/or percentages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's shocking to me that presidential candidates do not produce these . <p> As far as I have been able to determine , though it 's so absurd as to seem improbable , no non-incumbent candidate for U.S. president has ever produced even the roughest outline of a proposed budget , and no debate moderator or major media outlet has ever publicly asked for one . <p> There are candidates right now who propose major changes to education , healthcare , environmental , and military spending . The numbers , however , remain vague and disconnected . How much , or what percentage , do they want to spend where ? <p> Some candidates might like to produce a revenue or taxation plan as well . " Where will you raise money ? " is as important a question as " Where will you spend money ? " But " Where will you spend money ? " seems like a basic question that any candidate should be asked . <p> The U.S. Treasury distinguishes three types of U.S. government spending . The largest is mandatory spending . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicaid , but also Veterans ' care and other items . The smallest of the three types is interest on debt . In between is the category called discretionary spending . This is the spending that the Congress decides how to spend each year . <p> What every presidential candidate ought to produce , at a minimum , is a basic outline of a federal discretionary budget . This would serve as a preview of what each candidate would ask the Congress for as president . If candidates feel they need to produce larger budgets outlining changes to mandatory spending as well , so much the better . <p> President Trump is the one candidate for president in 2020 who has produced a budget proposal ( one for each year he 's been in office ) . As analyzed by the National Priorities Project , Trump 's latest budget proposal devoted 57% of discretionary spending to militarism ( wars and war preparations ) . This is despite the fact that this analysis treated Homeland Security , Energy ( the Energy Department is largely nuclear weapons ) , and Veterans Affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ militarism . <p> The U.S. public , in polling over the years , has tended to have no idea what the budget looks like , and -- once informed -- to favor a very different budget from the actual one at the time . I 'm curious what each person campaigning for the presidency wants the federal budget to look like . Will they put their money ( well , our money ) where their mouths are ? They say they care about many good things , but will they show us how much they care about each of them ? <p> I strongly suspect that most people would recognize the significant differences , and have strong opinions about them , if we were shown a basic pie-chart of spending priorities from each candidate . <p> When I say that the United States is the mafia , I do n't mean that we are all the same , or that nobody is doing good . But I do mean the society as a whole , not just the government , and certainly not some shadowy room where eight guys with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier and a lot harder in various ways if the world worked like that . The reality is very different . We have a pseudo-representative oligarchy with various power centers and ideologies rolling recklessly toward the cliff of World War III , with certain parties licking their lips for dollars or blood , and others coming to grips with the possibility that they 've gone too far . <p> Many of us have a fondness for whistleblowers . Even beyond our respect for people who were always right , we like the stories of people who were wrong and then saw the light and then took a courageous risk to expose wrongdoing . But how do you blow a whistle on a whole society ? Whom do you expose it to ? You have to expose it to itself . You have to intervene as a member of society to correct society while society tries to remain anonymous like an alcoholic , avoiding publicity about what it has done . <p> At World BEYOND War we 're working on cultural changes , as well as structural changes like divestment from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interlock . If people were ashamed to profit from weapons it would be easier to divest from them . If there were less profit in weapons , it would be easier to make people ashamed of them . <p> Last Spring , some of us asked the City of Charlottesville , Virginia , where I live , to divest from weapons and fossil fuels , and they did so . And one place we took the idea next was Arlington , Virginia . I spoke with one of the County Board members there . And he told me without the slightest hint of embarrassment that it would be hard for Arlington to divest from weapons because , first , Boeing had paid for a nice park , and , second , because of the National Cemetery full of war dead in Arlington . <p> Think about that second one . It 's always been important in starting wars to get Americans killed so that more can be killed in some sort of sick honor of the earlier ones killed . But here is advocacy for getting more people killed ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-Americans ) -- killed in unspecified future wars in honor of the dead from all past wars . <p> Now , perhaps the idea is this . If we outgrow the barbarism of war , if we cease producing rows of corpses , then we will be putting on airs and suggesting some sort of superiority to the people already rotting away in row after row of war graves . I think this confuses individuals with society . A society can improve ( or worsen , for that matter ) without its constituent individuals changing their attitudes toward the dead . Our society claims to be superior to slavery but puts slave-owners all over its money and monuments . <p> Yeah , somebody shouts out , but slavery is gone because of war . You ca n't hate slavery if you do n't love war . No ? Watch me . I can do it even while disliking the lousy education that denies people the knowledge that most of the world ended slavery without wars . But what you think of the U.S. Civil War need not determine what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . And what you think of the Civil War should n't alter the fact that nobody proposing any major legal changes , such as the creation of a Green New Deal , is proposing that first we find some fields , slaughter millions of young people , and then pass legislation to create a Green New Deal . We are in a society that is superior to that , whether we like it or not . <p> Many people , however , are still far too ready to support wars on distant foreigners -- and to support the weapons industry that supports the wars because of their belief that foreigners often need some killing to straighten them out . One way to increase opposition to the weapons industry that we do n't take advantage of is to make people aware that it 's a global monster with no flag or fight song , that U.S. weapons stocks rise on the threat of U.S. wars but not merely because the U.S. government will use their weapons . Most wars have U.S. weapons on both sides . <p> The U.S. government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons , but it also gives other governments billions of dollars every year on condition that they use this money to purchase U.S.-made weapons . If you unquestioningly support U.S. militarism , then you support whatever Egypt , Israel , and numerous other nations do with their free weaponry . I suspect that few taxpayers in the United States knew they were giving weapons money to Ukraine until the topic came up during the impeachment of Donald Trump , just as few even in Congress seemed to know that the United States had troops fighting in Niger until a scandal developed around what Trump said to the widow of a soldier killed there . Perhaps it is the case not only that wars are how the U.S. public learns geography , but also that weird scandals are how the U.S. public learns about U.S. wars . <p> The U.S. government also provides military training to other governments ' militaries around the world . Sometimes this serves to support an existing government , such as the brutal dictatorship of Bahrain , and sometimes to overthrow it , such as with Bolivia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also maintains military bases in numerous other countries , bases that sometimes serve to help prop up unpopular governments , such as Afghanistan , or assist them in their foreign wars , such as Saudi Arabia in its war on Yemen . <p> So , even U.S. government militarism is not limited to the wars of the United States . <p> Not only does U.S. militarism extend well beyond the patria , but it extends into places that call into question one of the most common justifications for militarism . We 're often told that wars and war preparations are aimed at protecting the world and human rights from dictatorships and oppressive governments . The wars are for freedom ! Yet , U.S. weapons companies ( with U.S. government approval and assistance ) and the U.S. military are , in a variety of ways , supporting most of the worst governments and dictators on earth , and have been doing so for many years . <p> President Donald Trump has expressed an embarrassing fondness for various authoritarian leaders , but supporting authoritarian leaders has always been part of U.S. governmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while Trump has been criticized severely for talking with the leader of North Korea , the standard U.S. approach to the most dictatorial leaders on earth is to arm and train them . This fact makes the outrage over merely talking with someone seem so out of place that one has to assume the U.S. public is generally ignorant of the basic facts . <p> Whitney was using the word " dictatorships " as a rough approximation of " oppressive governments . " His source for a list of the oppressive governments of the world was Freedom House . He intentionally chose this U.S.-based and U.S.-government-funded organization despite the clear U.S.-government bias in some of its decisions . A list from Freedom House is as nearly as possible the U.S. government 's own view of other countries . <p> Out of some 200 countries on earth , Freedom House deems 50 countries to be " not free . " Of these 50 oppressive governments , the U.S. government allows , arranges for , or in some cases even provides the funding for U.S. weapons sales to 41 of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have looked at U.S. weapons sales between 2010 and 2019 as documented by either the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute Arms Trade Database , or by the U.S. military . <p> Remember , this is a list of nations that an organization funded by the U.S. government designates " not free " but to which the United States is shipping deadly weapons . And this is 82% of the " not free " nations , which hardly looks like a case of a few exceptions or " bad apples . " <p> Beyond selling and giving weapons to oppressive governments , the U.S. government also shares with them advanced weapons technology . This includes such extreme examples as the CIA giving nuclear bomb plans to Iran , the Trump Administration seeking to share nuclear technology with Saudi Arabia , and the U.S. military basing nuclear weapons in Turkey even as Turkey fights against U.S.-backed fighters in Syria and threatens to close NATO bases . <p> Now , let 's take the list of 50 oppressive governments and check which ones the United States government provides military training to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teaching a single course for four students to providing numerous courses for thousands of trainees . The United States provides military training of one sort or another to 44 out of 50 , or 88 percent . I base this on finding such trainings listed in either 2017 or 2018 by the State Department and/or the United States Agency for International Development ( USAID ) . <p> Once again , this list does not seem like a few statistical oddities , but more like an established policy . <p> I suspect that many in the United States did not know that in 2019 , these many years after September 11 , 2001 , the U.S. military was training Saudi fighters to fly airplanes in Florida until one of them made the news by shooting up a classroom . <p> In addition , the history of U.S.-provided military training to foreign soldiers , through facilities like the School of the Americas ( renamed Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation ) provides an established pattern of not just supporting oppressive governments , but helping to bring them into being through coups . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governments weapons and training them , the U.S. government also provides funding directly to foreign militaries . Of the 50 oppressive governments , as listed by Freedom House , 32 receive so-called " foreign military financing " or other funding for military activities from the U.S. government , with -- it 's extremely safe to say -- less outrage in the U.S. media or from U.S. tax payers than we hear over providing food to people in the United States who are hungry . <p> Of the 50 oppressive governments , the United States militarily supports , in at least one of the three ways discussed above , 48 of them or 96 percent , all but the tiny designated enemies of Cuba and North Korea . With some of them , the U.S. military also bases a significant number of its own troops ( meaning over 100 ) : Afghanistan , Bahrain , Egypt , Iraq , Qatar , Saudi Arabia , Syria , Thailand , Turkey , and United Arab Emirates . Technically Cuba is in this list , but it is a very different case from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but in defiance of Cuban opposition and decidedly not in support of the Cuban government . Of course , the Iraqi government has now told U.S. troops to get out . <p> In some cases , the military engagement goes further . The U.S. military is fighting a war in partnership with Saudi Arabia against the people of Yemen , and fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan in support of oppressive governments ( by the U.S. government 's own definition ) that were created by U.S.-led wars . <p> Taking dictatorships as a subcategory of horribly oppressive governments , and consulting various sources , I come up with the following list of dictatorships supported by the U.S. military : Bahrain , Brunei , Egypt , Equatorial Guinea , Eritrea , Eswatini , Gabon , Jordan , Kazakhstan , Morocco , Oman , Qatar , Rwanda , Saudi Arabia , South Sudan , Sudan , Tajikistan , Thailand , Turkmenistan , Uganda , United Arab Emirates , and Uzbekistan . These are places whose leaders would have war propagandists drooling in excitement if the United States were to target them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and others the United States has supported and then turned against look good . We could add Yemen which the U.S. and Saudi Arabia have spent years destroying to restore a dictator . <p> Take just the first one alphabetically , Bahrain , and Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa . This guy has been the King of Bahrain since 2002 , when he made himself King , prior to which he was called Emir . He had become Emir in 1999 due to his accomplishments in , first , existing , and second , his father dying . The King has four wives , only one of whom is his cousin . <p> Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa has dealt with nonviolent protesters by shooting , kidnapping , torturing , and imprisoning them . He has punished people for speaking up for human rights , and even for " insulting " the king or his flag -- offenses that carry a sentence of 7 years in prison and a hefty fine . I 'm sparing you pages on how awful this guy is . <p> Bahrain is only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published a 9,000-word love letter to the royal dictator of the United Arab Emirates , claiming that such anti-Islamist dictators must be supported -- which is somewhat reminiscent of all the justifications for supporting anti-Communist Islamists . <p> When the U.S. government wants a war , it will point to human rights abuses ( which it may or may not have helped facilitate ) as reasons for the war . They are no such thing . Wars are horrible for human rights , and the U.S. government is not in the business of spreading human rights . Where wars begin in the world does not correlate with higher levels of human rights abuses . Wars are not started to rid the world of human rights abuses . Wars do just the opposite of that . They are also the opposite of spreaders of democracy and could not be launched by a functioning democracy . <p> Since the United States overthrew democracy in Iran in 1953 and empowered the Shah until 1979 , the Shah 's son has been spending time in the Washington , D.C. , suburbs , reportedly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think the relative lack of bloodthirsty support in the United States for a war on Iran right now is in part people having learned from the past , and in part the failed propaganda of building up former Iranian President Ahmadinejad as an Evil Dictator and then him getting voted out ( an odd thing to happen to a dictator ) . Dictators and royal heirs are not particularly popular , which may also explain why we 've never heard very much about the Shah 's son . <p> How did we get to where we are on U.S.-Iranian relations ? Through decades of warmongering and lying , and through Congress refusing to prevent war or to impeach for war or even to stop increasing the world 's largest military budget every year . <p> What we need to do now is to act both short- and long-term . We need to prevent a new war , and end the existing ones . We also need to move in the direction of de-militarization more generally . We ca n't put this whole country into a witness protection program if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if we do n't want to be recognized as what the U.S. government used to be . <p> One place to start is by demanding that U.S. troops finally get out of Iraq . Whether we pretend they 're there to spread democracy among the people who have demanded they leave , or whether we admit they 're there to steal oil , the occupation is a criminal and counterproductive enterprise . Getting U.S. troops out of Iraq would be an enormous boost to movements to get U.S. troops out of dozens of other nations they have no business being in . If the U.S. and Iraqi publics were to both loudly demand the departure of U.S. troops from Iraq and succeed , that lesson might do more for the cause of democracy on earth than 10 million targeted strategic murders . <h> Scoop Citizen Members and ScoopPro Organisations are the lifeblood of Scoop . <p> 20 years of independent publishing is a milestone , but your support is essential to keep Scoop thriving .

" <p> " The July 2019 attack at Tajoura is a tragic example of how the use of air power has become a dominant feature in Libya 's civil conflict , and of the dangers and direct consequences on civilians of foreign interference , " said Special Representative of the Secretary-General and head of UNSMIL Ghassan Salam ? .

" <p> The research team developed a New Zealand-specific food emissions database that , in estimating greenhouse gas emissions arising from foods commonly consumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each food , including farming and processing , transportation , packaging , warehousing and distribution , refrigeration needs , and supermarket overheads . <p> Using its database , the team was then able to model climate , health , and health system cost impacts stemming from a range of dietary scenarios . <p> Alexandra Macmillan <p> Senior author and senior lecturer in environmental health Alex Macmillan said results from the study showed greenhouse gas emissions varied considerably between different foods in New Zealand . <p> As a general rule , the climate impact of animal products , particularly red and processed meats , tended to be substantially higher than that of whole plant-based foods , including vegetables , fruits , legumes , and whole grains . <p> " Fortunately , foods that are health-promoting tend also to be those that are climate friendly . Conversely , certain foods that carry known health risks are particularly climate-polluting . Red and processed meat intake , for instance , is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease , type-2 diabetes and certain cancers , " Dr Macmillan said . <p> The research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the extent of changes made , offer diet-related emissions savings of between 4% to 42% annually , along with health gains of between 1million to 1.5million quality-adjusted life-years ( a single quality-adjusted life-year is equal to one year of optimal health ) and cost savings to the health system of $14billion to $20billion over the lifetime of the current New Zealand population . <p> Mr Drew said the analysis revealed emissions savings equivalent to a 59% reduction in New Zealand 's annual light passenger vehicle emissions could be possible if New Zealand adults consumed an exclusively plant-based diet and avoided wasting food unnecessarily . <p> " All of our scenarios were designed to meet New Zealand 's dietary guidelines . " <p> The pair began with a baseline scenario where they looked at minimal dietary changes required , relative to what New Zealanders were consuming now , to meet the guidelines . <p> " These changes included increased intake of vegetables , fruits , whole grains and milk , along with decreased intake of highly processed foods . From there , we tailored our dietary scenarios to be progressively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant-based alternatives . <p> " We thought it was important to show what was possible if people were willing to make changes to their eating pattern , and what would be possible if our entire population made a significant shift in that same direction , " Mr Drew said . <p> " As our modelled dietary scenarios became increasingly plant-based and therefore more climate-friendly , we found that associated population-level health gains and healthcare cost savings tended also to increase . " <p> A scenario that replaced all meat , seafood , eggs , and dairy products with plant-based alternatives , and that also required people to cut out all unnecessary household food waste was found to offer the greatest benefit across all three of these parameters . <p> Mr Drew said this was exciting because we could now better understand what it meant to promote a climate-friendly eating pattern in the New Zealand context . <p> " Essentially , the message is highly comparable to that being delivered in other countries already , and we should be rapidly looking for ways to effectively support our population in making eating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should prompt national policy action , including revising the New Zealand dietary guidelines to include messaging on climate-friendly food choices . <p> They also advocated for the implementation of other policy tools , such as pricing strategies , labelling schemes , and food procurement guidelines for public institutions . <p> " Well-designed public policy is needed worldwide to support the creation of a global food system that no longer exacerbates the climate crisis , or the burden of non-communicable disease , " Mr Drew said . 
@@31612230 <h> Should the Pike River Mine re-entry be put to rest ? <p> As the re-entry programme falls behind schedule , some families are saying " enough is enough " . Meanwhile New Zealand has seen a big rise in workplace fatalities . <p> Under a section entitled , " Health , safety and well-being " , the Pike River Recovery Agency 's latest annual report says , " As an Agency we need to know when to call it ' quits ' if that is what needs to be done . " From the context , the agency is referring to the need to know when to give up on particular tasks it is undertaking , rather than whether to give up entirely on trying to re-enter the Pike River coal mine . The latter is a decision for the Government , which gives no sign of recognising that the time to quit has already passed . <p> This year will see the 10th anniversary of the tragedy that occurred on November 19 , 2010 , when the West Coast mine exploded while 31 men were working inside it . The only survivors were the two employees who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mine entrance to escape . The other 29 perished in a day that will be long remembered by their families , friends and communities , and by a country that vowed after the event to improve its health-and-safety practices . In the first 11 months of last year , 79 people died in workplace fatalities , compared with 56 for the equivalent period the previous year . Vehicle accidents dominate workplace death statistics . <p> That the remains of the 29 men who died were unable to be recovered will always be part of the tragedy , and one that is particularly difficult for their families . That the company that employed the men was afterwards never put on trial , despite it being known there were safety deficiencies , remains another significant regret . It is also hard on the families that politicians , in particular Pike River Re-entry Minister Andrew Little , and New Zealand First leader Winston Peters , who offered to be among the first group back into the mine , choose to prolong the aftermath . They have dangled the prospect of finding evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding human remains . Nine years has been long enough to allow these families to hold on to hopes that , sadly , are most likely illusory . <p> Recently , Marion Curtin , the mother of Richard Holling , who is one of the 29 men who died , was reported to have asked when someone would say " enough is enough " . The men were not lost , she said , because their families knew where they were . Further , the coroner had explained that the bodies would be ash . She questioned how many millions of taxpayer dollars had already been spent , and how much more would be committed for no obvious outcome , given that reaching the far part of the mine where the men were most likely to have been , was not one of the objectives . <p> In response , Little was quoted as saying that " the vast majority " of the families supported re-entry .

Some kind of political point-scoring may always have been a fourth objective . <p> Few people , if any , think it acceptable that 29 people should go to work one day and never come home , with no one being held accountable . Yet , tragically , that is what happened . Their families ' enduring commitment to justice has never been in doubt , but the public 's willingness to continue to pay so much to achieve it might be .

( I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill . ) What should be entirely non-negotiable from the outset though , is the retention of Concert as a quality audio experience , and not merely as a format that 's available only online . <p> Footnote : If RNZ management continue to be muleheaded about going down the path it has flagged , there would be little reason for any New Zealander with a passion for classical music to persevere with it .

True , the field of who is to be The Great Unifier able to bring the party and nation back together still includes Elizabeth Warren , Joe Biden and Amy Klobuchar - but time is running out for all of them . Biden is already downplaying expectations for New Hampshire and is merely hanging on until South Carolina on February 29 , when the black electorate that supported Barack Obama will ( Biden hopes ) come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viable until Super Tuesday on March 3 , when 15 states will hold their primaries simultaneously . <p> Maybe . One problem looming for the other leading Democratic contenders in November - Sanders , Buttigieg and Warren -- is that they all poll badly among black and Hispanic voters . Reportedly , the population of voting age African-Americans is at or near or above the national average ( of 12.5% ) in perennial swing states such as Florida , Michigan , North Carolina , Ohio and Pennsylvania . Clearly , Democrats will need a large black turnout in those states if they are to defeat Trump . Yet if the general election campaign language does shift to messages of moderation and unification ( in order to attract the key white swing voters who were pro-Trump/anti-Hillary in 2016 ) the more likely it would be that black voters would simply stay home , rather than turn out in enthusiastic droves to support the status quo . Obama was unique in that respect . <p> Mayor Pete seems to be clearing Sanders ' path to the Democratic nomination by crippling their common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . Sanders ' campaign has always faced two key questions . First , could he consolidate the party 's left wing behind him , or would he and Sen. Elizabeth Warren undermine each other by splitting that vote ? Second , even if Sanders could win the battle for the party 's progressives , would that be enough to overcome Joe Biden , who seemed to have a lock on moderate and minority voters ? Buttigieg has helped on both fronts by sapping support from both Warren and Biden , whom his backers consistently list as their secondchoice candidates . <p> As Buttigieg continues to prevail over Warren , Weissman says , progressives will turn to Sanders as the leftish candidate more likely to prevail . In the moderate lane , Biden ca n't get a clear run . He is being crowded by the surge for Buttigieg , and by the late entry of Michael Bloomberg , who is staking his all on a strong showing on Super Tuesday . Basically , Biden is surrounded by spoilers who are eroding his main pitch for the nomination : that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisle , mobilise black voters and beat Donald Trump . ( On February 29 , South Carolina will put Biden 's claim to be a ' black voter magnet ' to the test . ) <p> The Bernie Believers of course , think that Sanders is really the guy who can reach the masses of disenchanted proletarians who supported Trump in 2016 . Arguably , this belief reflects an ideological romanticism about the working class . This year , that romantic belief seems about to be given its first serious test since George McGovern won the Democratic nomination in 1972 , and went on to suffer a massive defeat . Certainly , there are plenty of conservatives who would love to fight Election 2020 against Sanders : <p> Sen. Martha McSally of Arizona , one of the most vulnerable Republicans in 2020 , was asked about how she would thread the needle , running in a state where many independents have turned against Trump . She argued that once the general election came , the campaign would turn into a referendum on socialism or freedom . That argument is obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Yet in the same article , the conservative Washington Examiner warned the faithful against treating Sanders as a pushover who would be the easiest of all the Democratic candidates to beat in November . Given Trump 's bad poll ratings , the newspaper says , it might take only one foreign policy disaster to turn this year into a repeat of 2016 , but at the other end of the political spectrum -- with the candidate widely written off as unelectable succeeding against the odds , regardless . <h> Scoop Citizen Members and ScoopPro Organisations are the lifeblood of Scoop . <p> 20 years of independent publishing is a milestone , but your support is essential to keep Scoop thriving .

@@31636235 <h> Ongoing victims of Havelock North 's water crisis <p> Three summers after the devastating water devastation that crippled the town of Havelock North , in Hawkes Bay , a researcher looks for the lasting effects on many of those who fell ill . <p> " It was bullshit . The whole thing was bullshit . And even to this day now it 's still bullshit . " <p> Those are the words of one of the Havelock North residents struck down by gastroenteritis in the 2016 campylobacter outbreak in the town as a result of contaminated drinking water . <p> It was sheep shit , not bull , that is thought to have been most likely responsible for the contamination , which led to four people dying , 45 being hospitalised and an estimated 5,500 -- a third of the town 's population -- falling ill . <p> But the bullshit comment reflects the ongoing sense of injustice I encountered when I interviewed more than 40 people who lived through the incident and became ill , cared for someone who became ill or bore witness to events . <p> The interviews -- with 21 males and 20 females @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know the stories of the people behind the numbers so frequently cited by media and in announcements related to the official inquiry into the contamination . <p> I heard of intense physical pain and hardship , in many cases lasting long after the outbreak itself . There was anger about how the crisis was handled , scepticism about several aspects of official accounts of it , and feelings of grievance over what is seen as a lack of accountability . <p> Another reason for the interviews was to develop our understanding of environmental victimisation . <p> Victims of environmental crime or harm are said to far outweigh those of everyday street crime . It has been calculated that the number of deaths from water pollution each year across the world is up to 30 times higher than those from homicide . <p> Despite this , scholars have only really begun to develop or imagine what an environmental victimology might look like . This is partly because environmental harm is complicated . For example , it is rarely criminalised , so victims are unlikely to be acknowledged by the criminal justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victims . There might be multiple impacts to their health and finances from lots of different origins , so it is very difficult to pin down who the offender is . <p> As a flow-on effect from that , the public are not often exposed to environmental victims , because the media seldom report on them . In cases where there have been clear environmental victims , it is often couched in the language of tragedy , as accidents , or hidden behind sophisticated greenwashing campaigns . <p> The Havelock North people I interviewed were , on the whole , reluctant to see themselves as victims . It was striking the threshold at which they felt justified to claim victim status . One woman , who had described to me a harrowing 12 months following the contamination , said : " It 's not bad . It 's nothing life or death ... Probably one of the least heart-breaking stories . " <p> Another , one of several people who viewed their suffering as relative to that of others in the community , said : " I would n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hospital , I was n't at death 's door , I was n't trying to look after children as well . " <p> For some , victimisation required intent to cause harm . <p> A woman whose children fell sick felt responsible herself for poisoning them , as though her victimisation had spilled over into another unwanted status : that of a kind of co-offender . <p> Whether or not they regarded themselves as victims , most of the people I interviewed thought they had been ignored , dismissed and silenced . <p> The World Health Organisation says the majority of people who get a campylobacter infection make a full recovery within 10 days , with only the elderly , the young and people with underlying complicated health conditions likely to experience long-term issues . <p> I heard a different story . People said it was the worst , with one woman saying there were moments she would have happily died . Recovery was long and slow , including cases of diarrhoea for months , significant weight loss , exhaustion despite long periods of sleep , unpredictable cramping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Many lost income and had ongoing medical bills . Several noted they or their loved ones were only just beginning to come right at the time they spoke to me -- and this was two and a half years after the outbreak . <p> People questioned why the alarm about the outbreak was n't raised earlier and then the form the alarm took , including Facebook posts and an announcement on Hastings District Council website . <p> " There 's no way on God 's earth you 're going to look at a council website to understand why you 've got diarrhoea , " said one man , who also asked : " Do I look like a Facebooker ? " <p> In such a community , with a lot of elderly people , relying on social media and other digital communications was inappropriate , people said . There should have been door knocking , telephone calls and drive-by megaphone announcements . <p> Anger over this was compounded by a sense the community had been left to fend for themselves . " They immediately should have called in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to them , ' We need help , we need medical people here , we need the rest homes looked after and what have you . ' We totally felt we were on our own and that went on for weeks , " said one man . <p> Afterwards , acknowledgement of the depth of their suffering was particularly important to people . Instead , they said , they felt invisible , with a compensation scheme when it finally came limited to $200,000 in total and subject to what were considered overly strict criteria . <p> " Quite frankly , I felt so ill that I could n't remember all the details of what I would have needed to remember to fill in the form . So what was the point ? " said one woman . <p> As a result of the crisis and subsequent inquiry into it , there have been legislative changes to drinking water regulations , including plans to establish an independent regulator . <p> But at a community level redress is another matter . <p> The man who made the bullshit comment ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and regularly sees a psychiatrist to help cope with his depression .

Photo : Lynn Grieveson <h> It 's not enough to be the party of bright ideas <p> The gloss seems to quickly come off every big announcement this Government makes - and to win the next election it will need to stop a public perception that it is ' all talk ' becoming entrenched <p> Labour 's recent conference seemed to tick all the boxes . The party appeared not only united , but enthusiastic and energetic ; an impressive new president was elected with a minimum of fuss ; the Prime Minister 's education spending announcement ; and , the promise of a bigger infrastructure spending announcement to come before Christmas , were all well received . <p> The elephants in the room of the party 's appalling handling of sexual abuse allegations involving staff in the Prime Minister 's office , and the constantly recalcitrant approach of its coalition partner , New Zealand First , barely rated a mention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All in all , it was a positive weekend for the lead party of government . However , any residual hype would have been surely blown away by Monday 's revelation of yet another privacy breach , this time involving personal data collected by the Police , including names , addresses , bank account details , of those participating in the weapons buyback scheme . <p> This is arguably amongst the most serious of all the data breaches of recent years , given the nature of the information disclosed , and the fact that it had been the Police , of all agencies , that had the responsibility for the collection and secure holding of this information . <p> After all , if the Police can not be trusted to hold personal information securely , who can be ? <p> Once again , the Government has been left in the position of having to explain why one of its flagship policies has gone awry . Just like KiwiBuild , just like the capital gains tax . Or the year of delivery that has not been . <p> All bright ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where all the details were not properly nailed down before implementation . <p> ... as the most recent polling shows , it has a problem <p> The weapons buyback initiative was a bold , positive and generally welcome move in the wake of the Christchurch mosque killings , but now it and the accompanying online weapons register are in danger of falling over because of the data breach . <p> Like KiwiBuild , if you believe the Police Minister , it also has been everyone else 's fault . He has even offered the fatuous explanation that those who have accessed the information are breaking the law . And the Prime Minister says the blame lies with the private sector company developing the system , and certainly not the government or the Minister . <p> It is all so much of a far cry from the dizzy heights of the weekend in Whanganui . However , generally speaking , party conferences are of little real relevance to the general public , unless things go wrong . <p> They are expected to be the highly stage-managed events they have become over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass by largely unnoticed . The only ones people remember are those where there was blood on the floor . <p> Where party conferences do matter is that they are the one big opportunity each year when a party , through its political and administrative leadership , can engage directly with its members . <p> Conferences are an opportunity to enthuse and encourage the party loyalists , especially in the lead up to an election , and a chance for delegates to rub shoulders with their political leaders . Beyond that , they count for very little . <p> Labour well knows that the public judgment come election time will be on the Government 's performance , not the passing enthusiasms of its annual conference . <p> And here is where , as the most recent polling shows , it has a problem . The perception that this is a Government which talks extremely big , but delivers very little , appears to be entrenching . And once a public perception solidifies , it is very difficult to shift . <p> To head off this , and the separate but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record Budget surpluses it is accumulating , Labour made two bold , but rushed , announcements at its conference . <p> The first was from the Finance Minister that when the HYEFU ( the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update ) is announced alongside the Budget Policy Statement there will also be a significant accompanying announcement about a substantial boost in infrastructure expenditure . <p> When challenged as to why this announcement was being so boldly foreshadowed at the Labour Party conference , the Minister brushed questions aside , correctly pointing out the release of the Budget Policy Statement ( effectively , the Government 's blueprint for next year 's Budget ) was the proper time to release such information , further begging the question of why it therefore had to pre-announced at the conference . <p> The only reasonable conclusion is that it was designed to give an impression of urgency and determination on the Government 's part , even if not much is going to change in the short term . <p> Once again , the gloss was coming off , almost while the Government was still burnishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister , of a one-off boost to state school funding of $400 million is many senses classic of this Government . A bold announcement , simple in concept and breathtaking in its sweep , that seeks to capture the public imagination -- just like the promise of 100,000 affordable homes over 10 years under KiwiBuild , or the world 's most comprehensive automatic weapons buyback scheme in the wake of the Christchurch atrocity . <p> As with both of those , the devil was in the detail of the schools ' funding package . Within 24 hours , it had become clear that the bold sweep was not all state schools , but all state schools minus integrated schools , and that the package did nothing to address funding inequalities between schools . <p> Once again , the gloss was coming off , almost while the Government was still burnishing it . Although the Prime Minister once proclaimed 2019 to be the Government 's " Year of Delivery " , for most people it has become the year of missed opportunities . <p> Yet , for much of the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been able to bask in the reality that despite everything , people still thought they were better than the National Party . <p> However , the controversial nature of some of its policy pronouncements notwithstanding , there have been distinct signs over recent weeks that National is at last starting to get its game together and show some discipline and focus . <p> And with ACT climbing off the electoral floor , it is starting to dawn on Labour that the previously inconceivable notion of a National-led Government , supported by ACT , is at least a possibility . <p> The 2020 election is but nine to twelve months away . There is still plenty of time for it to be won or lost by either side of politics . <p> The hype and adulation of its conference notwithstanding , Labour knows that it is public perception which will determine its fate . If the perception that this is a Government which talks extremely big , but is struggling to deliver becomes locked in , it will be very difficult to prevail against a resurgent National . <p> But if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coherent plan which is working after all , the contest will be much more winnable . <p> Normally , party leaders fire up their conferences by promising " we WILL win the next election . " Interestingly , the Prime Minister 's closing promise to the Labour conference was only " we CAN win the next election . " <p> As 2020 approaches , she clearly knows that for her party and Government , there is still everything to play for . <p> Newsroom has repeatedly broken big , important national news stories and established a platform for quality journalism on issues ranging from climate change , sexual harassment and bullying through to science , foreign affairs , women 's sports and politics . <p> But we need your support to continue , whether it is great , small , ongoing or a one-off donation .

@@31636237 <p> Paula Morris ( Ngati Wai , Ngati Whatua ) is an award-winning novelist , short story writer and essayist . She has been awarded numerous residencies and fellowships , and is convenor of the Master in Creative Writing programme at the University of Auckland . <h> Atwood , Swarbrick and an expensive waste of everyone 's time <p> Chl ? e Swarbrick was more interested in herself at the Civic last night than engaging with her guest Margaret Atwood , writes Paula Morris . <p> " Writers are a cheap date , " Margaret Atwood joked early in last night 's event at the Civic , though she was anything but . She talked with pride about being one of the founders of the Toronto writers ' festival , but rather than come to New Zealand for one of our book festivals , Atwood opted for the large fee offered by an independent producer -- the UK-based Fane Productions -- and three one-off events in Wellington , Auckland and Christchurch . <p> Large fees and independent promoters mean high ticket prices for fans . In Auckland the " cheap seats " -- at $70 -- quickly sold out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( bought by a friend who could n't use it ) cost $131 . If the evening with Atwood had been offered by the Auckland Writers Festival as an out-of-season event , as they 've done recently with Arundhati Roy , Nigella Lawson and Lee Child , the top ticket price would have been $37.50 , with a student price of $20 . Within the festival itself the price would have been the same , even for big names like Gloria Steinem , Alice Walker and Haruki Murakami . <p> The event would also have sold out . Faced with too many empty seats in one of Auckland 's most expensive venues , the promoters dropped the price of remaining tickets to $69 , then $59 , a blow for avid fans who 'd bought their tickets earlier . Twenty-five free tickets were reserved for " under-25s " , and through the University of Auckland I helped distribute these -- the offer taken up mainly by young women who are keen Atwood readers . ( I hope the event did n't put them off future events with writers . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Green Party MP Chl ? e Swarbrick , announced there were " almost 2000 people " present , but a glance around the circle suggested this was wishful thinking . <p> In Christchurch , where a WORD out-of-season event last year for Zadie Smith cost $25 ( plus Ticketek 's lavish booking fee of $8.50 ) per ticket , the prices for Atwood were the same as in Auckland -- and Sydney . Sales were so sluggish that the promoters had to downsize from the 2000-seater auditorium to the 700-seat James Hay Theatre . As in Auckland and Wellington , all tickets were reduced to $59 in the final week . " Selling fast " read the online ad for the event . Well , no . <p> So , lashings of money -- and expense -- all round . But what about the show ? Fane billed this as a " premiere literary event spanning the breadth of Atwood 's remarkable career , her diverse range of works and why , in the Booker Award winning The Testaments , she has returned to her seminal story , 34 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " seminal " to Atwood 's work aside , this description was false advertising . <p> Part of the issue was Chl ? e Swarbrick , who seemed more interested in talking about politics and herself than in interviewing Atwood about her " diverse range of works " . I was not convinced that Swarbrick had read any of Atwood 's books , or even recognised the titles . Another audience member tweeted : " References by Atwood to Robber Bride , Blind Assassin , Cat 's Eye , Edible Woman were all brushed aside . Comments by Atwood about the independent ( and unintended ) life of texts could have been tied into Oryx and Crake . All opportunities lost . " <p> Instead we got an inane question about how Atwood is " able to write people so well " and an inane discussion about protestors who dress as handmaids . I still have no idea how The Testaments works as a sequel , or what happens in it , or why Atwood decided to revisit the characters . <p> Swarbrick told us they 'd be back after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At 9:15pm I wrote : " Still waiting for a question about an actual book . " Atwood was asked her biggest regret : " Not learning to touch type . " Swarbrick did n't know what that meant . " How do you feel about your books being taught in schools ? " Atwood did n't care . " Do you wear pyjamas while you write ? " No . " Would you like to come to dinner ? " LOLs all round . One of the tweets asked about the " Hulu adaptation of The Handmaid 's Tale . " Where did that question come from ? Someone who works at Hulu ? In New Zealand , The Handmaid 's Tale screens on Lightbox . <p> I submitted a question about Alias Grace , a novel many Atwood readers love , the TV adaptation screening now on Netflix in New Zealand . It was not asked , perhaps because it was about a book rather than Atwood 's Hopes for the Future , or an anecdote about riding an e-scooter in Wellington , or a question about inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Swarbrick tweeted : " My briefing was to discuss her broader approach to life , writing and thematics , primarily as related to the recent launch of The Testaments in wrapping up Handmaids . " I do n't know what " thematics " means , any more than Atwood understood what RNZ was when Swarbrick MP-splained the controversy over Concert FM . " Royal New Zealand ... ? " Atwood asked , and the audience around me shuffled and groaned . <p> " Every woman in Auckland has turned out for Margaret Atwood , " someone tweeted , but what they meant was Pakeha women of a certain age who could afford inflated ticket prices . If Atwood was prickly with Kim Hill in Wellington , she was patronising with Swarbrick in Auckland , mentioning life pre " the internet " in italicised sing-song . She made various claims about indigenous people in Canada that would not withstand scrutiny from a more informed interviewer , especially one who knew the controversy around Atwood 's support of Joseph Boyden and Steven Galloway . Nothing was asked about her Booker Prize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win the Booker . <p> I 'm familiar with the speaker 's circuit of paying big-name writers high appearance fees . When I worked at Tulane University , we spent several hundred thousand dollars bringing in Toni Morrison , Salman Rushdie , Joan Didion and Billy Collins , among others . We held the events in our biggest auditoriums on campus , and all tickets were free . Morrison filled the 1800-seat venue , and the audience included hundreds of young people and local families . Billy Collins cost my rich US university a lot of money , but he 's appeared at the Writers Festival in Wellington for the standard fee paid to all writers , local and international . <p> Our writers ' festivals in New Zealand are our " premiere literary events " where the conversations are wide-ranging and informed , prices are reasonable , and authors sign books for hours after their events . ( Murakami needed to get to bed straight away , so he signed 200 books in advance . ) As well as international stars , we get to hear from the international @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealand writers , from award-winners to debut novelists to slam poets .

Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Electoral Commission 's decision to refer the matter to police , who in turn passed the parcel onto the SFO , is not the biggest surprise in the world given the claims raised by Stuff 's investigation of the foundation and its role in funding the party after which it is named . <p> New Zealand First leader Winston Peters insists the foundation is lawful , claiming it replicates National 's own foundation - but Opposition MPs and staffers have been equally adamant that the two are materially different , with donations to National 's foundation disclosed as if they were made directly to the party . <p> The commission may lack the powers to determine whether or not any electoral laws have been breached , but its conclusion that donations to the foundation were not properly transmitted or disclosed is still damaging . <p> Peters offered a bullish response , claiming he had already advised New Zealand First to refer the matter itself to police - for the sake of clarifying New Zealand 's donations regime , rather than any admission of impropriety . <p> If the events of 2008 are any guide , the investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' supporters and detractors alike are hoping for . <p> Private investigation , public dissection <p> Back then , the SFO 's director ultimately concluded there was no basis for laying fraud charges , but noted unanswered questions about other potential breaches of electoral law which were not within its remit . <p> A police investigation also failed to result in any charges , while the Electoral Commission ruled that New Zealand First 's return of donations for 2007 was " materially false " but not in breach of the law . <p> It would be a mistake to assume the facts of the case are identical , or that there will be an identical outcome - but there is enough to suggest that clear-cut wrongdoing or innocence will not be that easily identified . <p> But while that investigation takes place behind closed doors , there will be a far more public dissection of the issue as Parliament resumes sitting this week . <p> National leader Simon Bridges will be feeling more comfortable with his decision to pre-emptively rule out New Zealand First as a coalition partner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Peters ' party to the larger target that Labour presents . <p> Such an offer has been neither made nor requested , according to Jacinda Ardern : speaking to media at her weekly post-Cabinet press conference , the Prime Minister insisted it was too early to render any judgment . <p> Peters set his own precedent in 2008 with the decision to step aside , and it is understandable that some will ask why he does not do the same again . <p> Of course , the circumstances are somewhat different : Peters was serving as a minister outside of Cabinet due to New Zealand First 's confidence and supply arrangement with Labour , while he is now far more intimately involved thanks to his party 's formal coalition deal and his role as Deputy Prime Minister . <p> Most pertinently , where there was little doubt about Clark 's ability to lay down the law should the circumstances demand it , Ardern has seemed far less willing - or able - to step in and hold her junior coalition partner to account . <p> Of course , Peters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice and the presumption of innocence as the SFO makes its inquiries . <p> But he set his own precedent in 2008 with the decision to step aside , and it is understandable that some will ask why he does not do the same again . <p> That could yet occur as pressure builds , although Peters may look back on the decision as a misstep that helped to usher New Zealand First out of Parliament . <p> Dropping out then was seen as the party 's death knell ( inaccurately , as it turns out ) , and if it was to happen again it would seem hard for New Zealand First to find a way back in . <p> But there is a wider concern here , that New Zealanders lose faith in our democratic processes as a result of the investigations into both National and New Zealand First . <p> Of course , neither has yet resulted in any proven wrongdoing , and the parties deserve the benefit of the doubt until proven otherwise . But as Ardern pointed out , all New Zealanders must have faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whether or not there is guilt established in these particular cases , it is beyond clear that our laws must be reformed , sooner rather than later . <p> We value fearless , independent journalism .

@@31636240 <h> New light shed on world 's most unusual continent <p> The Pacific " Ring of Fire " , rather than Australia , might be responsible for the evolution of recently discovered continent Zealandia . <p> A new theory about Zealandia , the seventh and smallest of the world 's continents , is being proposed by Te Herenga Waka -- Victoria University of Wellington Professor Rupert Sutherland . <p> Professor Sutherland , of the School of Geography , Environment and Earth Sciences , was co-lead scientist on a multi-million-dollar international drilling expedition in the Tasman Sea to unlock the secrets of the largely submerged continent . <p> He says the theory came from observations on new geophysical data . <p> The ring of fire -- the plate boundaries around the Pacific on which volcanoes and large earthquakes occur -- had permanent and transient effects on Zealandia . <p> " Things that were in 1000 metres of water came up to sea level and then subsided down to be more than 1000m deep again . The permanent effects included the New Caledonia Trough that comes all the way down to Taranaki .

The other co-lead scientist was Professor Gerald Dickens from Rice University in Texas in the US . <p> Professor Sutherland says that in 1972 , three holes were drilled " pretty much randomly " in northern Zealandia . <p> " That was the first time anyone had really properly sampled offshore there . And that was the last time pretty much , although in 1986 they went back and re-drilled some of the shallow parts but did n't learn anything fundamentally new . <p> " The question is -- how did Zealandia form ? Six of the continents on Earth look incredibly similar in terms of continental slope and mountains , but Zealandia is really , really different , so it is a really unusual continent . <p> " That very first expedition in 1972 led to the hypothesis that it was underwater because it was ripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85 million years ago . In the process of doing that , the crust was stretched and made thinner . <p> " But there was a whole bunch of observations I was making on the geophysical data that just were n't adding up with that idea . <p> " The hypothesis we were proposing was that a key factor in the geography of Zealandia was the formation of the Pacific Ring of Fire . It was n't just the ripping away from Australia and Antarctica . <p> " What we discovered is the formation of the Pacific Ring of Fire subduction margin had a really big impact on the geography . And the Lord Howe Rise actually came up and was above sea level when this process was going on , about 50 million years ago . <p> " Zealandia has formed at that subduction margin . Our hypothesis is that these margins can die and can come back to life in subduction resurrection . <p> " All the Zealandia continent formed over 500 or 600 million years by stuff being plastered on to the edge of subduction margins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hundreds of millions of years , in fact its whole life . It was born in that environment , but it has n't been in that environment continuously . <p> " So why did that subduction die and then come back to life and die again and be resurrected ? From a geologist 's point of view that is a very interesting thing . <p> " The formation of the Pacific Ring of Fire is quite a puzzle , because that actually caused everything on the planet to change . It was a really significant global event with far-reaching implications for natural resources , climate and global geochemical cycles . " <p> All six sites provided useful new stratigraphic and paleogeographic information . <p> " We were out in the Tasman Sea for 58 days .

@@31639230 <h> Mark Reason : Some Kiwi players lashing out after All Blacks ' World Cup failure <p> OPINION : New Zealand rugby is on the rogue edge . The fans have been superb about the All Blacks defeat in the semifinal of the Rugby World Cup , but some coaches and players appear to be seeking vengeance . They want their kilogram of flesh . <p> The first major sign of roguery was during the Hurricanes ' defeat on the opening weekend of Super Rugby . They were well beaten by the Stormers and too many of the team reacted like petulant children . Some of the tackling was grotesque . <p> GALLO IMAGES <p> Referee Jaco Peyper during the Super Rugby match between the Stormers and Hurricanes . <p> The worst hit was the ' tackle ' of Ricky Riccitelli on Siya Kolisi . It was an act of cowardly thuggery . The Springboks captain had already long passed the ball when the Hurricanes hooker blindsided him with a shoulder into the knee . It was ridiculously late and has put the Springboks captain out of the game for around six weeks . <p> Riccitelli did not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he was helped off the pitch . And to rugby 's shame , nothing has subsequently been done about it . We need sanctions for this sort of thing . Why should the victims , the Stormers and Kolisi , suffer , but the thugs escape unpunished . <p> You would have liked to think that the Hurricanes coaching staff would have publicly apologised after the game for this and many other cheap shots their players perpetrated . But we know what happens when New Zealand rugby is criticised . They jump into the sand pit and go into the denial mode of a small child . <p> GALLO IMAGES <p> Jaco Coetzee is tackled by Scott Scrafton of the Hurricanes at Newlands Stadium . <p> The Stormers coaches were rightly angry about everything that went on . They spoke of it being " a mean-spirited game " and of their anger after they had reviewed all the cheap shots . They pointed out one of their players even had his hair pulled - twice . <p> The Hurricanes reacted predictably . Assistant coach Chris Gibbes said ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honest . There are a few clips that we 've looked at -- TJ getting tackled off the ball , head shots and guys getting their head hit . <p> " So I do n't know where he 's coming from with that . He 's entitled to his opinion , but it 's a bit surprising , and a bit disappointing ... <p> BILLY STICKLAND/PHOTOSPORT <p> Ireland 's Robbie Henshaw about to be stretchered out of the 2016 test against the All Blacks . <p> " Billy 's one we could have controlled ( Proctor was shown a yellow card for an off the ball block ) , he did n't need to do that , but Vaea 's one we have looked at a number of times and it does n't look like a yellow card . It 's Jaco 's decision and we have to live with that . " <p> That final , bewildering statement tells you all that you need to know about the Canes ' astonishing levels of denial . <p> Fifita should have been shown a red card for a high tackle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leniency shown in the southern hemisphere . <p> It is the sort of tackle the authorities are desperate to eliminate from the game because of the long term implications to player health . It was a shoulder to the chin . But referee Jaco Peyper , as is his wont , fished about for an excuse . <p> The South African official decided there was sufficient mitigation for him to downgrade the sanction from red to yellow , because Fifita was bending at the knees . <p> Rugby 's guidelines state that mitigation can occur if the " tackler makes a definite attempt to change height in an effort to avoid ball carrier 's head " ; and the main factor against mitigation is " If the tackler and BC ( ball carrier ) are in open space and/or the tackler has clear line of sight and time before contact . " <p> PHIL WALTER/GETTY IMAGES <p> Ireland captain Rory Best remonstrates with referee Jaco Peyper during the test match against the All Blacks in Dublin , in 2016 . <p> The first proviso certainly was not satisfied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of sight from several metres out . It was also not much more than 30 minutes of Super Rugby since he last received a red card for a similar tackle on Daniel du Preez of the Sharks . Coach John Plumtree , now with the All Blacks , also went into denial about that one . <p> GALLO IMAGES <p> Hurricane Billy Proctor on the attack against the Stormers . He was yellow-carded for a block . <p> No , the only mitigation was Peyper . He was the official who was infamously in charge of the game when New Zealand went rogue in Dublin . He does not like coming down on New Zealand sides because , it seems to me , he fears the impact on his career . This is common amongst referees . <p> After that Dublin game Matt Williams , a former coach , said of New Zealand teams ; " They pressure the official .... If New Zealanders come out and say ' you 're not a good referee ' , that knocks your career out ... The best in the game are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have buried people 's careers ... It is a very big flaw in our game that they can get away with this . <p> " I do n't think that they came out with an intent to have high tackles and to bash people ... They lost control . That 's why the officials are there . That 's why we have these things - to protect players . New Zealand have been above the law for many years and I 'm not surprised about ' what occurred ( in Dublin ) . " <p> Those words from nearly four years ago now sound a current warning . At the weekend the new All Blacks coach Ian Foster said ; " We 've got to make sure we define what being physical means ... Some games over the last two years where teams beat us , they 've hit us in that area . We 've said we 're going to outskill you , but you 've got to respect opponents have done a lot of work on us and if we do n't get physical , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Of course rugby is a physical game , we know that . But there is a difference between gain line speed with a physical edge and bashing people up . Even in victory over the Jaguares at the weekend there were a couple of signs still of the Hurricanes wanting to bash people up . And it was the same two or three players over and over . <p> PHIL WALTER/GETTY IMAGES <p> Josh Van Der Flier takes on Malakai Fekitoa in Dublin , in 2016 . <p> It will also have alarmed the fair-minded that when the TMO wanted to review what was a forward pass in the game-deciding try , the commentators also went into denial , claimed that there was nothing to see and that the TMO ( " Where 's that TMO from ? " " Have a guess " ) was motivated by national bias . It was a disgrace . These were fans with microphones . <p> So I 'm worried . There was some fabulous rugby over the first two weekends from New Zealand teams , but I am concerned that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country has some of the most fabulous players on the planet . But just because the All Blacks lost a World Cup game because they were out coached and out thought , New Zealand rugby does not need to react by lashing out . <p> The fans , who all tell me they had a fabulous time in Japan despite the result , have moved on . The players and coaches need to do the same .

First and foremost , NZ Football is a member of the Oceania Football Confederation ( OFC ) , meaning the All Whites have a sparse competitive schedule . <p> They played a total of 11 qualifiers against six different teams , excluding Peru , over a four-year campaign ( 2014 - 2018 ) -- and the first matches only commenced in 2016 , meaning there were two years of inactivity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New Zealand . <p> In 2006 , Australia sought greener pastures by ditching the OFC , which they dominated , for the Asian Football Confederation ( AFC ) . The Socceroos now regularly play competitive football against quality opposition . For instance , on the road to Russia they played 18 group matches in qualifying alone , plus six in the 2015 AFC Asian Cup -- which they hosted and won . <p> The All Whites initially benefited from Australia 's departure , qualifying for their second World Cup in 2010 , after winning the OFC Nations Cup and defeating Bahrain in an inter-confederation playoff . <p> However , since FIFA allocates 0.5 World Cup spots to the OFC -- the only confederation without a single automatic spot -- qualifying is still difficult . <p> For instance , the All Whites had to face Mexico in a playoff in 2013 , and then Peru in 2017 -- which was very nearly Argentina . <p> But this will change when the World Cup expands from 32 teams to 48 in 2026 , awarding the OFC 1.5 spots . <p> Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NZ Football -- assuming the All Whites qualify -- a lack of competitive fixtures will remain an issue . <p> How can the OFC expect to grow and maintain interest in the game with its current fixture schedule ? How can the All Whites improve , let alone international football in Oceania , when they do n't play regularly ? <p> Just 26 per cent of voters wanted the All Whites to remain in Oceania , while 74 per cent preferred a move to Asia . <p> However , a move is not that simple . And it remains to be seen whether NZ Football would be interested in such a move -- considering the path to World Cup qualification will become much easier -- or be financially capable in its current state . <p> The OFC certainly would n't want New Zealand to leave , as it would be viewed as a significant loss to its competitions . <p> But it seems a necessary move for the All Whites , if they ever want to reach their full potential on the world stage . <p> The late Michael Cockerill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the AFC .

The All Whites -- and Pacific Island nations -- would thus compete regularly against the likes of Australia ( reviving the trans-Tasman rivalry ) , China , Japan , and South Korea . <p> It 's an exciting concept , one that would , expectedly , raise the overall game in Oceania in the long-term . And it would n't be the first time the All Whites competed for World Cup qualification through Asia . In fact , the nickname was born from a qualifier against Chinese Taipei ( Taiwan ) in 1981 . <p> This was when the AFC and OFC shared two qualification spots out of 24 for the 1982 World Cup . <p> A total of 20 AFC and OFC teams were placed in four groups for round one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up of amateurs , topped their group consisting of Australia , Chinese Taipei , Fiji and Indonesia . <p> Then , in round two , competing against the other three group winners , the All Whites tied second with China , forcing a playoff in Singapore -- which resulted in New Zealand qualifying for their first ever FIFA World Cup . <p> This campaign remains as one of New Zealand 's most memorable sporting achievements -- a classic underdog story . This journey is what made football finally relevant and exciting in a rugby-centric society and saw fans flocking to Mt Smart Stadium for seven home games . <p> Now , under the current format , the All Whites can only generate real excitement on home soil once every four years .

' <p> Opening up about seeing her first child , George , for the first time , the mum said it was an ' amazing ' moment . <p> ' It is extraordinary as I 've said , ' she gushed . ' How can the human body do that ? It is utterly extraordinary , actually . And he was very sweet . And also sort of relieved that he was a happy , healthy boy .

Yep -- all the time , yep -- and you know even this morning , coming to the nursery visit here -- George and Charlotte were like " Mummy how could you possibly not be dropping us off at school this morning ? " <p> ' But no it 's a constant challenge -- you hear it time and time again from mums , even mums who are n't necessarily working and are n't pulled in the directions of having to juggle work life and family life ... and always sort of questioning your own decisions and your own judgements and things like that , and I think that starts from the moment you have a baby ! <p> Photo credit : Max Mumby/Indigo - Getty Images <p> ' Also I feel huge responsibility because what I 've learnt over the last few years is so fascinating and I definitely would have done things differently , even during my pregnancy , than I would have done now .

But the emotional wellbeing of the mother directly impacts the baby that you 're growing . ' <h> On morning sickness <p> During the podcast , the royal opened up about suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum during her three pregnancies which the NHS states results in symptoms such as excessive nausea and vomiting . <p> ' I got very bad morning sickness , ' she admitted . <p> ' I 'm not the happiest of pregnant people . Lots of people have it far , far worse . It was definitely a challenge . Not just for me , but also for your loved ones around you and I think that 's the thing - being pregnant and having a newborn baby and things like that , impacts everybody in the family .

It was hugely powerful . ' <h> On the highs and lows of being a new mum <p> Having previously opened up about struggling as a new mum , Kate also touched on how the first few hours of parenting panned out for her and her husband . <p> While she was n't quite sure how many hours after George 's birth she stepped out in public , describing it as a ' blur ' she revealed that during the overnight stay she recalled the weather being anything but comforting . <p> ' I remember it was one of the hottest days and night with huge thunderstorms so I did n't get a huge amount of sleep , but George did which was really great , ' she said . <p> Photo credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen to get home because , for me , being in hospital , I had all the memories of being in hospital because of being sick so it was n't a place I wanted to hang around in . So , I was really desperate to get home and get back to normality . But I think you think , particularly with your firstborn baby , you think everything is going to go back to how it was . I totally underestimated the impact and the change it had on us from that moment really and I think , unless you 've got children , you do n't realise . No amount of planning and preparation can get you ready for that moment . ' <p> While Fletcher recalled having an ' eerie silence ' when you get home after being in the hospital , Kate said she found the experience to be the opposite . <p> ' It was n't that quiet in our household ! ' she joked . ' William was like , " oh my gosh , is this what parenting is going to be like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to get ourselves settled and going again , but that 's the beauty I suppose of having a newborn baby . You are pulled to your toughest and most unknown places really that you had n't necessarily even have thought about before . ' <h> On what she 'd tell her younger self <p> During her discussion on the podcast , Kate said that she would love to have written a letter back to herself at the beginning of her first pregnancy as she feels that she has ' earned a huge amount ' . <p> ' I 'd really love to go back and tell myself at the beginning of pregnancy , right at the start what things I feel now really matter in terms of being a parent but also what really matters to the children and my children now , ' she admitted . <p> ' It 's the simple things that really make a difference .

@@31656231 <h> Statement Of Jami-lee Ross - " Spoke Up Now Set Up " <p> Just like donations to political parties , the justice system should be open and transparent . That is what I believe and have sought . <p> Until now , however , I have been unable to make a public statement regarding these allegations , despite wanting to do so . <p> That is because at the end of January , the three people responsible for the donations to the National Party in 2017 and 2018 made an urgent application for suppression of their names and any details that might identify them . I was not aware of their application at the time . I made no application for suppression of my own name or details . <p> While shocked that I had been targeted by the SFO , I had no intention of hiding away . I always wanted to make it very clear that as the whistle blower on this deception , it was outrageous that I was then charged and that others were seeking to implicate me , making me their expendable scape goat . <p> However , I could n't speak up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those three people to seek name suppression . Further , even though I made no application for name suppression , the same protection was extended to me by the Court despite me not wanting that . <p> I have complied with the court 's orders to date , as is expected of any person in my position . The public could rightly be outraged , if I did not respect the court 's decision , or if I sought to abuse my freedom of speech in the Parliament to circumvent that decision . <p> However , in later court documents my lawyers have made it clear that I never sought name suppression and that I do not want it . I have therefore proactively sought to have the suppression orders lifted so that I can make this statement . <p> Unfortunately I remain constrained at this time in what I can say , as the issue is now before the Court . As much as I would like to provide detail and evidence about what I now know , my lawyers have reiterated to me that these matters need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , or anyone else , to try and do so in the media . I will say all that I need to say when I am permitted to do so . <p> But , given what is being said by others , I want everyone to know and understand my position - I have never been involved in any deception to do with donations . <p> In fact I was the one that took this concern to the authorities , as you all know . I felt that I needed to expose the concerns that I had about the donations in 2018 that had been offered to Mr Bridges , in person , at an event that I was not in attendance at . <p> While I am yet to see what has been said by other people involved , it is clear that I am now being painted as the scape goat for the donation deception that the National Party , not me , benefitted from . I am being painted as the scape goat because I left the National Party after raising these concerns and because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be leader were not honoured by him . <p> On the receipt of new and further information , months after donations were received by the National Party , I was concerned that the donations were not made in compliance with the requirements of the Electoral Act . As soon as a I learned this further information , I advised the Party to return the donations . <p> In October 2018 , I notified the authorities of my concerns . This led to the SFO investigation . My decision to notify the authorities , was not just because I had been the victim of broken promises made to me by Mr Bridges , but because I considered that there was an issue that needed to be openly and honestly addressed for the benefit of the country . I still consider this to be the case . <p> I was the whistle blower , and as a result , ever since I have been attacked by the party and its supporters for bringing this matter to the attention of the nation . Some seek to make me out as the bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I will not be the National Party 's fall guy . <p> I want to emphasise that at the time the donations were made , I was not aware of any conspiracy to defeat the requirements of the Electoral Act . It was not until later that I had such a concern and I reported the matter to the proper authorities . Since then I have cooperated and said what I know . While I do not know what other connected parties have claimed , I deny that I was involved . I will defend myself and make that clear . <p> I have no intention of letting those who were involved get away with it or blame me in a way that is for their benefit or the National Party 's benefit . Politics is dirty . I know that now and have been the victim of this . But New Zealand 's politics must never be corrupt . <p> In Court , I will have the opportunity to defend my position and specifically , the allegations that I was a participant in any deception . But so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am permitted to say more and present evidence , I will . It will then be clear who was behind any scheme . But the public statement from Mr Bridges and the party that they had no involvement is simply untrue . <p> The donations concerned were for the National Party . They were taken and used by the National Party . <p> The donations that led me to blow the whistle were offered to Mr Bridges , not me . They were not for my own political or personal use . They improved Mr Bridges ' position , not mine . I had nothing to gain at all . <p> To the extent I played a part , that was as asked of me by the Party leader . Any suggestion that I might be behind any deception is simply untrue . The Party , and those who now make this claim , seek to blacken my name in order to avoid accountability for themselves . <p> I will continue to campaign for greater transparency in our laws around political fundraising . Our democracy belongs to New Zealanders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been feeding off money connected to foreign governments for far too long .

@@31657233 <h> Rental reforms progress to select committee stage <p> The Government continues to make progress on a fairer and more secure rental market for renters and landlords with the First Reading of the Residential Tenancies Amendment Bill and its referral to the Social Services and Community Select Committee . <p> " Now is the opportunity for landlords , tenants and others who want to have their say on the Bill to do so through the select committee , " Associate Minister of Housing ( Public Housing ) Kris Faafoi said . <p> " This Bill includes a series of reforms to improve the wellbeing of the 609,700 households that live in rented homes , and to provide a balance between the rights and responsibilities of both tenants and landlords , " Kris Faafoi said . <p> The changes in the Bill recognise that more New Zealanders are in rental accommodation for longer periods . In 1986 , about 25 percent of the population lived in rental accommodation .

@@31663231 <h> Big Tech threatens to geo-block NZ <p> Big Tech companies like Microsoft have raised the spectre of geo-blocking New Zealand if the Government proceeds with a bill for classifying streamed content , Marc Daalder reports <p> A law attempting to standardise parental guidance warnings across streaming services like Netflix and Lightbox has raised hackles from some Silicon Valley firms , which have threatened to block Kiwis from accessing their content . <p> The bill mandates that certain commercial video-on-demand ( CVoD ) providers follow the process that broadcasting and film companies follow in classifying content or submit themselves to a self-classification system to be developed by the Chief Censor and the Office of Film and Literature Classification ( OFLC ) . <p> Even this latter proposal would require reclassifying vast back catalogs of content , some CVoD providers say , and it might be easier for them to pull some content out of New Zealand altogether . There are also worries that streaming services might choose to leave the country rather than deal with a potentially onerous regulatory regime . <p> Microsoft threatens geo-blocking <p> In order to pull out of New Zealand , these companies would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with overseas addresses and credit cards . This would entail geo-blocking , in which IP addresses associated with a certain country are prevented from accessing webpages . <p> Geo-blocking is already used by streaming services that are n't present in New Zealand and to lock away content when a company has the rights to air footage in other countries but not here . Now , international streaming companies already present in New Zealand say they are considering stopping or delaying the release of some content if the new legislation places obligations on them that are too onerous . <p> Submissions to the Governance and Administration select committee raised concerns about enforceability or whether companies might just pull out . NZME 's submission said news sites with paid subscriptions that aired video footage could fall under the classification system . <p> " The difficulty with such wide application is that , coupled with the extra-territorial effect of the proposed Bill , the definition could capture news sites worldwide where VOD is offered in a supplementary form to the main news reporting function . Rather than complying with the law , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ users from subscribing to international news sources , " the submission stated . <p> " Restricting the availability of news sources internationally is not desirable . " <p> In its submission to the select committee , Microsoft warned that content it has yet to classify could be geo-blocked . " Microsoft observes , however , that while the majority of content it makes available through the Microsoft Movies &amp; TV platform is or may be rated by the studio producing the content , where a small independent studio or filmmaker makes content available on the platform , that content may not have a rating assigned , " the company 's government affairs manager Maciej Surowiec writes . <p> " In that situation , a provider like Microsoft is unlikely to apply to rate the content itself ( or itself develop a rating system ) as it is n't in the business of reviewing the film 's content in order to apply for the correct label . In the result , unobjectionable yet unrated / unlabelled content may , in some cases , not be made available to New Zealand audiences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labelling . " <p> At the same time , Sky asked in its submission " whether ( and how ) DIA expects to be able to impose the new CVoD regulation on global operators like Amazon Prime , Disney Plus and Apple TV+ " . <p> There were also fears that content , if not blocked , could be delayed . The Australia New Zealand Screen Association said it " supports measures that allow CVoD providers to self-classify without onerous regulatory obligations or fees that could delay release of content and increase piracy " , evoking the frustration that rippled through New Zealand when the first episode of the final season of Game of Thrones aired an hour later here than the rest of the world . <p> Government reassures those concerned <p> The Government says there is no reason for worry . Minister of Internal Affairs Tracey Martin wrote in a March 2019 cabinet paper that she had " been advised that the Deputy Chief Censor 's opinion is that self-classification options are unlikely to result in any delay in new content coming to the New Zealand market " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that providers would skip the New Zealand market because of the proposed changes . " <p> The OFLC , in its select committee submission , said that " given that this framework is low cost and simple for providers to implement , this would be unlikely to impact services provided to NZ public . We have not seen providers withdraw from other jurisdictions due to regulation . This light-handed regulatory approach will not require providers to make significant investment to supply our relatively small market . " <p> This avenue of concern was anticipated , as it had been raised in earlier rounds of debate . <p> In a submission on an earlier proposal , which included the possibility of mandatory classification without a self-classification option , the Screen Association wrote , " Complying with a formal classification process demands time and resources that may prevent operators from meeting the demands of the CVoD marketplace " . <p> A 2018 Department of Internal Affairs briefing raised the same concerns . " Some streaming providers have signed up to the voluntary scheme , but several major CVoD providers ( like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be members . This highlights an issue with the scheme as subsequent new entrants to the CVoD market may opt not to participate or current participants may decide to leave in order to reduce their compliance obligations . " <p> When the legislation was introduced to Parliament , National MPs also aired concerns about geo-blocking . Melissa Lee told the House that " the other concern is that if the regulation is too much , sometimes , I think , we run the risk of having content providers geo-block New Zealand " . <p> ACT Party leader David Seymour told Parliament that geo-blocking would occur . " One of the unintended consequences is that some outfits that currently stream to New Zealand will either stop servicing the New Zealand market or be blocked , " he said . <p> However , the Government says that the need for classification justifies the concern . The OFLC 's submission contains the below table illustrating the wide range of classifications for controversial content . <p> The submission says it is a problem when " a movie appears on different platforms with completely different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking reliable information when making viewing choices for themselves -- or for young people in their care . " <p> Under the new system , streaming services would either have to subject their catalogs to the classification process that mainstream films go through or self-classify based on a new scale the OFLC will develop for streamed content . This would particularly address concerns that suicide , sexual assault and other forms of sexual violence are not adequately prefaced with warnings , the OFLC says . <p> We value fearless , independent journalism .

He has poured $50 million of his own money into developing a 21m-long neutron accelerator that can treat head and neck cancer . <p> It is about to begin trials in a Finnish hospital . <p> Buckley half stunned but mostly bemused the audience when told them " The Americans did n't think an accelerator could do the job because it needed to go above 2 million volts .

The laughter is drowned out by a standing ovation -- just . <p> A common theme throughout the night was the use of te reo . The hosts , the sponsors presenting awards and the recipients all spoke in te reo Maori . The days where only one of New Zealand 's official languages is heard are fading quickly . <p> Jennifer Ward-Lealand Te Atamira 's victory is a reflection of the changing times . She is a champion of te reo as much as she is for the arts and the country 's actors . <p> She started learning the language in 2008 . She was gifted the name Te Atamira ( the stage ) by Maori elders for championing the language in the arts community . She has added it to her English surname because " it is a challenge in the best sense of the word . It is an urging on ( for others ) " . <p> After a fluent acceptance speech , Ward-Lealand said learning te reo " had fundamentally changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my own skin now and connected to the land . " <p> Earlier , Ward-Lealand told Newsroom she had noticed a significant change in attitude towards the Maori language about five years ago . <p> " People used to ask me why ? What use is it to you ? I felt like I had to justify it , like there had to be some economic benefit or something . Some people would look askance and go , ' oh that 's nice ' . <p> " I started by doing one night a week at evening class .... it was hard , I was 46 . I used to be good at French but my French is useless now as I obviously do n't have the ability to hold more than two languages in my head . " <p> Ward -- Lealand says the arts sector is quickly adopting the language . <p> " About five years ago , the greetings started changing and in the arts world we have embraced that change in a very fast way . It has made a profound difference to the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go faster . We have an amazing opportunity in this country because we are so small and we embrace change really quickly . <p> " I use te reo every day , if I do a Facebook post I do it in both Maori and English .

@@31663233 <h> Resignations , allegations swirl within Sustainable NZ <p> A new , " true green " party hoping to break into Parliament at this year 's election has been hit by resignations and allegations of questionable conduct , Newsroom 's political editor Sam Sachdeva reports <p> Fledgling political party Sustainable New Zealand has been rocked by a flurry of resignations and allegations of questionable behaviour by its leader , Newsroom can reveal . <p> One of the departees , former party secretary and board chair Helen Cartwright , has criticised the party 's lack of profile , policy and money , likening the nascent organisation to " a fast fail " . <p> Sustainable New Zealand launched in November last year , with founder and leader Vernon Tava pledging to lead a " full-time environment party " which could partner either National or Labour . <p> However , the party has struggled to find any traction since then , and has failed to register in any public polling to date . <p> With the September 19 election fast approaching , Tava and the party are now contending with a number of resignations by party officials since the new year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with immediate effect , a copy of which has been obtained by Newsroom , Cartwright said her position within the party had become untenable . <p> " My voice as party secretary and board chair is vastly ignored by my fellow board members . " <p> ' No policy , no profile , no money ' <p> In the letter , Cartwright outlined key problems facing the party , which she did not believe could be resolved " in a way that makes us fit for Parliament , nor a suitable collation sic partner for the left or the right . <p> " This is the truth of our current position : We have no policy . We have no profile . We have no money . We operate with no regard or reference to our constitution and rules ... We do not have a bona fide party leader nor a legitimate board .

He has advised me that he has all that is required and that I need not worry too much about it , " Baldwin said in a formal notice of resignation seen by Newsroom . <p> Sustainable New Zealand 's national volunteer coordinator and youth wing leader have also left the party in recent weeks . <p> Newsroom understands one area of concern from some within the party was whether it had fallen short of a legal requirement to have 500 financial members before registering with the Electoral Commission - and whether it had been suggested the matter should not be proactively raised . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Electoral Commission , and received an assurance that it was compliant with the law . <p> Ironically , it has been suggested that Tava himself is technically not a member , having failed to pay his joining fee within three months as required under the party 's constitution - which in turn would make him ineligible to be leader . <p> Baldwin declined to comment when contacted by Newsroom , while Cartwright said only that her resignation was due to concerns about the party 's operation . <p> Tava responds <p> Tava downplayed the significance of the resignations when speaking to Newsroom , suggesting they were a normal part of life in a political party . <p> " In a brand new party , you have to take people as they come and people are , based on initial promise , given positions and some of them obviously are going to be significant and high-trust positions , and it does n't always work out . <p> " You are under a lot of pressure establishing a party , particularly coming into election year , and there are complex interpersonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of people who are all rowing in the same direction .

@@31663234 <h> Top surfing break ' under threat ' <p> It 's feared a new carpark and cycle path planned for the coastline north of Kaikoura will spell the end of one of New Zealand 's best surfing breaks . David Williams reports . <p> What the 2016 earthquakes could n't do -- destroy a top surfing spot on the upper South Island 's east coast -- might be achieved , ironically , in the name of the post-quake rebuild . <p> Emergency powers have been used to push through plans for a parking area and coastal path , protected by a sea wall , at Mangamaunu , just north of Kaikoura . The Transport Agency and KiwiRail say the work 's being done for safety , to improve access to the break and protect the yet-to-be-built path from erosion . <p> Conservation Minister Eugenie Sage raised concerns last month , saying in a submission that any work should " avoid impacts on the nationally significant surfbreaks at Mangamaunu " , which is protected under the New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement . <p> Nevertheless , consents for paving and armouring a coastline were granted last week by the district and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parliamentary Order In Council -- which expired last week -- put in place to speed up the rebuild of quake-hit infrastructure , like roads and rail lines . ( Importantly , using quake powers limits public notification and potential appeals . ) <p> Surfers , usually a laid-back bunch , are seething . A group called the Surfbreak Protection Society is considering legal action to stop the work , and is in the throes of launching a Givealittle campaign . <p> Surfbreak 's president Paul Shanks , of Whangamata , in the Coromandel , notes Mangamaunu featured in a special NZ Post stamp issue featuring five of the country 's prime surfing breaks last year . The issue proudly states Mangamaunu survived the 2016 quakes , and " waves still peel down the point for over 300 metres and new surf breaks have been formed " . <p> Shanks told Newsroom : " A New Zealand stamp collection has a picture of Mangamaunu on it , peeling in its grandeur , and these people from road and rail want to take it out . It 's part of the scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decimate . It 's absurd . It 's sad . " <p> How can a surfing break be broken up ? <p> Surfbreak 's research and communications officer Michael Gunson , of Auckland , says placing a large , monolithic structure on a beach interferes with sediment movement . As a sea wall does n't move , wave action can scour out areas of the foreshore and seabed , which , in turn , changes the shape of waves . Surfbreaks are sensitive to manmade features , Gunson says . <p> " Once you lose a naturally formed surfbreak , it 's almost impossible to get it back . " <p> A boat ramp and breakwater built in the late 1960s at Manu Bay , at the entrance to Raglan beach , has affected the surfing break there . And poor land-use decisions have caused problems at Christchurch 's Scarborough beach and St Clair beach in Dunedin . <p> Beyond the potential effects , Gunson says the proposed works at Mangamaunu are a misuse of emergency powers . That stretch of road was n't damaged by the quake , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So who 's asking for the work to be done ? <p> The proposed works are part of a package of what the Transport Agency calls " minor adjustments " stretching from Mangamaunu to Okiwi Bay . <p> The agency 's earthquake recovery manager Tim Crow was n't available for an interview yesterday . But in an emailed statement , he said the Mangamaunu plans will " significantly enhance " safety and amenity . At present , surfers park at an informal layby and have to cross State Highway 1 and rail lines to reach the beach . <p> KiwiRail 's general manager of strategic projects Walter Rushbrook takes this point of a " longstanding safety issue " , saying : : " We have had anecdotal reports of surfers being observed sitting on deckchairs on the tracks watching the beach . " <p> Crow says coastal works at Mangamaunu will be set back 5 metres from the mean high water spring mark and NZTA is working with coastal experts to minimise any effects on the coastal edge and surrounding area . " There is not anticipated to be any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> However , scientists have differing opinions on the effect of a new , sloping rock revetment , built on the upper beach to protect the new cycling and pedestrian path . <p> Scientific face-off <p> NZTA 's coastal engineer Richard Reinen-Hamill , of consultancy Tonkin + Taylor , said the revetment will reflect " slightly more energy " than the existing cobble beach . He concludes any small increase in wave reflection during significant storms " is not anticipated to result in adverse effects " at Mangamaunu . <p> Not so , says Surfbreak 's consultant Dr Shaw Mead , the managing director of Raglan-based eCoast . Mead says any " works " would have to be 2.5m to 3m above mean high water spring tides to avoid potential problems . He notes the buried foundations of the revetment would be below the low tide water mark . <p> ( NZTA 's Crow says because of the seabed 's uplift , the high tide mark at Mangamaunu is now where low tide used to be . ) <p> Mead predicts the works will cause problems for the renowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of erosion holes and rips unknown " . <p> Many other concerns were raised from a handpicked group of submitters . An ecological assessment notes a permanent loss of potential breeding habitat for " variable oyster catcher and banded dotterel " . Ngai Tahu worried about the effect on two mataitai reserves , especially increased sedimentation affecting kaimoana . <p> " Is it little minnows like us that have to go out and stand up to protect New Zealand law , or should it be the minister ? I should imagine it would be the minister . " -- Paul Shanks <p> While their hands were tied in many respects , the councils were n't immune to the concerns raised . <p> Environment Canterbury has ordered KiwiRail to undertake a baseline assessment of the Mangamaunu surf break and a high-level assessment to ensure the detailed design of the cycle path and carpark and sea wall avoided adverse effects -- " to the extent practicable " . <p> Meanwhile , the Kaikoura District Council granted the consents but noted the " desired details are lacking " . Its decision , issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works provided does not enable a full understanding of what is proposed and why it is proposed . " <p> The plight of Mangamaunu made national headlines for a different reason last year . Quake rebuild alliance North Canterbury Transport Infrastructure Recovery dumped hundreds of metres of quake debris , up to eight metres high in places , along Mangamaunu beach . It was later removed . <p> Meanwhile , the controversy over these latest plans has forced authorities to drop a second carpark from its plans . It is unclear whether the remaining carpark will have toilets , because of cultural concerns . <p> What happens next in this surfing break saga may come down to Surfbreak 's legal advice ) and whether Conservation Minister Sage ( who could n't be reached for comment yesterday ) or any of her colleagues are willing or able to step in . <p> Surfbreak 's Shanks says his group has heard nothing from Sage 's office , other than a thank you letter , despite the looming potential destruction of a nationally significant surfing break . <p> " Is it little minnows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect New Zealand law , or should it be the minister ?

@@31663235 <h> Milk could be carbon-neutral now , says new study <p> By boosting how much maize cows eat , modestly reducing stock numbers , shrinking fertiliser use and buying carbon offsets , New Zealand milk could be carbon neutral today , according to a new study modelling changes to a typical Waikato dairy farm . <p> Researchers at AgResearch have calculated that a typical Waikato dairy farm could go carbon neutral now and still make a profit . <p> As a bonus , a farm that adopted the changes could also reduce nitrogen leaching by up to 42 percent , improving water quality . <p> Crucially , the farms profit could also increase , by 15 percent , after factoring in a premium paid by climate-conscious consumers . <p> The modelling , which was funded by the Our Land and Water National Science Challenge , reveals that making relatively small changes to existing farming practices could allow milk to be marketed as carbon neutral , while also improving water quality downstream -- an important consideration as regional councils and the Government move to impose stricter run-off limits . <p> However , there is one major caveat -- the exercise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be offset by buying carbon offsets . Actual emissions on the farm would be reduced by a maximum of 20 percent , with the rest counteracted using credits . While that makes the proposition attractive at today 's carbon prices of just $25 a tonne , the calculations will change when the price of carbon inevitably increases . <p> On the other hand , the exercise shows that comparatively modest changes to farming practices , such as feeding cows more maize , would enable farmers to market New Zealand milk as greenhouse-neutral -- so long as they could find the rights sales and marketing channel to capture a premium price . <p> AgResearch senior scientist Gina Lucci , the senior author of the study , says the researchers deliberately avoided suggesting large-scale changes such as hugely slashing milk production volumes or retiring big swathes of land from use . " We did n't want to come up with things that nobody would actually do , we tried to operate within the constraints of a realistic situation because we wanted this to be applicable and not a blue sky exercise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cows ? ' , " she says . <p> AgResearch senior scientist Gina Lucci . Photo : Supplied <p> The researchers took the workings of a typical Waikato dairy farm -- including the average number of cows , what they ate , the fertiliser used and other inputs -- and entered them into a model to calculate the milk 's greenhouse gas footprint . They then tweaked farming practices to reduce emissions as much as practicable , before adding the cost of offsetting the remaining emissions to calculate an overall profit . <p> The researchers came up with three scenarios : two in which milk production volumes remained close to today 's conventional farms , but with tweaks to fertiliser use and the cows ' food , as well as a third scenario in which the farm reduced its stocking rate and and shrunk the amount of feed being purchased . <p> In the third scenario , the farm 's milk production shrank by 9 percent , although the individual cows were more productive , with each one making 8 percent more milk . The third scenario was the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the biggest boost to profit ( an estimated 15 percent increase ) . <p> The economic analysis was done by Wei Yang , an economics lecturer at Lincoln University , who calculated how much more consumers would be willing to pay for dairy products with " feel-good " qualities related to the environment and animal welfare , based on previous studies . After combining the results of 32 different studies on consumers ' willingness to pay , the study factored in that overseas customers would pay around a quarter more for environmentally-friendly dairy products . <p> The third option , with lower stock and less feed required for cattle , was found to be the best-case scenario by the researchers , because it reduced greenhouse gases from the farm by up to 20 percent and shrunk nitrogen leaking by up to 42 percent . Nitrogen leaching is a problem for waterways and also a greenhouse contributor , because when excess nitrogen in cow urine falls on paddocks , microbes convert some of it to a powerful greenhouse gas , nitrous oxide . <p> From the perspective of the farmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed cows -- with maize rising to up to 30 percent of the animals ' diets . Maize is lower in nitrogen , says Lucci , so increasing cows ' maize intake reduced nitrogen excretion , with potential benefits for water quality and the climate . <p> Increasing maize intake also allowed the hypothetical carbon neutral farm to stop using nitrogen fertiliser on the pasture , because maize replaced the extra pasture growth that would have resulted from fertiliser use . The cows could keep getting the same energy intake . Their stocking rate was reduced by 17 percent to 2.4 cows per hectare , increasing milk production from each cow by an estimated 8 percent . <p> The researchers ' model incorporated some of the important inputs from off the farm , including the greenhouse gas produced by growing maize on a different property . <p> Also counted was the cost of paying for carbon-neutral certification through an independent scheme . <p> Not every environmental aspect of the milk-making system could be counted , however . While the team included the greenhouse footprint of growing the maize off-farm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maize in their estimates of nitrogen leaching . However , Lucci says any nitrogen leaching from growing the maize offsite would not negate the overall benefits to waterways from switching to feeding more maize to cows . <p> She says she was surprised by the scale of the benefits to water . " Even if you are just focusing on carbon emissions , you get benefits from nitrogen ( leaching ) as well , " says Lucci . " There are dual benefits there . " <p> Other aspects of the milk sales and processing chain would need to be in place to allow farmers to sell and market carbon neutral milk for a premium , Lucci acknowledged . <p> Danoneannounced in July it is investing $40m in building a wood-powered , carbon-neutral milk processing facility in Balclutha and Fonterra has also announced goals to shrink its carbon footprint . <p> By 2024 , New Zealand farmers will be required to report their livestock emissions and start to reduce them , under an agreement between the agriculture industry and the government . <p> AgResearch described the results from its modelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " rip off the band aid " by going carbon neutral sooner rather than later . <p> Newsroom has repeatedly broken big , important national news stories and established a platform for quality journalism on issues ranging from climate change , sexual harassment and bullying through to science , foreign affairs , women 's sports and politics . <p> But we need your support to continue , whether it is great , small , ongoing or a one-off donation .

@@31665237 <h> Asia IT market feels effect of US slump <p> Recurring news of further deterioration to the outlook of the U.S. economy has raised concern over the potential impact on the stability of the IT market in the Asia/Pacific region , including Japan ( APJ ) . In a review of the most recent economic indicators , current IT forecasts , and the economic linkage of APJ and US economies , IDC developed two scenarios of worsening US economic outlook for lead factors associated with IT expenditure . In the first scenario , IDC 's research depicted a moderate 1.7 percent and 0.9 percent erosion of its current forecast APJ IT market growth for 2008 and 2009 , respectfully , should the U.S. conditions worsen . In dollar terms , this means US$4.8 billion and US$7.5 billion less market potential in 2008 and 2009 . <p> " Even with a slightly less optimistic outlook depicted in our preliminary IT market forecasts , a further slide in the US outlook will have noted impact on the APJ IT Markets " , said Gary Koch , associate vice president of IDC 's Asia/Pacific IT spending research . <p> IDC 's research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. economy would result in a stronger influence on the business outlook in the APJ economies and would result in as much as US$7.9 billion and US$13.6 billion slashed from IDC 's current APJ IT market forecast in 2008 and 2009 . This would push the already very moderate growth rates of IT markets in Korea and Taiwan into negative territory for 2008 . While the decline in absolute dollars within IDC 's projections are substantial in markets like China and India , the sheer size of these markets diminishes the resulting impact on their growth rates . Therefore , the APJ regional IT market will still boast moderate growth in both 2008 and 2009 , 3.1 percent and 5.5 percent respectively . <h> Microsites <h> Featured <h> Slideshows <h> Reseller News Platinum Club celebrates leading partners in 2019 <p> The leading players of the New Zealand channel came together to celebrate a year of achievement at the annual Reseller News Platinum Club lunch in Auckland .

@@31714233 <h> Abundant irrefutable evidence -- bring Israel to account ! <p> February saw a massive increase in the number of Gaza ceasefire violations by Palestinian Resistance fighters . In comparison with January , which saw seven such violations , there were 51 attacks in February , one of which directly targeted the Israeli military . Zionist Israel uses these Palestinian missile-firings as justification for its blockade , periodic blitzes and daily economic and agricultural sabotage of the Gaza Strip . It would have us believe that its aggression and population-control over Gaza is simply a response to Palestinian violence . The reality , however , is the exact opposite . <p> The number of Israeli ceasefire violations in February totalled 162 and , while the total number of Palestinian ceasefire violations for the year ( even up to and including 6 March ) was just 58 -- that number was overwhelmed by the unleashing of no less than 320 Israeli Gaza ceasefire violations over the same period . The first Palestinian ceasefire violation for the year occurred on 15 January , following the 37th Israeli ceasefire violation . During January and February in Gaza , four people , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Israel claims that its deadly aggression is to defend its borders but , in truth , it is defenceless Gaza that has its borders constantly violated by Israeli armed incursions , air strikes and spying by Israeli drones . Israeli forces come and go as they please into Gaza and onto its territorial waters , while politicians and the mainstream news media remain silent . <p> While retaliatory Palestinian missile-firings afford Israel a valuable propaganda resource , it should be remembered that resistance to foreign domination is , nevertheless , recognised in international law . In any society , expressions of outrage will vary . Those Palestinians who resort to missile-firing may have lost loved ones , homes or their means of income . It is their way of reminding the world that the Palestinian people are still there , even though the mainstream news media ignores their plight and Israel wishes them out ! In some cases , Palestinian Resistance fighters do take on the Israeli military directly -- which is their right . In the Second World War , organisations such as the French Resistance were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest level . <p> Keeping score -- for Israeli snipers , shooting protesters is sport <p> Earlier this month , a Golani infantry brigade sniper told a Haaretz correspondent " I kept the casing of every round I fired , " he says .

Competitiveness is the only way to describe the driving force behind the inhumanity . The sniper ( referred to simply as Eden ) informsus they were told that nobody could outdo one sniper in particular who had , until then , scored a total of eleven hits to the knee . He proudly boasted thatsubsequently he " . . . brought in seven to eight knees in one day . Within a few hours , I almost broke his record .

Eden explained : " In the end you want to leave with the feeling that you did something , that you were n't a sniper during exercises only . So , after I had a few hits , I suggested to him that we switch . He got around 28 knees there , I 'd say .

Palestinian residents were forced away from the area . During Purim , Israel 's population-control measures are tightened to the extreme . Palestinians living along the route of the march are not even allowed to open the doors of their homes . <p> At every level , the Zionist mind dismisses Palestinian humanity , identity and history . Zionists almost always refer to Palestinians as ' Arabs ' , not as Palestinians .

But by calling Palestinians ' Arabs ' the Zionists lose their way because , by doing so , they also give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Semitic language-speakers . <p> Palestinians can not be expected to fight all this on their own . Great power interests placed them in this dreadful situation -- and it is in the vital interest of all humanity that we restore and uphold respect for justice and international law . A UN Independent Commission of Inquiry bears witness to the fact that Israeli forces intentionally shoot children , paramedics and news reporters in Gaza . While powerful Security Council members , such as the US and the UK , do everything in their power to cover and give support for Israel , when it comes to hard questions concerning Israel 's violations of international law , the UK , at least , can not avoid telling the truth . For example , in the UK Parliament a written question , HL2108 , asked Her Majesty 's Government , regarding a statement by the Minister for the Middle East and North Africa on 24 February about Israel 's intention to construct 1,077 housing units in Givat Hamatos , in southern Jerusalem . On 2 March , the UK Foreign and Commonwealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announcement to move forward with the construction of 1,077 housing units in Givat Hamatos . Settlement construction in these highly sensitive areas undermines the viability of a future Palestinian state with its capital in East Jerusalem . <p> " It is the UK 's longstanding position that settlements are illegal under international law and threaten the physical viability of the two-state solution . We urge Israel to reverse this latest decision and halt its settlement expansion . " <p> In another question , HL2104 , Baroness Tonge asked the UK Government to announce what representations they intend to make to the government of Israel about the reported ( 1 ) expulsion of students from , and ( 2 ) confiscation of , a container classroom in Susya , Palestine . The Foreign and Commonwealth Office response to this was : <p> " While we have not made representations on this specific issue , officials from our Embassy in Tel Aviv raised the increase in demolitions with the Israeli authorities on 17 December 2019 . The practice of confiscations and demolitions causes unnecessary suffering to ordinary Palestinians and is harmful to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Palestinian leadership to avoid actions that make it more difficult to achieve a culture of peaceful coexistence and a negotiated solution to the conflict . We have also stressed the importance of the Israel security forces providing appropriate protection to the Palestinian civilian population , in particular the need to protect children . Under international humanitarian law , an occupying power has an obligation to facilitate the proper working of all institutions devoted to the care and education of children , with the cooperation of national and local authorities . " <p> With the US refusing to recognise any consideration of international law that might hinder the progress of the Zionist enterprise , how much longer can it be before the UK Government eventually succumbs to the powerful Israel Lobby ? The world community has a duty to uphold the myriad UN Security Council and General Assembly Resolutions ( including the tragically hard-won Fourth Geneva Convention ) that Israel so wantonly violates . There are very many movements around the world , in Israel itself as well as Palestine , dedicated to defending the Palestinian people . Many Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commits in their names . <p> On 20 December 2019 , the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) , Fatou Bensouda , announced that there were reasonable grounds to believe that war crimes have been , or are being , committed in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and elected to seek a ruling from the ICC to confirm her position regarding the court 's jurisdiction . Israel 's Attorney General AG response , according to the Israeli human rights group , B'Tselem , " supports everything the ICC is not meant to be in order to stop it from doing what it is meant to do . " B'Tselem says : " It is important to expose the absurdity of the AG 's claims , which are based on intentional misquotation , disregard for international law and an extreme misrepresentation of reality .

The money is desperately needed to increase the authority 's ability to combat the disease . <p> About 400,000 Palestinian workers from the West Bank travel to Israel daily and pose a serious risk of carrying an infection back from Israel , according to Melhim . <p> Israel announced on Monday its total coronavirus infections climbed to 277 confirmed cases . <p> He also said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besieged Gaza Strip , which has the potential for a devastating contagion because of Palestinians who travel to Egypt or work in Israel and end up coming back infected . <p> " We are fighting on two fronts : one against the pandemic and the other against Israel 's brutal military occupation , " he said . <p> Melhim said the Israeli army and the illegal Jewish settlers " still mount constant closures , incursions and attacks against civilians , which complicate our efforts in combating the pandemic " .

@@31732231 <h> The Only Way Through This Crisis Is Together <p> THE COALITION GOVERNMENT 'S greatest political challenge over the next 6-12 months will be keeping up morale . If it fails to hold the nation together , then it will be swept out of office on a tsunami of fear , anger and recrimination . <p> Only a very small number of New Zealanders can draw upon historical experience to help them through the unfolding Covid-19 crisis . Assuming people 's coherent memories kick in from around the age of 7 , to recall the onset of the Great Depression in 1929 you would need to have been born in 1922 -- making you 98 ! To have clear memories of the outbreak of the World War II , in September 1939 , you would need to be 88 . Most of us have never experienced anything like the present crisis . If our morale is not to crumble in the face of mass illness , a rising death toll , and something pretty close to economic collapse , then the Government will have to box very clever indeed . <p> It is , therefore , to be hoped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefed by scientists , physicians and senior civil-servants , call upon the services of New Zealand 's historians -- especially those with knowledge of " The Home Front " during World War II . The Government needs to know how this country kept up its morale during six long years of war . Especially important to understand , is how we coped with the first three years of the war -- when nearly all the news was bad . What prevented us from falling to pieces when the Germans and the Japanese were winning on just about every front ? <p> Critical to the maintenance of public morale was the near complete control exercised by the wartime government over information and the means of communicating it . The daily newspapers , radio broadcasts , cinema newsreels -- even private letters -- were strictly censored . The Government 's key objective was to ensure that every citizen received the same information about the war . <p> While no government can prevent people spreading rumours and speculation , the state does have the power to punish those responsible . During World War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ despondency " faced harsh penalties . To be convicted of attempting to undermine the government and/or the war effort , or , even worse , give " aid and comfort to the enemy " -- i.e. commit treason -- could mean execution . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> There can be little doubt that had the Internet existed in 1940 , one of the first things the Labour Party leader and wartime prime minister , Peter Fraser , would have done is bring it under strict state control . Inevitably , Jacinda Ardern will have been briefed by the Security Intelligence Service ( SIS ) and the Government Communications Security Bureau ( GCSB ) on the practicalities of controlling the Internet , should the situation deteriorate to the point where such action becomes necessary . If that sounds fanciful , just consider the fact that in 2019 , governments around the world shut down the Internet on nearly 200 occasions . Given the Internet 's crucial economic role , the NZ Government would be loath to take such a drastic step . But , if fake news was inciting major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the banks ; or massive and prolonged panic buying ; Jacinda and her colleagues would be left with little choice . <p> Controlling the crisis " narrative " , however , is just the start . Keeping up public morale is best achieved by encouraging all citizens to " do their bit " for victory . In the present circumstances , " doing our bit " might involve joining neighbourhood units dedicated to assisting the elderly and those in " self-isolation " with food and medicine deliveries . Such groups could also serve as the Government 's " eyes and ears " : reporting possible new cases of infection and enforcing the quarantine . " Doing our bit " might also involve working in the " instant factories " set up to manufacture protective masks and clothing , and construct additional ICU facilities .

Clearly , the suffering and dangers endured by New Zealand 's soldiers , sailors and airmen in direct conflict with the enemy could not be shared by everyone , but just about everyone contributed something to the war effort .

Most Kiwis alive today have had no opportunity to prove their mettle in the way their parents and grandparents did during the global struggle against fascism . In the weeks and months to come , Jacinda 's Government must do everything it can to ensure that we are given our chance . <p> A top-down , government-knows-best approach will not secure the public " buy-in " crucial to keeping the people of this country together .

Count on it . <h> 43 COMMENTS <p> Well everyone knows I enjoy what Chris Trotter has to say . The world has been an interesting place these last few weeks with Wuhan virus and the world got cancelled and surprisingly the woke did n't do it . Or so we are told . <p> But seriously corona virus is all that 's going on right now and there are millions of people out there claiming expertise and no one has a fucking clue . <p> Corona is a very dangerous virus so it is critical that every one gets the information they need to keep themselves safe and while The Director of Public Health in NZ may have his complicated graphs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like The Spin Off may have its fancy opinions and complete lack of self awareness , we have our ridiculous analogies and Chris Trotters analysis which is why I 'm going to talk a bit about this blog and how we might learn about how to deal with the corona virus . <p> The first lesson is that people should not play with nature incautiously . I would imagine peoples minds would think about humanity inadvertently creating dangerous weapons and things that can kill us but it 's a bit more simplistic when it comes to covid19 . <p> The Chinese Government was not carful in its regulation of wildlife farming thus Chinese wet markets are infected with dangerous bacteria and viruses that can mutate and infect humans which we saw with the Seafood Market in Wuhan China the most probable geological Genesis for the disease . As it turned out we do n't need white male patriarchy to devastate humanity . <p> Human curiosity ingenuity is what makes us special but while such traits are important to society they also at times threaten the survival of the human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Chinese government knew what science had to say about the dangers of Chinese wet markets after all the 2003 SARS epidemic most likely started in a Chinese wet market . Despite a temporary ban on Chinese wet markets business mostly went back to normal soon after because Chinese wildlife farming industry is very powerful and influential . So these wildlife farmers became incautious with nature and thus covid19 jumped from animals to humans . <p> The next lesson we can take away from Chris 's blog is that in times of pandemic human cooperation is vital . Obviously the take away is in times of crises terrible things can happen from miscommunication or lack of communication . <p> According to various media outlets being held back important information about the Wuhan virus for months the consequences being the world is much less prepared for the outbreak costing possibly thousands of more lives than necessary and further more America and China is fermenting blame by casting doubt on each other . Trump says China is to blame and Beijing peddles conspiracy theories that the U.S government spread the disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virus spiralling out of control what we need to do right now is all play on team human so that nothing worse happens during the course of this viruses spread . Relating to this lesson is that strong leadership is essential to beating this virus . <p> Following the outbreak of corona virus the woke mainstream right wingers did n't think it was real and began running counter narratives that in my opinion it was a poor decision on behalf of Chinese leaders that kept everyone in the dark . Leaders who are more open could have possibly delayed the spread and potentially saved thousands of lives . Just the same in New Zealand we have to hope and pray that our leaders make the right decisions in times of crises . <p> So to all those out there showing pride in your Democratic Party of choice I would say choice your leaders carefully because even though all options might seem to suck sometimes in a crises you at least want the best person in charge . <p> Its the Covid-19 virus Sam , , , , , Only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil virus , , , and he has his reasons , , , , https : //youtu.be/JrLnB4dyn0 <p> Serious or helpful people call it Coronavirus or Covid19 , , , and there is good information with practical advice out there .

Closing our borders was a first . Jacinda Ardern made the announcement during the 6pm News .... but <p> There was a buzz around the Beehive yesterday ( pardon the pun ) that a significant unprecedented announcement was about to be made about closing the borders . The usual leaks would be in play . What does the latrine Rodent Slymon Bwidges do ? Not for the first time attempts to steal the Government 's thunder as he did with the 2019 Budget announcement . He went to reporter Henry Cooke just prior to 5pm with his " scoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a cynical move to not only steal some of the spotlight which he craves like a drug addict craves their next fix , but he more importantly wanted to create the impression that he was a genius and extremely insightful . When Ardern made the announcement , it would " appear " she had either taken advice from Bridges or followed his lead . <p> This type of disgraceful politics is to be expected from Slymon at exactly the time he should shut his entitled creepy mouth and let the Government govern . <p> Well let me say this if you look at the preferred Prime Minister polling Simon Bridges is only just ahead of Judith Collins so I 'm not sure where this criticism from Mr Simon Bridges of Jacinda Ardern 's leadership comes from . <p> It 's a funny old thing where Simon Bridges has been put in a privileged position where I personally believe he should n't be in but he 's been put in this position as crises hits the Coalition government Bridges gets more and more brave and you got to recognise that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't perhaps remember all the political history of what 's happened in New Zealand especially what happened with Mr Simon Bridges and illegal spying of oil and gas exploration protesters .

For sure business is important to the economy but let 's not get to cocky about our position and I 'm not sure if Simon reads The Daily Blog or looks at the preferred Prime Ministers polling but I would be very carful Mr Bridges . <p> I call it as I see it .

These were unprecedented very personal attacks to express their hatred and contempt . <p> Same trolls celebrated and laughed when Ardern 's pet cat was run over and killed outside her family home . Who does that ? <p> Same trolls repeatedly attacked her marital status and routinely described Ardern 's beautiful baby daughter as a " bastard " .

They set the tone for their army of online trolls who happily follow that lead . Reasoning with such people is futile . I learned that two years ago . Funnily enough , I did n't notice your name calling out the reprehensible vile attacks on Ardern ...... but you 're happy to throw your fluff when someone highlights the disgraceful conduct of ..... whatshisface . <p> Jacindafan -- Do n't forget that Simon Bridge 's own wife boasted that he was a dirty little street fighter .

A couple of things stand out . First , state censorship was unjustified then and is unacceptable to us now . Second , the New Zealand government policy of following the British lead which took New Zealand into the Second World War has already cost this country dearly in the effort to contain Covid-19 . The progress of the disease in China has shown that Covid-19 can be contained and suppressed , and geographically New Zealand is better positioned than most countries to avert an epidemic -- if its government can finally come to the realization that it is highly inappropriate to follow every twist and turn in Boris Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state ideology of laissez-faire neo-liberalism must be abandoned if the epidemic is to be cut short and lives saved . Lastly , I note that Jacinda seems to have taken your advice that left-wing governments sometimes need to conceal their true agenda from the masses . In that I believe that both she and you are very , very wrong . <p> During WWII the government encouraged local cinemas e.g some were built in more rural areas .

@@31737232 <p> It might be 2 years from the election , but the Labour party is making its pitch for the 2017 elections now . Since becoming Labour Leader , Andrew Little has made a consistent appeal to a very specific demographic within New Zealand . Understanding who is Labour 's target audience helps to define what progressives can expect from the Labour opposition under Little , and from a future Labour government . Contrary to expectations , Labour is not singing its tune to disillusioned progressives or the union movement . It 's not even aimed at the wavering national voters in ' middle new zealand ' . <p> The core of Labour 's pitch is to New Zealand 's rich and powerful . <p> Labour 's 2014/5 review 1 <p> In the first instance , we should take the Labour Party 's word for it . In the wake of the unsuccessful 2014 election the Labour Party commissioned a review to avoid such failure again , which was later leaked . Its results are telling . Organisationally the reviews recommendations seek to undermine the participation of ordinary members . Instead of an organisational turn to strengthening its base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to big businesses . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> According to the review , party branches should no longer have a formal space within the party organisation . Instead , Local Electorate Committee 's , or LEC 's , would be the party 's primary local entity . These committees , instead of being open to membership as in a branch , are restricted to 12-15 members . On top of this , these LEC 's can only develop local strategies in line with that developed by national executive and delivered by regional ' Hubs ' . These Hub 's replace regional councils , and the recommendations suggest are responsible to the national executive , rather than local party members . By themselves these reforms disenfranchise local members , but are only a turn to centralisation . The reality of the big business approach of labour is shown elsewhere . <p> The ' policy ' section of the report is brief and vague . Whilst saying that the Labour party must ' respond to ' growing inequality , the party commits itself to being pro-business ( although it also says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and medium ' business in particular ) . More interesting is the section 1D on fundraising . The recommendation reads : <p> Labour must build greater confidence in its ability to win and to form a successful government , and -- in addition to building its database of online donors -- it must use high-level business and other contacts , supported by a strengthened group of professional fundraisers on the staff team , in approaching the corporate sector and other potential sources of funding for donations . <p> Central to the Labour Party leadership 's strategy for the future is big money . Rather than trying to strengthen the capacity of its membership and organisation , or reaching out to its traditional base in the union movement , the Labour Party is turning to the big end of town . And , as the saying goes , you do n't get money for nothing . <p> Understanding Labour 's business pitch : Housing <p> At a glance , Labour 's messaging under Andrew Little seems less than consistent . After winning the Labour leadership , Andrew Little first called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gains tax2 . Then in April 2015 he called for a crackdown on ' speculators ' by forcing tighter controls on lending3 . Finally , Labour created controversy by releasing data on ' chinese ' home buyers and calling for controls on foreign home ownership . <p> On the surface , this seems like a series of puzzling twists with Little pitching first to the right , then to the left , and then to the racists . Taking a closer look at the policy suggestions of Andrew Little shows a fundamental consistency , a pitch to the wealthiest New Zealanders . <p> To find the beneficiaries of the Auckland housing price boom you only need look as far as the National Buisness Review 's annual Rich List . The Rich List is a fairly comprehensive list of New Zealand 's wealthiest individuals and families . The 2015 Rich List includes 180 individuals or families with a net worth of over 50 million dollars . Of those 180 , at least 53 are listed as making their wealth from ' property , ' real estate ' or ' housing ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Labour Party is attempting to woo to finance their future campaigns . And each of Andrew Little 's announcements would benefit these 53 property barons , at the expense of working New Zealanders . <p> In the first instance , Andrew Little spoke in favour of dropping the Labour Party 's existing policy for a capital gains tax . Such a tax on those that sell homes for a profit would clearly benefit working class people in Aotearoa . A portion of the profit from property speculation would go into government hands rather than to wealthy individuals , and this could be reinvested into public housing or social services . Dropping the capital gains tax keeps this money firmly in the hands of property developers . To appeal to New Zealand 's elite , dropping the tax is an obvious first step . <p> Less obviously pro-business was Little 's call to crack down on speculators . On rhetorical , it appears he is taking aim at the rich speculating on housing and driving up prices for everyone else . The devil is in the detail . Little calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lending " . Large investors would be unaffected by these changes , they already have the capital to invest , or assets to borrow against and therefore could meet higher ratios . However , this would place limitations on small time speculators , who borrow heavily from the bank and gamble on raising house prices to flip homes for a profit In practice , such a policy would actually increase the strength of large property developers , as it would place significant hurdles in the way of smaller competition . In practice this is n't cracking down on speculators , but allows large capitalists a greater share of the market . <p> And finally there was the ' Chinese last names ' debacle . This was widely seen ( and condemned ) as a ' dog whistle ' to racist undercurrents in New Zealand society . The policies public presentation was aimed at placing the cause of housing at the feet of foreigners but when placed into the Labour Party 's strategic vision it looks differently . Again , the Rich List is instructive . The problem of housing affordability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money from overseas . Primarily , housing prices have been driven up by local investors . Controls on foreign buyers- again- would not solve the underlying causes for the housing problem and would just strengthen the hand of local capital against their international competitors . For the Labour party , appeal with xenophobe voters was an merely an added bonus . <p> A disaster for the left , or an open road ? <p> This may be depressing reading for Labour Party true believers . Not only has the party leadership fallen in behind a strategy that focusses on the needs of business , the party review recommends undermining the capacity for the membership to be involved and counter these tendencies . Any semblance of hope for a left turn within the Labour party should have been seriously questioned after Andrew Little 's comments on July 17 . He spoke against Labour Policy and promised to keep 90 day trial periods5. 90 trial periods remove undermine worker 's rights by removing protections from unfair dismissal at work . If in opposition a Labour leader ca n't stick to Union principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be confident that this party would advance working people in government . <p> But there is a more optimistic reading of the situation . <p> Understanding and accepting that the Labour Party is wedded to a strategy of working for " high-level business " also means that there is space to build an alternative . For the non-labour left in the Union movement , it can be expected that the Labour party under Andrew Little will continue to seek the support of business donors ahead of the unions . While initially disheartening for some , it does mean that the space for those pushing for a more independent political stance in the Union Movement can expect greater hearing . Alternatives may take time to materialise , but accepting that the Labour party has gone down a different strategic path opens the door for that disscussion . <p> For the Greens , this should mean clear space to grow their organisational base amongst progressive sectors of Aotearoa . A Labour strategically orientating to the business table should leave space for the greens to grow and solidify their position as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with less effective competition than ever before . ( Whether or not the Greens take this road is to be seen ) . <p> There still needs to be a political organisation to represent and fight for progressive change in Aotearoa . The Labour Party 's embrace of business at the expense of working people shows definitively that it is not the organisation capable in leading this fight . But in its place , new organisations can be built , and by learning the lessons of the Labour Party 's embrace of the wealthy , the left can build political organisation that wont make the same mistakes . <h> 12 COMMENTS <p> led by/riddled with blairites/clarkists .. the ( still ! ) neoliberal nz labour party is being led in the wrong direction by the wrong people .. <p> .. and is totally on the wrong side of history ... <p> , , ( and those doing it hard would have been no better off had labour won the last election .. <p> .. they promised s.f.a . for those doing it hardest .. no rise in benefits .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this at a time when both sanders and corbyn are showing them the blueprint to gain real popular support .. but these **28;107;TOOLONG careerists in nz labour do n't give a flying fuck about any of that .. <p> .. clinging to their roles/positions in that rotting/decaying-carcass of a political party is more important to them .. <p> what to do .. ? .. <p> .. the only suggestion i have is for young people/those wanting real change to do what the british are doing .. joining the labour party in droves .. to demand their voices are heard .. and to support/force change back to new old-labour ... <p> .. and to those who say : ..

Therefore , we do n't trust Labour and we have no confidence in them . <p> Ben was highlighting how Labour can only get trust and confidence if they have get some guts and represent their core values . Policies are important because voters are n't idiots and policies are inextricably tied to trust and confidence ... that 's why the business class do not trust Labour !

At best it will get another Labour PM , but the cost will be a shift the political centre to the right , again . That 's the best we can expect from Little ; Labour can get their hands on the levers of power but they will be driving us down the same neoliberal dead-end . <p> Meanwhile , as Phillip Ure points out in the first comment , Jeremy Corbyn and Bernie Sanders show the sort of groundswell of optimism that can emerge when the rhetoric matches the proposed policies ( even though the Democrats &amp; UK Labour are parties that have lost the trust and confidence of their base ) .

But your claim that Labour is trying to lock small-scale speculators out of the market for the benefit of large-scale ones does not stack up . Those at the top have the resources to buy up property as they please . Demand is not a problem for them , it is the prize . The presence of small-scale speculators adds to the demand of the large-scale , and actual owner-occupants , pushing up the prices . Despite its many flaws , microeconomics reliably shows us that impacts at the margin ( in this case , small-scale speculators ) can have considerable effects on equilibrium ( speculators capital gain ) in supply/demand models . By locking out small-scale speculators , the bigger ones will receive diminishing returns on their investments due to the reduced demand .

He was known to be mentally impaired after his tours of duty and was still able to access firearms and ammunition . <p> America is awash with veterans of past and present military engagements , and there is a considerable proportion with psychological difficulties -- as there is in Britain also . <p> And the support when they get back is less than good enough . <p> Trump 's political party is definitely going to make this worse if they scuttle Obamacare .

But , even knowing that ( and they do ) , it wo n't stop those humiliating ' security ' checks and intrusions at airports and border checkpoints . <p> I think the fact that he had mental health issues is the reason for silence on the matter . Trump said during his campaign that he would support veterens , although he did n't say how . To be honest they could n't be treated any worse than they are now , so something needs to change . Obamacare only helps those who have nothing . Otherwise , premiums have become unaffordable . <p> To be honest they could n't be treated any worse than they are now , so something needs to change . <p> Trump has no replacement for the Affordable Healthcare Act .

At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( if you 're living here , . as a NZ Citizen ) so it 's easy for you to deride Obama 's efforts to provide healthcare to millions who never had insurance cover previously . <p> As others have pointed out , Trump has not suggested one single alternative to the Affordable Healthcare Act . As a result , Americans will die for want of medical care . <p> Air Canada sent a Tweet saying he was not on the Passenger list , Crisis Cast ( INC ) were cerytainly a busy bunch , how lucky it was there was so many ' brave ' Camera men already filming on the Scene before it happened &amp; we are lucky to see so many school jogging teams running all around an airport ( Hollyweird conveniently ) that had allready been made safe within minutes as the ' gunman ' had been tacked after he ran out of bullets , what a coincidence an open carry bill had been scedualed beforehand to ariive just after the ( staged ) incident <p> The reason he got away with it was because Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Security Guards , off duty cops &amp; other Licenced to carry citizens were present -- he would have been stopped dead in his tracks ..... but we all know it was staged in time for the expiry &amp; review of the open carry laws in the local buildings such as airports ect -- convenient timing huh ? <p> On that logic , child poverty , domestic violence , high-level financial fraud , or the plague of suicide bombings in the Middle East should not be newsworthy . I 'd disagree with that logic completely , however . Of course they are , as are America 's mass shootings . It 's not about what you personally consider , it 's about the fundamental wellbeing of our species as a whole , and the detrimental effect all of these issues have upon it . If you wa n't to bury your head in the sand over one issue or another , that 's your business , but the rest of us might actually still want to be aware of those same issues . News is a collective information pool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Limiting access to guns will not stop terrorist acts in the USA . As shown in Europe , they will just use trucks &amp; bombs to do a similar amount of damage . " <p> Oh dear , another one who ca n't see the basic flaw in his argument ! <p> Andrew , they use trucks where guns are not readily available to anyone who walks into a shop and plonks $100 down onto a counter and points at an instrument of lethal destruction . <p> And if you want to stop all terrorist acts , maybe we should look at the causes of the cancer of terrorism . <p> For one thing , solve the Palestine-Israel problem . Secondly , the West ( especially the US ! ! ) should stop meddling in middle east affairs . And lastly , stop selling lethal weapons to autocratic governments that then use those same weapons against their own people ! ! <p> It 's worth noting that ' American ' gun laws or ' US gun culture ' are total misnomers . Barring certain federal laws which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bush I assault weapons ban ) , states decide for themselves how to legislate . New York is almost like Australia , California slightly stricter than NZ on some things , slightly more liberal than NZ on others , while in Idaho for instance you have open carry . It 's really a mixed bag . <p> Personally I think if you have an NZ-style system for obtaining a licence , and a proper police system for following up on licencing and licence conditions , then within those confines there 's mostly no problem . We have several tiers of licence which allow different firearms , firearm features , etc. to be owned . Proper background checks are made . Take the Jan Molenaar situation for instance ; his licence had been expired for years , but at no time did the police attempt to find out if he still had firearms in his possession . <p> Most of the US mass shootings would be avoided not by banning categories of firearm wholesale or banning certain features , but by simply having better licencing and background checks , along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got a felony record for firearms , you ca n't own one -- and that 's a federal condition which states ca n't override . Many such things can be done by a sensible US government without butchering the second amendment . <p> The NZ system works reasonably well . There are millions of guns in NZ yet very few incidents . If we wish to worry about personal safety we should sooner ban swimming pools . <p> Whilst the basic licencing system works well , the endorsements are a bit of a joke and in dire need of tidying up . The E endorsement ( for MSSA rifles ) is meaningless and was introduced as a sop to calm public fears after Aramoana .

@@31742236 <p> Hopefully the four weeks of Level 4 lockdown gives the Government enough time both to knock back the pandemic and adjust policy to help us through the coming economic turmoil , says Eric Crampton . Photo : Lynn Grieveson <h> Public policy prescriptions for a pandemic <p> Unless effective treatment for the novel coronavirus Covid-19 emerges quickly , the world faces not only misery but economic depression . New Zealand will be immune to neither . The normal economic uncertainties of a downturn will be compounded by the uncertainties of a pandemic , writes Eric Crampton of the NZ Initiative <p> The New Zealand Government 's Covid-19 policy needs to directly boost capabilities in the health sector while providing the kind of appropriate economic support necessary when we 're all taking a lengthy staycation and some industries are put on ice . <p> Uncertainty about the duration of this crisis makes deciding on the most suitable policy difficult . <p> Increasing the capacity of the health sector to deal with peaks in numbers of Covid cases is important to reduce mortality and morbidity rates . But nobody quite seems to know just where the binding constraints in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excellent contributions from Newsroom journalists , warn about substantial shortages in equipment and incredible pressure on staff , official statements have been far more sanguine . <p> If there really will be shortages of critical equipment in four to six weeks , potential suppliers should know that today . Quietly shoulder-tapping likely suppliers may partially solve the problem but wo n't provide the necessary scale of response . <p> Simply announcing a willingness to purchase equipment -- and the prices the Government is willing to pay -- would allow potential suppliers to identify themselves . Serious companies are n't likely to re-tool without the certainty of a contract . But they do need to know the demand exists and that they can get essential service status to do the job . <p> Rapid identification of equipment and skills necessary to boost capability in the medical system , combined with a wide call for assistance , would enable people and businesses to find ways to help . If the health system is not already doing so , it should be offloading less-significant tasks to helpers with limited training , to ease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of air cabin crew have been trained in first aid and will have plenty of time on their hands . With some rapid training , they may be able to ease some of the burden . <p> Additionally , the Government has asked retired health workers and health workers furloughed by the current lockdown to assist in Covid-response . It should also consider those foreign-trained medical professionals already in the country who have not yet been able to secure New Zealand medical registration . <p> Part of the cure for a pandemic is a sharp reduction in economic activities in areas not related either to pandemic response or critical areas like food supply . That 's why support for workers and firms is important . But the Government 's chosen wage subsidy scheme is not working well . Even if it can be extended to larger employers , it provides too little support to keep companies from laying off staff en masse . <p> The Initiative urges the Government to consider a version of Germany 's Short-Time Work support policy . That scheme allows firms to shift workers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top-up from the Government . That way , instead of laying off 80 percent of staff , a company could keep staff on 20 percent of their normal hours with little reduction in worker earnings . <p> This kind of scheme is better than either relying on benefits or starting up the sometimes-promoted universal basic income ( UBI ) . A speedy reboot of the economy when this is over matters . That is much harder to do when companies must rebuild hard-earned experience and skills from scratch . The Short-Time Work support policy maintains both workers ' incomes and their links to employers . It targets support to those workers whose hours are cut , rather than spreading support broadly to those far less affected . Simply put , it works better . <p> Some tax provisions can also be eased . Individuals and firms should be allowed to combine the 2020/21 tax years and temporarily suspend their PAYE collection and Kiwisaver contributions . This would immediately provide more cash in hand everyone . Companies staring down provisional tax assessments based on last year 's earnings could instead defer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could help reduce business ' fixed costs that otherwise might have compelled them to shut down . It could also cover Council rates bills for firms in financial distress , averting a major hit to the local government purse as well . And access to credit can be improved , especially over the longer term as wage support to employers may need to ease . <p> Finally , a modified version of the New Zealand Student Loan programme should be made available to non-students to help bridge any remaining income gaps . It has the advantage of having already set provisions for income-contingent repayment when the crisis passes . <p> But financial support is not the only way the Government can and should help . <p> Regulations that were no real barrier to getting things done in normal times can be insurmountable in a pandemic . For example , some airline pilots require time in simulators to maintain certification , but the necessary simulators are in Australia . In normal times , this just does n't much matter -- pilots can roster onto an Australia route when and as necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government ca n't be expected to identify every barrier proactively . It needs to rely on business to highlight the obstacles as they come up using lines of rapid communication with regulators who can suspend or modify them during this crisis . <p> And this is no time for policy or regulatory changes which are not related to the pandemic . The Reserve Bank and Commerce Commission have already postponed theirs . But Parliament 's Select Committees are still asking for submissions on non-urgent legislation . Does n't the Health Select Committee have better things to do than consider the regulatory framework for vaping ? Some legislation may be urgent enough to require submissions during the Level 4 alert , but everything else should be quarantined . <p> Obviously , the Government should borrow the funds it needs to do all this . But this will require maintaining a disciplined approach to any spending lines unrelated to the pandemic . Entrenching new ongoing commitments would complicate a return to prudent debt levels after the crisis and make it harder to borrow the funds necessary for responding to the pandemic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Government enough time both to knock back the pandemic and adjust policy to help us through the coming economic turmoil . We need to adopt more effective treatment . <p> Credible information is crucial in a crisis . <p> The pandemic is pushing us into an unknown and uncertain future .

@@31742237 <p> There is a quotation often attributed to Lenin , in which it is said that when it comes time to hang the capitalists -- they will fall over each other to attempt to sell their executioners the rope . <p> Now , I do not invoke this axiom to attempt to urge a death-sentence against this Texan . Going by his own words , he seems more than eager to initiate such a thing upon himself , in order to secure the delusory promise of a few days of scrounged together economic ' stabilization ' . <p> For that is all that would likely eventuate were America to turn upon the proverbial dime and ditch physical/social distancing and lockdown protocols to go back to " business as usual " ( as Trump appears now keen to do ) ... is n't even a temporary uptick in economic activity -- it 's just a brief arrest of the ongoing crisis-pandemic furthered decline . <p> Followed by an even more dramatic medium-to-long-term negative impact as the directly attributable result of heightened pressure upon their healthcare system and their workforce through illnesses , disorder , and deaths . <p> Some Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the malaise of a significant downturn in economic activity ( or even doing things differently when it comes to economic activity all up ) , that it is preferable to talk of quite literally " sacrificing " an entire generation in pursuit of its desperate avoidance . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> They love largely illusory money ( for that is , ultimately , what so much of their stock-market , with its one point five trillion dollar devouring snackatite , actually is ) , and are prepared to fight to the death to defend it . Human blood and human deaths , in exchange for filthy , filthy lucre . <p> To be fair and sure , Lt. Gov . Patrick deserves some minimal modicum of ' credit ' for being prepared to place himself -- rhetorically at least -- upon the chopping block . <p> And the issue is not his own willingness in principle to do something daft for his grand-children ; because there is something instinctual in the desire to protect one 's progeny and future lineage . <p> Dependent upon your personal ethical position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his endeavouring to force his personal choice in this matter upon every OTHER grandparent in the nation . <p> But for me , it is quite simple . Doing as these economic right-lemming kinds would wish , does not offer " sacrifice " in exchange for meaningful improvement in circumstances -- either for their own generation , or for ours . It shall not leave their country better off a week , three weeks , ten weeks , or twenty eight weeks later from now . <p> On the contrary , it shall almost certainly extend the misery . Because ' delayed gratification ' rather than degraded prefrontal cortex critical-thinking-child seeking pseudoconomic sugar-rush-'stimulus ' , is not how their minds appear to work in practice . <p> This , presumably , is a large part of how we seem to *keep* finding ourselves , every few years , crushed under the weight of " too big to fail " billion-dollar outfits and operators who ca n't seem to keep themselves ticking over between largely self-authored crises sans massive government intervention upon their behalf . A variable that requires no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! <p> And lest this seem like an anti-American beatup ... it is important to note that many Americans find all of the above absolutely and axiomatically abhorrent . And , perhaps more concerningly , that it is not only an American ' disease ' of the mind of which we are speaking . <p> It was just a week ago that the European Union 's leadership was speaking about the necessity of a balancing act between preventing deaths on the one hand ( assumedly also encompassing to a certain extent deaths particularly amidst the older and less wealthy or physically hearty -- you know , those for whom the capitalist mill has increasingly less use for as time goes on ... both their time in a personal sense , and the general time of the advancement of the economic epoch we presently endure ) ... and preserving " The Market " and its accompanying actions and profits on the other . <p> It may be undeniably true that on a long enough time-line , everybody 's survival rate drops to zero ... yet these kinds of " acceptable losses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to secure temporary reprieve for the stock-portfolios of the few , is not so much " natural selection " as it is " utterly inhuman " . <p> Perhaps , in the not too distant and nightmarishly , overbearingly close future , it may be possible for finance-capitalism to exist sans humans . It already seems to do largely well enough with just computers and the hive-like inhabitants of Wall Street , so some might suggest it 's endemically close enough . <p> Yet until that happens -- and , indeed *especially* should that happen , it makes no sense whatsoever to value dollars above lives in the manner these demons are proposing . <p> If there is to be a " sacrifice " , turn it around -- sacrifice a certain modicum of financier-cheque-book , to support the lives and the quality of lives of many ordinary and older people . <p> Except most peculiar , curious thing -- it never seems to get offered like that , does it . It 's always just the other way around . <h> 8 COMMENTS <p> Unfortunately its always someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make . These days money is a virtual concept . We could simply put the market on hold for 8 weeks and create pandemic money to keep the economy afloat . Then once we get over the hump simply press play again . Since it was a replacement for lost demand it wont create inflation ( if you believe that anyway , since fractional reserve banking for some reason does n't ) . Giving loans to businesses does n't replace months of lost demand . When they have to pay back the loan its like those months of revenue disappear . I think this crisis may clarify peoples idea about where the country has been heading . Why do we have fewer hospital beds than we did in 1973 , with a much higher population now ? I expect some of the economic certainties of the past thirty years to be questioned . Unlike Simon Bridges I understand that contractors and gig economy workers need UBI . They wont get wage subsidies since they are not employees . Simon better hope they do n't end up on the dole where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been talking about actually have to try and live on . <p> I believe this is what 's termed an ' externality ' in the corporate world . You fob off the cost of doing business ( be it pollution , outsourcing , etc. ) onto an external party , keeping costs down and ensuring the business can keep on ticking along . In much the same way , companies calculate whether paying a fine for an illegal activity ( dumping toxic waste for example ) is more financially viable than instituting new systems and processes to deal with that activity in accordance with the law . If it 's cheaper to pay the fine and is n't likely to cause a PR shitstorm ... BOOM ! Let 's keep doing that illegal shit . What matters is making someone else pick up the tab . Someone else take the hit . Someone else make the sacrifice . Just so long as it 's not you and you get to keep sitting on your giant mountain of cash .

They 're giving scientists clues <p> At least eight strains of the coronavirus are making their way around the globe , creating a trail of death and disease that scientists are tracking by their genetic footprints . <p> While much is unknown , hidden in the virus ' unique microscopic fragments are clues to the origins of its original strain , how it behaves as it mutates and which strains are turning into conflagrations while others are dying out thanks to quarantine measures . <p> KATHRYN GEORGE/STUFF <p> Scientists are tracking eight strains of the coronavirus by their genetic footprints . <p> Huddled in once bustling and now almost empty labs , researchers who oversaw dozens of projects are instead focused on one goal : tracking the current strains of the SARS-CoV-2 virus that cause the illness Covid-19 . <p> Labs around the world are turning their sequencing machines , most about the size of a desktop printer , to the task of rapidly sequencing the genomes of virus samples taken from people sick with Covid-19 . The information is uploaded to a website called NextStrain.org that shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new subtypes . <p> While researchers caution they 're only seeing the tip of the iceberg , the tiny differences between the virus strains suggest shelter-in-place orders are working in some areas and that no one strain of the virus is more deadly than another . They also say it does not appear the strains will grow more lethal as they evolve . <p> " The virus mutates so slowly that the virus strains are fundamentally very similar to each other , " said Charles Chiu , a professor of medicine and infectious disease at the University of California , San Francisco School of Medicine . <p> The SARS-CoV-2 virus first began causing illness in China sometime between mid-November and mid-December . Its genome is made up of about 30,000 base pairs . Humans , by comparison , have more than 3 billion . So far even in the virus 's most divergent strains scientists have found only 11 base pair changes . <p> That makes it easy to spot new lineages as they evolve , said Chiu . <p> " The outbreaks are trackable . We have the ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strains or lineages are circulating , " he said . <p> So far , most cases on the US West Coast are linked to a strain first identified in Washington state . It may have come from a man who had been in Wuhan , China , the virus ' epicentre , and returned home on January 15 . It is only three mutations away from the original Wuhan strain , according to work done early in the outbreak by Trevor Bedford , a computational biologist at Fred Hutch , a medical research centre in Seattle . <p> On the East Coast there are several strains , including the one from Washington and others that appear to have made their way from China to Europe and then to New York and beyond , Chiu said . <p> BEWARE PRETTY PHYLOGENETIC TREES <p> This is n't the first time scientists have scrambled to do genetic analysis of a virus in the midst of an epidemic . They did it with Ebola , Zika and West Nile , but nobody outside the scientific community paid much attention . <p> " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Kristian Andersen , a professor at Scripps Research , a nonprofit biomedical science research facility in La Jolla , California , speaking of the diagrams that show the evolutionary relationships between different strains of an organism . <p> The maps are available on NextStrain , an online resource for scientists that uses data from academic , independent and government laboratories all over the world to visually track the genomics of the SARS-CoV-2 virus . It currently represents genetic sequences of strains from 36 countries on six continents . <p> While the maps are fun , they can also be " little dangerous " said Andersen . The trees showing the evolution of the virus are complex and it 's difficult even for experts to draw conclusions from them . <p> " Remember , we 're seeing a very small glimpse into the much larger pandemic . We have half a million described cases right now but maybe 1000 genomes sequenced .

The rate varies greatly by country and experts say it is likely tied to testing rates rather than actual mortality . <p> Chiu says it appears unlikely the differences are related to people being infected with different strains of the virus . <p> " The current virus strains are still fundamentally very similar to each other , " he said . <p> The Covid-19 virus does not mutate very fast . It does so eight to 10 times more slowly than the influenza virus , said Anderson , making its evolution rate similar to other coronaviruses such as Ebola , Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome ( SARS ) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) . <p> It 's also not expected to spontaneously evolve into a form more deadly than it already is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between human hosts , said Andersen , it is under no evolutionary pressure to evolve . <p> GETTY IMAGES <p> The Covid-19 virus does not mutate very fast .

Another 30 per cent are associated with health care workers and families of people who have the virus . <p> " Only 20 per cent are coming from within the community . It 's not circulating widely , " he said . <p> That 's fantastic news , he said , indicating the virus has not been able to gain a serious foothold because of social distancing . <p> It 's like a wildfire , Chiu said . A few sparks might fly off the fire and land in the grass and start new fires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embers stomped out , you can kill off an entire strain . In California , Chiu sees a lot of sparks hitting the ground , most coming from Washington , but they 're quickly being put out . <p> An example was a small cluster of cases in Solano County , northeast of San Francisco . Chiu 's team did a genetic analysis of the virus that infected patients there and found it was most closely related to a strain from China . <p> At the same time , his lab was sequencing a small cluster of cases in the city of Santa Clara in Silicon Valley . They discovered the patients there had the same strain as those in Solano County . Chiu believes someone in that cluster had contact with a traveller who recently returned from Asia . <p> " This is probably an example of a spark that began in Santa Clara , may have gone to Solano County but then was halted , " he said . <p> The virus , he said , can be stopped . <p> CHINA IS AN UNKNOWN <p> So far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genomics of the virus inside China beyond the fact that it first appeared in the city of Wuhan sometime between mid-November and mid-December . <p> The virus 's initial sequence was published on January 10 by professor Yong-Zhen Zhang at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Center . But Chiu says scientists do n't know if there was just one strain circulating in China or more . <p> " It may be that they have n't sequenced many cases or it may be for political reasons they have n't been made available , " said Chiu . " It 's difficult to interpret the data because we 're missing all these early strains . " <p> Researchers in the United Kingdom who sequenced the genomes of viruses found in travellers from Guangdong in south China found those patients ' strains spanned the gamut of strains circulating worldwide . <p> " That could mean several of the strains we 're seeing outside of China first evolved there from the original strain , or that there are multiple lines of infection . It 's very hard to know , " said Chiu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While there remain many questions about the trajectory of the Covid-19 disease outbreak , one thing is broadly accepted in the scientific community : The virus was not created in a lab but naturally evolved in an animal host . <p> SARS-CoV-2 's genomic molecular structure - think the backbone of the virus - is closest to a coronavirus found in bats . Parts of its structure also resemble a virus found in scaly anteaters , according to a paper published earlier this month in the journal Nature Medicine . <p> Someone manufacturing a virus targeting people would have started with one that attacked humans , wrote National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins in an editorial that accompanied the paper . <p> Andersen was lead author on the paper .

@@31750235 <h> Survival of the fittest and other cruel logic <p> Donald Trump and Boris Johnson 's response to coronavirus has revealed some disturbing attitudes towards segments of the population <p> As New Zealand enters a period of indeterminate lockdown in response to the Covid-19 pandemic , we ( and I mean us as a global population ) have learned a lot about the importance of experts and scientists , and of frontline public services . <p> It has also revealed that our emergency workers exceed the police , medics and firefighters , and include warehouse workers , refuse collectors , shelf-stackers and checkout operators who continue to put themselves in harm 's way . We 've also learned their relatively low wages do n't match their social importance . In fact , we 've learned of the importance of the labour force as a whole and its contribution to our economy , despite being constantly told it is only the corporate bosses and financiers who are the real " wealth creators " . <p> We 've also learned there is no such thing as the economy , just economics , and that our economy can and must operate differently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope that we really do have the capacity to respond to the approaching threat of climate change should we find the political will . <p> However , we 've also learned that valuing life is not a straightforward and universally accepted moral position , and that in some instances people are prepared to take a more instrumental and transactional view about value and worth . While the vast majority of people have accepted the need for social distancing , and , from what I have seen , practise it with diligence and care , Donald Trump is making declarations that this is a very temporary situation and he wants everyone in the US back to work by Easter . <p> As people attempt to explain to him that this will inevitably cost many lives , he replies that the cost in terms of collapsing markets is the greater concern . People try to veil the ugliness of this attitude by referring to the number of US citizens killed by cars every year , for example . People die , the argument goes , so why should we stop everything just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , is a very disturbing attitude towards a significant segment of the population , summed up in this now-deleted tweet by a US attorney replying to Trump 's call to go back to work . " The fundamental problem " , he wrote , " is whether we are going to tank the entire economy to save 2.5 percent of the population which is ( 1 ) generally expensive to maintain , and ( 2 ) not productive " . <p> This sets out a very cruel logic , and one made even more cruel by the fact that if left to run its course in such a class-ridden and unequal society as the US , it would disproportionately affect the poor and the already vulnerable , whose risk is made even worse by having neither access to healthcare nor the privilege of being able to sit out the pandemic in relative comfort and safety . This is , of course , exactly who the author of the tweet is willing to sacrifice . In fact , the suggestion is it 's not really a sacrifice at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its course was the initial British response when PM Boris Johnson announced the aim for tackling the coronavirus was to achieve ' herd immunity ' . Most of us would have been unfamiliar with this concept even though it is fairly routine in epidemiology . The issue , though , is that ' herd immunity ' is normally achieved through the use of a vaccine . When at least 90 percent of the population ( in the case of measles ) is inoculated , the disease is restricted because those who are vaccinated shield those who are n't . Not everyone is immune , but we 've achieved ' herd immunity ' . <p> Without the vaccine , it 's a case of exposing everyone ( or at least 60 percent was the British estimate for coronavirus ) and seeing who dies . Continuing the herd metaphor , it 's effectively a cull . We could say this is simply another gaffe from a gaffe-prone politician , but I do n't believe it was . <p> Johnson is a vociferous advocate of philosophical aristocracy , by which I mean not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who are at the top are there because they are inherently , even genetically superior . He is also known as an enthusiastic social Darwinist who believes society should be organised to flush out the weak . The importance of competition in a capitalist system for him is precisely because only the fittest succeed . <p> In his 2013 Margaret Thatcher Memorial Lecture , he argued that the " violent economic centrifuge " or capitalism accentuates inequalities amongst people " who are already very far from equal in raw ability " before going on to propose that people are also inherently unequal in " spiritual worth " . This aristocratic ethos also encourages an interest in eugenics , shared by a number of his advisers . From this perspective , the idea he should propose a cull as a means of disease prevention becomes rather chilling . <p> Over the course of the last five years , the rise of the alt-right -- with whom Johnson has a connection via Steve Bannon -- has been alarming . One of their aims has been to shift the ' Overton Window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particular , they want eugenics put back on the agenda because it helps re-establish the pseudo race science they are so fond of . Hence , one other thing we should learn from this pandemic is just how effective this project has become . <p> Credible information is crucial in a crisis . <p> The pandemic is pushing us into an unknown and uncertain future .

@@31758233 <p> Channel experts Ken Thoreson and Keith Lubner team up to offer their knowledge on generational gaps that cause obstacles in the channel . <p> What are some of the gaps that distance Channel Managers and their partners ? <p> Thoreson/Lubner : The Channel Manager is a challenging role . Generally , they have several layers of internal personnel that are attempting to promote their products , their marketing/sales promotions , and corporate program rollouts . <p> At the same time , they have to assist with the issues facing their partners that deal with their corporation . The Channel Manager needs to be the partner 's representative at the table . <p> On top of those opposing issues , there is a continuous need to achieve sales quotas . To build " trust " with the partner ( so they sell the products/market them , train their salespeople , etc. ) , the Channel Manager must satisfy the needs of the channel partner . <p> Without basic trust , there is not much of a relationship , especially when the partner has 6-10 other Channel Managers attempting to gain their mindshare . <p> When you add in generational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the traditional Channel Manager ) , not only are communication styles a challenge but having confidence in that Channel Manager becomes a top priority for most partners . Vendors tend to do a poor job of onboarding their Channel Managers ( another issue in itself ) . <p> You mentioned generational gaps , where are these gaps being seen in the channel ? <p> Thoreson/Lubner : Generational gaps appear at all levels and they interfere mostly with the job of a Channel Manager in driving revenue . When communication breaks down due to generational gaps , the messaging from the vendor to the partner fails to connect . <p> Having business discussions that are misunderstood or social communications via text ( versus a telephone call ) can be disruptive . <p> We often see discussion on topics that are of interest to the Channel Manager but not to the partner . When we speak at vendor conferences we frequently hear that " events are planned by one generation , but the partners attending the events are from another generation . " <p> The result is that the vendors who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it was waste of time and money . <p> The secret is measuring PFT , or Partner Face Time . The more time a Channel Manager spends with a partner , the more they can understand that person and they communicate . <p> What issues or problems are generational gaps causing between Channel Managers and their partners ? Can you offer an example or two ? <p> Thoreson/Lubner : Generational gaps can cause an immediate disconnect by virtue of experience . Good vendors direct their Channel Managers to help grow the business of their partners but often what happens is that you find an inexperienced Channel Manager trying to counsel a seasoned , typically much older , business owner ( partner ) . <p> The latter does not yet respect the former , inevitably causing a bit of a disconnection . The results are slower adoption of technology by the partner , lower sales by the partner , and minimal marketing by the partner . <p> We like to recommend that once a year , Channel Managers spend a week with their partners . Shadowing their salespeople , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better understand the partner environment . <p> How can Channel Managers do a better job of connecting across generational gaps with their partners ? What should be the principle area of focus ? <p> Thoreson/Lubner : Solving the generational divide is not an easy task . However , there are some things that Channel Managers should be aware of , starting with building trust . Channel Managers must realise that building trust with their seasoned partners is crucial . This starts with listening more to what the partner is telling them . <p> The Channel Manager then needs to do more " asking " instead of " telling , " and develop an attitude of " give before you get . " The bigger the divide is in the generational gap , the more that the Channel Manager needs to cede to the aforementioned . <p> Thoreson/Lubner : We can close the generational gap by paying more attention to the existence of this issue . Currently , vendors do not do a great job in giving their internal teams the tools and programs to realise how to " connect " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting that a divide indeed exists . Step two is all about constructing programs to educate the Channel Managers on the partner environment , the reality of entrepreneurialism , and business management . Step three is the most important , and that is reinforcement . Too often , programs are built without creating a cadence of reinforcement . <p> What needs to be taught ? Examples include techniques in identifying personality styles and giving lessons in what technology to use with different generations . <h> Featured <h> Slideshows <p> This exclusive Reseller News Exchange event in Auckland explored the challenges facing the partner community on the cloud security frontier , as well as market trends , customer priorities and how the channel can capitalise on the opportunities available .

This of course comes at the peak of the season , exacerbated by drought in several regions , particularly the top half of the North Island . <p> Because meat companies are n't entitled to government wage subsidies , they have set up schemes to look after employees whose earnings would be adversely affected , either by an inability to work for reasons of age or dependants or the reduced volume throughput . In AFFCO 's case , employees are paid their full production bonus based on numbers processed before the Level 4 lockdown , while those unable to work receive a company funded support package of $585 gross per week for an initial four week period . <p> The companies are also providing food donations to iwi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Wairoa and Whanganui , while Greenlea has made a sizeable donation of beef mince to the Salvation Army . <p> The return of China to the market , after the significant drop at the beginning of the year from the combined effect of Chinese New Year and Covid-19 , has been a positive factor compensating for the pandemic-led disruption to traditional European and North American markets . The sales pattern has changed with the restaurant and food service trade almost coming to a halt , whereas sales to supermarkets and online sales channels have increased . It 's quite possible online sales of meat and fresh produce will remain at high levels after the end of the pandemic , as such events tend to lead to a faster pace of change in consumer buying habits . <p> The outbreak of Covid-19 has seen the meat industry collaborate through the Meat Industry Association to develop a best practice protocol in a short timeframe which has enabled all processors to continue working whilst ensuring the health and safety of their employees . <p> At the same time farmers still receive prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , providing they can obtain space at the works .

AFFCO the longest surviving recognised brand from the " old days " appears to be demonstrating that its new structure under private ownership has very certain advantages . Single minded decision making and objectives from the top obviously provide effective control and direction rather than the cluttered and often cross legged approach of the co-operative types in trying to please all comers . <p> Interesting to learn via your excellent article , Allan , that meat companies are not able to use the wage subsidy scheme . That they are creating their own self-funded version is good news . It puts the lie to the accusation so blithely scattered through comments that ' companies Bad ' , and that only Gubmints can provide .

@@31774230 <h> ' The situation is getting dire ' : A Kiwi doctor working the wards in London <p> As the UK records its deadliest day so far , with 980 deaths in 24 hours surpassing the worst seen by Italy and Spain , a New Zealand doctor reports from the frontline of a London hospital . <p> It took eight painstaking months before I was allowed to work as a doctor in the UK . I became a troglodyte , holed up in my west London flat , diligently studying for the General Medical Council 's registration exams day after tedious day . I resented being shut indoors while the rest of the city went to work -- self-isolation was n't considered cool back then . <p> The week I started my first hospital job was the week the lockdown began . Suddenly the entire population of London , along with a fifth of the world , was banished from the outside realm into their respective homes for the foreseeable future , while I was elevated to the godlike status of an NHS key worker . As a doctor I already had an inflated sense of self worth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transport , had a dedicated hour in the grocery store and was literally being clapped in the street . Never before had I experienced such a violent turning of the tables . <p> For the first few days on the job , the hospital , like the rest of the country , did n't appear to regard the rapidly spreading virus as a matter of much importance . Clinical life proceeded as normal . The corridors and cafes still teemed with people ; staff , visitors and patients all rubbing shoulders , unaware of what was about to unfold . But by Friday of the first week , the serious switch had been flipped , and the whole hospital was thrown into upheaval . <p> The atmosphere was tense , as if we were preparing for war . An infectious disease specialist prowled the halls , giving impromptu lectures to groups of scared staff , comparing the approaching situation to the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic . There was stunned silence as he prepared us for the worst , explaining how we stood to lose an entire generation of people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't been taking the matter more seriously myself , though mostly I felt nervous . I had only been in the NHS for four days and had barely worked out how to log onto the computers . I felt woefully unequipped to face the new frontier . <p> The hospital was divided into " dirty " and " clean " wards in an attempt to sequester the infection , which required a mass reorganisation of patients and staff . All sense of the usual workplace hierarchy was obliterated as it became obvious that nobody really knew what to expect or what their roles were . The directions from management came in fragments and seemed to change by the hour . My cohort was assigned to the " dirty " ward for patients aged 70 and over . We were segregated from our " clean " colleagues for all hospital activities . I went home for the weekend with a growing sense of unease , expecting the worst upon my return . <p> To my surprise , when I returned on Monday the working environment had vastly improved . The hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation meant we developed immediate bonds with the nurses and therapists , making day-to-day tasks much easier to achieve . In addition , much of the administrative burden that makes up the bulk of a junior doctor 's role disappeared as the hospital suspended all non-urgent activities . We basked in the camaraderie and adoration from the public as we feasted on gifts of Krispy Kreme and cupcakes . I thought to myself : " this pandemic is going to be a doddle " . <p> That illusion faded fast . We are now in week three , and the situation on the ward is getting quite dire . An average of two patients are dying per day on our ward . It 's not that these are unexpected deaths -- the patients are all elderly and frail -- but the frequency is greater than what I 'm used to . Difficult decisions about resuscitation are being made more rapidly than normal and are in part driven by a lack of available resources . We are at full capacity and several staff are off sick . Our PPE provisions keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are tending to infectious patients in flimsy plastic aprons and breezy surgical masks while Johnny-on-the-street is walking around dressed like Darth fucking Vader . <p> Patients ' conditions often fluctuate wildly . One man on maximal oxygen therapy , who was sitting up in bed and chatting to us in the morning , was dead by the afternoon . The speed of his deterioration caught us all off guard . When another patient took a turn for the worse , I solemnly called her son advising him to come to the ward -- a privilege we can currently grant only to the closest relatives of the imminently dying . By the time her son arrived , the patient had made a full U-turn and was sitting up in bed , happily eating a pottle of yogurt . Her son had questions about the expected course of the illness ; I could n't provide any answers . <p> The daughter of another patient approached me in the hallway . Her elderly father had been hospitalised with the virus the previous week -- he was in a critical condition and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping him comfortable . Active treatment , routine observations and labs were all ceased . It was now a week later , and his daughter had questions : what if Dad had recovered from the virus but was n't improving because he was barely getting any nutrition ? How could we be sure if we 'd stopped taking measurements ? Was it possible that we had " given up " on her father too early due to the uncertainty regarding the nature of the virus ? Again , I did n't have a satisfactory answer . <p> In addition to the uncertainty regarding patient management , it 's unsettling to know that my paperwork is being used to inform the public . When completing a death certificate , I am legally required to list all conditions that could have contributed to the patient 's death . This goes to the deaths registry , which is then used to inform the daily Covid-19 death tolls . Problematically , as there is so little known about the virus , it is n't always clear that Covid-19 directly caused death , but these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I fear may be leading to widespread misinformation . <p> All we can do is keep moving forward .

Sam Brooks brings you up to speed on what you need to know before you dive into the show . <p> First things first , what is Noughts + Crosses ? <p> Noughts + Crosses is a BBC series adapted from a series of young adult novels by British author Malorie Blackman , with the first in the series being published in 2001 . It 's a wildly popular series , often taught in schools , and has already been adapted into plays and radio dramas . <p> So what happened in the world of Noughts + Crosses that makes it different from ours ? <p> Well , in the world of Noughts + Crosses , the European colonisation that we 're all bleakly familiar with never happened . <p> What happened is that several nations in West Africa combined to form the ' Aprican Empire ' , and then went on to colonise Europe . Following this , there was a conflict known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is great in size not great because everybody loved it . Europe was then split into different African factions , with the European mainland under control of the Malian Empire and the Moors .

That 's all background , though . The show focuses largely on one country : Albion . <p> While Albion appears to be its own colony with its own prime minister and government , it 's still accountable to the continental Aprican Empire .

The one big change is that there are nearly no laws to prevent discrimination or prejudice . <p> That 's ... bad . <p> I know ! <p> So this leads to the Crosses continuing to hold the power -- more wealth , better jobs , more access to education , and the Noughts with nearly no power , often performing manual labour or literally being servants to the Crosses . <p> That sounds a little bit like our world , but backwards . <p> Yup ! It 's allegory . Makes you think , huh ? <p> Okay , that 's the world .

It was at a time when the health system was trying to sort out the testing process . We got her tested the same afternoon . We went to White Cross , called in advance , and stayed in the car while we waited for the doctor to come out . It was a 45-minute wait before he came out in a full hazmat suit . She got a nostril swab , which went quite far up . They try to get into your sinus glands . It was kept up there for about 15 seconds while she sat in the car .

We could tell because she did n't realise she was burning her rice on the stove top . She was lucky to be a mild case . <p> How did you friend cope with contracting Covid-19 ? How did it impact her ? <p> On the grand scheme of Covid-19 illness she was a mild case , but she did go through hell those two days of illness . It was hard for her to get out of bed but it was also hard to sleep , so she was uncomfortable . <p> For our friend when she was sick she kept to her room unless she had to use the bathroom .

How did Covid-19 impact her compared to your friend who showed mild symptoms ? <p> My partner got ill on Tuesday , March 24 , five days after our friend first showed symptoms She had a mild fever , fatigue , and a nasty cough , but she got hit harder as she has a history of asthma . Her symptoms lasted about five days , more than twice the length of our friend and she was stuck in bed for four to five days . Her breathing was pretty bad .

All her symptoms indicated she had Covid-19 , she had the same symptoms , a similar recovery time to others , there is no way it was n't Covid-19 .

As I mentioned earlier , we disinfected everything we could as often as needed . <p> We had to self-quarantine for 14 days after our friend recovered , and then another 14 days after my partner became symptom free , so while they got hit worse , the rest of us have to remain in quarantine longer . <p> Were any of you scared ?

Going into isolation before lockdown had some mixed reactions . I had some pushback from my employers who just considered Covid-19 a flu or cold . The reactions have been scarier and more of a concern than actually getting the virus . By the time my friend had it and recovered , we were all prepared what was to come if one of us had it . <p> We actually felt a lot more calmer than what many others did , who were running off what ifs , and what was floating around on social media . We knew what we were dealing with and had regular contact with health officials . <p> How was their experience with the health system ? What extra checks were taken ? Did you all feel supported ? <p> We had a nurse call up daily asking how everyone was and thoroughly questioned every flat member about their health , symptoms and general wellbeing .

Who wants a single , unmatched sock ? <p> Once the other socks , that were already neatly folded in pairs on the bed , became acquainted with the full story there was cheering and whooping and rejoicing at the reunion .

On the first Saturday of the lockdown ( which would normally be a golf day for Chris ) , I woke up bright and early and announced that I wanted to learn to play golf . Chris put his hand on my forehead , convinced I must have been delirious with the dreaded fever . His fear deepened when I suddenly leapt out of bed , donned my gumboots and marched off to the tennis court in my nightie . <p> " We can create a chipping course and putting green here on the tennis court , and a driving range by draping weed matting over a branch of the walnut tree , securing it with tent pegs , " I announced to no one in particular , apart from George the cat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is nothing short of miraculous .

Photo : RNZ / Simon Rogers <p> The modelling , released today by Te Punaha Matatini , shows measures similar to those now in place can suppress the virus for up to 400 days but infections could spike as soon as they are gone , because the population will not have developed any herd immunity . <p> However , any fewer restrictions would result in a peak of at least six times hospital capacity within just a few months . <p> The paper compares a " suppression strategy " - a sustained period of restrictions - with a " mitigation strategy " , where controls are lifted for brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ICU beds fill up . <p> In all scenarios , the lockdown period is modelled to last significantly longer than the initial four weeks that began today . <p> However , one of the researchers , University of Auckland Professor Shaun Hendy , told RNZ the current lockdown could be sufficient if all measures were rigidly enforced . <p> " Provided the contact tracing , testing , and containment strategy works then we may be able to relax in four weeks . But we need to cut cases to just a handful . " <p> The researchers wrote that both strategies were " fraught with uncertainty " but suppression at least had the advantage of buying New Zealand time until a vaccine or treatment became available . <p> Mitigation , which aimed to let the epidemic go ahead at a controlled rate while creating herd immunity , was " a tempting approach " , the researchers wrote . <p> However to be successful , each case would have to result in less than one other new case . <p> " It remains unknown whether this will be achievable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has yet been achieved in comparable , western democracies , including those that have instigated major lockdowns such as Italy .

Hospital capacity would not be exceeded for over a year . <p> However , that scenario would require the restrictions to remain in place until a vaccine or other treatment was developed . <p> " When controls are lifted after 400 days , an outbreak occurs with a similar peak size as for an uncontrolled epidemic , " the researchers wrote .

" <p> But the number of overseas arrivals has not topped 300 for a week . <p> Ardern said another reason not to impose a blanket quarantine sooner was because of the prospect of extra arrivals , for instance for travellers transiting through New Zealand - which has recently been allowed under strict health conditions . <p> Contact-tracing tech <p> Contact-tracing would also be enhanced by technology , Ardern said . <p> " The Ministry of Health is already working on a locally-developed app that will assist with contact-tracing .

He stepped to the podium armed with a video meant to frame his response in a positive light after his initial handling of the crisis has come under increasing scrutiny . <p> After it aired , Trump grew increasingly irate as reporters probed the time line of his response , claiming the criticism was n't fair and that he 'd handled the outbreak effectively . <p> " Everything we did was right , " Trump insisted after an extended tirade against negative coverage . <p> Pressed later about his authority to reopen parts of the country , Trump delivered an eyebrow-raising statement asserting absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president of the United States , your authority is total , " he said .

He claimed his response " was taken as a way that maybe somehow something was at fault here " and said his remark about " pushback " inside the administration to some of his recommendations was a poor choice of words . <p> The episode capped a stretch where Fauci 's position in the administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical of Fauci 's comments on CNN along with the hashtag #FireFauci . <p> Trump shrugged off the retweet on Monday -- " I retweeted somebody , " he said , " it does n't matter " -- but many of Trump 's allies in the conservative media have fueled calls for Fauci 's ouster , painting him as overly focused on the health aspects of the coronavirus crisis and not attuned to Americans ' economic suffering . <p> Fauci , the nation 's top infectious disease expert , conceded to CNN 's Jake Tapper on Sunday morning that earlier mitigation efforts could have saved more lives and again called for a cautious reopening of the nation , despite Trump 's calls to quickly restart the economy . <p> " You could logically say that if you had a process that was ongoing and you started mitigation earlier , you could have saved lives , " Fauci said . <p> But a day later , he sought to characterize that comment as hypothetical and not about any specific actions that could or should have been taken before Trump announced social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were discussions among the " medical people " about the pros and cons of strong mitigation efforts , but when he and Dr. Deborah Birx , the White House coronavirus response coordinator , ultimately recommended mitigation efforts to the President for the first time last month , Trump listened . <p> " The first and only time that Dr. Birx and I went in and formally made a recommendation to the President to actually have a ' shutdown ' in the sense of not really shut down , but to have strong mitigation , we discussed it , " Fauci said .

@@31785240 <p> Health professionals working with the World Health Organization ( WHO ) in eastern Democratic of Congo ( DRC ) , have been dealing with the deadly Ebola epidemic since August 2018 . This experience is helping them to prepare for the latest disease to arrive : COVID-19 . <p> New cases of Ebola have been reported in Beni since 10 April , resulting in two deaths , despite earlier hopes that the disease had been eradicated in the country . As well as Ebola , the population of DRC is also having to deal with malaria , measles and cholera as well as ongoing insecurity , which is partly why health workers trying to vaccinate locals against Ebola have faced mistrust , and even violence . In an interview with UN News , doctor Abdourahmane Diallo , who heads up the WHO Ebola vaccination programme in DRC , explained that this is an ongoing problem . <p> " Unfortunately , we have been fighting some resistance regarding the new cases : the community did not believe that they were Ebola cases , which is making life difficult for our workers on the ground . But we are doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has been in contact with the patients to get themselves vaccinated . <p> The cases of COVID-19 that we know about are two people who came from Dubai to Uganda , and then tried to get to Beni . As soon as we got the message , we tried to isolate them , and their conditions have improved . <h> Delivering the right message <p> We had hoped to be able to close the treatment centres , but now , with cases of Ebola , and cases of COVID-19 , that has changed . Spirits are good , however . I am from Guinea , where we had Ebola , and I also coordinated vaccinations in Sierra Leone . So , I am very experienced . When we face challenges , we try to remain courageous : this is part of being a public health worker . <p> Communication has been a major problem throughout the Ebola epidemic , and we expect to have the same problems with COVID-19 . For example , even before the new cases of Ebola this month , we had a meeting with local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one message , and that it was the right message . Within our team , we also have to be very careful to make sure that we are coordinated and speaking with one voice . <p> As of now , it seems to be working : social distancing has begun ; the authorities have closed the night clubs , for example , and even in the markets , people are trying to stay at least one metre apart . <h> Fighting myths and rumours <p> Disinformation has been a problem . People have been saying that certain drugs can be used to vaccinate against COVID-19 , which is not true . We explain that there is no vaccine against the virus , and trials are still ongoing . That message is beginning to get through , and we are continuing to vaccinate against Ebola . <p> It is very important that we keep going back to the community , as many times as necessary , to get our message across . And we have to take time to explain , and give them the opportunity to have their say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going back to the community five or six times in one day ! <p> I have learned that you have to know the right way to speak to the community . Sometimes , to put them at ease , I do n't wear WHO-branded clothing . I dress simply , I bring a basic mobile phone , to show them that I am like them , and that we need to work together to fight the outbreak . <h> Protecting health workers <p> Luckily , we do have enough protective clothing , because of our vaccination campaign : for some time , have been vaccinating anyone who has been in contact with an Ebola patient , and we do n't know if they are a high or low risk . So , we need to make sure that we are fully protected . And when we go into the community , we are spraying chairs , tables , everything , and ensuring that our team is wearing personal protective equipment.As for the COVID-19 pandemic , we are worried , of course , but we hope that , if people stick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communicate those guidelines to the community , the outbreak will not spread.I remember when the COVID-19 cases started in Guinea , my home country , I warned that anyone returning from high-risk countries needed to self-isolate for fourteen days , and not to go immediately back to their families and risk infecting them . Unfortunately , many people did not follow that advice , and now there are hundreds of cases in the country .

True , I do n't have firm numbers , but I know certain incontrovertible facts . Approximately 30,000 die in New Zealand each year . That is about 2500 each month , on average . Probably more die in winter , so maybe it is about 3000 in winter months , 2000 in summer months , hence my conservative estimate of 2000 over the past four weeks . <p> How many of those died from Covid-19 ?

The central bank should bypass the market , they argue , just create the money and give it to the Government with no obligation to repay or any other strings attached . <p> But in practical terms it is not all that different . In theory QE allows the Reserve Bank to later sell down its bond holdings into the market , withdrawing money from the system in the process -- running the shredder , one might say , instead of the printer . <p> And if the economy were running hot and inflation threatened , that would be useful thing to do . <p> In practice , however , where other central banks have undertaken quantitative easing there has tended to be a pretty sturdy ratchet under their bond holdings . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respect .

" <p> Orr replied : " Yes over time Government debt will either be paid back or rolled over . Since the days of Julius Vogel we have owed somebody something . Fortunately this time we start from a very low debt to GDP position and , judging from what we are seeing , we are going to get back to an average historical position . <p> " What we the Reserve Bank are doing is transferring those long-term IOUs into short-term cash .

Falling inflation expectations push real interest rates upwards , the opposite of what is required right now . <p> The large scale asset purchases are being done purely for monetary policy purposes , Orr said . " With low nominal interest rates if we were n't doing it we would have significant deflation , which brings a whole new set of challenges . " <p> It should not , in short , be seen as compromising the bank 's autonomy or price stability mandate . <p> That leaves the empirical question of to what extent its bond buying will match the scale and pace of the Treasury 's debt issuance . <p> Since mid-March when the Government announced its initial fiscal support package the bond programme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to $25 billion and the expected increase in Treasury bills by $4 billion . <p> With droll understatement the Treasury adds that " It is anticipated that increases to programmes for future years will be necessary relative to those published at the Half Year Economic and Fiscal Update 2019 . " <p> The Reserve Bank for its part announced on March 23 it would be undertaking $30 billion worth of QE over the next 12 months , to which it has subsequently added $3 billion of purchases of local government debt . <p> No-one expects it to end there . " On the monetary stimulus side all I can say is at most we are at the end of the beginning around what may need to be done and what we can do , " Orr told the select committee . <p> " We did the $30 billion QE because that was about 30 , 40% of the Crown debt on issue . " It equated to 35% of central government debt securities on issue at the start of March . <p> " And we do n't want to crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participant . But as that opportunity grows so does our ability to continue the quantitative easing . " <p> Both the Government and the central bank have emphasised the importance of maintaining the efficient functioning of the secondary bond market in all this . <p> That is an important consideration . When a lot of New Zealand government bonds are owned offshore and there is a non-trivial risk that a gruesome global slump will trigger Global Financial Crisis II , the sequel , there is a clear financial stability case for the bank to support the market , on top of the objective of trying to keep long-term benchmark interest rates low . <p> If the bank sees 40% of the stock of bonds on issue as some kind of upper limit before crowding out becomes an issue , then as a matter of simple arithmetic if the stock of bonds on issue were , say , to roughly double from 25 to 50% of GDP , it could buy up 80% of the increase before reaching that level . That would require roughly doubling its QE " budget " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barely discernible dot on the horizon of possibility -- might well loom larger as a prospect . <p> In an interview with interest.co.nz Finance Minister Grant Robertson , when asked about the option of a more direct bilateral financing arrangement with the Reserve Bank , opened the door a crack towards that possibility . <p> The current system was providing the amount of financing the Government needed . " I 'm comfortable for it to continue to be the way that we work , ' ' he said . <p> " Obviously we keep it under review . If we do n't believe it 's working or if the amounts of money that are required turn out to be such that they ca n't be sustained through the secondary market ... then of course we would look at that .

" .. we do n't want to crowd out the rest of the market by being the only participant " Ditto . <p> How about CGT to starf with which is also just and must but JA ego will prevent it as she promised that not as long as she is PM ( vote bank politics ) but she should also remember that the reason she was able to promise as PM was that she promised before the election that will introduce CGT if she becomes PM si vite for her . <p> Capital Gain ? On what asset in these times ? The horse has bolted . Jacinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be booked . Asset tax ( not arguing for it ) might be a more sensible suggestion . <p> Utterly disagree . Capital Gain is a theoretical gain only , until it is realised by either a sale or borrowing against . This is basics . Unless either of those two instances occur , the material wealth , actual money , of the owner does not change . If however an asset is sold recording a capital gain then in that instance i suggest our laws already specify that it be taxed . So what about enforcement ? <p> If we already have provusion of CGT in another form like BLT but if not implimented so why hesitation to have CGT . <p> Agree that gain is only when buy and sell take place and make profit just like in business pay tax when buy and sell take place - this is utter rubbish reason for not to have it . Any tax is when profit is created . <p> If make money - world over people pay tax and if no buy/ sell and no profit than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - can argue anyway but fact of the matter is CGT is must as in other part of the world . <p> Vested / biased people exploiting and making money have to fear like politcans or not in favour . <p> So the question that most people are not asking is " When is Capital Gain to be measured ? " Current discussion does not in any form address this , and it is dangerous to make an assumption . We should all be afraid of any move to tax a perceived gain that is theoretical only . <p> Disagree . As for fmaily home , why should yours ( or my ) $800k investment in a home not be taxed when all those renters out there have their cash savings taxed ? The cap gain on cash deposits is the interest ... we tax that . CGT is a dumber then dumb idea . <p> I 'm not against cgt , but really , it 's just an envy tax with little real world value and full of potential loopholes . And to be fair , it would need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a rort at the moment , with an implied taxable dividend rate of 5% . Where do you get that ? Income tax , consumption tax , property rates . You might hate em , but you ca n't avoid them and they will remain the backbone of our tax system . Wealth/asset taxes would be electoral suicide in this country . <p> To the extent that the Reserve Bank 's buying of government bonds matches the scale and pace that New Zealand Debt Management ( the Treasury ) is issuing them , the net effect is that money newly created by the central bank flows , via a swift detour through the secondary bond market , into the Government 's bank account .. <p> Is that so ? Explain away this interpretation , which seems more likely : <p> A recent Bloomberg article described central bank easing with the phrase " pumping money into the economy . " That 's a misconception . Monetary easing is actually an asset swap . The public was holding savings in one form , and now it holds it in another . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaces them with currency and bank reserves ( base money ) that someone has to hold , at every point in time , until the Fed sells its bonds and retires the cash . All monetary policy does is to change the mix of government obligations held by the public . Only fiscal policy -- specifically deficit spending -- changes the total amount of those obligations . Link <p> Furthermore , The out of thin air proceeds the US Federal Reserve issues to primary dealers in exchange for QE securities purchased are called reserves and are lodged and recorded here as liabilities offsetting the asset ledger of the newly purchased notes and bonds . The US Treasury has no claim to them . <p> It is wrong to assume that government deficits create money , when actually they create national debt &amp; growing regressive interest transfers from the many poor to the few rentiers who they seem to be serving . <p> The government should stop crowding out savers from investing in productive enterprise that employ citizens and rid themselves of the fees associated with raising Crown debt . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government directly , by purchasing Crown IOUs with their own IOUs credited to the government bank account . <p> Here 's the obvious answer by any of our ruling elites ( both red &amp; blue ) , rbnz , councils , govt bureaucrats etc. 1 ) Do n't print the money , BUT borrow/bail out from future tax payers ( as so far measures reported here ) 2 ) Anticipate the flurry of US property buyers into NZ , as per article by CCP sponsored media ; https : **33;8900;TOOLONG ... 3 ) Anticipate the OZ Chinese capital movement/people movement to NZ ; https : **35;8935;TOOLONG ... So Kiwis ? use your job looses redundancies money , wages subsidy money ( instead going direct to landlords ) .. go to the OZ Banks now , the LVR-FHB gone , you have only 12months of short windows opportunity to jump into the F.I.RE economy scheme , this is a lifetime opportunity pretty much guaranteed by any NZ government , point ( 1 ) above is silently being mentioned by both blue &amp; red team , to safe guard the RE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credible honesty . <p> Lets talk some numbers : as per RBNZ C35 , in 2019 the scheduled payment of loans were about $18b a year ( interest and principal repayments due ) . Lets assume that total repayments of loans for 2020 is about the same amount . In 2019 , there were also about $30b new loans ( this is my estimate based on total new loans minus loans fully repaid ( i.e. people who sold a mortgaged home and bought a new one using some loans ) . The $30b new loans in monetary term is now fully replaced for the year and more by government new borrowing . Almost all that money is given in wage subsidy and other assistance to individuals in one form or another . I assume that the said individuals use part of this money to keep the scheduled payment of $18b going . Now it all goes to debt write offs . How much of the total $272b debt will be written off will determine if we have monetary deflation or inflation . In my very rough estimates we will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $1 to anyone for the year to come , unless we have write off circa 10% . Now , that is not to say that we will not have decrease in house values . We will have them more likely than not . But unless that reduction causes bad debt circa 10% of total loans , it will not be enough to offset money printing by the gov. Around 10% and more will be deflationary for sure . But I guess the gov will then print more money and buy the bad debts from the banks . So I do not see with RBNZ actions how we will have deflation . Reduction in house prices yes . long term stagnation yes , but deflation ( in Monterey terms ) no . <p> Arguably , we should have learned our lesson the first time ; not in 2008 but in 1987 ! That 's when this monetary madness started to take hold , and at each ' crisis ' since ; when the Left fork ( forgive the pun ) in the road offered us " More of the same " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Right ' fork beckoned with " We need to go another way " ; better use of what debt we already have and the productive use of same , we veered Left And we are trying to again ! At what stage do we have the courage to say " We are going the wrong way . We need to go in another direction " . Now , would be as good a time as any ! <p> Smalltown - you are aware that pensions would not be a problem today if the Politicians had n't messed with the pension funds ? Even for well off boomers , means testing their pensions is a betrayal by the politicians , on top of multiple prior ones . <p> You might have to explain why kiwis are so special that almost uniquely on this planet we have no means tested pensions , CGT and land tax . You realise that it 's time for the rubber to hit the road do nt you , this is probably the reset that ol PDK has been warning since whenever. ? <p> Also do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always been the way . Read the Gaynor article , it 's quite illuminating . See what the pension age was when it was first bought in during the late 1800s. ( 65 ) <p> wo n't someone think of the poor betrayed boomers . If they 're looking for ways to cope with getting the rough end of the stick , perhaps they could ask their grandkids they 've spent the last decade insisting were just too lazy to buy houses . I 'm sure they 'll have some pointers on how to cope . Maybe a few less takeaway coffees here and there might help . <p> Means testing is extremely complicated and very difficult to do fairly . Easy to get those that do n't plan , but those with wealth do . Look at the resources thrown at Residential Care Subsidy tests .. legal challenges , case laws , trusts for Africa , gifting , fake invoicing etc etc.all to save on some care ( which generally does n't last long due to age of recipient ) . Imagine the avoidance efforts and policing requirements when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Wow , the ol kiwi arguments that it 's just too hard/ political suicide/political betrayal , wonder how all those other countries do it ? <p> Kiwis so dumb lah , it 's not just a slogan at CCP central . <p> Let 's remain the hillbillies of the Sth Pacific shall we , world class education that all the world comes to allegedly , but an economy built on protecting farmers and selling houses to each other . Embarrassing . <p> So if without intervention deflation would say be 10% but with the printer going brrrrrr it ends up at 0% , is that not inflation of 10% ? Against everyone who would have otherwise had things 10% cheaper and against beaten down first home buyers ?

@@31794236 <h> Life in Lock Down : Day 27 -- and it 's been a shit day . <p> The second-best possible news ; testing has revealed only five new cases . If this keeps up , we might -- might ! -- be down to zero by the time we move to Level 3 at 11.59pm on Monday 27 April . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> Except ... the good news was marred by the death of another person ; a 70 year old woman from a rest home in Te Atatu . <p> Also marred by an asinine response from our benighted Leader of the Opposition , yesterday , which has raised a storm of anger from thousands of New Zealanders . <p> And marred by a revelation that has raised my anger and left me wondering if I should have bothered with all the precautions and sacrifice that I ( and hundreds of thousands of other New Zealanders ) have made over the last few weeks ... <p> My usual trip into town yielded my usual observations of commercial vehicles as well as ordinary cars . Traffic seemed sparse ; no heavier or lighter than usual . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planned move to Level 3 as an invitation to leave their lock-down en masse . <p> In fact , the number of cars at the nearby Park N Ride had dropped from the usual three to two . The wide variety of commercial vehicles , though , ranged from what were clearly essential to more questionable status . Such as the " Directionz " van parked outside a closed McDonalds outlet : " Directionz " deals in commercial signage , traffic signs , and graffiti removal . <p> The ship spotted in the harbour yesterday was still in position , station-keeping in the same spot ; <p> . <p> . <p> It may be there for quite a while : they have twelve more days of quarantine . <p> In town , there was road-works in Vivian Street ; <p> . <p> . <p> Essential emergency work ? <p> And yet more roadworks in Wellington . This time at The Cutting in Miramar ; <p> . <p> . <p> Note the photo immediately above . Look to the left of the white truck . Here 's a close-up ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social distancing in a workplace setting , then obviously I 've been taught the metric system incorrectly . <p> This is why I reject calls from the National Party , ACT , and various sundry business lobby groups to allow all retailers to open , and let them practice " safe social distancing " while trading . I call ' bollocks ' on that . I also share similar reservations that safe social distancing can be managed during a Level 3 lock-down where non-contact business activity and trading will be permitted . <p> So far I see precious little " safe social distancing " even in the limited activities that are publicly visible . ( See also busy aisles at Kilbirnie Pak N Save here : Life in Lock Down : Day 23 ) <p> " The public has done a great job of self-isolating and social distancing . The entire country has made huge sacrifices to ensure the four week lockdown was effective . <p> Unfortunately the Government has n't done enough and is n't ready by its own standards and rhetoric . " <p> When Transport Agency data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year ago , that 's a fairly strong indication that the over-whelming majority of New Zealanders are doing the right thing . It suggests they trust this government and the leadership to be implementing policies that will , in the long run , save lives . <p> The fact that new cases have been trending downward for the last two weeks , until we now stand at only five is a clear sign we are going in the right direction . <p> PM Ardern and Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield have been in our living rooms for the last four weeks , almost night after night , and most New Zealanders have grown to trust them as a steady pair of hands . <p> So when Simon Bridges attacks the government and the leadership of the immensely popular Prime Minister and highly respected Dr Bloomfield , then he is basically " giving the finger " to the entire country . <p> Which is why around 82% of the stats to his post are in some way negative ; <p> . <p> . <p> The responses were ferocious in condemnation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four weeks . Our lives have been disrupted . Thirteen people have died ( with one in Peru ) . Thousand have lost their jobs . Four weeks lock-down was an impromptu " holiday " -- like being stuck in your hotel room while a tropical storm lashes your area for the entire time of your stay . Not much fun . <p> People are cranky . They are pissed off at those who flout the rules so they can have a good time while the rest of us tow-the-line . We want normalcy . We want to walk into a supermarket and not have to keep two sodding metres away from everyone -- just in case . <p> So for Mr Bridges to lob his on-line " grenade " at the government was not just an attack on said government and Ministry officials -- but also a snide dig at all of us . Despite stating " New Zealanders can be proud of the sacrifices they have made during this difficult time " , he was effectively dismissing those sacrifices as utterly meaningless . <p> Simon Bridges not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the wrong bloody building ! <p> The more comments he makes along the lines of his Facebook post yesterday ( 21 April ) , the more entrenched will be the public view of him as someone not fit to lead us in time of crisis . <p> And then , this evening on RNZ Checkpoint , came revelations that Air New Zealand air crew were returning from overseas flights -- and not quarantining on arrival -- despite several staff having been infected by covid19 ; <p> Air New Zealand is keeping secret the number of its staff infected with Covid-19 amid allegations it is not doing enough to keep its workers safe . <p> The airline 's crews who fly internationally continue to be exempt from the strict 14-day quarantine rules for people returning to New Zealand from overseas -- with the exception of Los Angeles flights . <p> On Monday the airline confirmed crew members had been forced to self-isolate after some staff allegedly disregarded physical distancing rules during a layover in Vancouver . <p> Documents obtained by Checkpoint show increasing unease and fear among flight crew staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk it poses to colleagues and the public . <p> Air New Zealand is currently operating 16 return international services a week . At the end of May it plans to add three return services a week to Shanghai to that schedule . <p> For more than a week , Checkpoint has repeatedly asked Air New Zealand , the Ministry of Health and the Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield for the number of Air NZ staff who have tested positive for Covid-19 . <p> ... <p> New Zealand 's biggest Covid-19 coronavirus cluster is the Bluff wedding , where the virus has spread to nearly 100 people and killed two , including the groom 's father . <p> The cluster has been officially linked to overseas travel . An Air NZ flight attendant who had just returned from the United States and had already been exposed to Covid-19 was at the wedding reception . <p> " On 19 March , NZ5 arrived at Auckland from LAX on which three passengers tested positive for Covid-19 , at least two crew later tested positive . A crew member from that flight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wedding , and now we all know about the ' Bluff cluster ' , " an Air NZ employee told Checkpoint . <p> Four days before that , Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced compulsory 14-day self-isolation for anyone arriving in New Zealand from anywhere in the world , excluding the Pacific . <p> Despite the clampdown , Air NZ crew remained exempt at the time and have largely maintained that exemption throughout the pandemic . <p> On Monday 20 April , Air NZ 's Shareholding Minister Grant Robertson told Checkpoint it was his understanding the exemption had continued . <p> That is despite employees repeatedly raising concerns that the lack of isolation for returning crews was endangering them and other people , Checkpoint has learned . <p> A letter sent to Air NZ management earlier in April starkly laid out the issue : <p> " An Air New Zealand flight arrived at Auckland from which three passengers tested positive for Covid-19 . One in each class throughout the aircraft . Four crew later tested positive . <p> " Another crew member from that same flight , before testing positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of duty . <p> " One of those meetings was attended by yourself . If the 14-day separation rule was in place , that crew member would have remained in self-isolation at home and would not have placed other members of the community or colleagues at risk of Covid-19 . " <p> Ministry of Health guidelines exempt aircrew from 14-day stand downs between different flights as long as they appear healthy , but the same letter noted these protocols are minimum guidelines . <p> For the last four weeks my partner and I have studiously observed the lock-down rules . We have kept separate " bubbles " ( we do not live in the same houses ) . We keep grocery shopping to a minimum , observing the 2 metre distancing rule . We do n't go to the beach . We stay home . And when I go to work , I go directly to the facilities I work at ; do my job ; then come home . <p> But according to Air New Zealand , they permit their staff to work overseas and then return to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew staff are walking around our major cities . If any carry the contagion , they will be oblivious to it . <p> Some have already been stricken by the virus . <p> But Air New Zealand wo n't tell us . <p> We could get the daily rate of new cases down to zero by Friday -- only to have new infection clusters blow up at any time because an Air New Zealand crew member brought it back into our country . <p> Remember : " A person can pass on the virus to others before they know they have it -- from up to two days before symptoms develop . " <p> Shareholding Minister Grant Robertson must act on this . <p> We need to know how many Air New Zealand staff have had the virus . <p> We need to have this practice of non-quarantining cease immediately . <p> And the CEO of Air New Zealand might as well take the next flight out of this country and not come back . <p> Once again , Air New Zealand has screwed us over . As if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stain on their reputation . <p> God help us , was Simon Bridges right ? <p> " Unfortunately the Government has n't done enough and is n't ready by its own standards and rhetoric " <p> Minister Robertson can not ignore this shambles . It is putting us all at risk . <p> We 've already had one death from a transmission by an Air New Zealand staffer. <h> 5 COMMENTS <p> ... " People are cranky . They are pissed off at those who flout the rules so they can have a good time while the rest of us tow-the-line " .....

Photo : AFP <p> New Zealand journalist Anna Fifield is the Beijing bureau chief for the Washington Post and last year she wrote the book on the controversial North Korean leader - titled The Great Successor : The Perfectly Divine Destiny of Brilliant Comrade Kim Jong Un . <p> While some have questioned whether the latest photos of the dictator are genuine , Fifield says she believes they 're the real deal . <p> " I do think they 're genuine , North Korea does n't generally make up photos like this . He does n't look well , but he does n't look any worse than he did three weeks ago , " she said . <p> " He 's returned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's pretty much it , we ca n't go much further than that . " <p> Some people had noticed Kim had a mark on his wrist that was n't there previously , which could suggest the insertion of a catheter if he was going to have a stent in his heart , as was initially reported . <p> However , Fifield said his disappearance would likely remain a mystery . <p> " Maybe it was coronavirus , maybe it was his heart , maybe he was just enjoying spring break at his palace on the waterfront in Wonsan - we 'll just have to add it to the column of things we do n't know about North Korea . " <p> One of the most surprising things about Kim Jong Un , she said , was that despite his attempts to hold onto power - even having family members and top officials executed - he has not made any apparent efforts to improve his health , the " single thing which could ensure his longevity " . <p> " We 've seen him balloon over this period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . <p> " If I was a ruthless dictator hellbent on staying in power , I think I 'd be cutting out the steak and the French fries and the cigarettes and getting on the treadmill a bit more often .

" <p> Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fifield says her current role is more that of an assistant , rather than a leader . <p> " She 's there to make sure everything goes well and her brother looks the best at all times , " she said . <p> " We saw this at the opening of the fertiliser factory , where she came forward with a tray with a pair of scissors on it , which he picked up and cut the ribbon with . <p> " I think the idea that she could take over , that the old guards of North Korea would accept a 31-year-old woman as their leader is extremely difficult to imagine . " <p> Fifield said that while some might accuse China of taking advantage of a vacuum in North Korea , it had many reasons to keep the region stable . <p> " The last thing China wants is for collapse in NK , they do n't want some rogue scientist with a suitcase full of fissile material escaping over the border and heading off , " she said .

@@31821239 <p> Tayi Tibble ( Ngati Porou/Te Whanau a Apanui ) is the author of Poukahangatus , which won the best first book of poetry at the 2019 Ockham New Zealand national book awards . She is a columnist with Re : and Pantograph Punch , and her ReadingRoom essay about ihumatao is a finalist in this month 's Voyager media awards for best personal essay . <h> Book of the Week : Tayi Tibble on Rachel Hunter <p> An essay by Tayi Tibble on being beautiful , being loved and being Rachel Hunter . <p> Rachel Hunter writes in her book Tour of Beauty that she never felt like " beauty was important " when she was growing up . " Beauty was nature . As soon as I came home from school I would drop my bag and run to the safety of the bush outside , to Mother Nature 's arms . " When I was coming home from school -- in the seedy neon lighting of the early 2000s -- I would drop my bag and run to the safety of the internet , to play makeover and dress-up games , or into MTV 's arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play on repeat . And so when Rachel Hunter writes that she was n't " really bewitched by the idea of beauty at all " and " barely looked in the mirror " I 'm like , wow , unrelatable . I was completely bewitched by the idea of beauty . <p> During my childhood this enchantment manifested in a number of ways including a preferred game of pretend that my friends and I would play as kids called Boyfriends , an alternative if darisay urban take on the traditional House or Mums &amp; Dads . In this game , it was always incredibly important to describe what we looked like - eg a hybrid Britney Spears x Shakira , or Jessica Alba in Honey ( 2003 ) . During sleepovers we would accordian-fold landscape pieces of printer paper and spend hours carefully drawing our dream looks . This is my pool party look . This is my prom dress . This is my clubbing outfit . It was sort of like playing The Sims , but pohara . I remember the next door neighbour coming to play , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic imitations of lipstick , nail varnish and powder puffs from The $2 Shop . I 'd sit on the trampoline with my eyes closed while she fixed my face . " Now , rub your lips together and go ' mwah ' , like this , " she 'd instruct . " Mwah " , I 'd repeat . I 'd peer into the cloudy silver sticker inside her fake plastic compact and think wow , I look so beautiful . <p> I wanted it all for real . Mascara wands , brushes , creams , all those products and perfumes and potions . Even as a snot-nosed kid I was completely transfixed by Mum 's collection of 90s matte lipsticks , glittery body oils and especially her Eyeshadows for Brown Eyes , a little plastic palette of green and gold shimmers . I could n't wait to grow up and have a go at it myself so I did n't wait . I was forever mashing lipsticks or leaving clumsy incriminating fingerprints in eyeshadow pans , emerging from 15 minutes without adult supervision with lipliner eyebrows and night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of beauty was compulsive , as if the divine ancient feminine within me recognised the dresser as an altar , and makeup as a form of witchcraft . More than aspiring to have an established career , I aspired to have an established beauty routine . <p> But somewhere between being told off for being a tutu and mocked , for the monobrow and Monroe mole I routinely gave myself with a Vivid , I began to grow disillusioned with Paris Hilton 's skinny white blonde constructed matrix . I was beginning to see the glitches . I remember walking home from school and seeing this plump and unpleasant kid from the mob house up the street mooching around my mailbox . He pointed to the top of my head and asked , " How come your hair is always so frizzy ? " <p> Little shit . But his fat finger caused a deep enduring wound as I realised , with horror , that my hair was frizzy ; dark , wild , and different in texture from the silky straight blondes I saw while skipping through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barged past him , up my driveway and into the bathroom where I looked in the mirror and thought wow I look so ugly . <p> Then one tangy summer in Nelson , my beautiful , bored teenaged aunts straightened my hair with an iron . Ebony and Millie were a few years older than me and had a reputation for being devastating . I idolised them . I would have worn , said , done , anything they wanted , like the time I let Ebony cut me a Mullet x Double Rats tail . I remember the awful but intoxicating smell of my hair being cooked against the ironing board , sort of like petrol . When they had finished playing with me like a doll , I was stood up in front of the mirror while they teased me , " Tayi you should enter Miss Richmond Mall ! " <p> It was n't even as though I looked much better . I looked as helplessly 11 and as awkward as ever . But it was the way that I felt that was transformational . Like every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have still had flat furry caterpillars for eyebrows , but inside me was a beautiful butterfly , gently beating its wings , unbeknownst that it was also causing catastrophic knock-on events . <p> I bullied my Mum into buying me a proper hair-straightener after that and spent every morning ritualistically burning the heritage out of my hair . I avoided all watersports , and destinations without wall sockets . The modern teenager today can pretty much do the " insta baddie beat " by the time they get their first proper bra ; when I got my first bra , " raaawr xo " and being " so random " was in , and the only makeup product anyone seemed to know about was black pencil eyeliner , for being an emo . Sure , I had a hand-me-down tube of brown mascara and my own stick of pencil eyeliner I 'd use to draw grudge-like rings around my eyes for special occasions , but I did n't really venture into makeup until I left school , and when I did it was a disaster . <p> I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 18 on colonisation or being pohara but probably a healthy and interrelated mix of the two . When I first started purchasing makeup for myself it was a hectic mess of a ) not knowing what I was doing and b ) being a broke ass student . I would buy drugstore foundations like Maybelline and Australis that were cheap enough to fit into my budget . Nothing wrong with buying within your budget , but there 's something wrong with the fact that lower end makeup brands do n't invest in the same range of shades and colours that higher end makeup brands do , so the makeup I could choose from only ranged from white white to pink white to super white . Alg though . I had watched enough youtube tutorials to know " just blend it down onto your neck . " Plus I was still straightening my hair and was lowkey into internalising and emulating the western beauty standards I had been consuming for the last 18 years aka being white . But then a group selfie from the whitest of white girl parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Um how are you the whitest person in that photo ? " My mum commented , " Hi Casper the Friendly Ghost , " and I thought wow , I really need to go and get colour matched and I did . It was a revelation . <p> That 's what I began to strive for ; those little revelations , those beauty eureka moments that spark from something as simple as incorporating a new product into your skincare routine , or slightly adjusting your eyeliner technique . I remember the moment when I figured out how to gradient my eyebrows instead of drawing harsh thick blocks and the real thrill of watching my entire face soften as a result . I remember getting ready to go to Ivy one night and overhearing one of the drag queens casually remark that you should follow the lines on your face and I was like oh . I looked in the mirror and could suddenly see where my blush should go . Or how it was my bff Raife exposing me to Kpop that finally had me give up trying to contour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phat face instead . I realised that the more I practiced makeup and studied my own face in the mirror , the more I came to terms with it . The more I was exposed to different people , trends , influences , cultures , the more I came to understand that there is more than one way to be beautiful , and so the way that I look might be included too . <p> In the introduction of Rachel Hunter 's Tour of Beauty , she propositions the reader with a challenge : " If I were to say to you , ' You 're beautiful , ' how would you react ? Would you accept the compliment , or would you shy away from it , your body language giving away your sense of insecurity ? " <p> She goes on to pose the reader with a lot of questions . There are questions of spiritual nature : " Is it our soul that makes us beautiful ? " There are questions about the ethics of technology aka Instagram : " And what is a feed anyway ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at these images ? " And there are big questions , of the philosophical kind like the essential , " What is beauty ? ' " <p> To answer these questions , she travels the globe , discovering beauty secrets and rituals of other nations and cultures . She goes to Greece and learns about the ancient beauty enhancing properties of olive oil . She goes to South Korea and learns about downturned eyeliner for a puppyish look , rather than the western preference of a cat-like appearance . In Dubai , she gets a special $7000 gold chainmail face mask which she describes as being " a touch more Silence of The Lambs " than she would have liked . And back home in Aotearoa , she talks to Donna Kerridge about Rongoa Maori , and learns the beauty secrets of Papatuanuku . " When we learn to heal the bark on a tree , we learn to heal our skin , " Kerridge explains . " Our bodies are a microcosm within a network of connections that we call the universe . " <p> " Coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Rachel writes in the conclusion . " I could see the Western ideal far more clearly and the impact it has had on me over years ; brushing over or erasing my individuality , those unique quirks that make us all beautiful and different . " The biggest lesson Rachel says she took away from her tour of beauty was " the power of community " which was reiterated " time and again in every culture . " There 's an irony -- but not a cruel one -- that Rachel Hunter 's Tour of Beauty was supposed to discover new beauty secrets of the world , but what she really discovered was that obvious , old clich ? : that there are many ways to be beautiful , and that beauty is in the eye of the beholder . <p> And I believe that . I really do . Beauty is in the eye of the beholder . On one hand it 's why haters can meticulously and hatefully study your face , picking it apart until it becomes grotesque , skewed and genuinely hideous to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I 've come to know and what I really believe is that you never look as beautiful as you do through the eyes of someone who loves you . Love is like a beauty filter , blurring your imperfections and casting you in a perpetual golden hour glow . And I think if we all focused our attention on being beautiful people for the people who love us , as opposed to whatever the societal norm or standard is at any time , then maybe beauty wo n't seem so elusive or unattainable . And thus we come to my number one beauty secret , the tip that truly helped me to achieve my wonderful good looks and embarrassingly high self-esteem : finding people who really love me , and as such , think I 'm like the most beautiful woman in the world and treat me accordingly . And if you love and regard and treat people the same way , then beauty is readily available , and everywhere . <p> * <p> Rachel Hunter with Tayi and her bff Raife at a book signing at Whitcoulls in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was doing a book signing at Whitcoulls in Lambton Quay .

She kept repeating , oh my god I love Rachel Hunter and was like , sharing Rachel Hunter trivia facts with the woman behind her . Raife and I were like , eh ? ? But as the line got closer , and we were about to meet and greet with The Rachel Hunter , I started getting nervous . I have this stand out memory from my childhood of watching Rachel Hunter on this random Gilligan 's Island reality TV show and there was this challenge of walking over this narrow plank suspended over water and I recall Rachel being like , " I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , " and then she like fully killed it , and I think she was in a bikini , and I was thoroughly impressed , and that distinct feeling of childhood awe for Rachel Hunter was coming over me again . Before I could say " Raife I 'm a bit nervous " , Raife was like " Tayi I 'm kinda nervous " and we both cracked up laughing because we are so fukn dumb . <p> It was our turn to sign . Raife nudged me and quietly said , " Oi Rachel is looking at you . " I looked up and she was . " She 's sussing you out , " he teased . We handed over my phone to her resident iphone photographer and The Rachel Hunter said , " Look at you . I love your phone case . " I was like omg and speechless and felt like blushing . Luckily , I can always count on Raife , my most trusted friend . He said , " Hi Rachel Hunter I 'm Raife and I 'm a drag queen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rachel said , " Oh you like to write ? " And I was like omg did I just get shaded by Rachel Hunter ? This is the best day of my life . " Do you guys want a photo ? " she asked . We got a cute and dorky photo , and then we thanked Rachel profusely , for her service to celebrity , fashion and beauty . <p> Afterwards , as Raife and I wandered back up Lambton , Raife said , " Wow she really is beautiful and so natural too . " <p> " God yeah , " I agreed , " And so nice ! And lovely ! And down to earth ! " <p> " You look good too , " Raife added . I stopped and smiled at my friend .

@@31854237 <h> A NZ without journalists : The implications of the combustion of our biggest news groups <p> On Friday NZME , the publisher of the New Zealand Herald , took their mission to buddy with Stuff , to the High Court at Auckland . <p> ANALYSIS : Like many families during the lockdown , we gathered around the laptop at lunchtime to watch the Jacinda and Ashley show . We quivered before the announcement of the daily toll , sometimes frowned at the often repetitive and occasionally plain stupid journalists ' questions . But mostly , we were soothed . <p> Ardern 's media team are brilliant at leveraging her natural talent as a communicator . Journalists , on the other hand , have emerged from the 1pm covid shows as a pack of squabbling , nitpicking chickens , their questions literally sounding like they are shouted from another room . Essentially their role has been to highlight by contrast the uber-parent calmness and reason of Jacinda and Ashley . <p> When things are going so well , why bother with the news media at all ? It is very tempting for governments riding a wave of approval to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The power of social media advertising and direct messaging , like any new tool , can be intoxicating . <p> And this government , like those before it , has seized that opportunity , bypassing traditional media and using social media for much of its messaging . Fair enough , but the loss of that massive advertising spend has been one more blow for teetering legacy media organisations such as Stuff , NZME and Mediaworks . <p> For those who are n't media junkies , Stuff and NZME are New Zealand 's two biggest news organisations by far , in terms of readership . For the past couple of years , they 've been locked , like a couple in a bad relationship , trying to decide whether to break up or marry . <p> The Government , through the Commerce Commission , has told them it wo n't have a bar of nuptials . It is probably terrified of the idea of one massive non-state controlled media organisation pulling the public strings . In the back of its mind may be previous Labour Governments ' battles with Tory-leaning newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first Labour government in the 1930s to seize control of the then new medium of radio and TV . <p> Nonetheless , like any true-hearted suitor ( or deluded stalker , depending on your point of view ) NZME has persisted in trying to buy Stuff from its Australian owners , Nine Network . Nine has turned them down , so NZME is going to court to try and enforce an agreement for negotiations to continue . <p> Meanwhile both organisations have been waiting and hoping for the Government to front up with a promised survival package . There was nothing in this week 's Budget , so fear must be growing in the minds of StuffMe bosses that the Government really does not mind if one or both of them fall over . <p> Stuff <p> Both Stuff and NZME have published public interest journalism , writes James Hollings . <p> Would that be a bad thing ? As someone who spent 20 years working for both state and private media , and the last 15 teaching journalists to do the same , I would say yes . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of democratic states , and any news media scholar could point to hundreds of examples of its value as a check on state and corporate power in any democratic society you care to name , including New Zealand , over the past 300 years . No one can seriously argue with that , nor apparently does this government , with Broadcasting Minister Kris Faafoi making all the right noises about preserving the plurality of news media . <p> The real question is what would a healthy news media ecosystem look like ? And how much should a Government intervene to foster it ? New Zealand does some things quite well , but also has some worrying holes , compared to other western societies . <p> Firstly , it needs a mix of state and non-state . Faafoi has been keen to reform the state news sector , with talk -- so far unrealised -- of merging RNZ and TVNZ . So far , so good . State broadcasting tends to be good at news of record . But history both here and overseas shows it is inevitably vulnerable to political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string-pulling of boards and veiled periodic funding threats . <p> What would it matter if Stuff went ? There is an argument for letting it fail . Something would rise up to replace it . If you go back 150 years , NZ had legions of voraciously entrepreneurial small business owners peddling their own organs , often two or three to a town . Maybe we would end up with a similar galaxy of smaller , local , genuinely Kiwi small news outlets , better reflecting the diversity of local and social communities . Perhaps any public money would be better spent subsidising these to produce content , rather than paying organisations to survive past their time . <p> But there are problems with this vision . Large news organisations have a clout that helps them brush off the local tyrant with a lawyer . Stuff and NZME , for all their faults , have done some very good public service journalism , taking down some rich and powerful villains . <p> Big private also has the money and independence to take on bad governments -- as we saw in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with axes to grind . The UK is now in the unenviable position of having 80 per cent of its news media in the hands of five billionaires , none of whom , presumably , have had to rely on a publicly-funded hospital to save their lives . Oligarchs can be reasonably benign , like the Sulzberger owners of the New York Times , or arguably manipulative and self-serving like Rupert Murdoch . The point is , you need a mix , at least . <p> A healthy news ecosystem also needs community , and niche media . We have seen some exciting examples of niche media spring up in recent years -- the Spinoff , Newsroom , NZ Geographic . But no one should make the mistake of seeing them as a replacement for widespread , systematic community news coverage . This , to me , is the plankton-level bedrock of any healthy news ecosystem . <p> Stacy Squires/The-Press <p> A few years ago journalists could go directly to the source within major organisations , now they 're inhibited by gatekeepers . <p> Community and small metropolitan news coverage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Stuff and NZME and other smaller owners have cut hundreds of journalists . Coverage of local courts , councils , schools and hospitals has not gone completely , but has faded badly . Broadcast journalists , who lack the time and often skills and patience to sit through hours of council hearings , feed off the stories thrown up by these bottom feeders . <p> The Government has funded a few local reporting positions . This is a nice gesture , but frankly a drop in the bucket compared to the hundreds which have been lost . In the past deacde the number of journalists has probably halved . There are much fewer stories about what 's happening at your local courts , your local city or district council . With only a couple of reporters now left on your day shift , do you send one to sit in a courtroom all day to cover an important trial , or send them out to the bus crash ? Or to the local beach where the overloaded sewage system has overflowed once again ? <p> We need more philanthropic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through individuals prepared to put money into news businesses , or providing scholarships or funding for journalism content or non-profits . Government could do more to support this . <p> The news media , like any sector , tends to be preoccupied with its internal psycho-dramas , and the StuffMe marriage drama is one example . It should n't be taken lightly -- Bauer 's sudden closure of its magazine titles shows media bosses are not bluffing . But I would argue discussion has been too dominated by worries about struggling business models to the exclusion of other important concerns . <p> For example , a complete rethink of our information and publishing laws . I do n't think New Zealanders realise the extent of decades of creeping covert censorship . <p> A few years ago journalists could talk to local police officers , hospital doctors , council employees . Now everything -- companies , police , local bodies , hospitals , even sports organisations , are controlled by ' media policies ' that rival the Stasi for the utter silencing of any form of dissent . Why should companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not socially or environmentally ? <p> Our freedom of information , defamation and whistleblower laws need reform . Why should the Police Complaints Authority , Parliament , and the courts be immune to requests for public information ? Why do we maintain the right of ( inevitably rich ) individuals to browbeat news media with the threat of ruinous defamation proceedings , an ever-present and often overpowering concern for any small news organisation pondering whether to run a story by their reporter questioning some local bigwig 's dealings ? <p> I believe this is a huge and hidden barrier to true free speech . Why have we abolished the right to sue for physical injury , but maintain it for reputational damage ? I would like to see the right to sue replaced with a simple remedy of a court order for publication of right of reply . <p> Probably none of this is high on the agenda of politicians thrilled with social media 's bypass of the often flawed and sometimes partisan monopoly journalists have exercised over the fourth estate for the past 150 years . <p> But other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of a new media technology . In the 1930s , many governments thought radio and film could bypass the Tory press and help them shape a new society . <p> It was no coincidence that Truth , that populist , sordid , occasionally brilliant scourge of the establishment became the biggest selling paper in New Zealand by the 1960s . The establishment press was mostly the mouthpiece of social and business elites , the broadcast media the mouthpiece of government . Who spoke for the people ? <p> The stories we tell each other about our society , our people , and our communities help make us who we are . We need journalists to tell us about the local heroes , the villains , the in-betweens , the comic events that give us a laugh , the serious events , the risks to our schools , health , and environment that we can then come together to fight for or against . But just as importantly , we need a culture in which they can do their jobs . <p> * James Hollings is the programme leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

The distinction between effort and progress was clear to me ; progress is not the natural outcome of effort as we have been led to believe . <p> Unearned privilege is a tailwind . Those who benefit from this tailwind are thrusting forward and making headway . But each downward movement of the pedal propels them further forward because unseen forces are working with them .

@@31872240 <h> Perfectly in toon <p> Otago Daily Times editorial cartoonist Shaun Yeo in his home " office " , with his trusty desk in the background.PHOTO : STEPHEN JAQUIERY <p> Cartoonist Shaun Yeo joined the Otago Daily Times in February . Then Covid-19 happened . He talks to Tom McKinlay about the art of the topical . <p> In the days before lockdown , Otago Daily Times editorial cartoonist Shaun Yeo captured the prevailing mood with a few deftly executed lines and a little wash . <p> On the Tuesday , after Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern had announced the nation was headed for Level 4 , an oversized padlock was plunged through a solemn grey South Island -- fastened with a heart-shaped key . <p> On the Wednesday there was a heartfelt handwritten message on an empty classroom whiteboard , a sepia scene evoking simpler , happier times . <p> But then on that first day of lockdown , when another Covid-19 related cartoon might have been most expected , Yeo did something else . <p> Below the editorial , in the hand-drawn rectangle among the letters , Asterix wept . Because Albert Uderzo was dead . The Frenchman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adventures of one small village of indomitable Gauls , had died the day before . Yeo ( 46 ) was grieving . <p> " That was a little bit self indulgent on my part , " he says . <p> Shaun Yeo 's cartoon of March 26 , the first day of lockdown , paying homage to the late Albert Uderzo with a line-perfect weeping Asterix . <p> " I normally would have passed that by , but I could n't ... he was such an inspiration to me as a young kid growing up . He was probably one of three cartoonists that I admired growing up and wanting to be a cartoonist . " <p> The other two were New Zealander Murray Ball , of Footrot Flats fame , and Herge , the Belgian behind the Tintin cartoons . <p> It was back then as an Asterix fan , in his early teens , that the Winton-born , Invercargill-raised boy asked his father if he might be bought a drawing desk . <p> " We can do better than that , " his father said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He did once try to move on to something grander , a more professional looking set-up , but it did n't feel right . <p> " It 's beautiful , I love it , " he says . <p> " It has a lot of memories . I have spent a lot of time sitting at that desk . " <p> Over the years Yeo has produced galleries of work on that wooden surface , ranging from graphic design , to book illustration , advertising artwork and , of course , cartoons of all shapes and sizes . Now , on an almost daily basis , that includes the quintessential newspaper set piece , an editorial cartoon . <p> So , Uderzo 's passing had to be acknowledged , Yeo says , though also : " I ca n't believe I did that " . <p> " Knowing now what transpired ... Covid , the lockdown ... " <p> There was , it transpired , plenty of time for more Covid-19 cartoons . In fact , between mid March and mid May , Yeo hardly strayed from the topic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he served up a stricken Simon Bridges circled by sharks . <p> " Over those two months I had programmed myself to be thinking Covid cartoons the whole time , " he says . " That shark one was actually a turning point because I was like , ' there are actually other things going on now Shaun , you need to start moving away ' . " <p> Yeo 's " teddy " cartoon , one of his Covid-19 favourites . <p> Yeo 's Covid-19 experience was n't exactly a baptism of fire . Before becoming the ODT 's editorial cartoonist in February , he contributed for many years to the pages of various Fairfax titles , including weekly to The Sunday News . <p> However , he was " still sort of finding my feet as a daily cartoonist " when suddenly there was just one topic in town . <p> " If I could make people smile , or lighten the load a little bit , I took that as a huge responsibility . " <p> Not that there were n't more sombre moments . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew another grey New Zealand , with a large cross standing on the West Coast . <p> " There was n't a cartoon that I did in that period , that I did n't second guess , " he says . <p> The pencil line must walk a fine line . There were to be no laughs just for the sake of a laugh . <p> " I 've come up with a mantra to myself : you 're only as good as your last cartoon . " <p> And Yeo sounds like a pretty tough crowd to please . <p> He says that once he 's sent his cartoon off -- and assuming it 's accepted -- he spends the next couple of hours taking another very critical look at it , thinking about what he could have done better . <p> " My wife is constantly telling me , around the dinner table , ' You have to let it go ' . " <p> He launches into the sort of self-directed dissection with which those in the Yeo household must be familiar . It 's pretty searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks he 's filed a sub-par cartoon one day , that 's further motivation the next . <p> As much as he can , he tries to start each day with a clean slate . <p> " There are a few things you 'd like to comment on and there are a couple of ideas that are floating around that you think you could address . But I try to sit down each day and start from scratch , so I do n't get too far ahead of myself , " he says of his process . <p> " She 's an interesting beast , all right . " <p> The cartoon Yeo considers one of the best he 's drawn . <p> All this art , craft , guile and humour emanates from the corner of a room in suburban Invercargill . It 's otherwise referred to as the sunroom . Many years ago Yeo had his own office in the house . But then his son was born and that became a bedroom . Then his daughter was born and he was moved on again . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " surrounded by all my books and art and all of that sort of stuff but at the moment I am just tucked in a corner of the house . " <p> There 's a documentary coming in next month 's online Doc Edge Film Festival about New Yorker cartoonist James Stevenson . In it , one of his editors talks about the sleight of hand involved in the cartoonist 's craft : " As with every good cartoonist , it looks effortless , but it only looks that way because he 's put a lot of effort into it . " <p> Yeo 's work certainly ticks that box . One of his Covid-19 cartoons involved a well-rounded middle-aged gent standing in the window of his house , wearing a teddy -- a short woman 's nightgown . It 's a sight gag playing on the Covid-19 custom of putting a teddy bear in the window to amuse passing children . In the cartoon , the wife 's face is a brilliant mix of appalled and fed up as she tells him he has it all wrong , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favourites from the period . But it 's far from the piece of dashed-off slapstick readers might assume . <p> " I left that for a couple of days , that one . Because I was like , ' am I just taking the mickey ' . I had a rough sketch and my wife was a great sounding board over that period because she was locked down with me ... She saw it on my desk and was like ' That 's a cracker ' . " <p> Then when it appeared in the paper it actually gave Yeo himself a chuckle . <p> Another of the more broadly humoured sketches from the period is , Yeo says , is a favourite for another reason . It shows a man newly returned to work at the office , sitting dishevelled at his terminal in undies and singlet . His boss is only just holding it together . <p> What must be remembered is that while the content of these pieces of work is important -- the cutting edge , the pin sharp barb or observation -- so is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man whose cartoons of former Prime Minister Robert Muldoon needled him close to apoplexy at times -- noted that editorial cartoons are often the last hand-drawn part of a newspaper left . <p> " That 's my best drawn cartoon , I think , I 've done , " Yeo says of the back to work piece . <p> " Most people would n't recognise that but I really like the mannerisms of the characters and the fact he 's playing solitaire on his computer . " <p> The joke itself is a little on the weak side , he says , which can result in an overdrawn cartoon , but here the balance was just right . <p> " I love the craft , " he says . <p> " I have adored the artform for pretty much my entire life . <p> " I strive to draw well . " <p> There 's been a trend in political cartooning for the message to be all-important , the artwork less so , which Yeo questions . <p> The Crying Kiwi cartoon that struck such a strong chord after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also realistic about the process of daily cartooning . There 's always a deadline and if the idea has not come easily there can be less time for the pencil work . That can lend an energy to the finished product , he says . <p> " Energy " is a watchword he mutters away about to himself . It 's what he tries to capture and it 's often there in an initial sketch , free and loose . The trick is to hang on to it . An overdrawn piece can end up stiff and lifeless , perfection the enemy . <p> " Sometimes I 'll draw something and I 'll purposely go back and rough it up . " <p> On other occasions it all clicks and flows and the lines simply fall into place . <p> That happened one day in March last year , following the Christchurch mosque shootings , resulting in the " Crying Kiwi " cartoon that captured the imagination of millions around the globe . <p> " There really was n't a lot of thought going into that at all . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very proud it resonated with people , because it came from an honest place . <p> " When you do something like that , and you 're not doing it for kicks , you 're not doing it for hits online , that 's just what you do , you just felt you had to do something , that 's a really lovely thing . " <p> The process of drawing is not always a conscious process , he says , with the brain sending a detailed set of step-by-step instructions to the hand . <p> " That was one of those drawings where I just drew and it was a blur . " <p> Then the critic walks back into the room . <p> If he 'd known the Crying Kiwi was going to go quite as nuts as it did , he 'd have spent a little more time on it , he says . <p> Fellow New Zealand cartoonist Toby Morris has said he once feared each person was allocated an ideas jar , which once emptied remained so . <p> And indeed James Stevenson , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Yorker when he was employed to write the gags for artists who had apparently exhausted their own repositories . <p> " You just hope that the idea jar never empties , " Yeo says . <p> " Some days you panic because , you think ' I 'm buggered ' . I am just going to email the editorial team and that 's it , I 'm done , I have nothing . " <p> That 's despite the ideas part of the brain remaining in a constant state of alert , he says ; dialled into the news , tuned in to conversation , observing the queue at the supermarket and wondering what everyone is thinking , filing things away . <p> Even then , sometimes he has to sit down at the desk , pick up a pencil and just start drawing ... something . It still all starts with pad and pencil . <p> Routine can be important . <p> That was reordered somewhat during lockdown , when his quiet home workspace became filled with the rest of the family , who gained new insight into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' There 's a lot of lying on the couch staring at the ceiling , Dad ' . I said , ' I 'm still working here , mate ' . " <p> It 's politics next , an election looming . <p> And the well exercised critic appears to be hard at work , as Yeo volunteers that he 's not sure he was as even handed during the last one as he might have been -- an equal opportunity bludgeon . <p> " I would really like to sit in the middle , " he says . <p> It 's not fair if you have the privilege of prime newspaper real estate each day , to be laying into one side repeatedly . <p> " You have to stand for something , but I just want to be a little bit more down the middle . " <p> That may change , he says , if one side is simply too irritating . <p> Which brings us to the Prime Minister . She 's tricky , he says , because she 's really quite nice : " Hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some of the politicians do n't , they 're quite easy canon fodder . " <p> Other work bubbles along . Yeo also illustrates children 's books . <p> Daily cartooning is usually over by about 3.30pm , after which he takes an hour off . Then , after tea he gravitates back to the drawing desk and the children 's books . <p> " Which I absolutely adore , " he says . <p> " That 's a wonderful thing to do after doing a political cartoon or a topical cartoon , you are switching from reality into a fantasy world . It 's just nice . " <p> Then tomorrow he 'll be back at that old desk , in the corner of the sunroom , with another observation on the world as it passes . <h> Add a Comment <h> Local journalism matters - now more than ever <p> As the Covid-19 pandemic brings the world into uncharted waters , Otago Daily Times reporters and photographers continue to bring you the stories that matter .

All content is free to watch , and the public is encouraged to get involved using the #visionweekNZ hashtag . <p> As a taster of the event , we invited some of the participants to share with us their vision for post-Covid New Zealand . <p> Frances Valintine <p> As we 've seen technology leapfrog ahead in the last few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been perhaps two or three years ago with the digitisation of systems and processes . We 're finally getting in line with the other markets in the world we trade with . <p> During the lockdown everyone who could work from home changed their behaviour , and as we come out of the Covid-19 crisis that 's the new norm . Now we have to understand how our businesses can catch up with the human aspects of wanting change . I 'm really excited about the idea that the economy is going to increasingly take into account society and humanity and fairness . I also look forward to people having the opportunity to get into roles that are more about having a chance to contribute and feel valued , and less around clocking in and out . <p> Frances Valintine is the education futurist at Tech Futures Lab <p> Rod Drury <p> Through Covid we have demonstrated the power of a team of 5 million , what it can achieve .

For me , the future needs to be environmentally friendly and it needs to be inclusive . I think there has been lots of thinking about what our future could look like , now it 's time to get quite crisp with this . This requires good relationships between government and business . There are lots of ideas floating and it 's important that a really diverse group contributes to the conversation , that no-one is left behind and that decisions that are made are good for all of New Zealand -- that they are people-led solutions . <p> I think one of the really big ideas is for us to lead in electric flight . One of the cool things about New Zealand is we are a long skinny country , but you know , we 're an island -- 100% of our domestic network is flying under two hours . Imagine if we had a vision that within a 10 year timeframe we had a hundred percent of our domestic network flying using electricity . <p> You can imagine building smart networks that tie into public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electric vehicles , small buses that you can chain together with software is really , really interesting .

Our land , ocean , rivers , mountains . They are our tupuna , or ancestors , and as such we revere them . We are hardwired for collective responsibility for people and intergenerational care . <p> Through Covid I have seen a set of values show themselves through all of Aotearoa -- ideas of manaakitanga or generosity , of what it is to be good kaitiaki or stewards , through which we have shown care for people and place . <p> I do n't think we will be able to go back to the way we were .

The world that we knew before Covid was n't actually great for many people -- there was inequality and inequity everywhere . Underrepresented groups will feel the impact of this more so than any of us , so we need to make their wellbeing a priority . <p> My future vision of New Zealand would include taking the ideas around kindness that the prime minister has propagated and actually give effect to them . How do we take the values we 've seen demonstrated during Covid and allow them to live on through the coming weeks , months and years , for the benefit of everyone ? <p> I think some change is possible because we are going to find a window of opportunity where we are all united in dealing with the health crisis , but also thinking forward in terms of what it means for our children and grandchildren because the consequences of this recession is going to go on for many decades to come . <p> What 's really important is not just the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investments are the right ones .

What purpose does it serve ? And I think it 's about making sure more New Zealanders are better off . If we can be very consistent in applying that test , it is about current generations and future generations . And better off means not just this material terms , but also in non-material terms , in terms of wellbeing , in terms of happiness , in terms of mental health . <p> Shamubeel Eaqub is an economist at Sense Partners <p> Vaughan Fergusson and Zoe Timbrell <p> Our vision for the future is rapid retraining , in our communities , alongside industry and innovation . <p> We need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

@@31891231 <h> The Bulletin : Level one , zero cases . Now what ? <p> Good morning , and welcome to The Bulletin . In today 's edition : What comes next after level one move , trade minister takes aim at Europe over deal offer , and harsh report into Oranga Tamariki released . <p> Good morning , and welcome to the strange sense of unbridled freedom that you might have woken up with . The announcement that we would move immediately to level one came yesterday afternoon , and took effect at midnight . A key reason why that was possible is that the country is now down to zero active Covid-19 cases . Not a single person in the country has the coronavirus -- something that has n't been the case since February . It is genuinely a remarkable achievement for the country to have pulled off , and very few others have managed anything on this scale . <p> For some data to back this claim up , I highly encourage you to have a look at the Government Response Stringency Index -- in other words , a map which compares the harshness of the restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , New Zealand has gentler restrictions under that index than Australia , Sweden , Britain , Canada , Singapore ... almost every country except Japan in fact . For a reminder of the rules of level one , here 's a cheat sheet from The Spinoff 's Catherine McGregor . <p> In making the announcement , PM Jacinda Ardern looked back at modelling which showed how many could have got sick and died had lockdown not happened -- her full remarks can be read here . All up , yesterday marked only 75 days since the alert levels were first announced . It is hard to go past the fact that her government made a massive call to go into lockdown , knowing full well that it was a big risk , and it basically turned out exactly as planned . Justin Giovannetti has reported on the scene at parliament when the announcement was made . <p> So what now ? Economic growth has been hit very hard by the lockdown and subsequent shift down in alert levels . Ardern said that the government 's focus would now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the data is n't quite as catastrophic as it might have been , there are going to be huge challenges here . This strong comment piece on Business Desk ( paywalled ) notes that many businesses will continue to heavily restructure -- not to mention those that already have -- so that the business as a whole can survive with fewer staff . <p> And what about further opening up , specifically of the border ? Radio NZ reports that is a key concern for business now , with no clear timeline available . Ardern described the border as being " our first line of defence " , and admitted that at the moment there was no certainty around reopening timelines . A lot of people wo n't want the border to open any time soon either , even if it does have benefits for business , because of the risks involved . <p> Finally , it almost certainly is n't over at all . As University of Canterbury associate professor Malcolm Campbell put it , " we have seen other countries get into similar positions in controlling the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Dr Amanda Kvalsvig from Otago University had a similar cup of lukewarm water to throw on the celebrations , saying " having no active cases is n't really a meaningful landmark for pandemic control ... if we continue to find no new cases despite ongoing testing , that 's much more informative and so far the results are encouraging . " Full commentary on getting to zero active cases can be found on the Science Media Centre website -- another in the long list of invaluable resources the SMC has put out this year . <p> " The arrival of Covid-19 and lockdown changed The Spinoff , transforming our editorial to focus on the biggest story of our lives , taking a small team and making it a seven day a week news operation . But it also fundamentally changed us as a business , too . Prior to the crisis , around 20% of our editorial costs were funded by our Members . Now , that figure is north of 50% . The loss of some key commercial clients meant that change has to be permanent . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at The Spinoff are incredibly grateful for your help . If you 're not , and can afford to contribute , please consider doing so -- it really is critically important to our ability to cover the next phase of the crisis , in all its complexity . " <p> A harsh report from the Children 's Commissioner has found many serious issues with Oranga Tamariki and the child welfare system . The reaction to the report has also been tense . Radio NZ reports former MP Dame Tariana Turia has called for resignations at the top in light of the findings , and Whanau Ora leader Merepeka Raukawa Tait said the report demonstrated that Oranga Tamariki has an " expectation that Maori mothers will fail " . In response , the NZ Herald reports OT has rebuked the report , saying it is heavily weighted in favour of the experiences of mothers , rather than the interests of babies . <p> Prison reform advocates say the sudden death of a man in Christchurch Men 's Prison highlights the dangers of the remand system , reports Newsroom . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face trial -- let alone be convicted of the crime he had been accused of . About a third of New Zealand 's prisoners are in the remand system , and it is considered the most dangerous part of the prison system for self harm and suicide . Remand prisoners are also ineligible to go through rehabilitation programmes . <p> Some doubt has been raised about the potential of regenerative agriculture , in an interesting contest of ideas for the farming world . Rural Life reports two leading plant science academics have called for the establishment of some sort of expert panel to assess claims made about the practices around regenerative agriculture , have taken aim at what they say is " erroneous publicity " , and have argued that New Zealand 's current farming systems are world leading . It 's worth reading what the regenerative agriculture side has to say as well , and a comprehensive outline can be found in this piece on Newsroom . <p> You may have heard about District Health Board changes to prioritise Maori and Pacific Islander patients . On the face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect , but it needs to be seen in context . The NZ Herald 's ( paywalled ) Nicholas Jones has done a lot of reporting in this area , and has put together a long-read which delivers on that context , where the policy might be delivered , and what the reaction to it has been . <p> Two men , two bodies to guard , but only one of them can win . Will it be Richard Madden 's David Budd or Kevin Costner 's Frank Farmer ? <p> Right now on The Spinoff : Professor Anne-Marie Brady writes about the risks and opportunities of New Zealand 's post-Covid foreign policy . Josie Adams writes about Covid cases that linger for a long time , and what health impacts that has . Alice Webb-Liddall reports on a push from schools to change how kids are picked up and dropped off permanently . I report on many in the NZ CrossFit world cutting ties with the international fitness organisation over controversial comments from the founder . Alice Webb-Liddall ( again ) writes about ICT education and the importance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critically acclaimed pieces of media -- which are both called The Bodyguard . <p> For a feature today , a look inside the sort of political tensions that will be felt across the US over the long , hot summer . NBC News has been chronicling not just the protests themselves , but the emergence of groups of armed people who turn up to oppose the protests . Particularly in small towns , there is a deep sense of paranoia about ' outside agitators ' turning up , even if most of the protests being carried out are being organised and attended by locals . Here 's an excerpt : <p> While large rallies in major cities have been the most visible part of recent social efforts to change how police treat black people , hundreds more have popped up in small , rural towns , where residents have marched and kneeled to protest police brutality . <p> Those protests -- and some of the violence and looting that have accompanied them -- have become the source of growing skepticism and paranoia in conservative circles . The most persistent rumors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sent to small towns to wreak havoc . <p> The rumors are unfounded . But that has n't stopped people in some communities , like Klamath Falls , from preparing for the worst . Towns from Washington state to Indiana have seen armed groups begin patrolling the streets after receiving warnings about an antifa invasion , often spurred by social media or passed along from friends . Those actions have yet to erupt in major violence but often bring heavily armed people in close contact with protesters , as it did in Klamath Falls . <p> Here 's some excellent news for those who prefer to listen to their live sport rather than watch it . Newstalk ZB Sport will be broadcasting both Aotearoa Super Rugby and the ANZ Premiership free to air , starting from this weekend .

For New Zealand they see an almost -50% decline . Both countries get a big bounce in Q3 according to their projections , and that may be followed by a second hit in Q4 , harder than for the Aussies than for New Zealand . <p> In Australia , mortgage lending to both investors and owner-occupiers has fallen sharply in March and April , a five year low , and economists say it is likely to fall further in coming months before it recovers . <p> China 's consumer inflation eased to +2.4% in May , down from +3.3% in April as food price hikes , especially for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eased but only marginally .

Or even better , the mortgage brokers - borrow even more and spend . ( That ' slow recovery ' bit after the ' bounce ' ? Add a time frame , say 10 years , and it might have more relevance ) <p> Whatever you do , DO N'T borrow ! Personal debt is never good solution to a pending economic crisis . Besides borrowing only puts that money into the banks coffers , and they do n't need it , and should n't get it . At least not up front . If you must spend , try to spend in your community , and try to buy NZ made . <p> I would n't advise people to be buying a home yet . I personally think the worst of the COVID outcomes are yet to be seen . And the reports are starting to come out to support this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait - better deals are coming . <p> 3% for 5 years available now is pretty attractive for anyone buying a house if you are worried about medium term financial instability . Makes it almost universally cheaper to have a mortgage than rent , even in Auckland . <p> I assume at higher end of market ? A first home buyer with 20% deposit and $700k borrowed over 30 year would be paying about $400 a week in interest . You ca n't rent a house for that . Of course principle repayments bump that up to $680 , but that extra $280 is investment not purely a cost . <p> That 's the ridiculous position that our decision making has put us in the last few decades , especially for FHB 's ... do n't buy and be subject to the whims of the landlord . Do buy and you could see all of your hard earned deposit wiped out this year - potentially never to be seen again ( if we do a Japan and see the market decline for who knows how long - decades ? ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - because they 've thrown future generations under the bus for their own short term , unsustainable benefits . <p> If you look at fiscal and monetary policy of the last 20 years , its been all about maximising the benefit of a certain generation while not giving a toss about the future . <p> Standing by for the angry stale , pale , males ( some who just sold houses and made a $1 million untaxed capital gains ) . <p> I do n't like this - but there appears to be some truth in it - as I did n't see the greatest generation pumping asset bubbles for their own benefit . If anything it was the opposite - they were doing things to make life better for the boomers . But I ca n't say the boomers are doing the same for the benefit of generations that follow them . Just look at the news - its all falling apart because of the self interest and lack of humility and planning for ' others ' and the ' future ' <p> IO just as a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought your first house , bearing in mind prior to that it was n't all that easy to actually get finance . worked steadily at a career , upgraded your family home a couple of times , all the time reducing the mortgage , helped with educating a couple of children , retired at 65yrs with a free hold house which you still live in . Assuming that defines a Boomer what exactly would you as an individual have done differently in terms of just leading an ordinary respectable and responsible life , gone with the flow under the influence of whatever government policies affected you . Not having a go here . Just curious as to why this sort of Mr Surburban example deserves to be demonised . <p> Interesting . I realise my parents aged about 25 when they had me , worked hard and bought a house in their early forties and retired with it paid off in their early sixties . I 've done similar but bought my first house in my late-twenties ( not encumbered with children ) paid it off and I 'm now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with help from an inheritance unlike me or my parents but the other five children I 've accumulated ( with four in Auckland ) seem to have little chance of buying property although they might be able to afford it if they had the same income but lived in rural NZ. maybe if my wife and I die half of them will have enough inheritance to put down a deposit and become FHBs . Its a tough world for young Kiwis and these days depends more on your parents than your own hard work and abilities . <p> Driving interest rates to zero over the period of your working life has given you significant advantages . It all looks to be related to the decision to run inflation targeting , which includes housing costs , yet housing costs are related to interest rates that are set by inflation ( an odd chicken/egg scenario going on here ) , so we keep driving rates to zero and wonder where the inflation has gone - its in the prices ! <p> If I look at the average boomer who probably purchased their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then retiring about now , with probably about an average wage for a boomer of $100,000 ( i.e. above the average wage given experience/being in a management position ) . So they are earning 5x the cost of their first home at the end of their career . <p> Now if we look at what is ahead of current generations - if they were to experience the same benefit , they should expect to be earning around $3.5 million a year by the time they are 65 ( i.e. 5x the cost of the current house - approx $700,000 ) . But for wages to get that high , we 'd need significant inflation - which if that happens , it means interest rates are going to be significantly higher , and because there is so much debt in the system already , it means that this debt is n't manageable ... <p> So basically what has happened from both fiscal and monetary perspectives has been significantly to the benefit of boomers and any attempt to balance things out to make it fairer for future generations will collapse the system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was n't your doing , which it was n't on a personal level , but it was at a collective level . <p> How about we remove inflation targeting with dodgy CPI measurements ? If you look at house prices in real terms , prior to the 1990 's , they were pretty much flat . Now that we 've run this system , house prices ( in real terms ) have gone into the stratosphere - like the biggest bubble you can imagine . Dwarfing anything we 've seen ! But the boomer generation are like ' this is great ' - I 'm getting rich . Who cares about future generations ? I can flip houses and make $1 million profits in 7 years like Yvil . Why work when you can earn more by speculating on asset prices ? <p> The system your generation has created is insane and most probably unsustainable in my view - unfortunately , because I 'm a human being , I have to live with it and deal with it , even thought I did n't create it . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great - but they appear to care little for anything other than themselves - hence the mess we find ourselves in . Or if they say they care about future generations , they 're only referring to their own children , but do n't appear to see how the whole system is interdependent and by attempting to promote the financial interests of your own children , you are causing financial suffering for somebody else 's children . <p> You have much generalisation in there and you do n't answer the question as to how you as an individual would have approached life differently . The point is rightly or wrongly the vast bulk of ordinary people simply live their lives and end up going where the politicians lead them . And in that regard there is a telling turning point that has to be considered , because it may well have helped creat the present circumstances that you resent so much . The 1972 Kirk Labour government introduced ACC , compulsory super-an , the concept of satellite towns on a rail link , eg Rolleston , and The Property Speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also stopped a South African tour . All of that , barring ACC was voted out by an electorate consisting of mostly generations older than what are now the present so called boomers , and thus became Rob 's mob . Ca n't change history anymore than you can blame people for setting about their lives in the circumstances available and allowed . <p> What are your thoughts on the Germans in the 1930 's and 1940 's ? No responsibility as individuals , they just had to go with the flow and do what the politicians , rightly or wrongly , told them to do . Which is the basis of your argument above . <p> You could stand up against this culture of landlordism and property speculation and driving interest rates to zero , and QE - but as a generation you do n't because you like the value of your property ( portfolio ) going up . Its self interest - which is fine . But it would be nice if as a generation , you admitted it . <p> You do the German nation a rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the gallows and guillotines were well exercised by those that objected to the Nazi regime . It is ignorant and malevolent to dishonour 000 's that attempted exactly what you proclaim . <p> IO , with your ' Boomer bashing ' - how many boomers do you know actually had the ability to set the interest rates of their first mortgages , managed the market price of houses , or were able in anyway to significantly influence the price of houses , interest rates since ? And if they could , then why ca n't you ? Boomers were born into and raised in the environment at the time , they did n't get to choose , and more to the point could n't change it . Boomer Bashing is as intelligent as racism . In other words it is as dumb as you can get ! <p> If you want to blame someone , look to your politicians because it is they who have shafted generations , often to their own benefit , either through action or inaction . Wealth redistribution is just petty jealousy in another colour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your politicians and ask what they are doing to ensure your and subsequent generations get a fair go at the trough ! <p> Hating someone because they have something you have n't , or had an opportunity you did n't , or achieved something you did n't , is a measure of your character that you should be ashamed of . <p> Right , so I 'm trying to work towards equality for future generations but get told that I 'm similar to a racist . What I 'm arguing is the complete opposite of racism , I 'm after fair rights between generations . <p> I can tell you I complained long and loudly about the 23% interest rate i had on the mortgage of my first home . Made not one jot of difference ! <p> I agree with you about a fair go between generations . As to blaming the boomers , it is just like racism . It is mindless . I have spoken to politicians politely , ranted at them , written them letters all to no avail . Told one National one I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Guess how much difference it made ? NOT ONE JOT ! Voted Labour that time , guess what ? They broke a few electoral promises ! Blaming boomers is like racism - it is mindless AND stupid ! <p> Ask instead how we can sack a Government without having to wait for an election ? Ask instead how we , the people can hold our politicians to account better ? Ask how politicians can be held directly accountable for the consequences of their actions while in office ? ( Consider JK and the changes he made to some of our international agreements as detailed on this forum over a few articles in the last week that helped to screw the property market ) <p> But Boomers loved John Key BECAUSE he did nothing while this abhorrent banking transferred wealth to asset holders . That 's what they wanted , we know because that 's what they voted for , because as Mike Hosking outlined in his article titled " House prices represent success in life " - 2015 . How can you sack a government that was overwhelming voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealth transfer at that time ? . <p> You mean some Boomers loved him ? I would suggest that the real reason they voted for him was because they had come to see Helen Clark for who she truly was , and Labour had been in for too long anyway . Just because you 're a fan of Hosking does n't mean you can peddle his BS here . <p> Obviously I 'm not a fan of Hosking . What idiot would think rapidly rising house prices is a sign of success . I quoted him because he represented what many boomers believe and why John key appealing to them . <p> Jimmy ( were you ever in the Airforce ? ) I agree completely about the intergenerational unfairness . But boomers are by no means the largest voting block , so why blame them for the problems ? They were no more in control of the economic situation in NZ than you and IO are now . So in response to yours and IOs rants , why blame the boomers who had no control , and not the politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have voted differently , why do n't you and your generations vote differently to get politicians in place who will change the current situation ? <p> What kind of interest rate were you getting on your savings when mortgage rates were 23% - better than the 2% now on a term deposit ? <p> Note that high interest rates suppressed prices and provided higher returns for savings making it easier to put together a deposit . But now we have low interest rates and sky high prices , meaning saving for a home is almost completely out of reach for many . I.e. the complete opposite of what you experienced in the 1980 's and completely for the benefit of you and not the current generation attempting to save . <p> Did n't have enough to save but I think 10 - 12% at the time . And IO no one i knew had the spare to afford to save . We instead found other ways to get around the deposit problem . Our first home was achieved by borrowing from three places . As military we could get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate that met the first criteria , my wife worked at the ASB and she could get a loan at staff rates , that was a bit more , then the normal ASB mortgage got topped up to do the rest and that one really hurt ! If you think that the people in their twenties and thirties had cash to spare to enable saving , have another think . We were on the bones of our arse , and it was only through considerable sacrifice that we managed to buy our own home . There was no spare money at all , the car was a cheapy i could fix myself , no holidays that cost anything at all . <p> I do n't understand - apparently you were so broke you could n't afford to save anything at all , yet you managed to buy a house with no deposit , and you managed to service the mortgage at 23% interest rates even though before you even bought the house you had no spare money at all ? <p> I do n't know if you realise this - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really sound like it . You did n't have an expensive car ( not much of a hardship ! ) . You could afford to take holidays - so you could at least manage to get time off at the same time presumably , and they must have cost something , even if not very much . Again , being able to take expensive holidays is nice , but not being able to is n't exactly a hardship . You managed to buy a house with no deposit , and presumably the cost of servicing the mortgage , rates , insurance etc was either less than or equal to your rent , seeing as before you bought the house you had no spare money at all to put towards the deposit . <p> Being in that position - being able to buy a car , being able to take cheap holidays , being able to buy a house with no deposit , where the costs of servicing the mortgage are about the same is rent - that sounds bloody great from my perspective . Can I ask how old you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as a multiple of your income ? <p> Amongst all of that you touch on a very significant factor and that is earning power . Up until the corporatisation of Rogernomics , you could expect the boss to be earning about half as much again as someone in middle management . Nowadays you have not just the one boss but many others earning way beyond the average of the contemporaries working in the lower levels . National and local civil servants is a glaring and valid example of this change . How much then has the reduced earning power pro rata , contributed to the emerging generations difficulties when stating out , in terms of an initial house purchase . Seeing as how past generations are being accused of having failed to influence politicians to prevent the current dilemma(s) then perhaps those now concerned and now in their shoes could take up the challenge and set out and show how it can be done today in this regard . <p> Early 30s , and the house ( Pahi Pl , West Harbour ) cost $80 K ( about 1985 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was circa $20K . It was not cheaper than renting for the first couple of years at least , but got us started . And yes we tightened our belt severely to make it work . I 'd had the car from before getting married and just kept it running myself ( Mk 4 Cortina , had 240 k on the motor when i overhauled the motor , and put another 200 k on it before I sold it ) . No holidays though - we could n't afford them . I was a SNCO in the Airforce . Around the same time one of my staff came to me for help . He was a CPL with 4 children and his pay actually put him below the official breadline at the time . It was not easy . <p> " Look at politicians " - but that 's at least partly the point . Politicians do n't just do things for their own benefit , or on a whim . Policies of political parties get shaped by what they believe will be acceptable to the electorate . Behaving is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are just an individual is a bit of a cop out . <p> Excellent comment IO , It 's discouraging how willfully ignorant many Boomers are regarding how this dying monetary system has favored them at the expense of future generations . They are the property investment generation . Even children understand the logic of the game of Musical Chairs i that there are not enough chairs to go around therefore someone will miss out . Boomers took it to the next level by getting to the game a generation earlier , taking more chairs than they needed and putting " for rent " signs up on their surplus chairs before the music even began to play . <p> But that is the thing - there are enough houses to go around - its just that some people have decided that its their right to own 5 , 10 , 15 or 20 of them - or for many they just leave them empty as a tax free store of wealth . Its completely insane . <p> Houses should be homes , not wealth generating mechanisms . Its a culture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good - you know ' communities and happy families ' not greed and self interest ) . <p> The most frustrating thing is that the people I know in my life with large property portfolios are often somewhat unhappy , which is hard to process . It 's caused large social disconnection and divide . Something was lost along the way . <p> I suppose I 'm a boomer - I 'm over 65 . I 've owned 3 houses , consecutively . The first 2 required a mortgage to buy - the first was a mortgage from a solicitor , the second from a bank , just as interest rates started rising in the 1980s . The third we were able to buy outright , selling the second in the Auckland area and moving to a less expensive region . I do n't see my current house as an investment , but as a place to live . <p> I have never owned more than the house I live in . The first challenge was to get a mortgage , the next to pay it off as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have owned and two of the changes were due to location changes by work transfers . Somehow I never foresaw going about life like that , taking care independently of my own business and family , would result in me being accused of shafting someone else . <p> Jolly Penguin as a new consumer of rentals in NZ I can assure you landlords are VERY flexible . Rental rates are suggestions only and you can ask for and get basically anything you want . There are a few we have encountered who think they still are in control . I 've followed up with anyone that has acted like this and the tenants they found were always described as a " group " . I followed up again recently to find out what a " group " was and it is large groups of migrants that will lose their legal status here around election time . <p> Wow . That 's not been my experience at all in the past ( pre-covid ) - instead its been the case that tenants have essentially been asked to outbid each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the property manage I spoke to basically still had the ' old ' attitude - she acted as though my ringing to ask about the place was a massive imposition and seemed put out that I asked basic questions like ' what kind of lease is it ' ? Can I ask where in the country you are Mike1 ? <p> Even before the lockdown ( about a year ago ) , my experience in Auckland ( North Shore ) was that under $600pw you are nothing and you mean nothing to the landlord / property manager . You are one of the 120 people who want to live in that house . Over $600pw : you are the only one at the open home , you can negotiate , ask for some repairs in advance , ' free ' lawn mowing etc . <p> Hi al123 . That was so much my experience here pre-covid that I stopped even coming to NZ . I used to rent here for three months a year but got sick of the unbelievable lack of professionalism in the NZ rental market . Total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost comically different . <p> You guess that I am somewhere with higher than average problems is correct . My market is Queenstown-Lakes district . <p> Our economy will go down by whatever our primary product overseas sales go down by , plus whatever our tourism goes down by . If we get enough tourists to keep Kiwis employed , without borrowing employees from foreign countries , there should n't be too big a problem . The whole world has been sick of cheap budget mass tourism for years , so if it never comes back , I for one am happy to miss out on all they bring us . <p> Agree with your last part . We 've sold out NZ to cheap tourism which just is n't sustainable ( and ignoring how much tourism revenue is expedited offshore rather than recycling in the economy ) . But my bigger concern now is that the objective seems to be trying to find ways to get back to how things were , rather than using this as an opportunity fine new avenues for growth . <p> As long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to worry about this stuff too much . Because at the end of the day , does anything else really matter , including the world that we live in ? As long as the central bank can keep fiddling the numbers so house prices rise , climate change .... who cares ! ( note significant sarc ) . <p> And I thought that things are getting better after reading news in other places that will be out of woods soon . My colleagues received a call from his finance broker for pre approval advising that it seems that the worst is over as rate of virus is falling and giving example of stock market , which is on rise and how even house price may go up just like stock , soon . <p> For house prices to rise significantly we would need to see significant increases in wages and banks encouraging lending - across the board . But people are losing jobs or taking pay cuts with possibly worse to come . <p> But it 's OK , according to a weekly real estate mailer I received last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ie Warehouse staff ) who probably do n't even own homes ! Therefore , prices will go up . <p> Honestly , what cretinous scum bags , to even have the gall to email such a thing . <p> That 's OK , IO - landlords can just do what they always threaten to do when things are n't going their way . Put the rent up ! That 'll totally work , right ? <p> On a more serious note , I think landlords do n't realize the level of simmering resentment they have caused . Whenever some landlord pats themselves on the back for being ' one of the good ones ' I think yeah right , what do your tenants think ? And it 's entirely of their own making . Out of the landlords I have had ( and I know most of them consider themselves to be ' the good ones ' at least half have either attempted to rip me off in some way , either deliberately or out of ignorance . And I 'm sorry , but if you 're a landlord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking up your obligations on the tenancy services site to avoid doing stuff that 's actually illegal . And my experience is not uncommon - it 's true of all of my friends too . Property managers are generally the worst . On top of that is the way you get treated by property managers - as scum , essentially . Expected to bow and scrape and be grateful to be able to pay an absolute fortune for a shitbox on which there is never any maintenance done and which you get kicked out of an average once a year anyway because ' the landlords family wants to move in ' only to see it re-rented for a higher price a few weeks later . And for a lot of people they 're not just putting up with this kind of shit when they 're students - they 've been putting up with it for 20 years now , while trying to start families and provide for their own future . <p> Landlords are going to get a rude shock when the shoe is on the other foot for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some bad ones - many appear to have some strange superiority complexes going on . Like to have power and control over other people , but they failed in the work place or other parts of society so figure they 'll become a landlord . <p> If you read up on the end of serfdom there could be some similarities there with the resentment that is brewing . <p> Stagflation cant continue indefinitely - ( Japan had the luxury of growth in the rest of the world economy ) When a critical mass of consumers cant afford something , prices keep going down ( regardless of cost of production ) A deflationary spiral is more likely <p> " ... a collapse followed by a slow recovery " OECD 's two scenarios are spot on . We will have either a slow or slower recovery depending on the development of Covid19 . Whoever has the disease under control will be the first ones to onboard the recovery bus , though the bus wo n't start until it has enough passengers . <p> So back to where we were before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it comes to fiscal/monetary policy could well be defined as madness - repeating the same thing but expecting different results . <p> It feels like a race to the bottom simply to avoid what needs to be faced . It 's almost a form of cowardice in some respects . I.e. running away from facing reality , which is that you ca n't use more debt to solve debt problems . But knowing that somebody else ( future generations ) will need to , on your behalf . <p> The US fiscal deficit is not " banana republic stuff " . That is nonsense , driven by an irrational personal dislike of the current president , with the emotional response fanned by his opponents ' polarising and socially destructive propaganda . Please , let it be . We do not live in the US , thankfully . <p> Fiscal and monetary largesse in the US is really good for New Zealand . The US $ is the world reserve currency . Thus a rising US dollar causes world GDP to collapse , as well as US GDP . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to open the floodgates on monetary and fiscal policy . This is the downside of having the world reserve currency ( an " exorbitant privilege " only in the deluded minds of envious French Imperialists ) . <p> For New Zealand to do well we need to see a falling USD , as this means the world is being flooded with USD . It is in our interests to see falling USD interest rates , rising US fiscal deficits and a rising US trade deficit . <p> Firstly , GDP is a nonsense - indeed I call it a lie . It fails to account for the only stuff we need to account for , which is why the real problems do n't show up in it . And why it should be being de-promoted , or ath the very least , only quoted with attached caveats ( Warning , this measure flies blind ) . <p> Roger it is weird that people writing for a financial news source do n't understand the basic mechanics of the world financial system . A writer here called the US " Argentina " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republic " . I 'm not sure why this is complicated if finance is your thing . Without USDs being created the world system fails . You do n't have to think its a great way to run things but you really should understand it if you do n't want to look silly . <p> I think the point is that the system has failed , and it 's not just " printing some usd 's " , the volume they are printing is unprecedented , unsustainable and unbelievable . Fiat currencies have a life cycle , and people that do n't understand that should read up on it . The " system " is completely distorted , and the currency and the stock markets are just the financial tip of the iceberg . The derivatives market is somewhere in the $1.5QUADRILLION . Check out " naked short selling " , an incredible abuse of shareholder trust by brokers , selling shares many times over . The only way out is to run companies to bankruptcy . European banks are starting to use USDC , a crypto stable coin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already being used in 4 Chinese cities , and the use of the usd a reserve is at 60% and decreasing . The point being that things are changing fast . <p> Trying to get back into cattle but the US market looks a bit of a mess , I do n't know how it affects our market now we have so much product going to China . <p> " The growing backlog of market-ready fed cattle has become more apparent and worrisome this week . It simply is n't possible to accommodate all cattle offered for sale and buyers seem to be focusing on the cattle most needing to go . Lots of cattle have been standing 30 days past their out-date , some 45 days . There is a sense today that the industry is collectively bracing for what downside is to come and the unknown magnitude and duration of the decline . " This week 's estimated slaughter if 650k to 656k head , the largest since March , closing in on year ago levels of 669k- so progress continues to made there . Once the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the market can begin to digest what the unprecedented number of backlogged fed cattle mean to the market from a price standpoint . The other key point is how low do boxed beef values go in order to buy back demand . The market has never dealt with a situation remotely similar to the one it finds itself in , therefore guesswork is the name of the game . What is known is total Q3 protein production in the U.S. will be huge . End users will be able to acquire ample supplies of anything desired at dramatically cheaper prices than Q2 . Competition between proteins will increase as all vie for the consumer 's basket . " <p> This is a meat processing world where Mergers have created monsters . JBS as an example kills 13 million animals a day . That 's every single day . <p> It 's easy to forget that we have a very high cost structure compared to our competition , even in the UK farm diesel for instance is below 40p a liter today . Our costs are up with the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ %40 while NZ $ is up %20 . I worry what will happen to us as the competition heats up , expensive land , high costs , relentless inflation from non tradable sector , Council consents , new taxes , droughts , every month farms pay bills at often double what our competitors pay for like . <p> Clay hill country has it 's limits , I am trying to get into seed production , my climate is challenging with frosts . I have a vineyard I do n't talk about much , it 's been a painful experience . Sheep and beef on my hills or trees are about my options , my farm is deer fenced I 'm not running deer till my trees are bigger , deer give trees hell . <p> Oats are a success , 7 " high and going for it . I looked at some farmers in Sweden who where growing oats just for milk production , although it 's not really milk is it . They were onto a good thing with the growth in alternative milk products . <p> I enjoy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the agricultural economy that as a Jaffa I do n't really have exposure to . <p> Regarding oat milk , it 's become the staple for me and mine , most of the people in our circle of friends drink plant milk and this was n't the case a few years ago . No one is vegan and only a couple of vegetarians . Flexitarian is now the norm . I have struggled to find NZ sourced product though , our current brand has oats from Australia . An opportunity perhaps ? Best of luck <p> I was talking to my nephew who wants to farm and he was telling me how many of his friend no longer eat meat , a worrying trend for farmers . <p> The wool industry needs a column of its own . <p> From PGG <p> ' Mackay said the wool market was in real trouble as it was down 25 per cent from where it was in late February and early March . Two recent auctions saw full length crossbred fleece least affected and strong lamb 's wool suffering the most , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not alone , as Australian wool prices had also taken a hit and fine wool prices had halved since September 2019 , said Mackay . <p> For some historic perspective Mackay spoke of 1968 where he would get NZD $5 at auction for strong wool , and that same wool today was estimated to get NZD $1.70 a kilo . ' <p> Where are you AndrewJ ? I have been analyzing the beef market a lot in NZ the last few weeks it would be really helpful to talk directly to a producer . Let me know if this is something you are interested in . <p> When I was in California cows with calves at food were selling for $2800 , they dropped to $1000 and our schedule here hardly moved . The works here must have done well out of the grinding market for the past few months . <p> I had agents trying to talk me into heifers before Christmas at $1150 a head , man I would have taken a hiding , some R2 bulls made 2k in the store .

Up more than 494% from April , the country managed to piece together 22 thousand units last month . And that was still 93.7% fewer than had been assembled during May 2019 . <p> Auto production had been down almost 99% , so the rebound to -93.7% seems especially large particularly when you focus in on the short run rate of change . Near 500% sounds like an awesome turnaround , a sign of maybe something big , if that 's all you know .

Wait and see but upside from here looks small . <p> Lets stop the bus . This pandemic was generated and spread throughout the globe by China and their residents .

The Christchurch experience tells us it will be vital to concentrate support on maintaining firm viability in order to support the longer-term livelihoods of workers . A wage subsidy scheme when the firm no longer exists will not be effective beyond the length of the subsidy period ! <p> The Government 's wider support to businesses is like a form of business interruption insurance ( i.e. insurance for times of disaster ) for firms -- a point made by Alistair Milne in the UK . Most of the firms receiving support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the premiums for ) this type of insurance . Perhaps the Government could institute a small but ongoing post-pandemic corporate tax surcharge on recipient firms to pay an ex post premium on ( notional ) insurance contracts that recipient firms could have adopted -- and paid for -- in pre-crisis times . <p> In New Zealand , Richard Meade has suggested an intriguing variant of Milne 's approach . Meade outlines a scheme whereby eligible firms and households apply for a loan from government that is then repaid through the tax system , as is the case with student loans . This scheme would enable firms and households to borrow against their future income , which ( for good reason ) banks are often loath to do . <p> Both the Milne and Meade proposals are based on the understanding that in order to retain employment -- and hence to promote a key determinant of wellbeing -- support for firm survival is critical . <p> A key test of the wellbeing focus of policy over coming weeks will therefore be the extent and nature of the Government 's support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a wellbeing focus now translates into policies that do their utmost to support firms ? <p> Help us create a sustainable future for independent local journalism <p> As New Zealand moves from crisis to recovery mode the need to support local industry has been brought into sharp relief . <p> As our journalists work to ask the hard questions about our recovery , we also look to you , our readers for support .

The go to plan for traditional High schools always seems to be threats , which is a shame in the information age . My kids were given a choice of Liberal or Traditional High Schools on the basis of Liberal will treat you as an adult so expect you to self motivate to learn while traditional will treat you as a child and will insist on motivating you with rules that must be obeyed .

Well of course all lives matter but the point is , black lives matter too and for too long they have been disregarded .

Look at the way Aborigines in Australia have been treated . <p> Roy Edwards -- You miss the the point completely .

" <p> With her autobiography , the congresswoman and mother of three traces her trajectory from her 1995 arrival in the United States ( when she quickly realized the disparity between daily life and the idyllic videos shown to new arrivals ) , to her struggles as an immigrant and woman of color that would motivate her to enter politics . <p> Normally private about her personal life , Omar writes about the challenges she faced during her pregnancies and in her marriage and why she decided to isolate herself in North Dakota -- away from most of her family for a year . <p> She also describes what led to her nomination as the representative for Minnesota 's 5th Congressional District in 2019 . <p> The result is a story that reimagines the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " American dream " at its center . <p> " As someone who really is a complete unicorn in American politics today , I wanted to give the readers the opportunity to really get to know me on a personal level , " Omar says . " And give them the chance to see the kind of trials and triumphs I 've had . ... Your today never really has to determine your tomorrow . There 's always a brighter day if you 're willing to fight for it . " <p> While she 's willing to open up now , that was n't always the case . The congresswoman admits that even her kids -- Isra , Adnan and Ilwad -- were n't aware of the trauma she 's experienced . <p> " I was reading it to my oldest daughter . And she was like , ' You 've never talked about any of this , ' " Omar recalls to PEOPLE . " And so , it is not only painful , but it 's also therapeutic . It 's allowing for me to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people that I represent who have been on this journey with me , see me as an inspiration . They now get to see the full story . " <p> Omar shares her three children with ex-husband Ahmed Hirsi . They legally divorced in November 2019 . She is now married to Tim Mynett , with whom she has denied having an affair . <p> Omar first married Hirsi in 2001 when she was 19 . In her book , she writes about the struggle to be a traditional Muslim wife and mother while also getting her college degree . Just after their first wedding anniversary , she gave birth to daughter Isra . Still working on her associate 's degree , Omar was anemic and weighed approximately 89 lbs . when she learned she was pregnant with twins , according to her memoir . <p> She was devastated when she miscarried at 13 weeks . <p> " I wanted to give people the opportunity to really see how curvy and bumpy and painful my journey has been , so that they can use that as inspiration when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is often a very lonely thing when you 're going through stuff in life , " she continues . " You think you might be the only one who 's struggling ... My hope is that reading my book would give people the opportunity to know that that is n't true . " <p> Omar found some comfort when she reconnected with her faith after visiting with family in Sweden in 2005 . Around this time , she also started to wear a hijab , a traditional Muslim head-covering -- a decision that was for herself and no one else , she explains . <p> But by 2008 , she experienced an " early midlife crisis . " She was buckling under domestic and community expectations . " What was I living for ? It was n't me , " she writes . <p> Dey Street Books <p> Omar began to doubt her marriage , her family and even her relationship with her kids . Some days she would hug them tight , while other days she could n't bring herself " to interact with them , let alone embrace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 2008 , Omar and Hirsi were estranged and divorced religiously , though not legally . ( In the Islamic custom , he just had to declare that their marriage was over . ) <p> Omar shaved her head . She then moved out of state with her kids so she could attend North Dakota State University . Originally she planned to get a bachelor 's in nutrition , she writes . <p> Instead , she realized her interest in politics and switched to international studies and political science . After a year of separation from her family , and a trip back to Somalia with her father , Omar began to truly process her past and what centered her as a person for the first time . She was also able to reunite with Hirsi . ( They had their third child , Ilwad , in 2012 . ) <p> " The breakdown of my marriage , like that of my relationships with other family members , was a direct result of my unresolved conflict over the fact that while people and places I loved had been destroyed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What America Looks Like . " I had to learn to forgive myself and fully accept the woman I had become , before Ahmed and anyone else could do the same . " <p> Professionally , there were other challenges : She writes how she was attacked verbally and even physically because of her identity as a black Muslim woman . She remembers in her memoir once getting a concussion after she was punched and hit at a rally . <p> Unabashedly progressive , Omar has been a target of conservatives since her election . Her politics -- including pro-Palestinian views in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict , what she says were missteps when talking about Israel and her vocal support of other left-wing policies -- have sometimes drawn wider criticism . <p> In her book , she also addresses ugly conspiracy theories that sprang out of simple facts . <p> She did apply for a marriage license in 2002 and again in 2009 ( when she eloped during her first split with Hirsi ) , she writes . But tabloids used these facts to support a theory that Omar illegally married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea she has called " absurd and offensive . " <p> " It 's heartbreaking for someone like me , who is not only private but sees themselves as a fighter , to feel stuck in my notoriety . That I ca n't really fully fight my way out of this one , " Omar says . " The constant battle of figuring out which fight to pick and minimizing certain damages to my father 's sanity , has been the most difficult part of this journey . " <p> She continues : " I was raised by a very prideful man who 's raised his daughter to be prideful . To know that I put him in a place which he ca n't defend me and where I ca n't also defend myself is ... it 's like being hostage to your status and to your position and notoriety . " <p> On March 13 , Breonna Taylor was shot at least eight times in her home by police <p> Omar 's focus , she says , is continuing to fight for her constituents . In the wake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ custody in her home city of Minneapolis -- after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes -- Omar has introduced legislation to combat police brutality and systemic racism in the justice system . <p> " I have been organizing in the Twin Cities , not just against police brutality but for racial justice and equality , for a really long time , " Omar says . " Now we find ourselves with the brutal killing of George Floyd by the Minneapolis Police Department . And finally recognized that there is no amount of reform that can be instituted that would make this extremely disturbing police department more functional for all of our residents . " <p> " It 's liberating to hear the call to action from demonstrators , " she continues . " We need to radically think about what public safety should look like in the future . How do we adequately address substance abuse and homelessness and many of the societal issues that we have criminalized in a way that is more just and preventive , rather than punitive ? What role , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going forward ? " <p> The congresswoman also addressed President Donald Trump 's rhetoric about the unrest , including saying he would send in the military to states that do not quell demonstrators to his satisfaction . <p> While the majority of protests have been peaceful , some have seethed into violence and destruction -- and Trump has responded with his own threats . <p> " You have a president who is spending his time talking about the ' vicious dogs ' he has and the kind of armed brutality he is going to bring to crack down on demonstrators , which is the way in which tyrants and authoritarians speak , " Omar says . " So we 're working on policies to check those powers . And make sure that there is no transgression against the administrators , and that there is the restoration in belief in our constitution and in our democracy . "

@@31907239 <h> Ministry 's handling of cancer diagnosis during lockdown a ' disgrace ' , top oncologist says <p> The 22 Covid-19 deaths will pale in comparison to the wave of deaths from cancer that will hit New Zealand , a respected oncologist predicts . <p> Recently retired oncologist Dr David Lamb , who worked in the cancer sector for more than 40 years , was the head of radiation oncology at Wellington Cancer Centre , and currently holds an academic position at Victoria University , has called the Ministry of Health 's handling of cancer diagnostics during lockdown a " disgrace " . He says the move has signed the death warrant for hundreds of Kiwis . <p> The figure is in line with what other countries experienced during lockdowns designed to contain the coronavirus pandemic . The report has prompted swift action from district health boards ( DHBs ) to catch up on diagnostics . <p> But Lamb said the catch up would only have worked if New Zealand was on top of diagnostics prior to the virus hitting New Zealand . <p> " The 22 deaths from Covid is going to appear tiny compared to the excess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . <p> " This is as a result of lockdown not permitting cancer diagnostic services to continue their essential work . It should have been ramped up like the supermarkets . " <p> Lamb said the already stretched waiting lists for diagnostics would be further impeded by the thousands missed during the lockdown . <p> " That is complete garbage , " ' Lamb said . <p> " This concept that we should catch up on just the April cases in three months is really quite ridiculous . <p> " Let 's say in June the cancer diagnostic services are back to normal . We 've got all the cases that would have come in during June , which is about roughly 2000 new cases each month , and we 've got this thousand from April that we did n't diagnose . <p> " It 's bound to take a long time to clear that backlog of cases and a lot more cancer patients are going to die as a result of that . <p> " What I 'm saying is that my modelling says there are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be around for a number of years rather than months . <p> " And therefore , the number of deaths is going to be in the hundreds , not in the 10s . Or just a few . " <p> BRADEN FASTIER / STUFF <p> Nelson man John Mitchell , 78 , is lobbying the Government for a tax exemption on unfunded cancer drugs . <p> Cancer Society Medical Director and oncologist Dr Chris Jackson said studies from the United Kingdom , suggested New Zealand had a three-month window to capture the 1031 people who were not diagnosed during lockdown or risk the deaths of 400 people . <p> The Cancer Control Agency was established in December 2019 . <p> The agency 's chief executive Diana Sarfati said there was no modelling on the impact of delayed diagnosis but some work internationally was progressing . <p> Despite the figures in her May report showing a 47 per cent decrease in cancer diagnostics during the lockdown , Sarfati said time-sensitive diagnostic services had continued . <p> Sarfati said Lamb 's estimates were likely based on UK studies which focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut down for three months . <p> She said recent figures showed there had been a seven per cent decrease in new cancer registrations and an 8.6 per cent decrease in breast cancer diagnosis to date . <p> The-Dominion-Post <p> Diana Sarfati is head of the new Cancer Control Agency . <p> Her report had found that cancer treatment services " were well-maintained during the lockdown period , " she said . <p> Asked about diagnostic waiting lists prior to Covid-19 , Sarfati said testing for cancer includes a wide variety of tests depending on the clinical context . <p> Sarfati would not provide figures on pre-Covid wait times for testing for the top three fatal cancers in New Zealand : lung , colorectal and breast cancer . Instead , she said there were many ways to test for cancer , including biopsy , radiology , scans , blood tests , mammography , and colonoscopy . <p> " Depending on what symptoms people have , their doctor will organise the relevant tests . For more complex tests , patients are prioritised to ensure the most urgent tests are done first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no major systemic delays for breast cancer prior to the virus . <p> The Government had recognised there were delays and committed to developing an early access programme in its Cancer Action Plan , Henderson said . <p> " The situation with Covid-19 has clearly caused great disruption , but this ca n't be an excuse to push this important commitment to the back of the queue . <p> " More than 650 women in New Zealand die due to breast cancer annually and funding an early access programme would result in fewer deaths , so we need to see action on this now , " Henderson said . <p> Lamb said there were long wait lists for diagnostics in other areas as well prior to Covid-19 . Lamb himself said he had recently had a colonoscopy which he had to wait four months on the public waiting list for . <p> The wait time under private health insurance was two to three months . <p> " So , you know , a lot of the arguments that are going around about more money will fix it is absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at colorectal cancer the private system does n't have any slack . The public hospital is under-resourced . You need skilled individuals and it takes years to train these people up , " Lamb said . <p> " So a lot of money poured in the top of the system is going to make absolutely no difference to how long you wait for your cancer diagnosis because you need extra people who are in short supply and believe you me I have sat on a number of committees that told the ministry this on multiple occasions . " <p> Lamb said he had little faith in the newly-established Cancer Control Agency . <p> " They 're making the statement that cancer diagnosis was allowed to continue during lockdown and it was patently obvious it was n't because we missed a thousand cases that we would normally have diagnosed . <p> " Having an X-ray or a scan or a mammogram is just separating out those patients who are more likely to have cancer from those who probably do n't . <p> " You can only diagnose by getting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the microscope ... That 's the only way you can actually make a diagnosis of cancer is by looking at the tissue under the microscope and that did n't happen . " <p> The-Press <p> Cancer Society Medical Director and oncologist Dr Chris Jackson . <p> But Jackson said the Cancer Control Agency was exactly what the country 's cancer sector needed . <p> The reporting by the agency and its strong commitment to closing the gap was already being seen , he said .

This combination of poor vaccination and malnutrition could increase the risk of these malnourished children having worse outcomes from the outbreak . <p> " One of the most important parts of our Ebola response in the Democratic Republic of Congo was community engagement and raising awareness - and this is essential again for our COVID-19 response in Cox 's Bazaar .

@@31916237 <h> Idea : Let 's not mess up Auckland to save ratepayers 47 cents a week <p> Auckland has made painstaking progress toward becoming a functioning modern city . Now its councillors may put that in jeopardy for a proposal that will save ratepayers an average of 47 cents a week . Hayden Donnell reports . <p> In the depths of the Covid-19 lockdown , Auckland 's councillors started coming under pressure from a familiar antagonist . It was early April . The city 's economy was on life support . Businesses were hemorrhaging jobs . Anti-rates campaigners lifted the stone lids from their ancient sarcophaguses and started shambling into action . Jo Holmes , spokeswoman for the Auckland Ratepayers Alliance , put out a statement saying Auckland 's economic system was unrecognisable from when mayor Phil Goff was elected on a platform promising 3.5% annual rates rises . " The mayor needs to scrap his old spending priorities and urgently rejig council finances so he can assure Aucklanders of a rates freeze , " she said . <p> Holmes ' ideas have often been brushed off in recent years . The Ratepayers Alliance is an offshoot of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government 's wage subsidy and making extensive use of a human-sized pig costume . During one round of media interviews in 2018 , Holmes appeared not to know how rates actually work . This time things were different . Her argument won support , not just from the usual crowd of spendthrifts , but from usually unsympathetic councillors . When the council 's governing body met to discuss how they would overhaul their finances in light of the pandemic , Goff suggested a compromise to fend off the possibility of a rates freeze . He proposed that council consult on a 2.5% rates rise alongside its planned 3.5% increase . <p> At first glance , that compromise sounds sensible . Aucklanders are still reeling from a one-in-100-year pandemic . Some have lost their jobs . Raising rates seems politically unpalatable with an economic depression looming . <p> On second glance , it may be the worst idea a council body has had since nearly ruining Christmas . Though it does n't sound like much , a 2.5% rates rise would be shockingly self-destructive . It would necessitate deep , wounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which would disproportionately affect lower-income people . In return it would save ratepayers , all of whom own property and may already be among the city 's wealthiest residents , an average of 47 cents per week . <p> Auckland Council 's emergency budget was forced upon it by the Covid-19 pandemic . It was always going to be depressing . The council lost $525 million in revenue during the crisis , with everything from zoo ticket sales to airport dividends crashing . North Shore councillor Richard Hills says the council would 've had to raise rates by 30% to keep every plan from its pre-Covid budget . Even with the previously planned 3.5% rates increase , deep cuts will be needed . Jobs will be lost , and worthy projects will be deferred or cancelled . <p> But those cuts become gaping wounds under the proposed 2.5% rates increase . The figures are depressing . According to the council , a 3.5% rates increase would mean paying $1.82 more per week on average for ratepayers . A 2.5% increase works out to $1.35 more per week . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget . Under a 2.5% rates increase , public transport fares -- already raised in January -- will likely rise yet again . Fare concessions for groups including the elderly and children will likely be removed . Libraries may close . Walking and cycling projects will be " extensively " deferred , and climate action will be delayed . Those changes either wo n't happen , or wo n't be as severe , under a 3.5% rates increase . <p> Graphic : Generation Zero <p> The impacts of a lower rates rise are so extensive , partly because of the way local government 's finances are structured in New Zealand . Auckland Council 's debt is capped by legislation at 2.7 times its revenue , meaning every dollar of lost income results in a corresponding reduction in its borrowing power . Unless rates are put up later to make up for the lost revenue , that reduction compounds year upon year . In other words , 2.5% rise wo n't only mean $17m in revenue and $45m in capital are gone this year ; around $200 million in revenue and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire 10 year budget . <p> Though implementing a rates cut might look good in the short-term , Hills warns the downstream impacts wo n't be as popular . " I think to save 47 cents a week and see the city grind to a massive halt could be seen as irresponsible by a lot of people , " he says . " A lot of us will have to look deep in our hearts and minds and ask ourselves ' is saving 47 cents per week for the average household worth the deep cuts to local board budgets ? ' . People are going to notice when maintenance does n't happen . I do n't want to close our libraries . " <p> The Green Party 's local government spokesperson Chl ? e Swarbrick is more direct . " What is presently being proposed by Auckland council is absolutely disastrous to communities and for the climate , " she says . " And it 's regressive . It 's going to hurt our least well-off the most . " <p> The council 's proposed financial self-immolation is more confounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some parts of the economy are almost back to normal . Many of the people who felt financial strain during lockdown are now back at work . Those still in trouble could potentially benefit from existing rates relief programmes . <p> Despite that , it 's understood a vote would be tight if it were held today . Goff is still non-committal on the idea of a 2.5% increase . " The economic downturn will mean that Aucklanders generally will have lower incomes and we need to be mindful of that when setting the rate , " he says . " My preference is for 3.5% but I will be listening carefully to what Aucklanders tell us in the submissions process . " <p> Central government could help soften the impact of the Covid-19 crisis on the council 's books . Goff , Hills and others have repeatedly called on the government to stop charging GST on rates , which the mayor has called a " tax on a tax " . The proceeds from that move alone could almost pull Auckland Council out of its fiscal hole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fix this issue overnight . " <p> Though that 's unlikely in the immediate future , help could come in the form of government funding for some of the " shovel-ready " infrastructure projects currently on the council 's books . Finance minister Grant Robertson told business leaders on May 21 that the government would make a decision on which projects to fund within weeks . Despite that assurance , the council has received " radio silence " on the potential funding recently , Hills says . " I 'm pretty depressed that we do n't know . I 'm concerned that there 's some kind of anti-Auckland thing going on . " <p> Goff says he 's written to the government asking for a prompt decision on what projects will be funded so it can be factored into the council 's budget . In the meantime , the council is looking at passing a rates rise which would be disastrous for the climate and the future shape of the city , while the government sits on its $20 billion in unspent money from Budget 2020 . <p> For years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becoming a modern city built around walking , cycling , and public transport . Now even that glacial progress is at risk . Councillors have the ability to avoid some of that damage by choosing not to adopt their own poorly conceived proposal . If they wo n't do that , Robertson may have to save New Zealand 's biggest city from itself . A decision on the budget is set for July 16 . He has until then to make up his mind . <p> The Spinoff is subject to NZ Press Council procedures .

@@31916239 <p> The Bank for International Settlements has highlighted a huge global spike in use of contactless payments since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic and also - contrarily - clear signs of cash hoarding in some countries . <p> BIS is owned by 62 central banks , representing countries from around the world that together account for about 95% of world GDP . Its head office is in Basel , Switzerland and it has two representative offices : in Hong Kong SAR and in Mexico City . <p> In its annual economic report , BIS says contactless payments have surged globally to more than 33% of ' card-present ' transactions from just over 27% in September . It also noted rapid growth in e-commerce , the slide in cross-border transactions and a forecast 20% drop in migrant remittances . <p> In New Zealand , Retail NZ chief executive Greg Harford says he does n't have any stats on the matter as such , " but anecdotally , I can confirm that we have seen a huge jump in contactless sales since the arrival of Covid-19 on our shores . There has been strong customer demand for contactless payments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the last few months . That has helped encourage customers to pay contactlessly " . <p> " Retailers have been driven to turn on contactless because of customer demand , but have been supported in that decision by the banks generally waiving fees for contactless debit , especially for SMEs , " he said <p> BIS has cited " at least four reasons " for marked changes in retail payments patterns after the onset of the pandemic . <p> First , it says public concerns about viral transmission from cash have risen . Scientific evidence suggests that risks are low compared with other frequently touched objects . Yet consumers in many countries have stepped up their use of contactless cards , and the pandemic could drive greater use of digital payments . <p> Second , as in past periods of uncertainty ( eg the expected Y2K glitch in 2000 and the Great Financial Crisis of 2007 -- 09 ) , precautionary holdings of cash have risen in some economies -- even as its use in daily transactions has fallen . <p> Fourth , cross-border transactions have collapsed .

@@31920234 <h> The Bulletin : Auckland drought leads to fears of severe water restrictions <p> Good morning and welcome to The Bulletin . In today 's edition : Auckland drought leads to fears of severe water restrictions , exclusive new poll results on government 's Covid-19 response , and is a resolution coming at Ihumatao ? <p> The Auckland water crisis is n't getting any better , and the city 's leaders are getting extremely nervous about the coming months . That is clear from the news yesterday that mayor Phil Goff has pitched for an application for water from the Waikato River to be part of the government 's fast-tracked Resource Management Act process . As the NZ Herald 's Bernard Orsman reports , the Waikato-Tainui iwi have objected to that , on the grounds that the project is n't at all Covid-related , and therefore should n't be part of a targeted Covid scheme . And a second point has been made by Waikato Regional Council chairman Russ Rimington , who says that Auckland delayed far too long to introduce water restrictions , starting them in May compared to Hamilton which had them in place last October . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would still take about a year to get pumping . <p> How bad is the situation right now ? It 's very concerning . Watercare keeps stats on storage dam levels , and at the moment they 're sitting at about 45% full -- the average for this time of year is more than 75% full . Total water use is coming down slightly , and there have been some good days of total use coming in under the target -- for example yesterday Watercare tweeted that " AKL used 389,601m3 and on Sat the usage was 397,729m3 -- both well below our daily target of 410,000m3 . " Households can of course do their bit here , and that accounts for more than half of the water used across the city . There are looming concerns though that commercial and industrial water users will start to see much heavier restrictions , which would put thousands of jobs at risk , reports Stuff 's Todd Niall . <p> And how bad will it get by summer ? Unless there is either extremely heavy and prolonged rain , or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a shocker . Stuff reports that further household savings will be harder to achieve , because there are already bans on outdoor use -- wasteful activities like washing the car and the like . That piece describes the chances of severe restrictions this summer as " touch and go " . <p> What is the long term picture ? At the moment the drought is being described as a ' one in 200 year ' event , but that 's based on normal climate patterns , which are gone forever . The reality is captured in this excellent feature by Radio NZ 's Kate Newton , who has looked at weather projections for the next few decades . It 's going to get much hotter and drier , and currently it 's not at all clear that we 're ready for that . <p> " The arrival of Covid-19 and lockdown changed The Spinoff , transforming our editorial to focus on the biggest story of our lives , taking a small team and making it a seven day a week news operation . But it also fundamentally changed us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , around 20% of our editorial costs were funded by our Members . Now , that figure is north of 50% . The loss of some key commercial clients meant that change has to be permanent . If you 're already a member , please know that all at The Spinoff are incredibly grateful for your help . If you 're not , and can afford to contribute , please consider doing so -- it really is critically important to our ability to cover the next phase of the crisis , in all its complexity . " <p> The government has confirmed that returning New Zealanders are a much higher priority than those needing limited quarantine facilities for economic reasons , reports Interest . The cost at this stage is in the tens of millions of dollars , and in the future returnees may be required to cover some of that for their stay . Despite what you may have seen with some Vision NZ party grandstanding yesterday , the border largely does remain closed . When it comes to returnees , it would not be legal to block New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound moral case for it . A range of other legal and border measures were announced yesterday , which you can read about in our live blog . <p> Meanwhile , we can exclusively reveal new polling results on how people are feeling about the quarantine system , the government 's overall response to Covid-19 and more . The Spinoff/Stickybeak survey , taken over the weekend , has found that the events of last week dented public confidence in the response , even if it remains at high net positive levels . Opinion is more split on confidence in the quarantine system specifically . And enthusiasm for a travel bubble has started to diminish , with just under half of respondents saying it should n't be a priority at all . <p> As for new cases , there were two more yesterday , with both people in managed isolation . Dr Siouxsie Wiles has put together an excellent piece outlining why the types of new cases we have seen so far do not give any reason to panic . Yes , some aspects of the quarantine system have been badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reiterate the point made in the last few Bulletins , there is still no evidence of renewed community transmission . And that remains a very unusual situation compared to what the rest of the world is going through . <p> Could an agreement finally be coming on Ihumatao ? One News ' Jack Tame reports that it could be very close at hand . Among the details revealed in his story last night -- PM Jacinda Ardern is understood to have been personally involved in the negotiations , and has set a deadline for negotiations at the end of this month . It is also understood that the next stage of the resolution would involve the formation of a ropu whakahaere -- effectively a trust with a board who would decide on the next steps . <p> Amid all the back and forth about whether Auckland 's port should move north , plans are going ahead to try and deepen the shipping channel , reports Brent Melville for ( paywalled ) Business Desk .

The NZ Herald 's Kirsty Johnston reports that the organisation has the lowest rate of actually following up with an investigation , at fewer than a third . By contrast , Auckland University has investigated every sexual harassment complaint made over the past five years . It follows a particularly ugly and prolonged case in which AUT 's former Pro Vice Chancellor Max Abbott allegedly stalked and harassed a colleague over a two-year period . <p> A complaint has been laid with the IPCA over an arrest in which police brutality has been alleged . The incident was captured on video , and Radio NZ has a story about what happened -- the established facts are that a man was tagging a wall , before being arrested by several officers who tackled him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he " violently resisted " arrest , while the man says he did n't resist at all . It has sparked debate about the use of force by police over minor crimes , with Manukau barrister Kingi Snelgar arguing that it was concerning and disproportionate . <p> Farmers in the Taranaki region have smashed out the planting of hundreds of thousands more native plants , reports the Rural News Group . Around 1200 landowners took part in the annual scheme , that allows farmers to buy the plants at cost from the regional council , with the overall goal of improving freshwater quality . Reporting from Radio NZ last year indicated progress is being made here , even if there is still a long way to go for many waterways . Still , the scheme is voluntary for farmers to participate in , so good on them for doing so , and long may it continue . <p> Right now on The Spinoff : Catherine Delahunty writes about taking the government to court over a new mine waste dump near Waihi on the Coromandel peninsula .

Photo : Unsplash / Rosan Harmens <p> Paul Madgwick , the chairman of Te Runanga o Makaawhio raised the issue at a meeting of the TeTai Poutini Plan committee this week . <p> The committee has begun to tackle rules and objectives for tourism and open spaces as it works on the draft plan it aims to complete before the next local government elections . <p> Madgwick said the Pounamu Pathway project , with its new tourism hubs up and down the Coast , was exciting and would change the landscape of cultural tourism from Kawatiri down to Awarua-Haast . <p> " What we do need to be careful of , of course , is over tourism , " he said . <p> " We 've had that ; been there and it was n't a good experience for the West Coast - we have n't had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left to the whim of each council and individual leaders and it 's created something that 's hard to hold the tail of .

@@31921237 <h> The debasement of art in schools <p> This month , the Ministry of Education 's Creatives in Schools programme received a $4 million boost . But leading arts educators say the scheme fails to create lasting change for a system in crisis . New Zealand has led the world in this area before , writes Mark Amery . <p> From the 1880s through to the 1930s , influential American philosopher and former primary and secondary school teacher John Dewey wrote passionately about the role of art in education . For a glorious period in the mid 20th century , his ideas were to come to flourish in New Zealand and encourage a cultural renaissance . <p> Dewey believed in learning through doing , rather than passive receiving . He would have struggled with learning by Google . Dewey believed art was vital in extending connections for young people with what is good and right ; expanding their perception of the need for understanding of others and our environment , creating in them a desire for action . Art , he wrote , excited potential for meaning and for insight into society . Dewey believed every person was capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of social interaction that would benefit the world . <p> " Transformative experiences , " he wrote in 1934 , " occur when people intuit new concepts that occasion seeing in valued ways . " For Dewey , art allowed people to come to understand and empathise with the environment around them . Art was a tool to " erase bias " , tied to " democratic citizenship " , enabling people to be self-directed and responsible : " to take charge ... adapt to change ... participate in the shaping and directing of those changes " . It would do well to remember this when looking at ways to deal with reports of rising violence in primary schools and the knock-on effects of Covid-19 . <p> And yet John Dewey 's ideas remain out of step with an education that nurtures consumers of information , rather than producers , makers and critical minds . A system that silos different disciplines away from a more holistic ( and potentially matauranga Maori-based ) learning . A system that sidelines the central role of the arts to act as a connective tissue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foremost about ideas and bridging fields of knowledge . Introduced in 2002 , NCEA has not made this better . <p> This is an education system that has commodified the fine and applied arts as part of a huge tantalising menu of tertiary courses with huge fees , and loan schemes to match . If that sounds like a conspiracy theory , consider the news this week that in Australia , university fees are to double for some arts courses , while fall for STEM subjects . <p> Meanwhile here , as Dionne Christian reported in the NZ Herald last month , NZ Principals ' Federation president Perry Rush recently argued for arts education in schools that is integrated with other subjects , going " beyond dance groups , school productions or instrumental music lessons " . School principals , Christian wrote , want the arts back in classrooms , to see " better critical thinking , problem solving , creativity , insight and empathy developed " . <p> In May , a group of Auckland-based arts organisations under Auckland arts regional trust Te Taumata Toi-a-Iwi wrote to the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister 's Office ; a review of the way the arts are being delivered in schools ; better resources ; better understanding of the arts ' role ; and " a national strategy to embed nga toi across government policies and departments " . <p> This followed leading school arts educators gathering for the first time in decades , at Te Papa in January , to speak out about arts in schools in crisis . Resources and delivery of the curriculum at primary schools is such that Francis Potter , president of the Aotearoa New Zealand Association of Arts Educators , told RNZ that at Year 9 secondary school entrant level , they are having to teach the primary colours . <p> In response to frustration over a lack of action by the Ministry of Education , in May the University of Auckland 's Professor Peter O'Connor joined with the NZ Principals ' Federation , NZEI and the John Kirwan Foundation to develop Te Rito Toi , an online resource to help teachers teach the arts as they returned to school under level two . In a month , O'Connor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30,000 teachers using the site . <p> Image for Te ora Auaha : Creative Wellbeing Alliance Aotearoa <p> " Great sentiments , little strategy " has been the criticism continually levelled at the government in the wake of the 2019 launch of a Creatives in Schools programme . <p> Calls for change come at a vital time . In the wake of disaster the arts have historically played a vital role in helping us adapt to change and think differently . We should have learnt this from the Christchurch earthquakes . The Covid-19 lockdown , meanwhile , has provided time for many to mull on work-life balance . Left to their own devices , people got busy baking , planting , crafting and connecting in new ways . And many suddenly had kids at home with them , learning alongside them . The questions kept popping up for me : are we teaching our tamariki to live , or just to work and consume ? Why do we struggle to recognise art 's role in innovative and critical thinking that builds confident , collaborative citizens , and put it at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology , engineering , arts and maths ) , rather than just STEM , is the rallying cry . It reflects how in the last two decades the arts have become increasingly focused on developing thinkers able to visualise and bridge the gaps between different disciplines . Think of recent New Zealand representatives at the Venice Biennale as examples : Lisa Reihana , Simon Denny and Dane Mitchell . Our images of the artist are multiplying : some are creative facilitators and collaborators , embedded in teams looking for new out-of-the-box solutions . This is something we have a long way to go in valuing in society . And that starts at school . <p> Gordon Tovey in workshop with school arts advisers <p> The Tovey generation <p> And yet we 've been here before . John Dewey 's ideas had a significant impact in New Zealand after the election of the first Labour government in 1935 . It was the last great depression . In America , Dewey got to see the implementation of Roosevelt 's Federal Art Project , which saw artist employment projects , federal art commissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In New Zealand , then minister of education Peter Fraser ( later prime minister ) was determined to initiate changes in schooling . As Luit and Jan Bieringa 's 2016 documentary The Heart of the Matter tells us , the New Zealand 1937 conference of the international New Education Fellowship saw a new wave of educators embrace John Dewey 's theories , principal among them in the arts , Gordon Tovey . The Bieringas smartly illustrate how Tovey , as a national supervisor of arts and craft after World War Two , under the leadership of director general of education Clarence Beeby , enabled an " army of men and women " to establish " a thoroughly bicultural and arts-centred education system " . Utterly progressive for its time . Jan Bieringa says of their motivation in making The Heart of the Matter : " New Zealand needs a strong story that challenges the notion of the arts as a ' frill ' in the educational process . Not arts or science -- but both taught creatively for our children , students of all cultures , and the public at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Pine Taipa teaching Para Matchitt finer points of carving <p> After training at teachers ' college with Tovey , a national network of arts specialists worked to train other teachers in schools throughout the country . Particularly strong was a focus on the Maori arts . Tovey inspired a wide range of post-war artists , from Colin McCahon to Ralph Hotere and Marilyn Webb . The change has been called revolutionary . <p> " I cried when I saw it , " says artist and teacher Judy Darragh of The Heart of the Matter . " All that we 've lost . It was joyous and holistic . And integrated . " <p> " We led the world , " says Peter O'Connor . " Tovey and Beeby understood that democracy was made with your hands ; you created the critical citizen with your hands . People with agency who could make things . We 've lost that . We threw it away . It 's gobsmacking what we 've done , and really sad . For all the talk of reform this government was going to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> In the last 20 years , the Labour government has not been shy of evoking Beeby and agreeing with John Dewey 's aspirations . In 2003 , then minister of education Steve Maharey spoke of Beeby as a visionary thinker , establishing " a public good and right-of-citizenship basis for the education system " . Maharey noted that this provided a " contrary proposition " to the education policy of the 1980s and 1990s , which saw education as a commodity . " That new vision is one that those of us in this government opposed . " <p> Creatives in Schools <p> In 2019 , the Ministry of Education launched Creatives in Schools . This welcome programme partners " artists and creative practitioners with teachers and kaiako to foster new learning experiences for students and akonga of all ages " . Projects can last between eight and 20 weeks and range from the traditional arts disciplines to those like film-making , game design , fashion design and spoken word . Creatives in Schools pays a fee of $10,000 for the participating creative ( or between up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they need to spend a total of 100 contact hours with the schools . This looks like good and welcome money for most artists . The first of seven rounds began earlier this year , with the placements now published online . <p> On June 12 this year , the government announced it was increasing the number of projects being funded over the next three years from 304 to 510 . All of this is a welcome shot in the arm for artists , schools and their communities , as the list of projects suggests , but some in the arts and education sectors have serious reservations about the programme 's design and context . <p> " The announcement of the extra funding for Creatives in Schools reinforces the complete lack of strategy informing government policies in the arts , " says O'Connor . " The media release suggests that the motivation for the extra funding was to provide more short-term precarious employment for artists rather than on the basis of any genuine understanding of the role and place of the arts in schools . <p> " There is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a successful arts educator . My assumption is that this extra batch of artists will have no training , no support or mentoring into working with children . " <p> That last point is difficult to assess -- the artists simply are n't listed in the published programme of projects . <p> The one artist currently advertised with a round one project , at Taita College , Chevron Hassett ( ' Selfportrait ' , One Thirty Series , 2019 ) <p> Judy Darragh and fellow senior artist Professor Anne Noble of Massey University have similar concerns about the programme 's lack of integration . <p> " Is there support for artists to be given some basic teaching skills ? " asks Darragh . " I 'm a bit concerned with lack of consultation with artists and art departments . This has to work to see the value of getting art back into the curriculum ... Maybe it will be a pathway for artists who were thinking about teacher training and can have a taster ? " <p> Adds Noble : " I do wonder how the current art and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , designers and crafts people -- figure in this scenario . While bringing artists into schools may well be a good thing , they are not trained as teachers and they do n't necessarily understand how to position their practices in a way that is connected with the curriculum . It is still seeing the creative arts as an exceptional component of the curriculum led by ' exceptional people ' rather than as a series of practices that can be integrated within the curriculum to broaden our regard for multiple modes of learning and expression of that learning . <p> " Put another way -- art in this model is indelibly linked to the practices of individuals , rather than being more firmly in the service of cultural and community development . What we term nostalgically as the ' Beeby and Tovey ' years are renowned for the policies based on the understanding of art as a series of practices essential to the health and wellbeing of communities and cultures . It can be said that the work of those artists in schools throughout New Zealand ( Paratene Matchitt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to our current New Zealand cultural ethos of biculturalism . What an outcome ! " <p> Noble also predicts the Creatives in Schools programmes will be " hit and miss " based on the skills of the artists as teachers . She , like other artists I have spoken to , is concerned about the lack of evidence of genuine development of relationships between the contemporary arts and the education system . When the programme was released last year , there was little evidence of this consultation , through CNZ or elsewhere . <p> " If you just plonk an artist in a school , I 'm not sure you 're going to get much benefit from it , " says Noble . " It 's totally the wrong idea . The model is surely that of the artist teacher who works to grow the capability of fellow teachers . The idea of artist specialists who can go in and transform the way art is taught and can be incorporated into the curriculum . It 's a specialist skill , not just piloting an artist into a school . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . <p> Northern Maori Project school performance session , from The Heart of the Matter <p> " It 's not about supporting the arts curriculum and that 's made really clear , " says O'Connor . " And it 's not about in any systematic way making schools any more creative . It 's piecemeal , it 's bitsy . " <p> What is at stake , I believe , is an opportunity to introduce the arts as a change agent in schools to challenge our assumptions and expands our ideas and ways of working , in the manner the strongest contemporary art can . This requires a programme that has the drive of Tovey 's 70 years ago , but with all the progressive changes that have happened in that time . That requires strong visionary facilitation to identify and really push artists and schools to develop projects that can be truly innovative in opening out the world to young people , and young people to the world . <p> Of the selection process , the ministry informs me the panel " comprised representatives from the Ministry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Heritage with expertise in education and creative practice and including an external youth assessor " . In that first round , 34 projects were selected from the 68 applications that met the criteria . <p> " The aim of the programme , " says Pauline Cleaver , associate deputy secretary of early learning and student achievement , " is for artists and creative practitioners to work collaboratively with teachers , students , parents , families and whanau to engage in creative projects drawing on the specialist talents and expertise within the community . We expect that the projects give students experience in working creatively across a number of curriculum areas and developing their key competencies . This is a valuable opportunity for creatives and schools to work in partnership in the interests of their students . <p> " We are undertaking ongoing review and evaluation of the programme and have made enhancements in response to feedback from creatives and schools and kura . " <p> Cleaver says interest remains high , with the Ministry of Education receiving enquiries from more than 70 schools even before applications for the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extension of the deadline for completing many projects to the end of term four . Applications for the second round of Creatives in Schools , for 2021 , opened on Thursday , June 25 , and close on August 21 . <p> This openness to change is welcome , but as O'Connor says , many are looking for a stronger overriding vision to empower all to see this really lead to change , not just decorate the edges . <p> A former teacher at both secondary and tertiary levels , Judy Darragh is one of our most respected senior sculptors . Her work in art , advocacy and education was recognised in the Queen 's Birthday honours list with the award of an ONZM . <p> " Creatives in Schools really needs to work . The next stage is to get art back into the curriculum , that 's the end game : STEAM , not STEM . Make art compulsory right through . So it has to work . <p> " It feels to me the education department is a little siloed about what is happening generally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from artists . I 'd like some real proactivity in getting really good artists into schools . " <p> Darragh also considers the Tovey movement 's focus on arts specialists and working closely with teachers a good model . Giving schools money , Darragh says , " is fantastic , but it needs ongoing shepherding in schools , and people with passion " . <p> Paascalino Schaller teaching video production at Avalon Intermediate <p> What change could look like <p> What placing the arts centrally in the classroom looks like was recently tested at two intermediate schools in Wellington . At Avalon and Newlands intermediates during 2019 , Noble and fellow Massey University professor Tracey Riley led a Teaching and Learning Research Initiative through the New Zealand Council for Educational Research ( NZCER ) . <p> Noble 's own practice has already demonstrated how an artist might work across disciplines to communicate complexities . Noble has worked principally with scientists around environmental urgencies , first with a focus on Antarctica and , for the last eight years , the predicament of the honeybee . <p> For Noble , teachers ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up photography and becoming an artist . <p> " That education came out of the Tovey era . The fact that good teachers are people who are passionate , informed , creative and enjoy teaching from their strengths . There was a high focus on art . <p> " I 've always been interested in how you engage with people in different disciplines , and in the university I 'm always challenged to think this way . Photography works very well alongside other disciplines . A lot of what I 've done has been inspired by working with fantastic people , with scientists -- that kind of parallel knowledge you receive from other people 's passions feeding into your own . Projects do n't come out of you , they come out of conversation with people who might have a shared interest . <p> " I became a beekeeper , and anyone who becomes a beekeeper falls in love with bees . There 's the sense that the curtains are drawn on the complexity of living systems , but with bees you get to be an observer and participant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to attune to attending to something -- and as an artist you do that incredibly differently to a scientist . I philosophise and I muse and I meld together speculative ways of thinking entirely out of being an artist , " says Noble . <p> " Biodiversity is under threat . There is an ecological crisis in the threats to multiple species . And yet you ask a scientist why the bees are dying in the way they are and the scientist will say ' Well ... we ca n't be too sure about that ! " There 's the sense that science will only speak when it can be certain of something . What science can not give us is understanding of the entire complexity and interrelationship of living systems . It wants to tease things apart and understand them piece by piece and then put it back together and imagine we might understand the whole . <p> An apiscope at Avalon Intermediate School <p> " I think what art can do is ask absurd questions and speculate in ways that are beyond reason , " she explains . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the marvellous ; and that the ability to act on and change the world belongs to all of us . <p> " A total focus on STEM subjects is like walking legless . It really privileges what we think we need to know to advance science , technology and economics as if those are all . It is also privileging the idea that education is about training the rational faculties of human beings , and actually , I reckon only a small percentage of people really flourish given that as a focus . " <p> Children wrote , illustrated and produced a series of picture books aimed at kindergartens based on their learning about the life of bees and the structure of the beehive . A further book , Yellow Black Nation , saw students at Avalon Intermediate write music , raps and create moving and still images . Teachers led teachers , tuakana led teina , and the resources of both the tertiary arts institution and local community employed , with the likes of Trinity Roots and Little Bushman 's Warren Maxwell from the Massey School of Music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of funding in the first round of Creatives in Schools that 's been publicised ) , and film-maker and teacher Paascalino Schaller in support . <p> A report of this project as a model for how the arts can be central to engaging teachers in multidisciplinary learning , fulfilling curriculum objectives across the spectrum , is now going back to the NZCER . <p> A sound recording workshop with Massey lecturer Warren Maxwell <p> " Observation from a living system is very different from learning online , " says Noble . " With an apiscope you get to see it in the classroom as a parallel universe . It can just be there but it can also be the basis of a project , like a music video and story project about bees . It 's something authentic . <p> " It 's art not as an add-on but a way of bringing the Beeby/Tovey model right back up to date . Art is seen in schools as something that is peripheral to the curriculum , a subset of skills to be developed for those with talent , not as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vehicle for the translation of learning about the world and expressing it . <p> " It 's no wonder low-decile schools are low decile , because literacy is defined and promoted in a manner which is so eurocentric -- where you have to write it all down . Why should they write down a poem when they already have incredibly sophisticated abilities to rap and improvise in their heads ? " <p> Peter O'Connor ( Photo : educationcentral.co.nz ) <p> Valuing the arts <p> Peter O'Connor is surely the most outspoken critic of the Ministry of Education 's approach to the arts right now . Based at University of Auckland 's faculty of education and social work , he is director of the Centre for Arts and Social Transformation and the university 's Creative Thinking Project . He has worked extensively in theatre and drama education in prisons , psychiatric hospitals , earthquake zones and with the homeless . <p> " What we do in schools is part of a bigger puzzle about how we understand the place of the arts , " he says . " One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arts and cultural life in the UK in 2015 , said was that everything is underpinned by the quality of arts education in public schools . And we 've abandoned the arts in New Zealand schools -- for a very long time . <p> " Understanding art 's value and central role in making humans more human has never been embraced . We need a wider strategy and vision . The closest we got to it was with Helen Clark , who understood it in neoliberal terms -- how you create a market and how we sell ourselves to the world . Jacinda gets closer when she talks about the innate value of the arts , but that has n't translated in any way into any policy or strategic direction . <p> " We did n't lose arts in schools by accident , it was deliberate . We wanted cheap labour for a global economy . You do that by creating people who do n't think , challenge or use the arts to reimagine the world . We had a glorious moment at the turn of the century where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be taught in every school , and then it was snatched off us . " <p> " Inexplicable " and " criminal negligence " are words O'Connor uses to describe the neglect of the work laid down by Tovey and Beeby . Other arts educators commented in January to RNZ that inequities in resourcing makes implementing the arts curriculum difficult in New Zealand , particularly at primary school level . The tools , in other words , are available , the resources less so . <p> " We have the only indigenous arts curriculum in the world , totally from a matauranga Maori perspective , and it 's been left to die . What an enormous indictment . You think of the power of Maori arts in our communities , what it would be to have in our schools . " <p> Instead , O'Connor says , for 20 years there has been a " grinding focus " on literacy and numeracy with " no understanding that that of itself does n't work , it does n't lift literary and numeracy rates . What 's interesting about that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're at , it 's the arts that schools will need to re-engage with their children with learning . " <p> I ask O'Connor what countries , then , are getting it right . While he notes that everyone cites the Scandinavian countries , there have also been shifts in places like Singapore and China . <p> " In China the curriculum for a generation was about making compliant non-thinking workers who can replicate products , but they 've worked out that does n't give them the competitive edge . They are increasingly embracing the arts in education as a way to do that . They 're not doing that because they see art linked to democracy -- that 's the last thing they want -- but they do understand that training in imagination has an economic impact . " <p> An artist teaching in schools <p> Judy Darragh taught for 30 years at Auckland secondary schools , leaving just as NCEA was being introduced at the beginning of the millennium . She 's worked as an NCEA assessor since and believes the national certificate has " flattened things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been working as a creative in schools long before the Creatives in Schools programme was invented -- four schools in 2019 alone . <p> " I did a two-day workshop out at Birkenhead with these juniors and I took a whole lot of stuff from my studio , a lot of 3D stuff -- because 3D is not being taught . It 's gone . Teachers are n't confident enough and they need resources . Materials . And they need storage . It 's considered too hard ! So students are n't encouraged to work three dimensionally . All the potters ' wheels have gone , the screenprints , everything 's gone . " <p> In workshops Darragh does n't necessarily use the word " art " or " sculpture " . Instead with juniors she asks them simply to join a soft material and a hard material together , and " to make the joining interesting " . She emphasises that there is no right or wrong . <p> " My god , they went off . One kid made 10 things . They were just making stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were making worlds they could own . <p> " Assessing NCEA , I saw very little 3D . A lot of digital design stuff and a lot of painting ... But I do n't see the digital being used creatively . Maybe it 's to do with the format of NCEA . It 's quite prescriptive . I went into a classroom and they were googling a tree to draw a tree . They were using their phones to draw from . It was a Leunig moment -- there was a tree out the window ! " <p> Again and again , Darragh says it comes down to the teachers . Like at Hamilton Girls High School last year where she was artist in resident , working with " amazing art teachers who 've gone through art school " . They created Bee Stunning , a temporary collaborative art installation using over 4,000 ping pong balls , and involving all students and staff . <p> Bee Stunning , Hamilton Girls High School <p> " At secondary school you 're getting arts graduates teaching art , but through early childhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they might get an arts specialist but previous to that it 's a bit winky wonky . We need to have it right through the curriculum . " <p> Indeed , given the enormous growth in tertiary education and the parallel growth in leading artists finding secure careers as academics , is being a school teacher even an aspiration for artists any more ? <p> Darragh , who has been a professional teaching fellow at Elam School of Fine Arts since 2005 , is n't so sure it is . She considers herself as one of a generation of art school grads who were also influential school teachers . She mentions the likes of sculptor Marte Szimay , painter Philippa Blair and in Christchurch , Bronwyn Taylor , who now lectures in sculpture at Ilam Canterbury University and has been involved in curriculum development at secondary and tertiary levels since 1972 . <p> Darragh believes there is often a significant gap between what is being taught in art at school and the more socially engaged conceptual-based making of contemporary art practice today . She agrees with my hunch that things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd say it 's very low risk . Maybe it 's a confidence thing . But there is a huge gap when kids arrive at Elam . In that first year you have to open them up again to art being about everything . A lot of them think they 've just come to do paintings . We need to do that at secondary school . " <p> Again , the need for our artists to be educated as teachers , and our teachers to have the confidence to be artists and apply creative thinking across the curriculum , comes through loud and clear . <p> " We describe the arts as an industry , " adds Darragh , " which immediately defaults to the digital , and that someone is getting paid . But in actual fact the language is wrong . I do n't work in an industry . We have to change the language .

The Watson ... <p> Over 20 years after the event , the Scott Watson murder case continues to attract public attention . Last week 's decision by the Governor-General to refer the case back to the Court of Appeal is but the latest step in this long saga . <p> The Watson case is one of a handful of cases from the 1970s to the 1990s which aroused considerable doubt about the original convictions and led to their being eventually overturned . Arthur Allan Thomas was twice convicted for the Crewe murders in 1970 , before being pardoned and released from prison in 1979 following a Royal Commission of Inquiry . David Bain 's conviction and imprisonment for murdering his family in 1994 was overturned at a retrial which acquitted him in 2009 . Teina Pora was convicted of murder in 1994 and was in prison for 20 years before being released . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Haig 's murder conviction in 1995 was quashed in 2006 , while he was on parole after serving 10 years in prison . Scott Watson was convicted and sentenced in 1999 , with a minimum non-parole period of 17 years , and he is still in prison after 21 years . <p> Separate to these , but no less significant , is the case of David Tamihere , convicted in 1990 of the murder of two Swedish backpackers . His appeals to the Court of Appeal and the Privy Council after the discovery of massive conflicts between the evidence presented and the emergence of subsequent contradictory facts both failed , and he served 20 years in prison before being released , still protesting his innocence . Earlier , this year , the Governor-General referred his case back to the Court of Appeal for further consideration . <p> And then there is the case of Peter Ellis , convicted in 1993 of child abuse , twice upheld subsequently by the Court of Appeal , and once more by a separate Ministerial Inquiry , who served his full sentence of 10 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year , a final approach is being made to the Court of Appeal to posthumously clear his name of what many consider to have been an appalling miscarriage of justice . <p> Over the years , I have read almost everything that has been published about the Scott Watson case , as well as speaking to many people directly involved . I am still unsure whether his conviction was justified by the evidence available . An aspect of the case that has always bothered me is the Police insistence from the outset that the young couple were last seen on a distinctive ketch ( a double-masted yacht ) , whereas Watson 's yacht was a sloop -- a single-masted vessel . <p> Many witnesses came forward saying they had seen a ketch that matched the original description given by the Police in and around the Marlborough Sounds at the time . Indeed , I saw such a ketch in Westport a few weeks later , which I subsequently reported to the Police , who , by then focused on Watson 's sloop , told me emphatically " there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ketch and seeking information about it hung incongruously on the wall behind them ! <p> While our system of jury trials is probably the best and fairest available , there will always be incidences where the complexity of the case , or the paucity of incontrovertible evidence increase the possibility of a mistake being made and a miscarriage of justice occurring . The right of appeal to the Court of Appeal , then the Supreme Court or ultimately the Governor-General , is a sufficient safeguard in most cases to ensure that eventually a just and correct decision is reached . But as the Thomas , Bain , Pora , Haig , Ellis and now potentially Tamihere and Watson cases have all shown , there will still be some cases that will leave a measure of public unease that the legal system , however fully applied , can not resolve . <p> In that regard , the formal establishment this week of the Criminal Cases Review Commission is an important and welcome step forward . In essence , it will replace the referral function of the Governor-General , as exercised in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to investigate on its own behalf cases where a possible miscarriage of justice may have occurred and to refer such cases back to the Courts if it considers that is the appropriate thing to do . The Commission 's statutory independence should ensure that it can proactively examine cases that come before it fully and independently without having to rely solely on the evidence previously collected . In that way , it is hoped that the cases the Commission considers can be judged more holistically than on the current basis of whether the Police and prosecution or the defence got it right . <p> The prolonged nature of resolution of each of the cases referred to above has been unsatisfactory in many respects . There has been the length of time taken , and the unreasonableness of the impositions on the freedom of the individuals , especially in the Thomas , Bain , Pora and Haig cases where the convictions were ultimately overturned . And each case and its course has also led to a measure of weakened public confidence in the current system , as the ongoing Tamihere , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system eventually got it right in the Thomas , Bain Pora and Haig cases , leaving us all to ponder how much more tragic the outcome might have been had capital punishment still been in place . <p> Whatever the eventual outcome of the Tamihere , Ellis and Watson cases , the establishment of the Criminal Cases Review Commission should mean that where such cases arise in the future , as they will inevitably , an outcome can be reached much more rapidly , without those affected having to prove their innocence while spending many unnecessary years languishing in prison .

@@31932231 <h> A red guitar and playing the blues <p> As the music scene returns to normal so does this column ; this week we 've got a blues gig and a new album . <p> The album , My Red Guitar , is by Tauranga local Ian Gilmour , recorded at Whakamarama 's Boatshed Studio . <p> Ian is not a professional musician . Now in his seventies , he played publicly for a while about 20 years ago , but his main musical talent is songwriting . <p> Songwriters are a weird group to categorise ; they can come from any background . You get songwriting lawyers , songwriters working on road gangs , songwriters who are intellectuals , songwriters who left school at thirteen . <p> Writing songs is an oddly elusive ability . It is clearly honed by experience but since so much is personal taste -- which word to use , where the tune goes -- there does also seem to be an indefinable inbuilt ability involved . Some people just have a ' feel ' for it . <p> The more I learn the more I value this ability and appreciate the effort it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs as there are here . <p> That 's ten songs on varying subjects , in varying styles , with varying structures -- an album is the musical equivalent of writing a novel : there 's a lot to it . <p> Luckily , Ian has a real feel for it . You can tell from the first line of the first song , the title track : " When I hit twelve I got a red guitar . " It 's a simple thing , but it 's simply right . As Mark Twain said : " The difference between the almost right word and the right word is the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning . " <p> Lightning <p> And that line is right . Roll it round in your mouth . " Hit " , " Got " and " Guitar " are the keys , with the whole song set up between that and the second line , a father 's admonishment that there 's no money in music . <p> So Ian can write a good lyric . And a pleasingly catchy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to younger generations which echoes the album 's dedication , to Ian 's grandchildren . Then there 's Fire &amp; Home , an impressive slice of philosophical musing on the contradictory pulls of home comforts and the solitary joys of campfires and trails . <p> That last one leans towards Celtic rhythms but the album 's overall style is easy-listening country . Boatshed boss , **39;411;TOOLONG Nigel Masters has fashioned a bed of acoustic guitars and piano and has brought his characteristic theatrical flourishes to the songs . Thus My Red Guitar ends with a piano outro of Que Sera Sera , echoing the lyric , while Journey Through The Past , a song reflecting Ian 's interest in American frontier history , gets hints of a military drum and similar musical quotes . <p> There are other smart touches , from pizzicato strings to some tasty resonator guitar courtesy of Katikati 's Richard Coad , and in a more typical Boatshed signature Nigel delivers pitch-perfect Mark Knopfler-style guitar on Three Short Steps , a bitter-sweet ballad of young love . <p> Ian has put extracts from the CD on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it is available - and is getting it onto Bandcamp .

Again . <p> No vote is scheduled to bring them in , but Waikato Regional Councillors unwisely decided to bring the matter up in front of Macpherson at a meeting between Hamilton City Council and the regional council . <p> " I 've had city-based regional councillors -- they have four city seats on that -- contact me after and say ' we were n't the ones supporting that note . It was the rural ones , not us ' , " Macpherson said . <p> " They 're aware of what an issue it is in Hamilton , " he said . <p> Macpherson has fought two election campaigns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included one , in 2016 , where he campaigned with a ' no water meters ' party affiliation beside his name on the ballot paper . <p> A watery patchwork <p> He credited the stance for thousands of extra votes that rocketed him from being the lowest polling councillor at the election before to the third-highest polling in 2016 . He lost those votes at the most recent local government election when water meters was n't an issue . <p> " I 've been elected eight times now and that 's the only time I 've had ' No water meters ' beside my name ... I 've never been the top-polling candidate but that time there was a significant jump , " Macpherson said . <p> Hamilton , Wellington and Dunedin do n't have meters , but Auckland , Christchurch and Tauranga do . Auckland 's Watercare charges $1.52 per 1,000 litres for fresh water and $2.62 per 1,000 litres for waste water , while Tauranga charges $2.14 per thousand litres of fresh water . Christchurch has meters , but does n't charge per 1,000 litres . <p> Statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent more water per capita than Aucklanders do : 224 litres per day vs 160 litres per day . <p> Hamilton has company <p> Water NZ data also showed that Wellingtonians used 229 litres per day or 43 percent more water than Aucklanders .

Although Christchurch used more water per person than Auckland , but less than Wellington , Hamilton and Dunedin . <p> On the face of it there is one difference between large urban areas that use the most and least amount of water per head : residential water meters . <p> They are attached to almost every residential property in Auckland , Tauranga and Christchurch , but barely exist in Wellington , Hamilton and Dunedin . <p> That said , the charging models attached to those meters are quite different . Auckland is the only major centre with full volumetric charging . Tauranga makes its residents pay a very low fixed charge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works out to $378 per 200 cubic metres . Christchurch has meters on its properties , but charges for water the same way a council without water meters does . <p> Only a minority of New Zealand is water metered : 14 out of 41 council and water CCO areas have water meters in over 80 percent of residential properties according to Water NZ . Although this means over 50 percent of the population is metered , largely owing to meters in Auckland , Christchurch and Tauranga . <p> Water NZ Principal Data scientist Lesley Smith said comparing water usage between non-metered and metered areas was difficult because many metered areas were rural and used more water per head of population , but it was more easy to compare usage in urban areas . <p> " Every year you see more councils coming on board , " Smith said . <p> " We 're international laggards in this space .

That 's where you get the savings from water metering , " Smith said . <p> Smith said council-reported data on water charges , collated by Water NZ , showed metering did n't necessarily mean the average water user paid more for water even if it was n't explicitly delineated on their rates bill . <p> Aucklanders pay less for 200m3 of water than Wellingtonians or people in Dunedin do ( but more than Hamiltonians and Christchurch residents ) . Tauranga residents pay more than all of them . <p> Macpherson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was a question of fairness for older people living or large sections who might face large bills , or large families who have no choice but to use large amounts of water . <p> What about the ' McMansions ' in the suburbs with a pool ? Macpherson contended the rich were n't large users of water . Yes they had to use a dollop of water to fill up their pools , but their houses were also more likely to be full of water-efficient technologies . <p> He did n't deny Hamiltonians used more water per head than other centres , but said no year-long water reduction campaign had ever been tried in Hamilton either . <p> The fact that water conservation campaigns had been successful during periods of drought proved there was more that could be done to promote water conservation before charging for water , he said . <p> " It 's not that Hamilton residents pay nothing for water , it 's that we all share in the cost just like do with our roading system and our parks and our libraries , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as water is , " he said . <p> Help us create a sustainable future for independent local journalism <p> As New Zealand moves from crisis to recovery mode the need to support local industry has been brought into sharp relief . <p> As our journalists work to ask the hard questions about our recovery , we also look to you , our readers for support .

@@31942231 <h> Threat of the gig economy needs urgent answers <p> Waiting another five years to address the problems the gig economy is bringing to New Zealand is not an option , writes Thomas Coughlan <p> London has become the centre of an international debate between regulators and tech giants over the gig economy and how ( or if ) it should be regulated . In the last month , Uber has launched appeals against two unrelated cases that both threaten to radically alter how it does business in London , one of its 10 largest urban markets . The outcome of these appeals will have wide-reaching consequences , potentially changing the way Uber and companies of its ilk operate in New Zealand . <p> On Friday , Uber lodged an appeal against Transport for London 's ( TfL ) decision to not renew the company 's licence to operate in the capital . <p> The initial decision by TfL not to renew the licence was not made with regard to Uber 's questionable interpretation ( or exploitation ) of rules around self-employment , for which it has brooked much criticism , but rather on the basis of the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is incredibly poor . The company 's disgraced former CEO and co-founder Travis Kalanick presided over a company culture that condoned serious gender-based discrimination , and in some instances celebrated the misogyny of some employees . Kalanick once boasted that he nicknamed the company ' Boober ' for its tendency to help him attract women . <p> TfLs findings suggest that this culture has filtered down to the day-to-day workings of its London operation . The regulator raised concerns for client safety , particularly relating to issues of the company reporting serious criminal offences to the police and carrying out background checks on drivers . It concluded that the company was not a ' fit and proper ' private car hire operator . <p> In the aftermath of the decision , several former customers have come forward detailing Uber 's dismissive handling of their allegations of sexual abuse from drivers . In one case , the company neglected to pass on relevant driver details to the police so that the claim could be pursued allowing that same driver to assault another passenger not long after . <p> It 's worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technological innovation on Uber 's behalf , but rather a legal innovation that uses the technology to exploit outdated employment laws . <p> Uber has played a careful political game in London , on the one hand intimating that the ban is the manifestation of London Mayor , Sadiq Khan 's union bias and TfL 's anti-competitive prejudice ( Khan has been quick to clarify that he has no authority to interfere in TfL 's decision making ) , while on the other , trying to charm the city 's regulators with statements of contrition and ambitions for change . <p> New CEO Dara Khosrowshahi , in an open letter to the city published in the London Evening Standard confessed that the company had ' got things wrong along the way ' and apologised for his company 's behaviour . In the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal ( London 's Metropolitan Police are currently investigating five British allegations made against Weinstein ) , Uber will no doubt face an even higher level of rigour to demonstrate its suitability to operate in London . <p> The other case against Uber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even more lasting impact . The appeal concerns a case brought against the company last year by two drivers , James Farrar and Yaseen Aslam and concerns the crucial detail in Uber 's apparently unbeatable business model . <p> Uber does not operate as a traditional taxi company , but rather classifies itself as an intermediary , which coordinates bookings between clients and drivers , who are classified as self-employed contractors and not employees of Uber . <p> This allows Uber to avoid having to give its drivers the statutory rights of ordinary employees , like sick pay , maternity leave , and the minimum wage . The last point has been a particular bone of contention for drivers as Uber has steadily driven down the price it charges for rides , slashing drivers ' pay . <p> Farrar and Yaseen successfully argued that the conditions of their employment were not akin to self-employment and that they were , in fact , employees of Uber . Should the decision be upheld , it will massively increase Uber 's costs in the UK as it rolls out full employment provisions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law has also enabled it to avoid paying a large portion of VAT ( Value Added Tax -- the UK 's version of GST ) . As its drivers are technically self-employed , they are liable for their own VAT arrangements . As most drivers fall below the ? 85,000 threshold to pay VAT , the millions of pounds of sales handled by Uber incur almost no VAT , depriving the government of almost ? 40 million in tax revenue . <p> Just half a decade ago , in the lifetime of our current government , most of the gig economy companies did n't exist , now they threaten to radically change the face of employment . <p> Again , this is essential to Uber 's business model . VAT is charged at 20 percent , a saving the company can partially pass to the consumer , making it far more competitive than many of its peers , who take a more orthodox interpretation of the law . <p> Uber 's New Zealand operation works similarly . In the three years it has operated in New Zealand it has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its subversion of existing rules not only endanger riders , but allow Uber to bypass costs that other companies are forced to pass on to the consumer , giving the company an unfair advantage . <p> An Uber spokesperson confirmed to me that in New Zealand , Uber ' connects ' driver-partners with users looking for a ride . When you book an Uber you 're really interacting with two companies : Uber , the booking agent , and the self-employed driver . <p> Uber collects GST on the service-fee it charges to connect clients with drivers . Drivers are required to pay GST on their share of the fee only if their turnover exceeds $60,000 , as GST rules stipulate . As many drivers will earn below this , Uber can undercut rivals with more traditional employment structures who will have to charge GST on the entire fare , not just the small percentage that Uber collects . <p> All of this conspires to make Uber far more competitive than its rivals . It 's worth remembering that this competitiveness does n't actually come from any technological innovation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uses the technology to exploit outdated employment laws . <p> This has all but been acknowledged by gig economy businesses in the UK . Deliveroo , which uses self-employed drivers to deliver take-away food has said that hiring its self-employed workforce and affording them statutory benefits like maternity leave and sick pay would force it to up its delivery fees from ? 2.50 to ? 3.50 , an enormous percentage increase which exemplifies the advantage current employment law gives to gig companies willing to exploit it . <p> Technology companies argue that London 's reputation as a hub for innovation is on the line . Their opponents counter that the city has a unique opportunity to affect material change in Silicon Valley 's chauvinist culture . The city should be applauded for its audacity in taking such issues on . <p> Just half a decade ago , in the lifetime of our current government , most of the gig economy companies did n't exist , now they threaten to radically change the face of employment .

@@31942233 <h> What are the things necessary to check when looking for accommodation in UK ? <p> Once one gets through a college or a university in UK , it means this is the time for celebration . Though one needs to think about a lot of things and back of the mind a lot are going on but still there should be the joy of achieving something . <p> When one is shifting to a new place or even in a new country where everything around is new then one takes a lot of time to adjust . But finding a new accommodation and settling down is the primary matter of concern that remains there . One has to look for Student accommodation in Bristol UK , if they have got selected in s college in that area . One can either look for on campus accommodation , or else they can look for a place to stay which is nearby ( preferably walking distance ) from the college . <p> When one starts accommodation hunting , there are a few things to keep in mind to make the searching process easier . <p> First of all , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The place in the university is already secured and one just needs a place to stay according to their preferences . But yes , even if one should not panic , one must not start searching them in a laid back attitude . In that case most of the studios which are good and nearby might get occupied . So , in order to search for an accommodation , one must make a preferred list first . One has to contact the university authority and check the accommodation options which are available there ( if there are at all ) . If there are places to stay , they can show the pictures of private halls of residence and the other facilities that they can provide . One can also check the cost of those rooms and if possible , can also reserve a space for them online . <p> If there are no on campus accommodation option , then one can also look for shared ensuite or dual occupancy studios . In these cases , location becomes the key factor to finalize a staying option . If one finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour away from the university then it is not suitable because it is going to affect the academic life of the student majorly . So , it is preferable to stay nearby may be 15 to 20 minutes away from the university . <p> One also needs to make sure that they get all the necessary facilities near the accommodation they choose . There are many accommodation which come with a strict guideline . One must check the parking restrictions payment patterns , maintenance and security facilities . If one has a habit of working out on a daily basis they can also check for an on-site gym or a nearby gym . One also needs to consider the other essential things like where can they eat . Do those accommodation have canteen facilities as well ? <p> If one has found a few places to stay then before finalizing one must do a proper research online for those places . One should take all the necessary information from the booking agent and if possible , can also take a virtual tour of the place where they will be going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions or about any information they need before they finalize down the accommodation . It is also okay to check the rooms and the bed ( to see if it is comfortable enough to sleep ) before taking the place . There are shared en suite options as well which one can check . <p> Apart from the above mentioned things there are some other things to consider as well . Can one take help of student loan in order to pay the living expenses apart from the school fees and other allowance ? Well , it completely depends on the student loan that they have got . The money will be sent to the student directly in some loans or in some cases it can go the university directly and then the fees are deducted from there before the rest is handed over to the student . The rest amount can be easily used to pay for the shared apartment or other accommodation that one will be using . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> It is true that student loans can be used to pay for the housing whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One can also opt for a dormitory which is beneficial because there are some universities that also include the food payment in their monthly fees . This can take away the worry about regular meals for the students . Most dormitories are furnished and so one does not have to buy furniture as well . They are less expensive because one also does not need to pay any kind of security deposits and for maintenance utilities . But shared apartments can be better than dormitories in other terms because there are less people sharing the space and there are more choices to go through . <p> When one is applying for college loans then there are federal backed student loan options where one has to fill up a free application for the student aid form as it wants to know about personal details of the applicant like their family income and desired school details . If one is eligible for a student loan then they must look for the ones which pays both the tuition fees and the living expenses . Once one has already applied for the loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accommodation facility in the meantime . <p> When one is looking for some accommodation , they can also ask their friends and relatives who have already experienced this before and they have something to guide . Researching online is a great and convenient way to look for accommodation . One can also ask students who are already studying in the same university about the accommodation options . <p> Once the staying place is finalized , they can check all the documents and sign them so that they can start living there the moment they shift to that new place . <h> STAY CONNECTED <p> Launched on Friday 1 March , 2013 , the ' TheDailyBlog.co.nz ' unites New Zealand 's leading left/centre-left commentators and progressive opinion shapers to provide the other side of the story on today 's news , media and political agendas.

@@31949236 <h> Birth of liberal churches an example of religion working as it should <p> A new church has been set up in Auckland , where LGBTI people do n't have to hide . <p> OPINION : It was reported earlier this week in the New Zealand Herald the " bisexual daughter of a conservative Christian pastor " has " teamed up with a gay minister to launch a new church where LGBTI people do n't have to hide " . <p> The Auckland-based Open Table Ministries website says : " We would like to plant an Evangelical affirming Church with the LGBTQIA+ Christian in mind with various ministries which cater towards LGBTQIA Christian living " . <p> Kudos to them . Rather than demanding that certain existing churches accept people supposedly participating in sinful activities , those two young people started their own church . <p> Christian denominations in New Zealand are private institutions . Accordingly , like any other private institution , churches can and do make their own rules and regulations . If you do n't like the rules , it 's simple : do n't go to church , find another church , or as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's what has always happened -- whether it be the Schism , the Reformation , or Brian Tamaki setting up Destiny Church -- the majority of Christian denominations were established because of theological and-or political differences with an existing church . <p> Speaking of Tamaki -- who coincidentally is my whanaunga from Te Kopua marae -- Stuffreported in June that Destiny Church is showing " signs of embracing the Rainbow or LGBTQI community " after he " apologised for years of offensive remarks about gay people " . <p> Tamaki 's previous views on homosexuality are held by many Christians . For example , the official Vatican website says sacred scripture condemns homosexual acts and restricts marriage to between a man and a woman . <p> A couple of years ago , Pope Francis reiterated the Catholic view when he declared that : " In consecrated and priestly life , there 's no room for that kind of affection . " <p> The largest Christian denomination in New Zealand -- the Anglican Church -- has moved in the other direction . Two years ago , the General Synod of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to allow the blessing of same-sex marriages and civil unions . It is important to note that it is merely a " blessing of " same-sex marriages and civil unions -- not actual marriage ceremonies . <p> The radical move by the general synod led to a recent split in Anglican membership and the establishment of a new Anglican body , the Church of Confessing Anglicans of Aotearoa New Zealand . The new group has proclaimed its members are " not bigots " or " an angry group of conservatives " for holding steadfast that " marriage is the lifelong union of a man and a woman " , which is also the view of the worldwide Anglican Communion . <p> Anglicans and their mother church -- the Church of England -- have been struggling with the idea of same-sex marriage for a long time . A distant relative of mine , Peter Elers ( 1930-1986 ) , vicar of an Anglican church in Thaxted , Essex , is reported to have " caused controversy in 1976 by coming out as gay at a conference and by allegedly blessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he again declared his homosexuality on a BBC TV documentary .

The newly established Open Table Ministries can promote " LGBTQIA Christian living " and the Anglican-breakaway can refuse to bless same-sex marriages and civil unions . Whatever floats your boat . <p> Article 18 says : Everyone has the right to freedom of thought , conscience and religion . This right includes freedom to change his religion or belief and freedom , either alone or in community with others and in public or private , to manifest his religion or belief in teaching , practice , worship and observance . <p> Article 19 says : Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression .

@@31953230 <h> WTF : Why Trump Fired -- The Tomahawks Of April <p> Back in the first weeks after Trump was elected , some more ... alarmist minds insisted on comparing the period we 're living in now to the early 1930s . In Germany . Saying things like " if you 've ever sat bored in History class and wondered how it felt -- wondered what you 'd have done ... well , wonder no longer . What you do now is what you would have done then . How it feels now is how it felt back then . " And other similar wild oversimplifications.It 's an interesting exercise in historical synthesis , to be sure ; but for a number of folks , the comparison was to decidedly the wrong War With Germany warm-up period.Instead , for some weeks now I 've been watching some of the brighter minds of my sphere insist instead upon the idea that we 're actually living in a historical re-rub of 1914 . That rather than simply watching an autocratic individual begin an arc of ascent into the political supernal ... we 're witnessing the squaring off of two Great Powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which might very well presage a serious and significant armed conflict -- a shooting war -- between these twinned armed camps . Provided , of course , that the right spark arrived with which to set the entire powderkeg ablaze . A " Proud Tower " , if you will.At first , I thought this was dismissable as the same sort of alarmist rhetoric which saw endless invocations of " TRUMP IS LITERALLY HITLER " or , more superciliously , because some millennials apparently insist upon political comparison being phrased in terms of pop-cultural references ... " TRUMP IS LITERALLY VOLDEMORT " . And then , at a little after 13:00 Friday , we received news that the Trump Administration had fired 59 Tomahawk missiles at an airbase in Syria . Or , in other words , that America had attacked a Russian ally , by bombarding a military installation which also harboured Russian personnel . About the only consolation thus far is that a pre-warning to the Russians means it 's unlikely that any actual Russian casualties have been sustained . And , for that matter , that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of overt American casualties . This latter point matters not so much due to any concern on my part for the lives of American servicemen -- but more because had there been American deaths as part of this retaliatory operation , then further escalation on the US 's part would have been made vastly more likely . An exceptionally scarier prospect indeed.The world now waits and watches with amply baited breath to see what Putin and Russia will say or do in response . Not for the first time , the hopes for continued ( broad ) peace in our time rest upon burly Russian shoulders and pragmatic Slavic restraint.To be sure , it is not the first time we 've all -- collectively -- found ourselves in this situation . Probably the best example from the later 20th century is , obviously , the Cuban Missile Crisis.But then , despite the speculation that his medicinal use of methamphetamine might have altered his judgement leading to a vastly more confrontational outcome at the Vienna Summit in 1961 , the West had a seriously perspicacious and competent leader -- a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To echo Senator Lloyd Bentsen 's ringing words to Dan Quayle in 1988 after the latter had compared himself to Kennedy ... of Trump , it is easily possible to say of him " You 're no Jack Kennedy ! " Not least because when it came to Kennedy 's parlous position in 1963 with the Missile Crisis , Kennedy at least had a clear and compelling sense of his place in history . In fact , he 'd just read a book -- The Guns of August -- about the situation which lead to World War One ; and was therefore very much acutely aware of how even small flash-points , when not treated with utmost calm and restraint , could easily boil over into giant and almighty continent ( or even world ) engulfing conflagrations.The policy pursued towards Russia as the result of that particular WMD-related encounter , therefore , was one of avoiding rather inflaming conflict -- lest the unthinkable happen . Phrased another way , I suspect I 've just implicitly said that a man with a well-documented meth habit may actually have had better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States.And having said that , as bad as President Trump 's subsonic outburst has been ... it could always have been worse . Hillary Clinton suggested in an interview conducted the same day as the missile striek that had SHE been Commander-in-Chief , that the United States would have gone further -- MUCH further -- in its bellicose actions against Syria . Instead of simply temporarily shutting down one airfield and damaging a few planes for that 's pretty much what this attack has done , she would have had the collective might of the US Military attempt to destroy pretty much the lot . And , given her comments about Russia aired in the same interview , one can only wonder how much more overtly aggressive towards the Russians she might have been in the process.Although it is interesting to invoke the specter of " Clintonian " foreign policy in the context of what happened Friday . Not just because of the natural questions as to what the alternative to Trump would have done ; but because there are several precedents drawn from her husband 's tenure as President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnessed.The first and most obvious of these is the narrowly-averted *actual shooting engagement* between Russia and NATO which took place during the Serbian intervention in 1999 . Then , as with today , Russian forces were again deployed at an airbase which the US and its allies wished rendered inoperable by adversarial hands . Troops from the UK were sent in -- and were ordered straight-up by the American General acting as NATO Supreme Commander Europe to engage the Russians with force . Needless to say ... this would almost certainly have lead to a patently undesirable escalation of ( literal ) conflict between NATO and Russia , with the very real risk of World War Three ensuing as a result . Fortunately , cooler heads prevailed ( including a young , pre-stardom James Blunt -- yes , *that* James Blunt ) , and the American order to British forces was countermanded by the UK 's General Mike Jackson.The second concerns the cruise missile strike which Bill Clinton ordered against a pharmaceutical factory located in Sudan , which was alleged to have been manufacturing a nerve gas that might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it happens , the " evidence " which underpinned this decision was later thrown into some rather strong doubt by even the Americans themselves . And , in concert with the now demonstrably spurious assertions of Iraq allegedly possessing vast stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction ( other than , presumably , the ones America sold them in the first place ) , just goes to show that the American track-record of alleging that Middle Eastern countries are in possession of nerve agents is not exactly one hundred per cent.My point is that the comparable actions from recent American history to what occurred Friday do not necessarily suggest that Trump 's course here is the particularly wise one . Hitting wrong targets on the basis of faulty intelligence ; and engaging in a dangerous dance of death by ' prodding the Great Bear ' ... are not what many would call fine examples of Presidential prudence . It is a dangerous form of international engagement indeed which only avoids serious escalation through the patience and valued restraint of the Russians . <h> 39 COMMENTS <p> The way I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering : <p> 1 ) Trump was accused of Russian interference in USA elections . <p> 2 ) What better way to defer those claims than be seen to get ' heavy ' with Russia -- and Assad . <p> 3 ) USA attacked a basically pre-warned ' empty ' airfield . <p> 4 ) Russian troops and Syrian troops were evacuated from that airfield . <p> 5 ) Prior warning was given to both the Russians and the Syrians . <p> 6 ) Russia wants an oil pipeline through Syria . <p> 7 ) Syria benefits from royalty 's from that pipeline . Iraq supports Russia and Syria because they back the Shiites theocracy ( in Iraq ) . <p> 8 ) USA backs Saudi Arabia because of it fulfills its energy requirements -- and Saudi Arabia , Qatar and Bahrain used the Clinton Foundation as a conduit for arms to be distributed to ISIS . <p> 9 ) Saudi Arabia is a Sunni Muslim majority -- and supports ISIS because they are Sunni .

And contrary to the wishes of the Saudi govt / monarchy . It also went contrary to USA oil / energy / economic requirements . <p> 13 ) This way Trump deflects domestic opinion about Russian interference of USA elections by looking ' tough ' against Russia . <p> 14 ) At the same time , Trump is entertaining the Chinese President in Florida- and orders airstrikes on Syria . <p> 15 ) This sends a message to North Korea , - but the REAL message is in fact directed towards China -- with the message that the USA is willing to use force in the South China seas . <p> 16 ) This also forces NATO country 's to finance their own military efforts against Russia -- something that Trump has warned them about . Trump is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 ) This also weakens the U N 's moral high ground -- particularity in regards to its relations with NATO country 's against Russia .

Meaning that the rebels were the only armed group in Syria with chemical weapons Khan Sheikhoun was under the control of Al Nusra/Al Queda . Why is it so impossible to imagine that they did n't have a cache of sarin there ? " Experts " have apparently refuted the Russian claim that the Syrian air strikes damaged a sarin cache , thus releasing gas , claiming that this would be impossible , that you ca n't store sarin gas , and that it loses its efficacy when exploded Today , the US military said they did n't target the building storing the Syrians sarin because the explosion would have caused the release of sarin gas and hurt civilians So which is it ?

In fact the only reporting as far as I can tell has come from Al Queda/Al Nusra spokespeople , who can not be trusted to report the truth . <p> Not disputing that point . In fact I would say ISIS is sick enough to use any means possible to inflict death and destruction on infidels ( under the premise that they are the religion of peace , but that 's another argument ) . <p> Why then did both Syria and Russia point to a chemical factory being hit for the reason for the death of so many civilians ? You 'd think if they thought it was ISIS they would come up to the plate and say that ( because you 're right , it seems more than plausible ) . <p> Notwithstanding that if ISIS did use chemical weapons then then why come up with some cockamamie story about a chemical factory that happened to have what looks like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to civilians . <p> I find all this stuff vaguely interesting at best but I can hardly be bothered dignifying the looming hissy fits between noble leaders of noble nations with a comment .

Has it been proven that the Syrian Government ordered it and carried it out ? I am not aware of actual evidence that this is the case . The best we have is conjecture , awaiting verification . ( And assertions on the part of Turkey which some might view as rather sketchy and questionably motivated ) Russia has stated -- quite validly , might I add -- that if the United States is in possession of evidence as " incontrovertible " as has been claimed of Syrian culpability , that this should be made public as promptly as possible .

And as Maya Mikdashi has pointed out you can not act as if you care about the victims of Assad when you are at the same time demonising them as refugees and blocking their escape routes . Having said this , those who ask ' what interest does Assad have in using chemical weapons ? ' are asking the wrong question . The use of chemical weapons by Assad is not a strategic decision . The question makes it out as if this bombing is a unique event . Chemicals are an integral dimension of Assad 's dictatorial rule , and its mode of humiliating , crushing , terrorising and eliminating dissent . To use a sentence by my friend the late Patrick Wolfe ' it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the core of the necro-politics that is at the foundation of Assad 's Syria . So much so that we can speak of a chemico-necropolitics . In this way it is no different to American imperialism which from Vietnam to Iraq has a distinctly chemico-necropolitics at its base , or to Israel 's phosphoric bombs-laced subjugation of Palestinians , except that in the Assad regime 's case , it is a government 's relation to its own people . <p> Curwen Rollerson and others have remained sceptical at Donald 's Trump 's new found concern for murdered Syrian children . <p> The fact that Donald Trump was sitting down to dinner with Xi Jinping at the same time the attack was going down , might have had something to do with it . <p> I wonder how Mr Xi got to hear of it ?

However , Pyongyang 's response suggested the reclusive state was determined to continue with its nuclear weapons programme . <p> My feeling is that the gas used in the attack on the rebel areas by the regime was not sarin , more likely it was chlorine . Easier to manufacture and commonly packed into the barrel bombs that the government regularly drop from helicopters onto civilian rebel held towns and areas . Actions that the Assad regime usually get away with , drawing little condemnation from the West . <p> So why has the Trump administration raised the stakes by claiming that the regime has started using a nerve agent like sarin on their people . <p> Many are not convinced by Trump 's new found concern for murdered Syrian children , more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed by the Trump administration to justify their attack on the regime . <p> Many are not convinced by Trump 's newfound concern for murdered Syrian children . <p> So why was the Trump administration moved to raise the stakes and attack the regime on this occasion ? <p> Several commentators have posited that the timing had a lot to do with the high profile meeting between Donald Trump and President Xi Jinping , delivering a pointed threat about the US and China 's differences over the South China Sea and North Korea . <p> That the attack was launched as Xi and Trump sat down to dinner could hardly be a coincidence . <p> The international bankers based mostly in the US and Britain can not stand the independent policies of Russia , and want Russia 's resources brought under their control . <p> What we have been witnessing recently is yet another phase of a relentless campaign to subjugate Russia and loot the place that goes back to Russian Revolution . <p> If the criminals and clowns that now constitute the bulk of western governments and western bureaucracies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are utterly deluded to the point of complete madness . <p> That said , the bankers have made such a shocking mess of the western world and placed the western world in an utterly untenable position and unsustainable position via the squandering of resources and the promotion of grossly polluting activities : they are now rapidly running out of options ( manipulating interest rates and manipulating markets no longer generates the required results ) ...... and when bankers run out of options they always promote war . <p> These are the most dangerous times in all of human history , both because the western world is government by maniacs and liars and because the energy systems and environment that have supported industrial civilization for over 200 years are now in terminal decline .

@@31959237 <h> Review : Ghost of Tsushima is a slick conclusion to the PS4 's lifecycle <p> Another PS4 exclusive , another game about the cost of violence . Sam Brooks reviews Ghost of Tsushima , the last big exclusive of the console . <p> A lot of gamers have been calling for a game like Ghost of Tsushima since Assassin 's Creed started moving into different time periods and locations across the globe . They wanted an Assassin 's Creed game set in Japan . With each successive game announced in that series , the collective " oh well " got louder . It 's fortuitous , then , just as buzz for the latest Assassin 's Creed game starts building in earnest ( set in Vikings-era Britannia ) , that Ghost of Tsushima , the last big exclusive on the PS4 , courtesy of Sucker Punch , drops . Gamers , you finally got it . You got your Assassin 's Creed set in Japan . But does it live up to what you 've wanted for well over a decade now ? <p> Look at the scroll bar to your right . You know the answer is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , the yes . Sucker Punch has been making slick games for years now , and the half-decade it has spent on it shows . The game is set on Tsushima Island during the first Mongol invasion of Japan in 1274 ; the island sits between Korea and Japan , and it 's the last stepping stone for the Mongols to get to the mainland . It opens with the inhabitants of Tsushima Island well and truly losing their first skirmishes with the Mongols , and by the time you play as samurai Jin Sakai , you 're in the position of having to win the island back , bit-by-bit , against a foe who has more or less already won . <p> It 's a reskin of the same gameplay that we 've seen a hundred times before -- indeed , the game is more similar to latter-day Assassin 's Creed games than it is to anything Sucker Punch has done before . The combat relies on you keeping on your feet ; changing stances , using ghost weapons ( a gadget by any other name still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While there 's no waypoints , as such , there 's light RPG progression , a range of collectibles to boost your way through that progression , and question marks to tick off on a map . <p> The difference is that Sucker Punch 's product is a lot slicker ; it simply feels more satisfying to play , with little flourishes and quality of life/play improvements . Rather than an ugly HUD telling you where to go , simply brushing on the touchpad will have a picturesque wind blow in the direction you want to go . It 's a level of care and specificity that puts Ghost of Tsushima if not ahead of the pack , then definitely apart from it ; it does n't feel like yet another open world game , it feels like its own thing . <p> It helps that the world is n't the huge sprawl of Assassin 's Creed , but it has a variety that makes it seem larger and livelier than it is . Somehow the island of Tsushima ( in real life about 700km squared ) manages to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the player gets to explore both deep wintry whites , sulky-looking swamps and glossy green forests . <p> The game that Ghost most feels like is , strangely enough , the PS2-era Grand Theft Auto games . The focus of the missions , especially the incidental " Tales " ( side stories , essentially ) is more character focused than many open world games are ; Jin gathers a small amount of allies through his journey to rid the island of Mongols , like the bow master Sensei Ishikawa , the slightly dodgy merchant Kenji and the bereaved , revenge-bent mother Masako . The last of these is the most compelling ; Masako has a genuine emotional arc , going through pretty much every stage of grief but lingering on anger for a lot of anger , and it 's a sad reminder of what open world games lost when they went for breadth over depth . <p> Those PS2 Grand Theft Auto games had tight plots , memorable side characters , but the worlds had a sense of scale to them ; you felt like you were truly inhabiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you 're inhabiting a very lusciously rendered map . Sucker Punch leans hard into the former ; even though you 're inhabiting an island that has very quickly been torn apart by invading forces , it feels alive with survivor camps and settlements , and by keeping both the scale of the island and the cast limited , it lets the player spend more time , and to actually emotionally invest in it . <p> But , and this is something I noted in my review of The Last of Us Part II , it suffers from hanging out in the same thematic territory that a lot of triple-A games are preoccupied : the cost of violence . Ghost of Tsushima has a more interesting spin on this ; it 's less the cost of violence , and more the cost of what engaging in a very specific kind of violence means . If it 's the only way to save your home , your island , and everybody who lives there , then is it worth ditching your sense of honour ? But it 's still the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gruelling time -- while there 's a little more lightness and more variety in the gameplay than say , even The Last of Us Part II , it 's still ultimately a lot of violence that 's intended to be dark , depressing and thoughtful . <p> That brings us to the elephant in the room : the setting . Since the game 's announcement , it 's been hard not to throw some side-eye at a western studio using a very specific point in Japanese history as the setting for their next game . While this is something that Assassin 's Creed has been doing , well , since the start , Ubisoft skirts around the issue with the disclaimer at the beginning of each of those games ( " this work of fiction was designed , developed , and produced by a multicultural team of various religions and beliefs " ) and by taking on characters that are as much part of myth as they are history . Putting Leonardo Da Vinci in your game is not quite the same as putting an obscure historical character from 13th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why Sucker Punch 's decision to fill a historical event with fictional characters is understandable , but frustrating . Understandable in that the studio clearly does n't want to offend ( or be cancelled ) for misrepresenting real-life historical figures in what will be their first introduction to millions of people . This is n't Dynasty Warriors , there are not dozens of folk tales and other adaptations preceding them to muddy the waters of fictionalisation , and to essentially give Sucker Punch carte-blanche to do what they want . There has to be some respect paid to the culture they 're debating , and understanding of the weight of bringing this certain period of mainstream history to the fore . <p> According to a smattering of Japanese critics who have reviewed the game , Ghost of Tsushima actually does a good job of this -- especially compared to most exoticised depictions of the country in other western media . Lost in Translation this is n't . The work 's clearly been done , but it raises the question of why this era in this way ? If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture right , why not pick an era where you can get the history right as well ? To remove culture from its historical context is dicey territory , and although Sucker Punch has done it well here , it sets a precedent that studios without the same resources as Sucker Punch might not be able or willing to meet . <p> Beyond being a slick game with hours of engaging , dynamic gameplay ( you could even say too many hours ) , Sucker Punch 's Ghost of Tsushima actually ends up being a step in the right direction when it comes to these sorts of semi-historical open world games , a far more prominent genre than all those adjectives and qualifiers might suggest . It 's definitely more culturally aware than I think it would be if it came out at , say , the start of this generation . The game is also a fine rounding off for the PS4 at the end of its lifecycle , but I hope it 's a capping off for at least one more thing : games about the cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crop of these -- I 'd rank it as more enjoyable , with more tonal variation than , say , another recent PS4 exclusive -- but I 'm pretty done with this theme .

@@31959238 <h> Three in four New Zealanders think the country will overcome Covid-19 <p> Our Covid-19 outlook is still one of the most positive in the world . But with new cases emerging in recent weeks , our optimism levels have taken a hit . <p> Jacinda Ardern yesterday delivered a speech announcing the " next steps " for New Zealand 's Covid-19 response , and what will happen in the event of a community case being detected . But as the country braces for a sustained period of isolation from the rest of the world , our levels of optimism about " overcoming " the Covid-19 have begun to ebb , according to the latest survey from research company Global Web Index . <p> New Zealand 's optimism levels had been trending upwards , peaking at a high of 83% in May . That number has fallen to 73% in GWI 's latest survey , conducted between June 29 and July 2 . It remains high in a global context , but is the lowest for New Zealand since the level four lockdown began in late March . <p> The decline in optimism likely comes as new cases emerge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared Covid-free . On June 16 , two arrivals from the UK tested positive after having been allowed to leave managed isolation under compassionate exemption and without being tested . Other stories raised questions about the permeability of the isolation and quarantine system , with minister Megan Woods and Air Commodore Darryn Webb being entlisted to lead the oversight of the system . <p> New Zealand remains , however , extremely optimistic about its coronavirus situation compared to the rest of the world . Among the 18 countries included in the survey , New Zealand was ranked second most optimistic , with India close behind in third with 71% . Only China , where the virus originated , felt more optimistic . Some 90% of Chinese were confident the country would overcome the virus . <p> When it came to how we felt about the pandemic globally , just 22% of New Zealanders felt optimistic -- down from 31% in May -- presumably reflecting the worsening health crisis in countries like the US and Brazil .

@@31959239 <h> The Bulletin : Collins reshuffles caucus , will make major speech today <p> Good morning and welcome to The Bulletin . In today 's edition : Collins announces major reshuffle after two leading MPs quit , horror story of migrant worker abuse revealed , and Auckland 's emergency budget passes . <p> So , there was a bit of incorrect information in yesterday 's Bulletin about departures from National . It turns out Amy Adams will also be quitting , meaning both of former leader Todd Muller 's key lieutenants are gone . It precipitated a much wider reshuffle for new leader Judith Collins , the details of which can be found in our live blog . Nobody would deny that it has been an extraordinary political week for the party , but even so , there are a lot of questions to be asked about the ' strong team ' part of what was their slogan on Monday -- Toby Manhire has an excellent analysis of what it means for them . <p> On that reshuffle , Collins has kept both former leaders in the inner circle , and has promoted other liberals to replace Kaye and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with foreign affairs , and Muller will take trade . Chris Bishop and Nicola Willis -- two strong supporters of the Muller coup -- have both been moved up , and Bishop will become the shadow leader of the house . Dr Shane Reti is now all the way up to number five in the caucus after a remarkable run this term . And Harete Hipango will become shadow attorney general -- she 's a first term MP from Whanganui , who came to parliament after a distinguished career in law . <p> Perhaps the only real loser in the reshuffle is former justice spokesperson Mark Mitchell . As Stuff 's Henry Cooke put it in a very useful analysis piece , Mitchell put his hand up for the leadership again this time around , forcing a contest at a time when party power-brokers wanted a coronation . But on Mitchell 's demotion , " many suggest this has more to do with work ethic than vindictiveness , " wrote Cooke . The reshuffle will perhaps bring an end to the months of chaos that have engulfed the party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking unity last time too of course . ) Bridges went on Newstalk ZB to make it clear that Collins had his support , though there was also a hint of off the record friction in this story by Newshub 's Tova O'Brien , in which MPs reflected on the fact that an MP who had been disloyal in the past was now demanding loyalty from them as leader . <p> Meanwhile , we 're expecting a major policy speech on infrastructure to be delivered today by Collins . A similar version was planned for earlier in the week by Muller , but had to be pushed back slightly for obvious reasons . One policy was pushed out yesterday by finance spokesperson Paul Goldsmith -- the NZ Herald 's ( paywalled ) Hamish Rutherford was at a speech in which he announced National would suspend contributions to the Super Fund , as a way of holding down debt . It was also a move taken by Bill English in 2008 , before contributions were resumed by the current government 's Grant Robertson . There was no such policy clarity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Checkpoint , in which he repeatedly refused to give answers because of which show was asking the questions . <p> The Spinoff would like to invite Bulletin readers to a special event with Breast Cancer Foundation NZ . <p> The effects of Covid-19 are often hidden from every day view . Writing on The Spinoff , Breast Cancer NZ ambassador Stacey Morrison spoke to Chloe Irvine about her experience with breast cancer through lockdown . <p> To support Breast Cancer Foundation NZ 's vital work The Spinoff is holding a Pink Ribbon Breakfast . Hosted by Stacey Morrison at Kind Cafe in Morningside , Auckland on July 28 from 730am the breakfast will hear from women about their breast cancer journeyand foundation advocates about the work they do . <p> Limited tickets are available here for a donation of $50 or more ( and includes breakfast ) . If you live outside Auckland or are unable to join us for breakfast we still welcome your support for Breast Cancer Foundation NZ . <p> A starkly confronting story about the situation of seasonal migrant workers in Hawkes Bay , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting between workers and their employers has revealed said employer threatening to withhold allowances and flights back to their home country . The way he talked to them implied a situation close to slavery . The story was followed up with another in which it is alleged the employer assaulted a worker . Complaints have been made to MBIE , but you have to wonder -- if this was caught on tape once , how often are similar situations playing out ? <p> Auckland 's emergency budget has passed with rates rises of 3.5% , staving off the harshest of service cuts . As Radio NZ reports , mayor Phil Goff says a lower rates rise would have resulted in things like library hours being cut , and rubbish bins being removed -- " a whole lot of small but meaningful things " . There will also be no cuts to infrastructure spending , as it is likely to be a necessary part of economic recovery . As it is though , the Council 's finances will still be in a lot of pain for a while , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Tens of thousands of sensitive identity documents have been accessible online after a Wellington property management company left them unsecured , reports CyberNews . The breach involves passports , drivers licenses and more , with the documents being held by LPM Property Management . Stuff picked up on one particularly troubling element -- a security company based in Ireland spotted the security flaw in May and immediately informed the company , who either did n't get the message , or just pissed around doing nothing about it for a month . For their part , LPM issued a statement saying " we promptly dealt with this issue once we were made aware of it . The data is fully protected after our external technical contractor acted to ensure it was safe . " <p> The effectiveness of the government 's Covid-tracing app has been called into serious question in a report given to DPMC , covered by Business Desk 's Pattrick Smellie . The key point is that it is seen as highly unlikely that the app could ever make enough of a dent in the population to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app in recent days , saying the current levels of uptake are n't good enough . But even so , the current download figures are sitting at just over 600,000 users ( with far fewer people actually using it regularly ) so it is n't really close to the necessary levels of saturation . <p> Inflation is down over the last quarter in large part because of the lower price of fuel , reports Interest . Along with the rise in unemployment , it is leading economists to suggest that the Reserve Bank will need to do more stimulus in the form of quantitative easing . Normally the target for inflation ( basically , how much more things cost over time ) is between 1-3% for any given year , but it is expected to bottom out below that by the end of the year , due to the various economic strains caused by Covid-19 , and the loss of international tourism . <p> A hikoi will be taking place today against plans for a proposed dump in the Dome Valley , north of Auckland . I 've reported on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatua , local residents and the Kaipara District Council , even though the dump is technically outside the latter 's area . Their big concern is for the prospect of a leak , which could pollute the Hoteo River and Kaipara Harbour -- and as we 've seen from dumps all over the country , it would still matter if that happened in 100 years time . A petition will also be handed over to Auckland Council , though much to the disappointment of organisers , mayor Phil Goff will not be there to receive it . <p> A bit of housekeeping : I wo n't be doing Monday 's Bulletin , but I 'm excited to tell you that it will be a first ever Bulletin for deputy editor Alice Neville , who has an excellent news brain , and will probably make far fewer typos than I do . I 'll be back on Tuesday , after a short weekend holiday before the election campaign really gets going . <p> Right now on The Spinoff : Trevor McKewen is back in managed isolation in New Zealand after visiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our version . Sophie Handford calls on voters to force politicians to put climate change on the agenda for 2020 . Kevin Dew writes about the ' green fairies ' , who get medicinal cannabis for those in need , and why they 're hoping for a yes vote in the upcoming referendum . Josie Adams writes about the remarkable work Wikipedia volunteers did to get accurate pandemic information up quickly . And Alice Webb-Liddall speaks to the operators of a physio studio , who somehow managed to take their practice digital over lockdown . <p> For a feature today , an argument about an important movement that lost itself in hypocrisy . The #MeToo movement took on some powerful and important people , but has since declined to address allegations against others who are considered too politically necessary . As Madeleine Holden writes in Mel Magazine , that has profound consequences for whether survivors will come forward . Here 's an excerpt : <p> In short , the position of liberals , when one of their guys is accused , has essentially been that a little bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important to note that this attitude persisted even among people who granted that Reade might be telling the truth , at a time when it was possible to insist on a different Democratic nominee for president . For example , New York Times columnist Linda Hirshman told readers she believed Reade but urged voters to " suck it up and make the utilitarian bargain " by voting for Biden anyway . Nation columnist Katha Pollitt said she would " vote for Joe Biden if he boiled babies and ate them . " <p> This is what it means to live in a post-#MeToo world when a man " too important " to lose is accused : Claimants are treated as presumptive liars , as ever , and sexual violence still is n't considered a disqualifying factor for holding the highest office in America . <p> Do n't laugh , but ... could the Phoenix actually win the A-League ?

@@31967230 <h> Blogs <h> Change of plans but are we there yet ? <p> So we have yet another change of plans for regulating the financial adviser sector . As we reported yesterday the latest recommendations from the select committee have a couple of key features . The first being a return to the concept of tiered regulation , that is one level for simple products like term deposits , and the other for complex ones . The other key change is that a Commissioner for Financial Advisers be established to work within the Securities Commission . On first glance these ideas look good . Regulating advisers on a product basis makes sense . That way it is pretty clear what who sits where . I am sure there will be some fascinating outcomes such as how does it impact on a mortgage broker who is selling KiwiSaver ? I assume KiwiSaver is a complex product ( although it is meant to be simple ) . A concern I have had previously is that the Securities Commission was being put into a regulatory role over a sector it does n't appear to have a lot of in-depth experience about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather a reflection of the role it plays . ) A Commissioner of Financial Advice is a good idea . The caution is that the terms of reference and description of the role need to be absolutely tight . As one person said : " it should be as wide as a very narrow doorway . " The appointment of this role is absolutely critical to the success of this regime . A couple of other points worth noting are that it appears the " accredited institution " idea is still alive . As long as there is an alternative and these institutions have exactly the same rules and standards of the alternative then the industry can , I suspect , live with this . Judging by the feedback to a previous post on this idea there is still some way to go in explaining the set-up and getting buy-in from advisers who do n't wish to be aligned to a particular institution . As a bit of a footnote to this whole saga it has been fascinating to see how things have unfolded . In particular the role the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She has been willing to listen to ideas and get it right . While the process has been long it appears to be reaching a conclusion which is workable . Secondly , she has repeatedly said she wants the changes to happen before the election . A week ago I would have said little chance . Now , it is looking far more likely . Finally Dalziel gets credit for openly acknowledging that the former idea of having APBs was the wrong idea .

Can anybody tell me why one of the MOST regulated countries , the good ole ' US of A , still has MAJOR financial institutions failing , and hundreds of thousands of investors losing millions of dollars ? <p> On a more local note -- we have the Securities Act , the Consumer Goods Act , the Financial Transactions Reporting Act , to name a few , and yet investors in New Zealand are STILL losing money . Slightly off the track , but still very relevant -- the Anti-Smacking Law that cost millions HAS NOT REDUCED CHILD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an investment company 's failure to perform ! <p> What I am saying is that the harder that bureaucracy legislates to protect the stupid , the more problems and inefficiencies it causes . <p> Do n't get me wrong : I can see many benefits in cleaning out the cowboys in our industry . The benefits extend to clients and advisers alike . <p> However , I see far more appropriate and more effective methods . Make the product providers more accountable for the advisers they employ or contract with . The companies should be responsible for the training and development of new advisers , and if the adviser 's behavior becomes questionable , then they accept the responsibility . The companies could even go as far as to pay 50% of the Public Indemnity Insurance cover . This way , product providers will be very careful about who they take on as an " Accredited Adviser " . Of course this wo n't completely stop all the cowboys , but then neither will any other form of legislation , no matter how intense it is . <p> Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- they do n't really care who brings in the business -- as long as the business comes in . Any disputes can be quickly hidden behind policy wording or bad advice from the adviser . I believe the only reason that insurance companies are so much in favour of regulation is that it will increase the annual premiums ! Of course advisers will also benefit from that . But I ask the question again : WILL THE CONSUMER ACTUALLY BENEFIT in any way from MORE regulation ? Clearly , the Securities Act , the Disclosure Act , and the Anti-Smacking Laws have n't achieved total protection . <p> On a more personal note -- I am a mortgage broker . People come to me seeking assistance and guidance in housing finance . As part of my compliance process , I also do a full risk assessment , and advise accordingly . I do the same for the limited investment advice I do . Am I now supposed to do a full financial " needs analysis " that incorporates an entire investment and retirement plan , as well as portfolio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line when it comes to financial advice ? My core business is mortgage broking and risk protection . Will I ( and others in a similar niche ) be expected to retrain in the art of Financial and Investment Planning ? <p> To compare it to the building industry : * You hire a builder to do the building * You hire an electrician to do the electrical * You hire a plumber to do the plumbing and so on . No one tradesman can do everything efficiently . To oversee the whole project , you have project managers who monitor progress and quality -- they are accountable . Then you have building inspectors who do spot checks to ensure compliance with local by-laws . <p> It seems to me that the proposed regulation of Financial Advisors is seeking to have a body at government level trying to monitor individual advisers . Seeing this as a major undertaking , the obvious answer to the bureaucrats is to create a whole lot of unrealistic and impractical processes that will ( mark my words ) become more hassle for the consumers while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The best example of this is the much ridiculed Disclosure Document . Yes , I have one , but it is so long winded and comprehensive ( it has to be comprehensive to cover the Mortgage advice , the Risk recommendations , the Investment Advice , and the budgeting advice I give , all free of charge ) - that probably only 1% of my clients have actually read it . And to be honest , I do n't believe there is ANYTHING in it that would change a persons mind about whether or not they do business with me . However , it does use a lot of extra paper and ink , and wastes a lot of time . In addition , to be able to read it and understand it fully in one reason you would need to be a lawyer . Some of my clients ( and I mean this with the greatest respect ) can hardly read . But they are still good clients . <p> My accountant has never shown me his disclosure document , or any of my lawyers or solicitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any of my bank managers or IRD managers . Neither has the man behind the counter at the T.A.B ! All of these people are just as capable of removing money from me in an illegal or immoral way . <p> On that note -- I have seen more people lose money from corrupt lawyers and accountants than financial advisers over the last 10 years . If we advisers are to be regulated , I believe many other professions should also be investigated . <p> To be totally frank -- may of the product providers are their own worst enemy . All commissions should be the same , and products sold on their relevance to the people we recommend them to . Commission should not be an influence on carrier choice . It should also be paid in such a way so as to prevent churning . This will add further protection to clients . A good solution for this would be REDUCE up front commissions , and spread the commission -- bigger trails . If this was legislated instead , we would see the cowboys leave the industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve and pay for ! <p> In summary , I do n't believe further regulation is required . I believe the product providers should provide comprehensive accreditation and monitoring of all advisers in the same way Banks train and monitor their staff . In this way , a client will have recourse against the adviser , and the product provider . If the adviser screws up -- he ( she ) will loose their accreditation , or get further corrective training . A national register will keep track of training and accreditation of advisers , as will a compulsory affiliation with a professional body ( PAA , NZMBA , IFA , etc . ) . <p> I have held off my views as long as I could , because in the past I have seen the bureaucrats keep marching on , ignoring those at the coal-face , and losing sight of the objectives , in the pursuit of more Legislation for the sake of legislation . <p> It is about time common sense took over , and we kept the real consumers in focus all the way through the process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ businessmen who keep this country going . <p> Maybe there is a better forum that these points could be discussed . <p> Maybe I am looking at things to simplistically . <p> Maybe I should n't be a broker because I care about the people who provide me with my income . <p> I welcome any comments , and maybe we could start a discussion . It may not be too late to have our say -- going on the track record so far , we still have another 2 years before any bill gets even close to being passed ..... <p> On 8 August 2008 at 12:51 pm Gary Taylor - Napier said : <p> Bravo to Andy Phillipson on his article . What he has suggested is so simple that it would work .

Gary Taylor <p> On 8 August 2008 at 1:50 pm Nigel Tate CFPcm CLU said : <p> I support a lot of what Andy Phillipson has to say above with a few minor exceptions . <p> Andy , if you are giving mortgage advice along with risk management advice as well as " some " investment advice then I believe you should be able and required to show competence in all of these areas . This is closer to comprehensive advice than simple mortgage structuring , a little bit of plumbing can be as dangerous as a lot . <p> I also have a problem with the product providers having too much control over the advisers dealing directly with the members of the public as this is more than likely leading toward product bias that is not needed . I do like the idea and have promoted this in the past , that all companies should be required to pay a set standard amount of commissions/brokerages for any new business placed and it seems that this amount should be around 20% - 25% per annum flat . NO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's comments around the process of formulating legislation in New Zealand , I could n't agree with him more fervently , the government is reaction to the recent finance company slides in a knee jerking manner and are in my view loosing sight of the real issues and their own objectives - to protect the investing public in a way that promotes the use of and growth of financial assets . <p> I feel the Government is being sidetracked on many of these real issues and we are ending up with what amounts to paralysis by analysis . <p> I came into this profession some 21 years ago and was told at the time to " keep it simple stupid " and feel that that advice is as appropriate now as it was then , are you listening Lianne ? ? <p> With the swift timing of the Select Committee reply I feel we may be very close to the Bill being enacted most likely rushed through before the election and I wonder whether we as affected individuals and corporates should not be canvassing our local MP 's in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hastily constructed Bill to be passed in it 's current form . <p> On 8 August 2008 at 2:25 pm Simon Hassan ( former IFA president ) said : <p> I should clarify that among other things in that article ( " Commission the big bugbear for money advice " , SST , 13 Jul 08 ) the report that I 'd " always believed the APB model would n't work " was just wrong . <p> Most who took an interest in financial adviser regulation will know that I was a keen advocate of the APB idea - and closely involved with MED and the other professional bodies in trying to make it work . <p> But I never agreed ( and made this clear to the Minister ) with the MED idea that multiple APB 's could compete over advisers in the same space . It seemed that pretty well everyone but MED could see that this would n't work . APBs are about standards ; how can competing on standards help consumers ? But MED would n't budge . <p> In the end I was relieved when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flaw -- was scrapped . And there were other attractions in the change - notably a significant shortening of the time frame , and ( potentially anyway ) a simpler and cheaper regulatory system . <p> I have no doubt that the G4 ( now FAANZ ) would have succeeded in creating a pan APB . But even this body would cover only a minority of financial advisers . I understand that FAANZ 's combined practitioner membership is only about 1750 , in a population of something like 6000 insurance , savings and/or investment advisers . <p> Simon Hassan ( Past President , IFA ) <p> On 8 August 2008 at 5:17 pm Dave Thomas said : <p> Gee , I think Andy needs to take a deep breath ! <p> Having been in the industry for only eight years it is very clear to me that the vested interests of many entrenched Advisers ( and Providers ) will always get in the way of any Voluntary Code being established that will be enforced with vigour . <p> So you might now have to work harder to earn your large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some value after all . <p> All Strength to the Securities Commission and Lianne Dalziel . <p> Dave Thomas Auckland <p> On 8 August 2008 at 6:17 pm Tony Vidler said : <p> I love seeing and hearing people who have clearly considered the industry issues voicing considered opinion . Congratulations one and all . <p> Might I suggest that strongly held views on what is appropriate in the regulatory reform be directed , via the submissions process , to the people formulating policy ? <p> To be frank , the only thing that will influence politicians is weight of opinion , and soundly constructed arguments that place the consumers interests at the forefront . <p> The original objective , supposedly , of regulation was to promote confidence in the financial advisory industry , increase participation in the use of financial products by consumers , and ensue a sound and robust system existed to protect or remedy wrong-doing . <p> These are still worthy objectives , but I fear that the legislators have lost sight of the original objectives . <p> You folk can remind them of those objectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as the " leaders " of the industry associations can . <p> However at this stage I have doubts the tiered regulations will assist advisers to do the things they should to meet investors expectations such as ; - understand products they recommend - explain the risks - disclose commissions and rewards - understand the client needs - advise in the clients interest - understand the legal framework 
@@31967231 <h> News <h> Tauranga : Bargains in the bay <h> Tauranga 's property market has been turned on its head by the current climate . Although some parts of the Bay of Plenty city and surrounding areas have finally reached the bottom , others are yet to hit . Adrienne Jervis talks to locals with their finger on the pulse to gauge the market from an investor 's point of view <h> Tuesday , December 16th 2008 , 12:00AM <p> by The Landlord <p> Located around a large harbour extending along the western Bay of Plenty , and protected by Matakana Island and the extinct volcano of Mauao ( Mt Maunganui ) , Tauranga 's sheltered position creates a warm , dry climate and is a lifestyler 's haven . <p> This temperate climate , combined with a diverse landscape rich in resources , makes the region a horticulture and agriculture stronghold , renowned for its tangelos , avocados and kiwifruit , burgeoning vineyards and winery industry . <p> Serving this large horticulture district is the Port of Tauranga , New Zealand 's largest export port . <p> Fastest growing cityTauranga is New Zealand 's ninth largest city and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the fastest growing population per capita in New Zealand and is expected to surpass Dunedin to become the country 's fifth largest urban area within a few years . <p> Ten years ago greater Tauranga was a popular retirement destination , but recent trends have seen Aucklanders moving more towards Northland for retirement . <p> Johnny Simmons , Tauranga City Council , says that with 2% growth per year , the Tauranga City region is second only to the Rodney District in terms of growth . " Ourpopulation is 106,000 , with a large number of young families moving to the region . " <p> There is a greater demand for skilled employees in a variety of roles to help sustain the growth . <p> Generally regarded as a safe place to invest , Simmons says the local property market has to deal with the same financial drivers that are evident both nationally and internationally . " The ( disappearance ) of cheap credit and the collapse of several finance companies , in particular , have had a direct affect on the finance available for property development and investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business , Tauranga City Council forecasts are largely in line with the national forecasts . The region has a large number of infrastructure projects happening including an addition to the harbour bridge . <p> Chief executive officer of the Port of Tauranga , Mark Cairns , says the port has experienced a record log cart-in , with a significant increase in logs coming in the port gates . " We are tracking well ahead of the last four years . <p> " The fall in the New Zealand dollar , the drop in freight rates and the Russian Federation 's 80% export tariff will help our exporters . " <p> Forestry represents a third of the trade through the port and Cairns reports cautious optimism for the industry 's future . <p> InfrastructureTransport is essential to the success of SmartGrowth , a programme led by Environment Bay of Plenty , Tauranga City Council , Western Bay of Plenty District Council , and tangata whenua , to develop and implement a plan for managing growth in the western Bay of Plenty . <p> SmartGrowth reports that with around 289,000 people expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2051 , planning needs to begin to ensure there is enough public transport and good roads to enable residents to get around safely , sustainably and without wasting excessive amounts of time sitting in traffic jams . <p> A new bus service has been introduced to serve the growth area of Pyes Pa West which is expected to feature around 3,000 homes by 2021 including 2,000 homes in The Lakes subdivision at Tauriko . While the potential pace of development in Arataki and Greerton may have slowed under Smart Living Places , the growth of Pyes Pa West is set to continue . <p> Western Bay of Plenty District Council planner , Mark Fauvel , says the council is following the regional SmartGrowth path with Waihi Beach , Katikati , Te Puke and Omokoroa identified as intensification areas . Two recent plan changes will free up more residential land . Sewage reticulation to the Omokoroa Peninsula allows for growth from its current 2,000-plus to 12,000 . <p> Seventy-two hectares of industrial land has been created in Te Puke . Long-term provision will see an industrial park established at Rangiuru , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Tauranga Eastern motorway , which will by-pass Te Puke . <p> The strategy is to set aside industrial land and avoid big box retailing . " We want to preserve the identity and character of our townships , " says Fauvel . <p> Papamoa East provides an important opportunity to accommodate Tauranga 's future population growth through urban development of up to 1100ha of greenfield land.The Wairakei-Te Tumu Urban Development Strategy intends that Papamoa East be developed as a " live , work , play " environment in accordance with sustainable urban development principles . <p> Residential developmentAccording to Gareth Kiernan , managing director of Infometrics , land is still very plentiful , but residential development work has virtually stopped as credit conditions have tightened and buyer demand has dried up . " The cash flow of spec builders , in particular , is probably coming under a lot of pressure and there could be falls in land prices if developers are forced to reduce their holdings . " <p> He says development levies imposed by the council a few years ago have contributed to the lift in land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Incomes in the region probably do n't justify very high house prices , though obviously coastal property is generally an exception as demand is not confined to people buying their primary residence . " <p> Kiernan does n't expect the Tauranga market 's relative performance , compared to New Zealand as a whole , to be as good as it was during the 1990s . " Overall , the region'sproperty market is going through much the same as the rest of the country -- a collapse in buyer demand , little pressure on most vendors to sell , and thus a Mexican stand-off of sorts . " <p> While Tauranga is a fast-growing region with a lot of subdivisions on stream , well marketed sales this year have been incredibly slow . Subdivision sections have perhaps been the hardest hit of all property categories during the downturn . Values have come back for most stock in the 10% to 20% range.QV Valuations manager in Tauranga , Shayne Donovan-Grammer , says the market downturn has been unkind on spec builders . " Interest in new homes is less than established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sell at cost . " <p> Residential marketRecent residential property listings were 530 ( Mt Maunganui ) , 350 ( Papamoa ) and Tauranga , 1120 . The total number of sales for August was 140 , 50% down on an average month . <p> " Supply and demand is out of whack , " says Simon Martin AREINZ , manager of Harcourts Mt Maunganui . <p> Listings hit a 44-month low , but are slowly coming back . Martin says homes were placed in the rental pool , creating an oversupply . " They either could n't rent them or rent prices could n't be achieved , so were put back on the market . " <p> Martin 's gut feeling is that the Mount Maunganui/Papamoa market , which performs differently to Tauranga , hit the bottom in May in terms of volume of sales and the market has started to rebound . " May sales were 41 , which have slightly improved since then -- apart from August . The average time to sell plummeted to 95 days in June , then to 58 days in July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maunganui/Papamoa market was the first to slow down and the first to recover . " <p> Based on the QV House Price Index , property values increased steadily until mid to late 2007 . Since that time values have started to decline slightly and are now 6-7% below their peak . This represents a change in sales price from around $380,000 in early 2006 to a peak of around $480,000 in September 2007 . Average sales prices have fluctuated considerably over the last six months ( hence the weakness in that measure compared to the index ) but are now around early to mid $400,000 . <p> The number of sales of residential properties shows a similar pattern but slightly different timing . The number of sales rose steadily from around 300 sales per month in early 2006 to a peak of 470 sales in March 2007 . Since that time there has been a rapid decline in volumes to around 160 sales per month since May 2008 . <p> Donovan-Grammer says there is a real disinterest in property at present . " The buyers who are looking are taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are expecting a bargain . " Mortgagee sales have clearly increased with more expected in coming months . A lot of owners over-extended during the peak of the market . Now with the property and business downturn they find themselves in non-sustainable financial positions . <p> Section sales have slowed dramatically and developers are not buying big development blocks . <p> Investment marketWhile the investment market has dried up , improvements are expected with interest rates coming back . Given the global economic uncertainty , more New Zealanders are favouring property as a preferred investment . <p> The Waikato and greater Bay of Plenty farming community impacts on the Tauranga market . " They 're positive about their profits and the future , and they always buy a lot of property here , " says Martin . Rental marketUsing TradeMe as a rough measuring stick for the amount of property available , Quinovic general manager , Mark Tower , says that from February up to the present , the number of rental properties has almost tripled . The average of 285 rentals on TradeMe alone is split approximately 40% to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' first choice was to sell , the slowing market has seen them resort to plan B and rent their properties . " <p> Though winter is traditionally slow , there was more supply than demand . Tower says rents have pulled back a bit , but there are areas which have not been affected , such as the town centre and well-presented properties . <p> Tenants have more choice and as a result properties can stay vacant longer . And with more competition on the rental market , rents are forced down . Properties further away from amenities are slower to move . <p> But Tower believes things are picking up . Key rental areas include the Avenues , certain parts of Otumoetai , Matua and Cherrywood . Properties close to town and close to good schools ( Tauranga , Matua and Pillans Point Primary , and Papamoa 's Taitaia Primary ) are always popular . <p> During the fuel price rise crisis , longer travelling distances impacted on the rental market and the likes of Papamoa East took longer to move . Though now less of an issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weather the storm relatively well and generally rent for $350 and under . Nice four-bedroom homes have succumbed to pressure and rents have lowered . Tidy two-bedroom properties close to town go quickly . Rents range between $240-$290 depending on the condition and location of the property . Executive homes return between $400-$600 , depending on location and what the property has to offer . High-end tenants are few and far between . <p> Investors are cautious , due to the state of financial markets and uncertainty about interest rates . Tower says they 're holding off in the hope of better bargains down the line . Quinovic continues to sign up long-term tenants , with rentals being sought by families , the general work force and new arrivals . <p> Over recent weeks Rothbury Financial Services has seen a lift in mortgage inquiry with a lean towards the sub $450,000 market . Mortgage adviser , Brian Berry , says the company has seen definite purchases and has completed a large number of pre-approvals . " People are positioning themselves to buy when they feel the time is right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past months , there has been some activity and more opportunities for first home buyers in the $250,000-$350,000 range due to decreasing values . Rothbury has even seen some quite surprising prices , down to the low $200,000s , which may be attributed to some investors offloading property and , of course , more forced sales . <p> Berry believes the Tauranga market is no different to the rest of the country . " To date the main direct flow-on from the credit crisis overseas has been a dramatic fall in the sharemarket and a loss of positive sentiment . Some lenders are now just starting to tighten their lending criteria and , if all follow , that will have a negative effect on the property market as it will take some potential buyers out of the market and also make refinancing more difficult . " <p> In the short term ( next six months ) , Berry believes Tauranga is possibly getting quite close to the bottom of the cycle .

As an owner and manager of three rental properties , I 've always had difficulty getting my head around property managers charging structures . Every contract I have seen charges a base fee set at a percentage of the rental income , but then list " additional services " such as property inspections , tribunal attendances , tenant selection ( which at the moment tenants pay for in any event ) , arranging for tradesmen ( again clipping the ticket for their " services " ) etc . Exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services I would expect a property manager to undertake seem to attract additional fees .

We manage our own properties because it is very hard to find decent property managers - not only does it cost a lot but they are slower at responding to matters of maintenance and at reletting properties . We run a property business and want to provide the best service we can while still making a profit . That is easier by us doing it ourselves than using 9-5 property " managers " . Leaving it to property managers just means that you want to have property and enjoy the benefits but not really prepared to work for it . <p> On 24 November 2008 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with two rental properties in Auckland under management and one next door that we manage ourselves . Thus far we have had a good run with the management company - no missed rents yet , touch wood . There are some issues with communications - it would be good to get occasional updates on how each property is progressing in terms of tenancy and maintenance . The managed properties are new but it is frustrating to see rather large invoices coming in for seemingly minor jobs that could quickly and easily be fixed if one was on location . We are very happy with the service provided but if costs rise again , we may rethink our management strategy .

And at a fraction of the cost , all things considered -that 's it ! <p> I think the other important issue to be addressed as an aside regarding this , is the proposed amendment to the Residential Tenancies Act whereby tenants will not be able to be charged letting fees . Have all private residential landlord investors given this proposal some thought ? It has the potential to skew the market and give the power to letting agents particularly in a slow market , thereby forcing landlords to enlist their services if they wish to procure a tenant . Apart from the obvious paying a letting fee , this could result in other more serious consequences such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality of tenants , agreements , etc etc . <p> This has been my experience in the past .

We use mangers ( and have to train them ) simply to spread location of property to get into greater growth areas .

We had to take one agent to the REINZ as we found she was not honest about a lot of issues , especially inspections and tenant damage , and she cost us thousands in R&amp;M in the long run . Most managers seem to be of the opinion that landlords have a bottomless bank account , and they get things fixed by their usual contractors who charge megabucks for very little . How about $500 just to lino the loo floor - no MDF required , all prep done ! Some of these guys are really ignorant when it comes to maintenance and what is required .

We did a lot of due dillegence and research before appointing the property managers because primarily property management has nothing to do with standalone or licenced managers . It has everything to do with the person who is the property manager . If the Govt regulates by group or on a licence type basis it will not improve property management .

We have however came to realize that we are not in the school zone ( something that we were unfamiliar with ) for our kids school ( the plan to attend Mt Albert Grammer ) , so we informed the agent that we would have to move due to this fact , she said she would speak to owner etc and forwarded to us a sms saying that the owner agreed that we could move earlier should we ( both the agent and ourselves ) be able to find a tennant . <p> We advertized on trade-me the property and indicated that we would knock off $80 of the bond which was 3 x $360 weekly rental , we also indicated that no letting fees apply if WE find a credit approved tennant to take over our lease since we have already paid the letting fee on the current lease . <p> We found new tennants , we fetched the application form from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to agent for credit check etc , and were informed by the agent that everything is fine their application was approved , then the agent asked to meet the people and we said of course no problem and they contacted the new people . At their meeting the agent asked them for a letting fee , upon which we were contacted by the new prospective tennants . My husband then phoned and asked the agent why a letting fee is payable as the tennants are taking over our existing lease we did everything to find them and tried to make the deal attractive with paying the new tennants $8- on their bond and also because no letting fee would apply and we were willing to pay for the credit check at least so that the agents do not have any expenses either and further to that these tennants were willing to take a 12month lease . <p> Today the tennants called us back saying the agent phoned them again told them she is bringing in more people to view the property and if they take it they would be paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no letting fee to them so they would rather put their own people in the property . <p> We want to move out on the 01 Feb as we have to move into our new place on the 01 Feb , the tennants we found can only move in on the 7th Feb since their notice period only expires then , we were willing to pay the 1 weeks lease that the place would not be occupied . <p> What is the legal action to be taken here , can someone please advise what decision would be the correct one with regards to this and we can not get stuck with problems or additional costs as we have only budgeted on one weeks extra rent if we had to but we feel that the agent is now trying everything to not take the people we found as tennants just because they are not getting a letting fee yet we feel that they already received a letting fee on the current lease which will now just be taken over by the people we found so at least there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the owner now have a 12 month lease . <p> Can the agent insist on a letting fee even for not finding a tennant themselves ? Can they openly tell the tennants we found that they would rather put other people in there that they found to get a letting fee even though they have also already told these tennants that they are approved ? What grounds could they now have to tell them they can not move in ? <p> We need some advise and insight here please <p> On 14 March 2009 at 5:49 pm Rachel said : <p> I 'd just like to say from a tenants point of view , that private owners managing their own properties are far superior to agency property management . <p> We have just had some very bad experiences with a well-known agency who were supposed to be our ' landlords ' in place of the owner - however the person in charge was consistently rude to us , dragged her heals over fixing anything , refused face to face meetings with us to sort out issues , and also refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We have come out this the other side feeling extremely angry and helpless to do anything other than appeal to the tenancy tribunal .

Tim Murphy reports <p> In the week Judith Collins rose to the top of the National Party , the book that scarred her earlier career , Dirty Politics by Nicky Hager , has been thrust back into focus in a longstanding High Court defamation case involving former Whaleoil blogger Cameron Slater . <p> Collins ' chapter in the book is left untouched in this case but evidence by Slater and his co-defendant , PR man Carrick Graham , to the Chisholm inquiry , which examined her role in revelations about the head of the Serious Fraud Office , was aired at Friday 's hearing . <p> Another high-profile name did emerge at the hearing : Dr Ashley Bloomfield . Slater claimed to have a source inside a team that the current Director-General then ran at the Ministry of Health , and that source had provided him with information on audits into a grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Slater and Graham had to appear in the witness box at the High Court at Auckland to provide answers to questions from the lawyers for three health academics , Boyd Swinburn , Douglas Sellman and Shane Bradbrook , who are suing the pair for defamation . <p> They had been attacked on the Whaleoil blog for their research and calls for public health and policy action on alcohol , tobacco and sugar . <p> Justice Matthew Palmer ordered Slater and Graham in late 2018 to appear to give evidence in person , but Slater had had a stroke and was incapacitated , and then in rehab , through most of last year . He was adjudged bankrupt , with his Whaleoil blog site put into liquidation , early in 2019 . He and others from the old site now have work appearing on another site . <p> The three academics claim Graham wrote , and Slater published , attacks on them on the Whaleoil site as far back as 2009 , and that the Food and Grocery Council and its chief executive Katherine Rich engaged Graham 's company to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , for example , sugar , by the academics . The background to these Whaleoil blog posts was revealed in Dirty Politics , which was based on emails and other communications obtained by Hager , and published ahead of the 2014 general election . This case was then launched . <p> Slater and Graham were required at court after Justice Palmer ruled they had not sufficiently answered written questions from the academics ' lawyers as part of their claim for defamation , and had inadequately ' discovered ' or turned over documents relating to their activities against the trio . <p> Slater did not have a lawyer representing him but his former advocate Brian Henry was in the back of the courtroom , declining the possibility raised by Justice Palmer of assisting the court and Slater . Henry said he was suffering from shingles and " no longer appearing before this court " , adding he was there because it " was too good a show to miss " . <p> Henry said in his experience , Slater would be able to concentrate for up to an hour on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to no longer be with this court " . <p> Bearded and in a bush-coloured Swandri-style top , Slater swore on the Bible before facing questions from Davey Salmon , lawyer for Swinburn , Sellman and Bradbrook . <p> Salmon repeatedly asked if Graham had been paying Slater to publish blog posts against his clients . " No . He was not . You seem to think if that 's what you ask me again and again it will change my answer . I 've sworn an affidavit . It 's my opinions . No one can buy those opinions . " <p> Asked about payments detailed in documents Graham and Slater had turned over , totalling $93,840 " from Mr Graham and his company to you and your company " , Slater said they would have been for media services , public relations advice and social media expertise , not posts themselves . <p> He agreed Graham was the PR man providing such media services , but added : " He needs advice on that .

" <p> Asked again if Graham had " procured you to publish " those posts , he said : " No . " <p> Was he paid by Graham ? " I was paid for advice . " <p> " What advice ? " <p> " That 's between me and my client . " <p> Slater said he had been most effective talking to his network of people in media and elsewhere about issues .

Let 's make no mistake about it . These defamation proceedings are because Carrick and I challenged the views of your clients . <p> " In the case of Bradbrook , I had a source inside the Ministry of Health leaking to me directly from the team that was conducting audits into his work , and the double-dipping that was going on that was then subject to an inquiry then headed up by Ashley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service in providing leaking information about one of the most prolific troughers at that time .

" I do not know what I do not know . If documents are not there I do n't know why they 're not there . Did they go missing ? Did I delete them ? No idea . I do n't have them . They are not under my control . " <p> Carrick Graham also denied he paid for blog posts against the three academics . <p> Salmon pointed to one invoice Graham had issued which mentioned blog posts at $300 each . <p> Graham : " The client realised Mr Slater would not do it for free and showed no interest in doing it for free but at the same time he heard what went on and what happened and would do a post . " <p> To another document Graham had provided , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , Salmon asked if that corresponded to a line on an invoice for $900 .

It produces no spoil , which means that there is no debris to remove from the site . This is a significant factor in cost reduction as well as an enormous time saver . <p> Compared to other foundation systems , screw piling is also very quiet , only producing 85Db of noise , which is equivalent to using a handsaw or sitting in a busy restaurant . Since screw piling requires a minimal impact and produces very little vibration , there is no unhappy neighbours or councils to worry about .

In July , the Government released new guidelines aimed at dramatically increasing housing development in the country 's fastest growing cities -- including Hamilton . <p> Urban Development Minister Phil Twyford ? says poor quality planning has stopped cities growing up and out and has been a big driver behind the country 's housing crisis . <p> Christel Yardley/Stuff <p> Infill housing has helped regenerate some existing suburbs in Hamilton . <p> The National Policy Statement on Urban Development stops councils from imposing height limits of less than six-storeys in city centres and forces them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into effect in 2022 and while developers have welcomed the move , some Hamilton politicians are n't happy . <p> Taylor sees merit in encouraging high density housing in the central city but fears developments with no car parks will cause unrest in the outer suburbs . <p> " People will still drive cars , particularly for the next decade or so , and I think we 're dreaming if we think that magically all these people are going to somehow become bus riders or cycle riders overnight . " <p> City council staff will brief elected members on the implications of the national policy statement in August but stress the council has a range of tools to control how their communities grow . <p> Parking management policies and bylaws will become crucial in order to ensure suburbs are n't detrimentally impacted by the national policy statement , council city growth general manager Jen Baird ? says . <p> Christel Yardley/Stuff <p> New rules will force councils to accept developments with no car parks . <p> " The conversation about parking management is going to be very important in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these developments without car parks start happening , " Baird says . <p> In 2015 , the city council 's most recent district plan became operative and introduced new duplex provisions -- two attached units on a minimum of a 400 square metre section both with freehold titles -- enabling significant infill growth . <p> A popular option for potentially giving the city more control over infill development is beefing up the council 's Urban Design Advisory Panel . <p> The panel provides free professional and independent advice on proposed projects with a focus on good design . <p> Creating incentives to encourage developers to seek out the panel 's expertise is backed by chair and director of Chow:Hill Architects , Brian Squair , ? himself a panel member . <p> The current angst about infill housing echoes similar concerns in the 1970s when two-storey concrete block flats started appearing in established city neighbourhoods .

The proposal features two- and three-storey buildings and will be a 50/50 mix of public and privately owned housing . <p> In response to the proposal , more than 2700 residents signed a petition , organised by National Hamilton East MP David Bennett , ? calling for the development to be halted . <p> Christel Yardley/Stuff <p> Flagstaff resident Mark Browning at the proposed site of a 70-unit housing development . <p> Resident Mark Browning ? signed Bennett 's petition and , along with other residents , formed the Flagstaff Residents Incorporated Society . <p> The group recently spoke in Parliament , relaying the community 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the negative impact it might have on local amenities and traffic . <p> " My view of the world is very clear . We are ratepayers , we are taxpayers , so we should have the opportunity to put our views forward and for that view to be considered significant within the process because at the moment it almost feels like a box ticking situation . " <p> Residents pushing back against infill development should be expected when builds do n't improve those communities , Waikato University environmental planning professor Iain White ? warns . <p> The pursuit by city leaders of creating greater density of housing across the city makes sense in some areas . The next stage , however , is to plan infill more strategically and selectively as part of a city plan linked to transport , amenities and facilities . <p> " We 've only just turned to infill as a strategy and that means we tend to just infill around the city generally , " White says . <p> " We 've got all the low hanging fruit , and a lot of the easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for our next strategy .

@@31993236 <h> Corporations vs communities in local alcohol policy <p> Have our new liquor laws achieved their objective to improve community input into local alcohol licensing decisions ? Dr Nicki Jackson on the David and Goliath battle playing out between councils that want to uphold community wishes and the alcohol industry that seeks to maintain profits . <p> The immense frustration that communities are expressing is palpable . New Zealand 's new liquor laws were meant to swing the pendulum back towards greater community control of alcohol availability , but this has been far from reality for many communities that continue to shoulder the burden of alcohol harm seven days a week . <p> This burden stems from the miserable failure of the 1990s experiment to liberalise alcohol regulation so that a mythical European-style moderate drinking culture could be created in Aotearoa New Zealand . This bourgeois fantasy led to alcohol availability increasing to such an extent that the number of on-licences ( bars , pubs , night clubs , licensed restaurants and caf ? s ) trebled in our country and the number of off-licences ( bottle stores , supermarkets , grocery stores ) doubled . <p> Much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated in our most deprived communities , leading to price wars , longer trading hours and inequities in alcohol harm . The result was a huge burden being placed on our most vulnerable communities to fight relentlessly to address alcohol outlet proliferation in their neighbourhood , often with little support . <p> This situation was to be remedied in the overhaul of our liquor legislation in 2012 . The Alcohol Reform Bill was introduced with the objective to " improve community input into local alcohol licensing decisions " . To reduce the burden that communities faced fighting each licence application , local alcohol decision-making was devolved to local government , with the new laws enabling each council to develop and adopt their own Local Alcohol Policy . <p> This new provision in our liquor laws appeared promising . Local Alcohol Policies could control 1 ) the number of licensed premises permitted across the district or in suburbs vulnerable to high levels of harm , 2 ) the location of new outlets ( whether they could be granted close to schools , etc. ) , and 3 ) the opening and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In essence , these policies offered significant potential to right the wrongs of the past , while enabling councils to utilise evidence-based measures to address local concerns . <p> However , the reality has been a long , tortuous and uneven legal battle . In one corner has been the councils ( and at times police and health authorities ) seeking to uphold community wishes for greater control on alcohol availability . In the other corner has been the appellants with vested interests , especially the supermarket duopoly ( the fourth and fifth biggest companies in New Zealand , by revenue ) and bottle stores . <p> While some councils have opted to use ratepayer dollars to challenge the appellants in court , the majority have opted to seek a compromise with the alcohol industry out of the public eye . Of significant concern , some large councils ( for example , Christchurch and Hamilton ) have opted to walk away from the entire process after spending considerable funds to fight for their policy . Auckland Council 's policy is yet to be adopted , having now reached the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for public consultation . <p> Should we be surprised ? Recent history would suggest not . Any evidence-based measure that reduces industry profits is heavily challenged . The Scottish Government spent five years fighting the Scotch Whisky Association all the way to the UK Supreme Court , so that they could take strong action on cheap alcohol ( through minimum unit pricing ) . After spending more than 1000 days in debate , Ireland recently adopted new laws to address the key drivers of alcohol consumption , namely pricing , advertising and marketing . The most controversial element of the new laws appeared to be the alcohol and cancer warning labels to be placed on all alcohol products . Irish media reported that such intense industry lobbying on the new laws had not been seen since the days of banning smoking in public places . <p> Even the Yukon Territorial Government in Canada , with a population of 36,000 , has not been immune to legal challenges . Having state-owned bottle stores , they opted to undertake a high-quality trial to examine the effectiveness of placing alcohol and cancer warning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the trial , media reported that the cancer warning label trial had been discontinued , citing alleged threats of litigation by alcohol companies . <p> So what does this mean for our communities who are continuing to struggle without a strong local alcohol policy in place ? To genuinely swing the pendulum back to greater community control , the law needs to change . Local councils need to have the powers to uphold community wishes without requiring huge resources to fight the commercial interests . Only by repealing the appeals provision in the Sale and Supply of Alcohol Act 2012 can people be placed ahead of profits . <p> Dr Jackson is executive director of a Ministry of Health funded NGO to reduce alcohol harm , called Alcohol Healthwatch .

Examples are cleaning , airline catering and airport baggage safety officers . <p> Instead of being employed by the business for which they are working , workers are contracted to that company through labour hire and temping firms . The aim is to cut costs for businesses . Firms do not have to provide full-time or a regular number of work hours . Nor do they need to pay holiday pay , sick pay or superannuation contributions . Workers might be required to pay for their own equipment and safety boots , as well as ACC levies . And there is no obligation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior . <p> However , for the workers , this means low wages , no job security and insecure hours of work -- and hence income -- from week to week . <p> Labour hire firms receive " sign on " bonuses of several thousand dollars from the business . The labour hire firm also charges the business an hourly rate for each worker which is significantly higher than the rates paid to workers -- perhaps $3 above the minimum wage . <p> As a result , in New Zealand , people now work alongside each other doing exactly the same tasks , but under vastly different conditions . Employees have regular hours and ongoing work , while the labour hire workers have no security and are generally paid several dollars an hour less than their colleagues . <p> Many labour hire workers are migrants , who have little bargaining power and often are not aware of New Zealand employment law . <p> A legal challenge to labour hire work began in the Employment Court at Auckland on 14 August 2017 . <p> The case is brought by E Tu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is LSG Sky Chefs New Zealand Ltd , which is owned by German airline Lufthansa and runs airline catering kitchens in Queenstown , Christchurch , Wellington and Auckland . <p> Two labour hire firms , Solutions Personnel Ltd and Blue Collar Ltd , are named as third parties in the case . <p> Approximately 200 temporary workers are contracted to LSG Sky Chefs through the third parties . Many are paid only the minimum wage and do not have security of employment . <p> The workers are seeking a declaration under section 6(5) of the Employment Relations Act 2000 that they are in fact employees of LSG Sky Chefs . They claim that , although they signed a contract with Solutions Personnel which was expressed to be a contract for services , they were in fact employed by LSG Sky Chefs . <p> The hearing is expected to finish on August 18 . <p> Many parents work two or three jobs to try and support their families but the minimum wage of $15.75 an hour is simply not enough to live on .

In 2012 , there were estimated to be 36 million temporary workers worldwide , with 11.5 million of them employed daily as agency workers . The United States had 11.5 million agency workers , while Europe had 8.2 million and Brazil 7.1 million . <p> The European Union in 2008 issued Directive 2008/104/EC on temporary agency work . This was designed to provide protection to agency workers : it states that the basic work and employment conditions of agency workers should be at least those of employees . <p> However , the way in which courts in different European Union nations have interpreted the directive has largely undermined its effectiveness . Instead of focusing on its purpose , courts have concentrated on the word " temporary " and held that the directive applies only to short-term work . <p> One example of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which aimed to provide rights to agency cleaners who had worked for a firm for between six and 25 years without ever obtaining the security of permanent employment . <p> The court held that regulations made under the European Union directive applied only to workers placed for a fixed period with a firm . If they were there indefinitely , they did not come within the ambit of the law . <p> One lawyer described the decision as driving a " coach and horses " through the protection intended to be given to agency workers . <p> In Canada 's Ontario , there was a 33 percent increase in temporary workers in the decade to 2014 . That growth was double the rise in the number of permanent employees in that time and the wages of the temporary workers were significantly lower .

@@31993238 <h> How Phil Twyford lost housing and why KiwiBuild failed <p> Phil Twyford is being blamed for the failure of KiwiBuild and just lost the housing portfolio . Bernard Hickey argues he was pinned down by an infrastructure funding Catch 22 and then drowned by the Government 's 20 percent debt anchor , both of which Twyford knew he could not fix quickly enough . <p> The simple view in any reshuffle of ministers or executives because of a policy or business failure is to blame the individual deemed responsible . And Twyford invited the judgment with his bold claims ahead of the election and his aggressive campaigning against National on housing . KiwiBuild was his baby , clearly , and it failed to deliver the promised 1000 houses this year . It has barely coughed before starting along its path to 100,000 . <p> But he never really had a chance , even if he did n't know it or believe it . Events and policies that were arguably out of his control before and since the election have guaranteed that . <p> Planning and building 100,000 homes over a decade in our fastest growing cities requires much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build houses . It requires massive capital investment in transport , water , earthworks and other infrastructure , most of which require co-investment from private and council investors if the central Government is not going to step up and use its balance sheet to borrow the money to invest in the pipes and roads and railways and shopping centres and parks and industrial buildings . <p> And remember , neither the National or Labour-led governments of the last 35 years have seen it as their role to pay for that underlying infrastructure . Their instincts have been to get others to pay for it , unlike during the golden eras of the 1930s , 40s , 50s , 60s and early 1970s when governments of both colours used the national balance sheet to build and subsidise that infrastructure through the Ministry of Works , State Advances Corp and various Group Building schemes and child benefit capitalisation policies . Starting with Labour 's Michael Joseph Savage and ending with Labour 's David Lange and Roger Douglas , the Government built state houses , made low interest rate loans , paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get a deposit and buy a house for less than three times their income . KiwiBuild buyers had to save over $100,000 or one times their income and then borrow another five times their income . <p> ' It 's not our job ' <p> After the mid 1980s , the Government saw the private sector as the provider of housing and saw any infrastructure as a cost that needed to be borne by those building the new houses and local Government , not the wider taxpaying public . Even now , that thinking is infused through Treasury and into the minds of the current Labour leadership , going from Ardern through Finance Minister Grant Robertson to Twyford . <p> That 's reflected in their decision to re-sign up to the 20 percent net debt target before the 2017 election . The 20 percent number was born in the bruised aftermath of the New Zealand economy 's near-bankruptcy experience of the late 1980s and early 1990s when bond vigilantes were a real thing to be feared . The 20 percent number coagulated into policy under Labour 's last Finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say mindlessly ) since then by both Labour and National . It has anchored fiscal policy for 30 years and continues to do so . <p> But it is now horribly out of date <p> The bond vigilantes have been euthanised by a decade of zero percent interest rates and US$15 trillion of quantitative easing or money printing by central banks in the Northern Hemisphere to buy government bonds . Fund managers all over the world are looking for safe government debt with some sort of yield more than 0.0 percent . The New Zealand Government bond yield fell to a record low of 1.5 percent last week . <p> Labour fears being accused of being profligate and of raising the net debt of an already indebted nation , but the Government 's net debt is at the bottom of the OECD and the nation 's net debt has fallen 20-30 percentage points of GDP in the last decade . Robertson and Ardern argue we are so vulnerable in the event of another GFC or an earthquake that we have to keep our powder dry . But they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Helen Clark or Michael Cullen from 1999 to 2008 , when New Zealand 's economy and balance sheets were both actually and relatively vulnerable . <p> They fear an unknown and yet-to-exist crisis in the future when a very present and known crisis exists right now and is right in front of their noses : a massive shortage of affordable and healthy housing that has consigned 250,000 kids to such poverty that 40,000 of them get so sick each year with respiratory and skin conditions they end up in hospital . Their parents are mired in working or non-working poverty that is impossible to break out of without affordable and healthy housing . Our growth cities need re-engineering to improve affordability and reduce carbon emissions . That means creating medium density housing corridors along train lines much closer to city centres that produce hundreds of thousands of new homes . <p> Urban Development Authorites have to work in tandem with city and transport planners to buy up the land along those corridors and fund the building of the infrastructure and housing to make them work . <p> Twyford and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the debt anchor is not just holding them back . It just dragged its first cabinet minister under the waves and drowned him . <p> A Catch 22 pinned him under the debt anchor <p> The importance of that debt anchor and the Government 's refusal to abandon it becomes clear when you consider the way KiwiBuild and any large scale house building is completely dependent on a broken system for infrastructure funding . <p> Put simply , KiwiBuild was doomed from the start unless the Government solved the fundamental problem of finding someone to invest in all that underlying infrastructure . Currently , the Government is dependent on the Auckland Council and the other growth councils ( Hamilton , Tauranga , Wellington , Christchurch and Queenstown ) using their balance sheets to solve the problem . <p> Those mayors and councillors are in turn captured by property-owning ratepayers in their leafier suburbs . These older suburbanites are the only ones who vote in council elections and they do n't want all these extra ( young and brown ) people living anywhere near them , and they certainly do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for suburbs they 'll never visit , let alone live in . <p> ' We wo n't pay for their new suburb ' - Essentially , central Government controls the migration settings and benefits from the population growth through higher GST and income taxes without having to pay for at least half the infrastructure cost of that population growth . Councils , and more importantly their voters , did not vote for high net migration or the infrastructure costs and they do n't have a revenue tool to fund the extra debt . <p> So councils are restrained by the politics around their balance sheets , and their voters are exercising a not-so-silent protest against high net migration , which they never agreed to . There are also two technical and revenue issues with using council debt to solve the problem . <p> ' We need a share of GST ' <p> The only revenue tool councils have to pay the interest on debt is rates on property . The lag between investing and getting rates from new residents and businesses is long and uncertain . Essentially , the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why they revolt . The Council needs a new revenue stream to fund the extra debt , and it has to be more closely connected to population growth . The obvious tools are a share of GST revenues and income taxes , which are currently set and collected and spent by the central Government in Wellington , which of course does n't want to give up that power and does n't trust councils to spend it carefully . <p> The technical problem is the Auckland Council is almost at its debt-to-revenue limit ratio of 270 percent , which is the level specified by Standard and Poor 's for Auckland to keep its AA credit rating . This is important because taking on more debt would mean Auckland 's credit rating would be downgraded , which would increase the interest costs on existing debt and force up rates . But it would also breach the rules set by the Local Government Funding Agency about Auckland 's credit rating not falling more than one notch below the Government 's AA+ rating . That 's important because Auckland 's rating essentially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LGFA . It means there is enormous political pressure locally and financial pressure from other councils ( and the LGFA ) for Auckland not to borrow much more . Councils beyond the Bombays and north of Orewa would scream blue murder if their interest bills went up because the Auckland Council decided to solve a funding problem the central Government wo n't solve . <p> Catch 22 = slow infrastructure spending <p> The end result is councils use the Resource Management Act , the Environment Court , their planning processes , Metropolitan Urban Limits and a myriad of building consent policies to slow that infrastructure spending down to a crawl . <p> The irony is all the restrictions on land use and infrastructure development deliver a juicy dividend for those same property-owning voters in the leafier suburbs . Land prices skyrocket in tandem with migration that is not built for , giving them astonishing tax-free capital gains thanks to leverage and a tripling of land prices in the last two decades . What 's not to love ? Unless you 're a renter or aspiring first home buyer ... <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get started , but this Catch 22 and the debt anchor are not news to Twyford . He explained it perfectly in this now widely-cited speech on March 22 to a NZ Initiative members ' retreat . It is well worth a read , if you have n't already . <p> " Our infrastructure funding and financing system is broken , " Twyford said . <p> " Some of our high growth councils which provide most bulk infrastructure have tapped out their balance sheets . <p> And to a large extent local government politicians have been unable to convince their ratepayers to invest in growth , leaving a burgeoning infrastructure deficit for the next generation , " he said . <p> " The unwillingness or inability to invest in the infrastructure to support development stops cities growing . When a city can not grow in response to demand , a pressure cooker effect is created , which is what has given Auckland some of the most expensive urban land and housing in the world relative to local incomes . " <p> ' I have a cunning plan ' <p> Twyford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to create Special Purpose Vehicles independent of the Government and the Council that could borrow money in their own rights to fund the infrastructure project by project . The model is the Municipal Utility District ( MUD ) bodies used in the United States to fund new suburbs and cities . They raise debt from bond markets , get their own credit ratings , and service the debt with targeted rates or fees on residents . <p> " The intention is that we create a system where the viability of the project is the determinant of whether to proceed with a particular infrastructure project , and whether private capital can be accessed and utilised , " Twyford said . <p> " We want to ensure that the costs of growth are properly allocated . So they fall on the beneficiaries of development . " <p> Ie the Government and the Councils do n't want to borrow to invest . They do n't want to spread the cost of new development across existing ratepayers and taxpayers . They want the private sector to do it . But the private sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the certainty of income ( ie they do n't have the power to tax or rate ) to make the big calls involved with the massive urban redevelopment needed . <p> Hence , KiwiBuild is not getting going : Twyford knew about the infrastructure financing Catch 22 and the debt anchor , but still signed up for the job and committed to the target . His problem is that he thought he could get the new infrastructure funding system up and running faster . Instead his infrastructure bond and SPV ideas are still in the legislative and testing processes . They are years away from happening . <p> The political and news cycles run on much shorter time horizons than these sorts of legislative and financial reforms . <p> Twyford ran out of time , and it could be argued he was always going to run out of time . <p> The only way to short circuit the painfully slow business of building a new financing system was to use the Government 's balance sheet and borrow to give certainty of funding for all these new Urban Development Authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the global bond markets would give the Government in an instant . Remember , New Zealand 's interest returns of 1.5 percent for 10 year bonds are much better than the negative 0.33 percent on German Government 10 year bonds ( ie fund managers pay Angela Merkel to look after their money ) . <p> Limited ambition <p> KiwiBuild is now expected to focus on building houses to rent out and helping private developers ' build to rent ' on Government land , rather than building over-priced houses for first home buyers who ca n't afford them , or are worried they are buying at the peak off a Treasury that has yet to revalue the value of Government land lower . <p> It will limit its ambitions and focus the Government house-building activity on Housing New Zealand . The 100,000 dream is over , and with it the hopes of a supply-led push to make housing more affordable . <p> It could all have been so different if the Government had chosen to solve the Catch 22 by ditching the debt anchor . And Phil Twyford would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he drowned . <p> How many more cabinet ministers will get pulled under before Jacinda Ardern and Grant Robertson choose to ditch the debt target orthodoxy that both sides of politics have clung to since the dark days of late 1980s ? <p> True conservatives - So far , their conservatism on this issue and their fear of debt is greater than their dreams of fixing New Zealand 's housing affordability , child poverty and climate change problems . <p> The public have yet to call them out on it . Largely because it suits the property owning public not to . Renters who vote and their non-voting children have yet to understand or act . Ardern and Robertson will hope that does not change . <p> Can you help our journalists uncover the facts ? <p> Newsroom is committed to giving our journalists the time they need to uncover , investigate , and fact-check tough stories .

@@31993239 <h> MUST READ : The Third Referendum <p> JACINDA ARDERN 'S STRATEGY for this election is now clear . She will be inviting New Zealanders to vote in three referendums . The referendum on Cannabis . The referendum on Euthanasia . And the referendum on her government 's handling of the Covid-19 Pandemic . Otherwise known as the General Election , this third referendum will be presented as an opportunity to endorse the course Jacinda has set for the country . While a reasonable amount of doubt surrounds the outcome of the first and second referendums , the outcome of the third is regarded as a " dead cert " by most voters . " Captain Jacinda " and her Labour crew will be urged to " stay the course " and sail the good ship New Zealand safely home . <p> Many on the Left , caught up in the excitement of a prospective electoral victory so emphatic that Labour may be in a position to govern alone , are imploring the party to seize the time and enact the most comprehensive reform of New Zealand institutions since 1984 . All the things the Left was hoping for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Winston Peters ; will become possible in a House of Representatives dominated by Labour and the Greens . <p> Really ? How much is the New Zealand Left ( as it used to be understood ) willing to bet ? Which of those institutions that , historically , have been thought of as " progressive " ( left-wing political parties , the trade unions , universities , the teaching profession , tertiary student bodies and the arts community ) will step up to insist that Jacinda and her ministry enact a genuinely transformative programme ? Let 's examine each of these collectivities in turn . <p> It is a sad -- but entirely fair -- question : Do any left-wing parties still exist in New Zealand ? Over the course of the past thirty years , the number of political organisations dedicated to the full emancipation of working people and their families and committed to an unequivocally internationalist and anti-imperialist foreign policy , has shrunk uncomfortably close to zero . <p> In the 1990 general election , two such parties -- the NewLabour Party and the Greens -- between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popular vote ( 219,086 votes ) . Three years later , those same two parties , now united in the Alliance , won 18.21 percent support ( 350,063 votes ) and two parliamentary seats . ( A remarkable feat under the then prevailing First-Past-the-Post electoral system ! ) <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> By 1990 , Labour , which had once been included among the parties of the New Zealand Left , could no longer be accounted such . Following the policy " revolution " unleashed by David Lange and Roger Douglas , the party had shrunk very rapidly to the point where it could no longer be considered a mass party . The split which gave rise to NewLabour in 1989 left it smaller still . <p> Perhaps the best that can be said of Labour in the years following 1984 is that it remained relatively progressive on social issues . On the all-important issues of working-class emancipation , redistributive economic justice and anti-imperialism , however , it had shifted decisively to the right -- and remains there . <p> The secret of Labour 's survival as a viable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealanders still think of it as " left-wing " , is due to it being the party people vote for to keep the much more recognisably right-wing National Party out of government . It is this core electoral function which gives it so much political gravity . Inevitably , all its smaller rivals become either orbiting moons ( the Greens ) or are spun off into the inter-stellar darkness ( New Labour ) . <p> In other words , Labour , like National , is defined almost entirely by what it is not . The moment either party abandons this essentially negative function -- as Labour did between 1972 and 1975 , and National did between 1990 and 1993 -- they are instantly perceived as threats . Those deemed responsible for turning their parties " rogue " are either removed or tamed . New Zealand democracy , in its essence , is about the voting public enforcing political restraint . Politics as a process of driving radical economic and social change is a once-in-a-lifetime experience . <p> All those other " progressive " institutions -- unions , universities , students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power from the radical changes ushered in by the first and second Labour governments . For fifty years these bastions of progressivism acted as the guarantors of the social-democratic reforms that gave rise to the Welfare State . It was precisely because they served as social-democracy 's bodyguards that the instigators of the neoliberal counter-revolution of the 1980s and 90s , like so many Mafia hit-men , made it their business to take them out of the picture . <p> What are the unions of today ? Fighters for the rights and living-standards of their members ? Hardly ! Today 's union is a structure filled with well-remunerated officials holding convivial negotiations with the bosses whilst perched on the backs of workers who have never been so carelessly exploited -- nor so indifferently defended . <p> And the universities ? Do they still act as havens for inquiring minds ? Are they the fiercely independent guardians and disseminators of their civilisation 's canonical truths ? Not really . Today 's university is a white-anted corporate ruin which is only prevented for collapsing into post-modern sawdust by all the neoliberal termites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And the Artists ? What have they become ? Idiots telling tales only the rich can afford to listen to , and from which the state 's cultural commissars have extracted every last drop of power and pity . In the immortal words of the Kiwi poet A. R. D. Fairburn : " The mushroom grows in the open ground ; the toadstool under a tree . " <p> What else can Jacinda do in a political environment so bereft of imagination and courage but seek a continuance ? If she trades upon the extraordinary personal qualities that she has , miraculously , carried with her into the office of Prime Minister , then I , for one , will offer no criticism . In the absence of the great collectivities upon which the historic Left relied to enrich the poor and make the weak strong , progressive New Zealanders are left with an intelligent , kind , brave , and very competent young woman . <p> To the question posed in the Third Referendum : Should Jacinda stay at the helm of our ship of state -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk and shouting : " Oh captain , my captain , yes , stay !

It seemed to me that you were constantly ascribing anti-neoliberal beliefs and intentions on her that she had never given any reason to assume she held . And with her strong support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neoliberal quite the reverse . And so from a purely fiscal management perspective have they proceeded . However we have seen something of what jacinda is made of . And the self confidence she must have gained from the internationally universal accolades she is constantly given will have made her a different creature from 2017 and " Let 's do this " . I think as I thought back then that she probably , like most people , had never considered any alternative to the way banking and money works and how it totally controls what a government under a neoliberal regime can do for it 's country and it 's people . It just is . But now that it is collapsing all around the world , and extraordinary measure are being taken everywhere to prop it up ; here too now , it is focusing everyone 's attention just as it did in the 30 's the last time it all fell to pieces . Now I think that jacinda has demonstrated the intelligence , the courage , the confidence and the diligence to do whatever has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her making the transformative moves to reverse the neoliberal settlement and rescue the economy than any leader we have had since Muldoon . I guess in a way Douglas showed that courage but it was driven by stupidity rather than intelligence . I have a problem though with the assertion that Winston has prevented this government from being the transformative government that it would otherwise have been . It has seemed to me that it has been Grant Robertson 's instinct for austerity that has applied the breaks . Could you pleas elaborate for me what transformative action Winston has prevented and how ? cheers D J S <p> David you mention of the banking system is very relevant . douglarse just followed the edicts of the Mont Perelin Society of which the traitorous swine was a member . Richardson joined after him No courage just cheek and lucrative personal rewards <p> But as in the 1930s the key to managing a slumping economy is to manage the banks by the state owning the right to print money straight into the government coffers for judicious programs building a state controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piggy had some things right to do with self sufficiency but his implementation was wide of the mark . <p> I agree with Chris on this . Celebrating a labour victory will be short lived by all from the left but even more so by the socialists who were promised and believe meaningful environmental and social change will come . If the economic upheaval that the virus has brought had n't happened I believe the Labour Coalition had a chance , but in my opinion the next Government no matter who it involves will be hamstrung by debt , incompetence , and the same neoliberal tendencies that have prevailed for decades . The way the world is disintegrating socially and economically , means we will eventually follow and I see the possibility of Coalition of all the parties in a year or two . I think we will need all the brain power and imagination this country can muster and labour has n't got enough of that on it 's own . A bit depressing but that 's the way I see it . <p> Bleak but true . Labour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the money and people exchanged between . Even the unions now lobby for foreign workers over NZs own working poor . Kiwi workers have no champion here . <p> Post modernist philosophy , and 36 years of neo liberal hegemony can take a toll on even the most resilient columnist it seems ! <p> Mass political party membership shrunk along with the drop in public participation in many other areas , following the wide penetration of neo liberal individualist pyschology . The small left parties of a marxist leaning , also no longer publish papers , or run their tiny demos -- those that remain seem now to be Facebook groups ! <p> But there are pockets of activists all over Aotearoa/NZ nonetheless . Climate strikers , Iwi activists , Issue based ' maddies ' , riled up unionists , and any number of minor public intellectuals revelling in online self publishing , there are enough of us to still make an impact . The pressure to change how this country is operated under Covid will shake Jacinda and Grant from their complacency -- " Covid Capitalism " is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support for " Covid Socialism " ? <p> " New Zealand democracy , in its essence , is about the voting public enforcing political restraint . " And is n't this the real problem here ? Every Govt. is too scared to upset the oldies , the boomers , the propertied class etc.etc . IMHO nothing will change until this lot is well and truly either gone or severely outnumbered on voting day . If Bomber is right , this may happen 2023 , so I wo n't be expecting change before then . <p> Thanks @ CT . Beautifully written . To prove my personal hopes and suspicions of Adern 's Labour I 'm compelled to vote for Labour just to see if nothing else . I 've been a professional photographer for more than twenty years in the film business as a locations scout and I love to write a sentence or two and with those two skills at hand , I can spot things amiss and askew a mile away . It 's a bit like smelling something iffy in the house . Has the cat shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I ca n't rest until I heave the sofa out for a look . Here ' what I think and I 'll try to be mercifully brief . Whether Labour availed itself to be infested by neoliberals or whether they confederated themselves within Labour by stealth will only be known when the neoliberals themselves admit to what they did , or did n't , do . Lets assume the cat shit stink of neoliberalism , or roger douglas 's own interpretation of neoliberalism at least , was supplanted within Labour by stealth . ( Remember ? Lange quit as prime minister because of roger douglas . ) So . roger 's in there rogering away at our assets , state owned systems and social welfare etc all under the camouflaging banner of Labour . And this is where it gets fruity . What now ? What now for those who 've most profited from such treachery against their own people , against their own country simply to create immense private wealth ? ( graham heart for example . Bought OUR government printing office at below capital value and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite a few ! ) They 've been sprung , there 's no doubt about that . Their nasty names and dirty deeds are all over the place . So how to escape with the loot ? Easy . Reanimate old Labour and stand in the shadows as money , once again floods in from our primary industries to rebuild AO/NZ to a level it once was and while we flourish , renewed and invigorated , all is forgotten ( hopefully , aye boys ? within time and space . It 's my opinion they 'll use Labour 's new popularity to effectively launder themselves into blissful obscurity . With our money . And after more than thirty six years of tyranny at their pink little sociopathic hands . They 're planning an escape . That 's why they tanked national and are re inflating Labour . I smell cat shit behind the sofa , I read bullshit in our msm and I see a visible askew politic which was the people 's Left ... and yet Right ? And yet kind , and yet cruel and yet transparent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lets do this " mantra must barely be able to believe their good luck to have a mass murder and a pandemic disease to help the woman with the hair and the gleaming smile start up the get away car for the neoliberal scum who 've fucked us over . Or ? I could be completely wrong . And this would n't be the first time I 'd to hope to God I am . Here 's what will prove to me that Labour is genuine . When Labour becomes our government free of hangers on then opens up public inquiries in to whether private interests put pressure on our politics spanning the years between 1920 and 2020 . Or not . <p> countryboy You are fresh air dispelling the doggiedo smell ! Keep it up . Lively reading and ideas that bubble up like Roturua 's Geysers . We definitely have to think about what 's going on behind the eyes or sunglasses of the busy hornets -- which are nasty pests and death-dealing to the unfortunate stirrers of their nests . We wo n't help ourselves by inducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But how to get our hold on the reins , and guide the direction in the best way and to the best end possible ? If left to the ' masses ' we will get in a pickle because they have n't even looked at maps yet , do n't understand to not frighten the horses , and have no practical idea of where to go , and what to do when we get there . They would leave that for some loudmouth to shout to the people what the quiet minority in the background are brewing up to suit themselves and present as a fait accompli . And many would welcome that , they would n't like to have to stir their minds , spend their time to think up practical ideas , and then amend them as faults are noticed ; too much trouble and hard brain work . And it does take time and requires examining long-held certainties for truth and value , and looking to the heart of the matter of needs , allowing for wants , and a template of a good life to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bureaucracy is n't an effective tool for solving social problems -- but it 's a very effective tool for maximizing the job prospects of university graduates and diverting most of society 's wealth into the hands of an administrative class . I suggest that this was the real point of the whole operation .

Morrison 's son is now chair . he was also chair of Kiwibank when kiwibank was sold to the NZ superfund which is managed by guess who ? sold it to himself he did . <p> Ever wonder why the level of poverty has steadily risen since the mid-1970 ? <p> Written for the American scene but largely applying here : <p> ' ...

In a nation where you 're literally incapable of influencing government policy and behavior unless you have a certain amount of wealth at your disposal , depriving the populace of their ability to pool their money toward electing a government which combats income and wealth inequality .

@@31998231 <h> Oranga Tamariki , the Waitangi Tribunal and the importance of stories <p> The Waitangi Tribunal inquiry into Oranga Tamariki kicked off in Wellington last week , while at the same time the agency released new data showing that perhaps it is doing better for Maori than many perceive . But do the numbers tell the full story ? <p> The first two days of the Waitangi Tribunal urgent inquiry into Oranga Tamariki took place last week . The contextual hearings now under way at the tribunal represent the latest milestone in the ongoing inquiries into Oranga Tamariki , following widespread protest from Maori in 2019 . Over the next few months , the tribunal will consider whether the actions of Oranga Tamariki constitute a breach of Te Tiriti o Waitangi . <p> Witnesses gave evidence about the actions of Oranga Tamariki in both its present and past forms . Children 's commissioner Andrew Becroft spoke about the discriminatory treatment of Maori mothers highlighted by his organisation 's recent review of Oranga Tamariki . Tania Williams Blyth , a family lawyer and researcher widely respected throughout Maoridom , spoke to the enormous challenges faced by whanau Maori who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Kahurangi Iritana Kawhiwhirangi spoke of the significant power imbalance that exists between Maori and the state . For those present at the hearings , the mood was heavy . <p> Just as the hearings were getting under way , Oranga Tamariki publicly released two reports discussing the disproportionate number of Maori in contact with the agency . The first report found that while tamariki Maori are indeed over-represented , the disproportionality reduces when other factors are accounted for ( the report labels these " other socioeconomic and parent/child characteristics " ) . The second report found that while the overall numbers of tamariki Maori in state care remain high , the number of entries into care over the past 12 months has decreased . Both of these findings seem positive at first glance , but do the numbers provided by Oranga Tamariki tell the full story ? <p> The statistics regarding entries into care were questioned by Len Cook , former government chief statistician , in his evidence to the tribunal . Cook stated that while the average rate of Maori children coming into care halved between 2001 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increased by two and half times during that period . In other words , children may be coming in to care less frequently , but they are staying in care longer . Cook questioned the robustness of the data provided by Oranga Tamariki . He also stated that the release of such data would not achieve the underlying purpose of public accountability while broader questions about the perceived legitimacy of the agency went unanswered . <p> But even if the numbers provided by Oranga Tamariki painted an accurate picture , are they all that matters ? If we ignore Len Cook 's criticism for a moment and take the numbers at face value , would we be satisfied ? Or do we need to understand the individual stories of people in contact with the system to truly understand what is happening ? <p> Some of the stories shared by whanau in contact with Oranga Tamariki since the Hawke 's Bay case was publicised last year are horrific . They include one mother having her child removed just moments after giving birth and another mother being pressured into having an abortion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the child would put her at risk of having her other children removed . Those stories are from just one of the four reviews of Oranga Tamariki conducted over the past year , and they were echoed frequently throughout the tribunal hearing last week . While the numbers are undoubtedly important , those stories seem to me to be what matters most . It does n't matter how you count people if you treat them like they do n't count . <p> What about the statement by Oranga Tamariki that the overrepresentation of tamariki Maori can be explained by other factors ? All that really tells us is that the children in contact with the child protection system are already facing other major challenges . The " other characteristics " highlighted in the report mentioned earlier include parental income , socioeconomic decile , parental involvement with the justice system , school disengagement and mental health provider contact . As a nation , are we satisfied with a child protection system that inflicts further harm on Maori children who are disproportionately likely to be poor , disproportionately likely to be struggling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges ? As one of the claimants in the hearing last week put it , societal disadvantage compounds . Is that compounding disadvantage really an excuse for Oranga Tamariki , or should it be a source of shame ? <p> At the risk of stating the obvious , there is an institution responsible for addressing those other problems . It 's called the government , and Oranga Tamariki is a part of it , not separate from it . Throughout the hearing last week , multiple witnesses stated that the whanau most likely to impacted by the failings of Oranga Tamariki are those who have been failed by multiple government departments over multiple generations . The fact that the most marginalised New Zealanders are the ones most consistently failed by the state can no longer be accepted as an excuse . What will Oranga Tamariki have to say about that ?

@@31998232 <h> Review : In Sex and Vanity , Kevin Kwan writes wealth like a fantasy novel <p> The Crazy Rich Asians author creates froth that may in fact be genius , says Sam Brooks . <p> Kevin Kwan 's first novel Crazy Rich Asians had the kind of success every populist author dreams of . It became a beloved bestseller , which turned into a slightly less beloved trilogy , which then turned into a blockbuster movie that was easily one of the most successful rom-coms of the past decade . When I say populist , I mean it as the highest compliment . Kwan took a world that should be highly inaccessible ( the lives of not especially nice super-rich people , in a part of society that very few of us are intimately familiar with ) and made it into frothy fun that was also emotionally engaging . It 's a highwire act that 's hard to pull off . Even more impressively , he pulled it off over three books in a row , heightening the emotional stakes as he upped the wealth of his characters . <p> Kwan 's new novel Sex and Vanity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised , the first of a new series ) , sits within the same diamond-encrusted wheelhouse ; it revolves around the problems of the super-wealthy as they fall in and out of love , trapped inside their gilded cages . It also ruthlessly satirises them and everything they stand for -- which in many cases , is actually nothing at all . <p> A billionaire 's bachelor party on a cargo ship turned party island in the movie Crazy Rich Asians ( Photo : Warner Bros ) <p> The novel is split into two clean halves . The first takes place at a wedding on the luxurious island of Capri , where 19 year old Lucie Churchill meets George Zao , the improbably dreamy surfer who she starts off hating and is then , yes , infatuated with . The second half picks up a few years after the Capri affair , with Lucie in New York and intertwined with one of the most eligible bachelors in the world , Cecil Pike ( has there ever been a tolerable Cecil in a book ? ) . The course of true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion to help you along the way never hurt . <p> If the plot sounds familiar , you 're either an English major or you really like Merchant-Ivory films , because yes , it is the same plot as E.M . Forster 's A Room With A View . To call Sex and Vanity a riff on Forster 's masterwork would be an understatement ; it 's a riff in the same way that ' Ice Ice Baby ' " samples " ' Under Pressure ' . No , Sex and Vanity is essentially A Room With a View with designer gowns , luxury cars , and social media . This is n't a dig against Kwan or the novel -- if you 've got bones as strong and tragic as the ones that Forster set out , you might as well use them . ( It 's worth noting that Kwan says that he was inspired by both the novel and the 1985 film , which I 'd wager more people are familiar with at this point . Forster 's great , but Helena Bonham-Carter with the wind in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While nobody would describe A Room With a View as a comic novel , Sex and Vanity definitely is one . Kwan 's target is , as always , the super-rich , the crazy-rich , or the rich-crazy . The kind of people who introduce themselves last name first , first name second -- and indeed , every character in the book is succeeded by a list of where they 've gone to school ; the protagonist herself is introduced with the bracketed ( 92nd St. Y Nursery School / Brearley / Brown ) . The only person that remains unskewered is Lucie herself , but everybody else , from Lucie 's annoying cousin Charlotte , to the Sultanah of Malaysia , is fair game . Kwan 's humour works best when he sits omnisciently over his entire cast , which sprawls into not just Lucie 's extended family , but her entire social circle . Take this exchange between Charlotte and Mordecai , an erstwhile interior designer/art historian at the party : <p> " What do you do , Ms. Barclay ? " <p> " I 'm an editor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bouche . Super magazine , superb .

I 'm not going to ask him what he does . It 'll drive him nuts , and he 'll tell me within two minutes . <p> High society in Capri , viewed from above ( Photo : mikolajn/Getty ) <p> The novel is full of this kind of jab -- everything that every character says about anybody else ends up saying more about them . It 's enormously pleasurable for the reader , and Kwan feels like the conspiratorial host at a masked ball . Nobody knows who anybody else is , but he knows and he 's delighted to show you . He turns the blush-deep thoughts into comic gems , without ever betraying his own affection for the characters . He 's as much their friend as he is ours , and it 's only the best friends who can truly insult each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use that word lightly , is that Kevin Kwan writes wealth like he 's writing a fantasy novel . The world is no more or less fantastical than Hogwarts , and Kwan 's worldbuilding is as tight as that of She Who Shall Not Be Named . He gets the reader into a world that is just far away enough that we know it 's unattainable , but we can see it all the same . It 's a world where celebrity chefs drop in and cater weddings , where a " four or five bedroom apartment " in Brooklyn is seen as a quaint downgrade , and where everything in the world is available at the click of a finger . One major plot point revolves around getting a famous Warhol star to be the guest of honour at a charity dinner , and he makes it feel as high stakes as a political coup . For as much as he makes fun of these characters , he 's a master at building a world , populating it with vivid characters , and getting the reader to invest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of names -- brands , famous families , locations -- can feel too much , but it 's part of the tapestry that Kwan is weaving . Keeping up with the names is exhausting for the reader because it 's exhausting for the characters . If you 're familiar with all the names , you get the extra thrill of knowing exactly why certain brands are gauche or coveted , but if you 're unfamiliar with them , it just builds up another layer of the character 's armour , another bar on the cage , nice though it may be . <p> Constance Wu as Rachel Chu ( right ) gracefully elbows her way into the Crazy Rich Asians set ( Photo : Warner Bros ) <p> It serves another function for Kwan : He drops all the names , all the references , so that when he throws them all aside we realise we 're caught up in the pretense of it . When Lucie falls in love , she falls hard , with breathless run-on sentences : <p> " ... she realized at that moment how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set eyes on him in the lunchroom of the hotel to the vision of him as a godlike Apollo diving off the rock at Da Luigi , she had wanted him so desperately she could hardly breathe , gasping deeply while he shoved the heavy door closed with his foot , pressed her body against the ancient stone wall , kissing her throat , her neck , letting his mouth linger , as she reached for him urgently . <p> For the characters , life only becomes real when they throw the names away . Similarly , for the reader , it 's when the characters become real and their experience becomes something relatable , flesh and blood . Kwan is a master of judging when to deploy these moments , when to unburden us from the excess of the rest of the novel . <p> It 's a fascinating direction for the author , and so is the territory he 's plumbing . Crazy Rich Asians showed the ways in which extreme wealth allows people to leapfrog the inequalities forced on people by race , class and culture . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trappings of extreme wealth do n't lift you up but actually weigh you down . It glances , not ineffectually , on the ways in which being mixed race complicates even the armour of extreme wealth , but it 's more a feint at weight than a true investigation . Your mileage will vary on whether the plights of the lovelorn rich are those you want to spend 300 pages with , even with skewering , but if you 're in the mood for escapism , then you 'll find enough nutrition in the froth that Kwan serves up . <p> Sex and Vanity by Kevin Kwan ( Hutchinson , $37 ) is available from Unity Books Wellington and Auckland . <p> The Spinoff Review of Books is proudly brought to you by Unity Books , recently named 2020 International Book Store of the Year , London Book Fair .

There are trade-offs , " the University of Otago economist and co-founder of global decision-making company 1000Minds explains . <p> " In the pursuit of one objective , like finding a new girlfriend ; that might cause you to do stupid things that end your political career . <p> " Or like loving your children and your wife and wanting to have a nice recreational time with them at the beach ...

Is something broken in the way we select political candidates ? Or is it bigger than that ? With a general election next month , plus referendums on legalising euthanasia and recreational cannabis , do we all need to learn to make smarter choices ? <p> The politicians who " fell from grace " made mistakes somewhere in the decision-making process , Prof Hansen argues . <p> " They did n't sit down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have enough information about them , or they acted on impulse .

" <p> Being human , it appears . <p> Prof Jamin Halberstadt <p> People , including politicians , often do not make rational decisions , Prof Jamin Halberstadt , head of the University of Otago 's psychology department , says . This understanding of our species was pioneered in the 1970s by Nobel prize-winning psychologist Daniel Kahneman , who showed that people habitually make choices using shortcuts which , useful in day-to-day choices , can let them down on weighty decisions . <p> " This is especially true when people are under pressure or are otherwise not motivated to reach the best decisions , which is a lot of the time , " Prof Halberstadt says . <p> A common mistake is basing decisions on whatever facts come to mind in the moment . The result can be a disastrous miscalculation of the risk inherent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in recent weeks . <p> Another barrier to sensible choices , Prof Halberstadt says , is the trouble people have knowing how they will feel when in a different state of mind . In a " hot state " , it can be difficult to figure out what your " cold state " self would feel about the plan you are about to execute . Competing priorities do not get a fair hearing and the person is left to rue the result . <p> Politicians could benefit , Prof Hansen suggests , from taking Benjamin Franklin 's advice . The American Founding Father famously outlined his decision-making process in a 1772 letter , advising London chemist Joseph Priestley to begin problem solving by creating lists of " pros " and " cons " , for and against , for the choice he faced . <p> " That would work really well for those binary yes-no decisions , " Prof Hansen says . <p> " Should I send nude pictures to young women ?

Others say important decisions should always be well thought out or they will lead to mistakes . <p> " But we all like to think we 're smarter than the average bear , " Prof Hansen adds . <p> Could it be that gut instinct and first impressions are playing a negative role in the selection of electoral candidates by political parties ? Just because the candidate committee 's chairman likes the cut of the contender 's jib does n't mean they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Trying to reach consensus about which candidate the committee should select can also be difficult .

It 's just the nature of being an individual . So getting those values out front and centre and being able to see other people 's points of view ; that 's the crux of the problem . That 's when we can have a proper communication . <p> " We might not agree . But at least I can see your point of view . " <p> Victoria Woodman <p> Victoria Woodman , however , does not believe there is any particular problem with candidate selection in New Zealand . <p> The University of Auckland electoral system researcher says there are differences in selection methods , ranging from the comparatively decentralised Greens , through Labour and National with a mix of regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more centralised end of the spectrum . <p> She says candidates are thoroughly vetted by parties , but it is inevitable some unworthy ones will slip through or that some decent ones will do something stupid . <p> Despite recent controversies , there is no reason to think poor candidate selection is an issue , she says . <p> Group decision-making dynamics are not a factor when a citizen is standing alone in a voting booth , pen in hand . There , other challenges need to be overcome when trying to make smart choices . <p> That process , Prof Halberstadt says , needs to begin long before we find ourselves staring blankly at a dizzying array of unknown names on a voting form . <p> He does worry about the wholesale ignorance of some sections of the voting population .

The algorithm amplifies disinformation and misinformation . " <p> Davis says politicians in many countries , including New Zealand , are using social media to distort debates . <p> A fortnight ago , New Zealand First leader Winston Peters confirmed the party had contracted election campaign services from wealthy United Kingdom businessman Arron Banks and political activist Andy Wigmore -- aka the " Bad Boys of Brexit " -- who were behind the Leave.EU campaign . That campaign weaponised negative emotions such as anger and irritation -- which spread more quickly on social media than positive messaging -- to galvanise and build support . <p> Last month , Wigmore was reported as saying he would be causing " mischief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " . <p> Davis teaches his students to be savvy media consumers who find multiple corroborating sources before sharing information online . <p> Determining which information sources to trust is crucial . A good guide is whether they correct their mistakes , he says . <p> " If the ODT makes a mistake , it corrects it . If the BBC or The New York Times get something wrong , they correct it . <p> " If the news organisation is honest enough to correct its mistakes , then it is probably honest enough to report the news properly .

Or , in the case of assisted dying , what value you place on sanctity of life compared with quality of life . <p> Hansen harks back to Franklin 's letter , saying his big contribution to decision-making was the advice to give a value rating to each item on the lists of pros and cons . <p> " All he 's saying is get a sheet of paper , divide it into pros and cons , spend the day filling it in . " <p> Then assign weights to each item based on its importance or value to you . Finally , cross out evenly weighted items in both columns until only one column has items not crossed out . <p> " The reason I find it attractive is that anyone can do it with a sheet of paper , " Prof Hansen says . <p> " You could do that with the cannabis and euthanasia questions .

Even then , some grace is required , both professors say . <p> " As I get older , I see my own mistakes all around me ... so a good point to end on is humility . " <p> Not that that means no improvement is possible or no change is required . <p> Prof Halberstadt wonders whether people should have to demonstrate a minimum level of political knowledge before they are allowed to vote . <p> Max Rashbrooke <p> Woodman says a possible improvement could be allowing wider participation in the candidate selection process . <p> Political researcher Max Rashbrooke believes New Zealand definitely needs to move from a representative to a more democratic system . <p> " I think the best possible change we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people the chance to discuss issues with each other , and then give the results of those discussions real weight in decision-making , " Rashbrooke says . <p> The Victoria University of Wellington researcher says there is lots of evidence that , when it comes to big political problems , large groups of citizens can make better decisions than small groups of experts -- and better than politicians alone . That , he says , is because one of the best guarantees of good decision-making is having a wide range of approaches , backgrounds and ways of thinking . <p> " But it 'll only be smart , obviously , if those ideas that are spread among us can be shared and brought to the surface . And that 'll only happen if people can intelligently discuss the issues .

Today everything has the touch of change including the celebrations and rituals of festivals . <p> Diwali has also undergone a complete metamorphosis . <p> The name Diwali itself is supposed to be a transformed form of the more correct word ' Dipavali ' or ' Deepavali , ' the literal meaning of which in Sanskrit is a row of lamps . Filling little clay lamps with oil and wick and lighting them in rows all over the house is a tradition that is popular in most regions of India . <p> Earlier , on the main day , the best part used to be the darkness approaching the night . The ritual of lamp burning used to take quite some time , even the dingiest slum hut used to acquire a glow of the earthen lamp and a traditional festive air of celebration . This was followed by a short prayer to Goddess Lakshmi , the Progenitor of wealth , with one rupee silver coin soaked in milk , few low-tone crackers , ordinary sparklers and rockets launched in empty soda water bottles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to make floor designs of Lotus , the seat of Lakshmi at the entrance . Lights were kept on all night to ensure that She does not lose Her way . In South India , celebrations began with an oil bath before sunrise . Goddess Lakshmi is said to reside in the oil on that day and Goddess Ganga in the water . <p> Along with eating and exchanging sweets in plates and merriment in the air , there used to be gambling with small stakes and mostly in small coins . The other aspect was , of course , to wish for more money after appeasing the Goddess and the quickest way to get it was by means of gambling . <p> The Scene today <p> Diwali is not what it used to be , a Festival not seen as it is now and the reverence for the occasion is gone . Now it is fun , frolic , revelry and pleasure . The religious trappings have been pushed to the background , with the forefront occupied by the ritual of consumption , entertainment , merry-making and life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and producer 's dream . <p> The innocence of the Festival has been invaded by sophistication and scale in all its aspects . The earthen lamps are replaced by flickering strings of lights , neon and other innovations that make the flames gyrate to attract attention . <p> Fireworks are thoroughly professional , high-sounded with burst of bombs that pierce through the ears , high decibel sounds and a long string of crackers in thousands . Sparklers are feminine and used by children and women ; loudness is masculine and thus handled by the daredevil men . <p> The art of pyrotechnics advances every year . The rockets soar higher ; make kaleidoscopic patterns after bursting , with loud sounds . The whole neighborhood is littered with remnants of scattered pieces . <p> Seeing is believing . And the remnants of the crackers lie around for a while , as it is not for workers to work and clean but collect baksheesh ( tips ) from households . <p> Exchanging Gifts <p> The second aspect is the intensification of the practice of gift giving . <p> In most religions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Hindus do so on Diwali day . Diwali candles have largely taken over the twinkling from earthen diyas . Nobody has the time nowadays to twist wicks out of raw cotton and to fill each individual diya with oil .

But crackers and fireworks have come into their own , vying with each other for range , variety and eye appeal , also sadly , noise and smoke . <p> It is possible to drape the night in stars without an almighty bang that also releases a pall of smoke . Most of the money spent on Diwali celebration only seeks to project an image . But in spite of this element of consumerism that has recently crept in , Diwali remains one of the liveliest of Indian Festivals . <p> Until distemper and plastic emulsion appeared on the scene , every single urban home was lime-washed for Diwali for cosmetic reasons and to lay on a befitting welcome to Goddess Lakshmi , who likes homes to be clean . <p> Diwali is also an occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumption <p> Diwali is an important economic event today .

The expenditure on celebrations has gone up by geometric proportions . Gambling is with very high stakes . <p> Gone are the innocent coins ; in are the high denomination notes in bundles . People are on a purchasing spree . <p> Diwali sales beckon people to bargains . <p> The atmosphere is sabbatical and raucousness is not despised .

Legends say when Lord Shiva and Parvati gambled , she won because she worshipped Lakshmi . <p> Candles and electric lights may take the place of the traditional earthen lamps ; yet part of the celebration and a life little changed over the centuries when men and women decked in all their finery moved to the rhythm proper to the occasion still remains . <p> Throughout India , Diwali celebrations bring the luminosity of joyous spirit-visits to relations and friends , heart touching heart , mind and mind , soul and soul , warm greetings and exchange of sweets , crackers and fireworks-loud and thundering or sparkling Anar or a Phooljhari so appropriate to the sparkle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worshipped on the night of Diwali with all the traditional offering of sweets , flowers , fruit and money , even a brand new gold ornament or two , bought especially for the occasion . <p> The diya , lit in homage to Lakshmi , is shaped to hold four wicks and is filled with clarified butter instead of oil .

This means the Bill will only protect the 2% of tenants who are behaving badly , upsetting their neighbours ' lives . <p> Although a small percentage of the tenant population , this still amounts to around 12,000 tenants around New Zealand causing problems for around 60,000 neighbouring households . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either now or in the future ? <p> If New Zealanders want landlords to continue being able to protect them from the seriously bad behaviour of particular tenants , they need to let their local MP , Labour , NZ First and the Greens know their opposition to this part of the Bill urgently . <p> Sharon Cullwick is the executive officer at the NZ Property Investors Federation . <h> Comments from our readers <p> Short sighted attempt to try and keep some tenants off the housing NZ queues . Although in the long run there will be less investors operating in the space where its needed most . <p> On 22 July 2020 at 11:03 am KiwiKathy said : <p> Am I misreading this ?

@@32009239 <h> Financial advice makes NZers better off <h> New data shows that New Zealanders with financial advisers are better off and more confident in their financial lives . <p> The Financial Services Council has released Money and You , a survey of 2,000 New Zealanders conducted in March , as part of its work on New Zealanders ' relationship with money . <p> It found that people who had advice received an average 4% better investment returns , and had 3.7% more in their savings . <p> " To put this 4% into real terms ; if a 25-year-old were to take financial advice and saved $2,500 per year , they would be $1.5 million better off at 55 than if they did n't take advice . That 's a remarkable difference , and a benefit that many more New Zealanders should be receiving , " said FSC chief executive Richard Klipin . <p> " Money and You also found that New Zealanders who get financial advice on average have KiwiSaver balances over 50% bigger than those who do n't ; are more likely to have insurance cover ; and have greater peace of mind and confidence in making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the impact of Covid-19 on the economy and jobs , only underscores the critical need for all of us to seek professional financial advice .

The research found that under 20% of New Zealanders get financial advice , while 40% do n't see any benefit to getting professional financial advice , and 75% do n't recognise the positive impact that financial stability has on their mental wellbeing , " Klipin said . <p> " This shows that as an industry we need to do better in addressing the perceptions and barriers that are stopping New Zealanders from getting financial advice and enjoying the significant benefits to their financial and mental wellbeing . <p> " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portfolios need or can afford financial advice . This research shows that 's not the case and the value and benefits of getting advice can be significant for all New Zealanders , no matter the scale of their wealth . <p> " There 's also a range of financial advice products and services to suit everyone 's financial position and stage in life . " <p> People with an adviser had life insurance of $189,708 on average , compared to $167,770 for those without . They had more than $51,000 in income protection versus $35,000 for those with no adviser . <p> The research found that inheriting money , going through a period of financial distress , property transactions or nearing retirement were triggers for seeking advice . <p> Ryan Bessemer , chief executive of Trustees Executors , which sponsored the research , said that it was an important step in building New Zealanders ' understanding of the importance of getting financial advice . <p> " Money and You starkly sets out the significant financial benefits for all Kiwis from getting good advice . <p> " We know from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Zealanders are in a precarious financial situation , so it 's imperative for us as an industry to do everything we can to ensure that more Kiwis are benefiting from receiving high quality financial advice . <p> " We hope that Money and You , in conjunction with other industry initiatives , will help drive increased debate and discussion about the need for financial advice and ensure that more New Zealanders are asking themselves the $1.5 million question .

@@32015236 <h> Abyss Solutions Helps Keep Offshore Rig Operators Afloat <p> As its evocative name suggests , Abyss Solutions is a company taking AI to places where humans ca n't or should n't go . <p> The brainchild of four University of Sydney scientists and engineers , the startup set out to improve the maintenance and observation of industrial equipment six years ago . <p> It began by developing advanced technology to inspect the most difficult to reach assets of urban water infrastructure systems , such as dams , reservoirs , canals , bridges , and ship hulls . Later , it zeroed in on an industry that often operates literally in the dark : offshore oil and gas platforms . <p> A few years ago , Abyss CEO Nasir Ahsan and CTO Suchet Bargoti were demonstrating to a Houston-based platform operator the insights they could generate from the image data collected by its underwater Lantern Eye 3D camera . The camera 's sub-millimetre accuracy provides a " way to inspect objects as if you 're taking them out of water , " said Bargoti . <p> An employee of the operator interrupted the meeting to describe an ongoing problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decaying and could n't be repaired sufficiently . Once it was clear that Abyss could provide detailed insight into the problem and how to solve it , no more selling was needed . <p> " Every one of these companies is dreading the next Deepwater Horizon , " said Bargoti , referencing the 2010 incident in which BP spilled nearly five million barrels of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , killing 11 people and countless wildlife , and costing the company US$65 billion in cleanup costs and fines . " What they wanted to know is , ' Will your data analytics help us understand what to fix and when to fix it ? ' " <p> Today , Abyss 's combination of NVIDIA GPU-powered deep learning algorithms , unmanned vehicles and innovative underwater cameras is enabling platform operators to spot faults and anomalies such as corrosion on equipment above and below the water and address it before it fails , potentially saving millions of dollars and even a few human lives . <p> During the COVID-19 pandemic , the stakes have risen . Offshore rigs have emerged as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adopt strict quarantine procedures that limit the number of people onsite in order to reduce the disease 's spread and minimize interruptions . <p> Essentially , this has sped up the industry 's digital transformation push and fueled the urgency of Abyss ' work , said Bargoti . " They ca n't afford to have these things happening , " he said . <p> Historically , inspection and maintenance of offshore platforms and equipment has been a costly , time-consuming and labor-intensive task for oil and gas companies . It often yields subjective findings that can result in missed needed repairs and unplanned shutdowns . <p> An independent audit found that Abyss ' semantic segmentation models are able to detect general corrosion with greater than 90 percent accuracy , while severe corrosion is identified with greater than 97 percent accuracy . Both are significant improvements over human efforts , and also have outcompeted other AI companies in the audit . <p> What 's more , Abyss says that its oil and gas platform clients report reductions in operating costs by as much as 25 percent thanks to its technology @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on many terabytes of data ( each platform generates about 1TB a day ) , occurs on AWS instances running NVIDIA T4 Tensor Core GPUs . The company also uses the latest versions of CUDA and cuDNN in conjunction with TensorFlow to power deep learning applications such as image and video segmentation and classification , and object detection . <p> Bargoti said the company also is working with the NVIDIA Jetson TX2 module and TensorRT software to condense its models so they can run on their unmanned vehicles in real time . <p> Most of the data can be processed in the cloud because of the slowness of the corrosion process , but there are times when real-time AI is needed onsite , such as when a robotic vehicle needs to make decisions on where to go next . <p> As a member of NVIDIA Inception , a programme to help startups working in AI and data science get to market faster , Abyss has benefited from a try-before-you-buy approach to NVIDIA tech .

" It 's all leading to this better development of perception systems , better development of decision-making systems and better development of robotics systems . " <p> Abyss is taking a deep look at a number of additional markets it believes its technology can help .

@@32025236 <h> It 's time to recognise the benefits of female Black leaders beyond race <p> On 11 August , Joe Biden , America 's Democratic leader , chose Kamala Harris to be his running mate for the forthcoming US presidential elections . While the announcement of the news has evoked mixed responses , Harris ' new job is undeniably historic . She is the first Black woman and first Asian-American in a major party presidential ticket -- the key word here is first . <p> It brings into question the contested views of Black women in leadership and whether or not Harris ' nomination could be a strategic political ploy to win votes . Donna Kate Rushin 's poem , The Bridge , explores the exhaustion that many Black women feel in having to step up to be ' the bridge ' , the person tasked with connecting different party viewpoints . <p> " Nobody Can talk to anybody Without me , Right ? <p> Find another connection to the rest of the world <p> Find something else to make you legitimate <p> Find some other way to be political and hip " <p> In the pinnacle of racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kamala Harris could not have arrived at a better time . As the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India , her background has been an unarguable talking point both prior to her new role and now ; she could well be the " bridge " that the Democrats need , bringing generational and racial diversity to the party . She represents a young and multi-cultural version of Democratic politics . Whether we like it or not , her skin has played some form of conscious or unconscious impact in her nomination . The death of George Floyd has heightened the necessity of enlisting a Black woman in the role and her appointment highlights the absence of Black female representation in leadership and politics . For Black women , she symbolises a section of the population in America who have never seen themselves in politics . <p> Harris ' nomination may be in part political play , but Black women in politics need better representation , and she is an excellent candidate , with the required skills and experience , in addition to an understanding of the views of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in why she is there , but the point is that she is there at all -- she more than deserves to be . Regardless of whether you align with the party or not , the boundary-breaking former prosecutor is fully equipped to do this job , irrespective of her skin colour . When Black women are given a seat at a table , while we can acknowledge the added intersectionality that comes with their appointment , the conversation needs to go beyond their race . Doing so detracts from their skill and competency ; instead we must recognise and celebrate their genuine contributions . We may never be able to agree on politics , but highlighting the achievements and abilities of Black women is a mark towards equity and fairer representation and this is exactly what Kamala Harris signifies . <p> View photos <p> Photo credit : Drew Angerer <p> Women in leadership may as well be translated as ' white women in leadership ' . Recent reports of female solutions to covid-19 revealed exactly what I always envisioned and experienced female leadership to look like typically in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter to me ; this pandemic must be beaten . Nevertheless , the images of all white women in leadership did create a clear view of what female governance looked like and it looked overwhelmingly white . For Harris and many other Black women , their identities remain the centre of attack ; they are frequently misconstrued and tarnished . Police recently stopped UK MP Dawn Butler in what she later identified as racial profiling . This came after she was forced to close her Brent office because of racist verbal abuse and threats of violence . <p> Only 12 of the 220 women elected in UK parliament are Black . To suggest that that white women have been the voices of all women is no understatement . Harris ' nomination represents an opportunity for Black women to have someone in power that embodies at least some of their experiences . <p> Black female leaders do more than create diverse leadership ; they provide inclusion in policy-making processes , from micro to macro levels . As Kamala Harris herself put it , " You have to see and smell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As a Black woman who began my career in politics and international development , I never felt that I belonged .

At 77 , he is the oldest major party nominee in US history and has described himself as a transitional figure . Harris is the person he wants to succeed him in office . Her appointment must be taken as more than political strategy , and a reminder of the wealth of experience that Black women possess . Black women in all their diverse , nuanced , individual identities are qualified , capable , and have every reason to be ambitious .

@@32025238 <p> What do we mean when we talk about ideas like Transition , Democracy , and Citizenship of Aotearoa ? How might we upgrade our framework for understanding these concepts to be more fit for purpose ? <p> This week , The Dig and ScoopCitizen launch an engaged journalism series exploring key aspects of the transition required for Aotearoa to navigate the crises we face , and to thrive as a resilient and democratic nation . <p> This series seeks to investigate how we can embrace and weave together the best ideas from the ' global tapestry of alternatives ' that will reshape every aspect of our society over the coming decade . <h> Welcome to the Meta-crisis <p> We live in a time of transition on many levels . For better or worse , disruption , social change , revolution , and evolution are occurring at an exponentially accelerating rate across our global civilisation . The current era is increasingly being characterised by many leading thinkers as a time of ' meta-crisis ' -- ie multiple systemic crises converging into one meta-crisis affecting every aspect of our complex system simultaneously . <p> Academic and philosopher John Vervaeke believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms ' the meaning crisis ' -- a lack of shared ' grand narratives ' and systems to make sense of our complex world . Perhaps nowhere is this lack of shared understanding more evident than in our lack of a coherent and commonly agreed definition of what we mean when we talk about democracy . <p> So , just what do we mean when we talk about ideas like ' Transition ' , ' Democracy ' , and ' Citizenship ' of Aotearoa ? Furthermore , how might we upgrade our framework for understanding such concepts to be more fit-for-purpose in the precarious times in which we live ? <h> What do we mean by ' Transitional ' ? <p> The visionary systems thinker Karl Pogany perhaps understood the nature of societal transitions better than anyone . He believed that since human society ( like nature ) is a ' complex adaptive system ' , its nature is to change through ' punctuated equilibrium ' , ' chaotic transitions ' and ' bifurcations ' . This means that humanity does n't adapt to radically new situations through reasoned debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the biophysical realities of energy use ) . <p> When one of these crisis points occurs , Pogany said , first , the old ' global system ' disintegrates and the old institutions lose legitimacy , then , a ' cambrian explosion of alternatives emerges ' , carrying the seed forms of the next system , but these alternatives need to fight it out before a new stable global system emerges . <p> He saw the relative stability of the post-1945 liberal international order as one of these periods of equilibrium . However , crucially , he also pinpointed the 2008 global crisis as triggering the disintegration of that global system of the liberal order and its institutions into the current age of confusion and transition . <p> Regardless of the exact date , evidence all around us suggests we are very much in the midst of a chaotic period of transition and change . COVID-19 has at the very least , revealed and accelerated this already underway delegitimisation and disintegration of almost every established aspect of the social , political and economic systems of the liberal order . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not avoid the chaos of this transitional phase any more than we could have stopped World War Two or the French Revolution once they had been set in motion . However , accepting this reality frees us up to positively shape the new stable system that will eventually emerge from this time of great revelation and rearrangement . <p> We can achieve this by focusing our energy on nurturing those ' alternative seed forms ' that preserve the best elements of the old system and help accelerate the emergence of a better stable system . <h> A New Global System <p> New global system / Artist : Sanouni Imad Morocco <p> So what would a better system emerging from this great time of transition look like ? <p> The failure of the current world order to avert crisis , suggests that such a new system must feature some very different design elements such as : <p> Better meeting the essential core needs of all humans such as food , shelter , community and a sense of purpose , and <p> A better understanding of the biophysical realities and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells us that achieving these goals requires a system that is grounded on a bedrock of truly democratic and representative principles and decentralised power and involves all citizens more meaningfully in decisions and actions affecting their essential needs . <p> Systems that trust that citizens know what is best for themselves generally leads to happier and more prosperous communities and environmental outcomes . Humanity is far more capable of taking part in decisions affecting our lives and surroundings than we are given credit for . A system that understands this truth could unlock vast amounts of latent human potential . <p> As legendary political philosopher Jurgen Habermas said , political culture does not drop from the skies , but is cultivated on the land or left untended to wither together with the rest of the plants in the garden of democracy . We need to consider how we can best tend the ' alternative seeds ' of our emergent new political culture and institutions in this time of transition to create the right conditions for an upgraded form of democracy to emerge . <h> What do we even mean by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century of democracy 's triumph due to the rapid spread of liberal democracies across the world under the banner of the liberal international order . However , this ideology of liberal democracy coupled with free-market capitalism championed by the powerful Western nations post-WWII has fundamentally failed to deliver more democratic outcomes for citizens . <p> The harsh realities of the escalating meta-crisis around us ( from inequality , to climate change , to COVID-19 ) suggest this system of governance has not helped us to collectively make sane decisions about managing our resources and activities . <p> If we follow Vervaeke 's ' meaning crisis ' , logic , this is a result of a lack of shared sensemaking apparatus about what we mean by democracy . Former Greek Minister of Finance and academic Yanis Varoufakis has highlighted this problem , stating that our current usage of the word democracy has departed wildly from its original Greek source meaning : <p> " Cleisthenis ' Demos was imagined as the State itself ; as an active community of citizens in which the political sphere , the economy , the State and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the Demos getting ( physically ) together and engaging in a contest of opinions about what ought to be done . The point of the exercise was not to stage a process whereby the rulers consult the people but one in which the people rule . " <p> Is the idea of democracy as propounded by acolytes of the liberal international order really based on this definition of democracy ? <p> The reality suggests otherwise . The ' meme ' or ' accepted narrative ' of democracy has been consistently used by powerful Western nations to justify inherently anti-democratic activities in order to maintain their imperial domination and exploitation of territories and resources . <p> Such anti-democratic activities include the commission of atrocities , convenient blindness to corruption and political violence , and a vigorous suppression of free speech , and grassroots political cultures . This was already a reality of political life in the global south , the communist bloc , or any nation that defied wholesale absorption into either of these imperial blocs post-1945 . However , such anti-democratic and non-representative systems have become an increasingly normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> These inherent hypocrisies are eroding faith in the ' democratic ' ideals of this liberal world order and leading to its delegitimisation and collapse . Many Citizens globally are asking the valid question , of how a system so devoid of the basic tenets of representation , equality , participation , and accountability can be considered a democratic one ? <h> Un-representative Democracy <p> Widespread participation and active engagement were never a central consideration in the design of the systems of Western democracies . As Varoufakis points out , " Magna Carta , the defining document of Western democracy , was not about fashioning an Athenian-style masterless Demos : It was about entrenching the rights of masters vis- ? -vis the Monarch . " <p> However , if we ever could , we can no longer seriously claim that liberal democracies include an ' active community of citizens ' engaging in a contest of opinions . Indicators of a truly functioning democracy such as voting turnout rates , and membership of political parties or trade unions , have all reached historically low levels in most Western nations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is a highly variable relationship globally ( by nation and party ) between voter desires/political promises , and actual legislation implemented by elected officials . Even worse , the landmark 2014 Gilens &amp; Page study demonstrated an increasingly strong correlation between legislation implemented and the interests of those funding the politicians . <p> These , and many other studies , show data to support an interpretation that the once shining beacon of liberal democracy , the USA , is now essentially a plutocracy ( or dictatorship ) controlled by " economic elites and organised groups representing business interests " . Recent political developments in the U.S since 2014 ( such as a war on journalism and the gutting of the US Postal system ) have only worsened this situation . <p> In Is New Zealand becoming a plutocracy ? , Maria Armoudian and Timothy Kuhner point to the Gilens and Page study , then go on to argue that in NZ we face some of the same threats that are unravelling the United States ' democratic representation . The authors point to the unregulated lobbying industry , opaque political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Democracy 2.0 <p> So , what can be done to reverse this steady decline of democratic representation and the resurgence of authoritarianism globally ? <p> Roslyn Fuller in Forbes , writes that in order to rediscover what democracy should be for the modern nation state we need to " go back to what the ancient Athenians invented in the 5th century BCE , where every citizen regularly participated in discussion and voting for the laws that would steer their livelihoods and survival . " <p> Fuller is in good company in the belief that new technology and communication tools can now provide the means to scale up for millions of people what ancient Athenians did for a small number of privileged citizens . <p> A recent OECD Report , Innovative Citizen Participation and New Democratic Institutions -- Catching the Deliberative Wave , states that " Public authorities from all levels of government increasingly turn to Citizens ' Assemblies , Juries , Panels and other representative deliberative processes to tackle complex policy problems ranging from climate change to infrastructure investment decisions . " The report explores trends , best practices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ institutions to give citizens a more permanent and meaningful role in shaping the policies affecting their lives . <h> Democracy 2.0 in Aotearoa ? <p> So where does New Zealand currently stand in this Democratic transition ? <p> As Max Rashbrooke sums it up in his contribution to the Transitional Democracy series : <p> " Imagine a twenty-first century piece of software trying to run on a twentieth-century computer , and you have a fair picture of the New Zealand democratic system " . <p> In this current age of transition in which everything is up for redefinition , it is clear that our political establishment could be doing far more to support and facilitate truly democratic participation . We must begin to develop a new definition or ' grand narrative ' for democratic governance both as a nation in Aotearoa and as a global society . <h> So what might a system worthy of the definition of Democracy 2.0 look like in Aotearoa ? <p> TLDR : I speculate that it might be based on Maori worldviews , involve constitutional reform to reimagine the relationship between Maori and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and make use of modern communications technology . It might also ensure that we move beyond divisiveness , call out culture , and censorship , towards a culture of more inclusive , civilised , and compassionate communication . <h> How do we get there ? <p> The systems , the technology , and the popular support for such democratic innovations to be adopted are all here already . The only thing still lacking is clear political will from our representatives . Just as turkeys will not vote for Christmas , politicians on most points on the ideological spectrum appear to be loath to hand over any real power to citizens . This means that if we want to upgrade our democracy in New Zealand , it is up to us all to drive this change both from within and outside of the established political system . <p> To do this we might consider becoming active and engaged in the political process via parties , local politics , or advocacy groups . We can also join collaborative efforts such as Predator Free NZ , or efforts to regenerate our local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launch , or take part in discussions about increasing democratic participation everywhere we can , in our local communities , our schools , our workplaces , and even our online environments . <p> In other words , we must work tirelessly to tend the garden of our new political culture by fostering the positive seeds of the global tapestry of alternatives thrown up by this transitional time to ensure they grow into a stable new truly democratic system . <h> The Transitional Democracy Series <p> ScoopCitizen is walking the walk on participatory and deliberative engagement by running the Transitional Democracy series in the lead up to the 2020 election and beyond . <p> This series weaves together and explores powerful ideas from the global tapestry of alternatives that may shape our society in the next decade .

The Auckland bus that may have been the link between two cases was on the morning of August 12 . <p> Bloomfield said AT Hop card data was being used to locate those who were sitting near the positive case . He said the fact the bus trip took place just before Auckland moved to alert level three was promising , as the movement since of those who may have been exposed had been limited . <p> That means there is just one remaining case under investigation -- 88 of the 89 cases not connected to the border are linked to the one cluster . <h> 12.50pm : Bloomfield to reveal new cases , PM to talk alert levels <p> Ashley Bloomfield will be revealing the latest Covid-19 cases at today 's 1pm media briefing . He 'll be joined by the prime minister Jacinda Ardern , who will be discussing cabinet 's discussions around our current alert level settings . <p> Watch below : <h> 12.45pm : Thousands default on mortgage repayments , data shows <p> Reserve Bank data shows almost 11,000 homeowners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first week of August , due to the financial toll of Covid-19 . <p> As RNZ reports , more than 240,000 mortgage payments have also been missed since April -- worth about $2.2 billion . Additionally , more than 83,000 mortgage deferral requests were lodged since the end of March , representing about 13% of all mortgages . <h> 11.15am : The day ahead -- when will our alert levels drop ? <p> As mentioned in an earlier update , cabinet will today be reviewing our current alert levels . Currently , Auckland sits in alert level three and the rest of the country remains in level two . There are a number of considerations that will be made today , taking into account the latest advice from Ashley Bloomfield and the Ministry of Health . <p> Current cases <p> According to the Ministry of Health , New Zealand currently has 101 active cases of Covid-19 . There are 78 cases linked to the Auckland community cluster , and 21 are in quarantine . The remaining two cases have no known links : one of these is the Rydges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the St Lukes mall in Auckland . <p> Despite the community transmission , early signs suggest the decision to move back into lockdown is working . There has been no sudden surge in cases , and the fact that only two confirmed cases have no known links to either the border or the cluster is promising . <p> Testing numbers <p> On Wednesday , 18,091 tests were processed , bringing the total test count since the recent outbreak to 154,000 . <p> " Based on testing , we do have a strong indication that there has been no unseen transmission outside of the border and aside from the mystery Rydges case , and that does not seem to have resulted in any further transmission , " Hipkins told media yesterday . <p> Similarly , Bloomfield was encouraged by the rise in testing ; when questioned on the level of testing outside of Auckland , Bloomfield said he has been satisfied . About two thirds of the testing has been done in Auckland , Bloomfield said , since the recent outbreak . <p> Contact tracing <p> As of yesterday there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you go back just over a month , there were just 596,000 people on the app . The recent surge in users as a result of Covid-19 returning to the community demonstrates that while New Zealanders may have been complacent about the virus at alert level one , they 're a lot more concerned now . <p> Yesterday , as part of a government announcement about beefing up our managed isolation and quarantine facilities , the government announced it will be trialling the CovidCard ( or similar technology ) in a facility . This could then be rolled out to all facilities in the coming months . <p> Since August 11 , the Ministry of Health said 1,996 close contacts have been identified and 1,921 have been contacted and are now self-isolating . <p> Level 1.5 ? <p> There has been a lot of talk over the past weeks about a potential " level 1.5 " , which could see the country return to a degree of freedom -- but with some added protections in place , such as mask usage . <p> Earlier in the week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and two could look like . <p> " I think we should aim to get back to life as normal as possible , but the new normal will include I think perhaps a little more physical distancing , more frequent availability and use of hand gels , possibly even use of masks in some settings , " he said . <p> " What I sense is that all New Zealanders would prefer that we stayed in alert level one and would be prepared to perhaps modify what our behaviours are in alert level one ... <p> " It may be that there 's somewhere between a one and two so we can maintain that really open economy and do as much as we 'd like to in terms of attending large events and so on . " <p> It 's also possible that with Auckland currently in level three , the supercity could drop to something in between two and three in order to further limit the spread of Covid-19 . <p> When will we find out ? <p> Jacinda Ardern will be fronting today 's 1pm media briefing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expected she will reveal more about cabinet 's considerations this morning , however , a decision on our alert levels is unlikely unless a sudden change is required . <p> Keeping with the usual trend of 48-hours notice being provided , it 's likely Ardern will make a formal announcement on our alert levels at a press conference on Monday . <h> 9.25am : Trump triples down on claim NZ has had ' massive ' outbreak <p> It 's like he 's obsessed with us . President Trump has name-dropped New Zealand for the third time in a week , calling the five new cases of Covid-19 we had yesterday a " massive outbreak " . <p> Trump also repeated his very disputable claim that his handling of the pandemic has been " incredible " . <p> Trump compares the US coronavirus outbreak favorably with New Zealand and South Korea .

At this stage , the restrictions are due to change at midnight on Wednesday . <p> Cabinet will today be considering the latest health advice and whether or not to extend the lockdown or end it early . RNZ 's reporting that cabinet will not be making " a definitive decision " today on whether to relax the alert levels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 1pm briefing where she is expected to discuss the outcome of cabinet 's discussions . We 'll bring that to you live this afternoon . <h> 7.35am : Top stories from The Bulletin <p> We 've had a glut of border policies announced in recent days , as parties look to explain what they 'd do differently in an attempt to prevent outbreaks . We 'll focus the most on the National party plan -- for the obvious reason that they 're the party that could form an alternative government . But there have also been ideas put forward by Act and NZ First worth mentioning . <p> A top line aspect of it all would be the establishment of a new agency to oversee the borders , reports Radio NZ . According to deputy leader Gerry Brownlee , that would be " resourced to act as a centre of expertise . It will have the personnel , technology and capability to provide a world-class defence against Covid-19 .

The policy comes the day after the government directed the defence force to deploy many more soldiers at managed isolation and quarantine facilities . <p> Another major aspect of the National plan is to require everyone flying into New Zealand to return a negative Covid-19 test before boarding . That would n't necessarily preclude still having to do the quarantine period , and such a policy would almost certainly reduce the likelihood of people with the virus coming in . The issues for and against the idea were debated by Collins and health minister Chris Hipkins in successive interviews on Newstalk ZB -- Hipkins said he had actually considered such a policy , before rejecting it , because " a number of people coming into New Zealand gain their infections while in transit . Between when they leave and when they arrive is actually the highest risk time for gaining the virus .

This would be part of a wider policy direction ( which in fairness , is shared by the government ) of aiming to reduce the need for lockdowns . Unfortunately , targeted lockdowns are probably a bit of a red herring , as was seen in Victoria where attempts were made to limit restrictions , until such a policy became untenable . All in all though , the policy represents a fairly firm commitment from National to an elimination strategy . As Justin Giovannetti writes , National 's policy also represents a quite important philosophical change in approach in recent weeks -- " the opposition 's plan builds on the border system created by the Labour-led government and veers away from ideas that would allow businesses or universities to open private isolation facilities .

" That 's why tourists come here , " she said . " Why are we shooting the goose that lays the golden egg ?

It was not the airport 's graphic , but it suggested at least some there believed the airport may become a high-volume proposition . <p> This will worry those who understand an airport is not just a place for flights to land . It is also a place for people to shop , to catch buses and shuttles , and to pick up rental cars and vans . It is a sprawling , busy place , serviced by busy roads . <p> The airport will could have a significant , permanent impact on a quiet slice of paradise , all while the lower south has three other international airports and at least one other half-an-hour away with the capacity to grow . <p> This column last week said the idea shows up New Zealand 's potentially costly lack of cohesive infrastructure planning .

@@32051240 <p> News from KWC Keep Wellington 's Character is a new non-partisan heritage-based campaign formed in response to the Wellington City Council 's Draft Spatial Plan and wider ' Planning for Growth ' proposal . The WCC has gone far beyond what 's needed for an affordable , compact , resilient city . The plan will destroy heritage suburbs . <p> To launch the campaign , Keep Wellington 's Character have released a video in which urban historian Ben Schrader and concerned Wellingtonian Sue Elliot share their view about the proposal on the future of Wellington city and for its residents . <p> The Draft Spatial Plan follows central government 's recent National Policy Statement on Urban Development ( NPS-UD ) which directs city councils to loosen planning rules and raise height limits to accommodate future residents . After the failure of Kiwi-build , this is its response to housing needs . <p> Under the guise of Local Government engagement , WCC is amending the District Plan and changing existing community conditions . WCC has not been transparent about its plan to allow 6 storey development in the heritage suburbs of Mt Victoria , Aro Valley , Mt Cook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storey development in all the heritage suburbs , including Aotearoa'soldest suburb of Thorndon . <p> Keep Wellington 's Character calls for the heritage of inner city suburbs to be recognised . They should not be broken up with high rise and intense development . Protecting a few streetscapes ( as WCC proposes ) will not adequately reflect their heritage values . <p> Currently , the heritage suburbs have " character " protections under the existing District Plan . A resource consent is required before demolishing pre-1930s buildings in those heritage suburbs . The WCC plan will take important protection away from about 70% of the heritage suburbs , opening the way for widespread demolition . <p> Keep Wellington 's Character asks WCC to : <p> 1 . Reverse proposal to remove existing heritage protection that requires a resource consent tobe granted in order to demolish pre-1930s buildings in heritage suburbs . 2 . Use the ? most likely ?

Be transparent about the locations of high rise development and the shady impersonalenvironments likely to result , and that neighbouring cottages and villas will not be able to support solar panels on their roofs , contrary to WCC vision . 5 . Extend the " engagement " period , since COVID level 2 has prevented community meetings , and WCC has cancelled planned appearances at libraries . 6 . Acknowledge that during a general election is not the time for WCC to consult on such a wideranging proposal . 7 .

September 2020 , 16:42 <p> The debate here is not about heritage versus housing -- it is easy to do both ; rather it is about democracy versus deregulation . Planning for Growth proposes very wide-ranging deregulation , and assumes developers will cherry pick sites . <p> Housing affordability was not even considered in designing these proposals , and the most likely immediate effect is replacement of rental housing with upmarket dwellings . This is exactly what we have seen in southern Te Aro and along Oriental Parade when they were upzoned . <p> Affordable , warm , dry housing is an urgent need . These proposals will do nothing to address that need , because they have not been designed that way . Global experience suggests that you need targeted measures and an active public housing programme , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deliver widespread housing availability . <p> Furthermore there is no a lot of rhetoric but no actual evidence that the planning system is constraining the provision of housing . The Council has done no evaluation of why upzoning has not led to housing development on Adelaide Road . <p> Possibly the most outrageous claim is that Planning for Growth will help address climate change . In many ways , it is exactly the opposite type of densification to what is needed to reduce emissions . It will slightly increase density in already dense areas while doing nothing to create the web of urban villages across the city that is needed to reduce car dependence .

Please reply to this email if you would like to receive our future op-eds . <p> Sir Winston Churchill said that democracy is the worst form of Government except for all those other forms that have been tried from time to time . He is right , but not for the reason opinion leaders now pontificate . <p> In modern times democracy is lauded for its ' representation ' . But if that were true , surely we 'd want a system better at picking the best and brightest to ' represent ' us . No , it 's not the representation that makes democracy great , it 's the opposite : the ability to sack our elected leaders -- to ' kick the buggers out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in local government , the chance to kick the underperforming , the dishonest , or the lame ducks out does not come round enough . Auckland was lumped with Len Brown for three years too long after his antics and abuse of office became public . We 've now got a Mayor under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office and offering no assurances that he will stand down if charges are laid . <p> Voter recall options are gaining popularity overseas and it 's time New Zealand had the conversation . That 's why the Taxpayers ' Union has launched a proposal with other ratepayer groups advocating for the introduction of recall elections at all levels of local government , including District Health Boards . <p> A motion to recall an elected official would need the signatures of at least ten percent of voters in that official 's constituency . This is called the trigger threshold . If the threshold is reached , there will be a poll to determine if the representative should be recalled . If recall is supported by a majority , a by election would occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that election ( unless they are otherwise prohibited by existing law ) . <p> A recall option would improve democratic accountability by holding officials to account directly . When a local politician ignores public sentiment , misbehaves , or breaks an election promise , they would risk having to face the people again , prior to the next scheduled poll . The policy would enable voters to have a say within a term of office , rather than just at election time every three years . <p> It affirms the basic concept of " sovereignty of the people " . The right to elect should include the right to eject . <p> We propose some constraints , such as not allowing for a recall to be triggered within six months of a scheduled election and preventing the same official facing a recall election within six-months of winning an earlier poll . We also suggest the term of local government bodies could be extended by one year to four years , once the safety mechanism of recall elections is in place . <p> A ten percent trigger threshold is the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it would mean around 38,000 signatures would be required -- not an easy task . A recall poll for an Auckland City Councillor could be triggered by around 11,000 signatures from the applicable ward . <p> With recall elections , Auckland ratepayers could have ejected Len Brown for his expense shenanigans , histrionics , and tabletop dalliances . Kapiti Coast ratepayers could have ousted David Scott who refused to resign for more than a year after being convicted of indecently assaulting a female colleague by rubbing his genitals against her during a council morning tea . <p> It 's time to return the power to the people , and ensure that our elected officials have voters firmly in mind as they exercise their civil decision making on behalf of us all .

Reforms are ' evolutionary ' -- indeed , in a technical sense -- in that they improve the ' fitness ' of democratic society . Unlike biological evolution , which is a fully blind process , the process of democratic evolution is only partially blind . There is an inchoate sense of ' destination ' about political reform -- or at least the idea that reforms take societies to better places , if not the best place . <h> The Problem of the Local Optimum <p> Important concepts in evolutionary theory are those of fitness landscape and local optimum . We can think of a contour map , with better places ( eg with respect to democracy ) being those at higher altitude , and the best place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be a hill , the actual optimum is somewhere else , a mountain . <p> In a blind process , a local optimum can be thought of as the endpoint of a sub-optimal trail randomly followed . In a process with vision , however , it is possible to ' know ' that you -- our your society -- are at or approaching a local optimum , and therefore to know that you could have taken a better path . A part of that knowledge is that , to get on the best path -- or even simply a better path than the one you are on -- you first have to retrace at least some of your steps . <p> The more vision you have when you make a choice that takes you on an improvement pathway , the less likely you are to make a suboptimal choice . If you can see that the path you are contemplating takes you up a hill -- or even a mere hillock -- while another path takes you up the mountain that best represents the optimal policy outcome , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong choice . <p> Sometimes the difference between a hill and a mountain is subjective . A sighted person with one set of beliefs may consider ' Object A ' to be the mountain , and another sighted person with a different set of beliefs may consider ' Object B ' to be the mountain . Object A upholds the benefits of one belief-system ; Object B the benefits of another belief system . There is conflict . <p> In other situations , the mountain fully incorporates all the benefits of the hill , while having some benefits that the hill does not have . In this case , all rational sighted persons -- regardless of their differing values -- would choose the path to the mountain ( ' Object M ' ) over the path to the hill ( ' Object H ' ) . <p> There may however be sequencing issues . The mountain M may offer benefits X , Y , and Z. ( These three should be understood as uncontested benefits ; as agreed benefits , though the relative importance of each benefit may be subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ X or Y ; or both . A person whose narrow or impatient vision is particularly focussed on benefit X or Y may choose the hill over the mountain , despite the fact that both choices give both benefits . <p> ( In posing this set of binary choices -- Option M versus Option H -- each choice involves comparable cost ; the choice is based on the ' seeing ' of the benefits . However , choosing H and then reversing that choice involves additional cost ; it 's cheaper to make the better choice first up . Having noted that , it is also costly to delay making a choice ; an inferior choice might be better than making no choice . The opportunity cost of choosing H over M -- and then settling on H -- is Z. The opportunity to have Z in addition to X and Y is lost . ) <h> Democratic Benefits X , Y , and Z <p> In what follows , X is reducing the voting age to 16 , Y is making the income tax scale more progressive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tax mechanism ( UIFT ) . Before looking at these benefits together , it is necessary to comment on them individually . In doing so , I make the claim that all three represent objective enhancements to democracy . I also understand that -- in today 's querulous social environment -- there will be initial objections to all three of these suggested benefits . Nevertheless , I am sure that a substantial majority of people believe that democracy is a desirable system of social organisation , and that more democracy is better than less democracy . I believe that the arguments in favour of these benefits are persuasive , at least through a democratic lens . <p> Last month , the matter of the voting age was in the news : eg Teenagers ask court to lower the voting age , and note this 2018 petition . As I see it , there are three major democratic benefits associated with this reform . First there is a simple extension to the franchise . While this is a valid argument , it is the least persuasive reason because this argument becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second benefit ( Y ) is that it makes sense to have a single age that defines adult responsibility ; and I am inclined to believe that the arguments in favour of 16 are stronger than 18 or 20 or 21 . ( Having a single age defining legal adulthood does not refute the fact that there is a life stage from around 16 to under 25 in which older people -- especially parents -- continue to have duty of care towards their young people . Nor does it suggest that organisations -- such as the police force -- can not set their own age limits for recruitment . ) <p> The third benefit is that , at age 16 , people for the most part are still at school and living with their parents ; and are still relatively open to civic guidance from their elders ( including grandparents ) . So , 16 or 17 is a good age for young people to enter the world of democratic participation , facilitating a cultural bias towards participation over abstention . <p> On the matter of progressive taxation , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for higher incomes , a person 's disposable income ( ie income after taxes and public benefits ) should be lower as a percentage of their gross market income ( ie income before taxes and public benefits ) . Essentially , it means that taxes should rise as a percentage of market income as market income increases . This commitment to ' progressivity ' is one of the core principles of the ' liberal democratic ' tradition that was forged in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries . <p> The particular measure which is widely advocated on the political left in New Zealand is that New Zealand 's income tax scale should be extended with the inclusion of an additional tax bracket ; something like a tax rate of 40 percent that would kick in at an annual income threshold of about $150,000 . Australia has such a tax bracket , as do many other countries . It would in principle increase the progressivity of New Zealand 's income tax scale ; and New Zealand has one of the least progressive income tax scales among developed liberal democracies . As in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits . While a new income tax like this may enhance democracy , further extensions of the ' taxing the rich more ' concept become democratically ( and otherwise ) problematic . <p> On the matter of the simple adoption of the Universal Income Flat Tax mechanism ( UIFT ) , there is no contest to the argument that this is an extension of democracy . By reimagining the existing progressive tax scale , and filling in the few ' cracks ' so that no adult is economically disadvantaged , this is a wholly desirable democratic reform that enables every economic citizen to receive a weekly public equity dividend ( of $175 ) in exchange for an income tax rate of 33 percent . ( All people earning over $70,000 per year already gain the full $175 weekly benefit ; they can calculate their disposable incomes by reducing their gross weekly incomes by 33% , and then adding $175 . ) <p> ( Note that existing critiques of proposals for a Universal Basic Income are critiques of policies that have substantial differences or add-ons compared to the simple UIFT proposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on financial costs , financial priorities , and labour supply disincentives . Left-wing critiques of these UBI proposals mainly focus on financial priorities , income inadequacy for the most disadvantaged , and the lack of help for people with special needs that exists in some UBI proposals . ) <p> This simple reimagination proposal ( UIFT ; Benefit Z ) has a small financial cost -- the cost of filling the few cracks that inevitably exist in present bureaucratised income support regimes -- and many financial and non-financial benefits . <p> The problem I am concerned about here is that , if either of the other proposals ( Benefits X or Y ) is implemented first then , then the subsequent costs of Benefit Z are raised . Both Benefits X and Y -- on their own -- reflect sup-optimal pathways towards the greater goal of democratic reform . <h> The Young Person Problem <p> Most of the ' cracks ' in the present ' bureaucratic regime ' are people aged 18 to 24 . While a few are in secondary school , most are either in tertiary education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tertiary education , most do not qualify for a student allowance on account of their parents ' incomes . ( Instead they have the option of a nine-month student loan ' living allowance ' . ) Of those in low-waged employment , they get nothing like the unconditional $175 per week that many of their parents receive . <p> This means that the financial cost of the simple UIFT proposal relates mostly to people under 25 years old . <p> The natural age to treat as the age of adulthood at present is 18 , given that it is the age of enfranchisement , and that 18 is the age for which income-tested ' Working for Families ' ' tax credits ' are no longer payable , on children 's behalf , to their parents . <p> By decreasing the age of enfranchisement from 18 to 16 , that would require the UIFT mechanism to displace Working for Families at age 16 instead of at age 18 . All 16 and 17 year-olds would qualify for the larger benefit . Thus , the financial cost of a subsequent UIFT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividends to 16 and 17 year-olds . This in turn increases the chance of the UIFT -- Benefit Z -- being rejected on the grounds of financial cost . <p> It means that it would be better to introduce the UIFT before reducing the age of adulthood to 16 . Once a UIFT ( Benefit Z ) is in place and seen to be neither too expensive nor employment-discouraging , then the later argument for reducing the age of democratic entitlement to 16 should be unproblematic . <p> To get onto the optimum pathway -- the trail to mountain M rather than the trail to hill H -- Benefit Z should come into force before Benefit X. <h> The Progressive Tax Problem <p> In 2020 , it would we simpler and less costly to implement simple UIFT -- Benefit Z -- than in Australia . In Australia , the tax rate would have to be 37 percent ( rather than 33 percent ) , but that 's not the problem . Australian economic citizens would get a public equity dividend of $240 per week , and pay 37 percent tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's top tax rate of 45 percent levied on annual income in excessive of $180,000 . Australia already has Benefit Y. <p> If the 45% tax was to be retained upon introducing UIFT , then Australia would have a two-rate rather than a single-rate tax scale . It would mean that people with declared earnings of more than $180,000 per year would experience a clawback on their public equity dividend . That would be undemocratic -- to deny a rich person a public equity dividend would be as undemocratic as to deny them the vote . Yes , rich people too have rights . <p> The more sensible thing to do in Australia would be to simply wipe the 45% tax rate , as redundant and inefficient . That could be politically unpopular though , especially with voters on the left whose principal policy ethos is to transfer ( redistribute ) money in a targeted way from the rich to the poor . <p> So , if New Zealand introduces , in 2021 , an Australian-style top tax rate , then the pathway to a simple UIFT would be impeded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It means that , if the second-mentioned of the democratic reforms -- Benefit Y -- was introduced first then we would be on Pathway H , climbing the sub-optimal hill rather than the more-optimal mountain . <p> Pathway M -- to the mountain -- is reached with least cost by implementing Benefit Z first ; and X soon after , once any fear of Z has been dispelled . What of Benefit Y ? Well , a natural part of the UIFT mechanism is to raise the tax rate and to raise the public equity dividend , under circumstances that economic productivity is increasing or that the income distribution is too unequal . If we properly understand the definition of progressivity , then it turns out that UIFT gives us an efficient way to achieve Benefit Y. The requirement is that simple UIFT is implemented first , and that its underlying capability to counter inequality is employed . <h> Summary <p> In our eagerness to make small changes that enhance our democracy , we may be encouraged to make small ad hoc reforms that subsequently make the more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So long as we choose to not be blind -- so long as we reject wilful blindness -- we can see both the mountain and the hill which represent socio-economic improvements . If we start climbing the hill rather than the mountain , then the mountain becomes further away and more difficult to reach . That 's why vision is an important decision-making tool , and why we should understand ' vision ' to be ' seeing ' rather than ' believing ' .

That bubbly Kim you always see on screen is exactly how she is when the cameras are off . I did n't pick up any cooking tips from her , no offence Kim , but she definitely attacked the cooking day like a professional and nailed the technical wordy bits better than I did , I need to scrub up !

@@32066237 <h> Government of the Media , by the Media , for The Media . <p> I MUST HAVE MISSED the news bulletin in which the appointment of Jack Tame as People 's Prosecutor was announced . I guess Winston Peters missed it , too . Otherwise , why would he have put himself in the dock on Q+A last Sunday morning ? ( 6/9/20 ) Not that Winston was ever in real trouble , not from " James " -- as the NZ First leader kept calling him . Winston 's been around too long to be seriously discommoded by an ambitious young journalist less than half his age . But , as he angrily told Tame and his producer , he had plenty of other things to be going on with , 40 days out from a general election in which he is fighting for his political life and legacy , than to submit himself to the inquisitorial fury of People 's Prosecutor Tame . <p> Anyone who knows anything about the way current affairs shows like Q+A are put together will share Winston 's outrage . Securing the appearance of a prominent politician on such shows is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely , his or her minders , will want to know what the programme intends to talk to their boss about . And believe me , if they are told that the programme intends to ambush him with a whole series of questions of the " Are you still beating your wife ? " variety , then the show 's producers will be told , very politely , to fuck right off . <p> So , you can bet your bottom dollar that Winston and his minders were n't told anything remotely like that . He 'd made himself available for an interview on the understanding it would mostly be about the tragic loss of the live-cattle-carrier capsized by a typhoon in the East China Sea . He did this believing , perhaps naively , that he was dealing with honest broadcasting professionals , not media bushwhackers . <p> You can also lay down a fairly heavy bet that Tame and his producers talked through the interview with considerable care , deciding exactly when the ugly shift from friendly interviewer Jack , to pitiless inquisitor Jack , would take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been receiving through his earpiece from the control room as the interview unfolded . Were it a case of an interviewer gone rogue , Tame would have been shut down immediately . So , the Tame-Peters interview did n't just happen -- it was organised . <p> Just think about that for a moment . The leader of a political party -- precariously poised on the edge of political oblivion -- is invited to appear on a television programme whose producers ' and host 's intention is to ambush and embarrass him . Not , it is important to note at this point , to question him on evidence gathered by its own journalists , and about which he , having been given fair warning , will be invited to make comment . No , no , no : that would be what honest-to-God professional journalists would do . <p> TDB Recommends NewzEngine.com <p> I 'll never forget my old boss at The Independent Business Weekly , Warren Berryman , drumming it into me that real journalists do n't do ambushes . The subject of a story must always be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's called " fairness " and there was time when TVNZ understood the meaning of the word . <p> Not anymore it would seem . If Tame had anything solid in the way of evidence of Winston 's and NZ First 's wrongdoing , then he and his producers kept it to themselves . All we got to hear was a quick-fire series of questions cleverly constructed to leave their guest with nowhere safe to go . Perhaps , they really did have the goods on Winston , and what they were trying to winkle out of him was a flat denial , which they could then expose as a lie -- as the cameras rolled . Then again , maybe they did n't . <p> Which leaves me -- and I 'm pretty sure a pretty large chunk of the Q+A audience -- wondering what TVNZ 's game is . This is , after all , a public broadcaster . That should mean , at the very least , that the highest possible standards , not just of journalism , but also of common human decency , are drummed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what , they used to be . Back in the days when news and current affairs constituted a sort of holy order , separated and secured from Hunter S Thompson 's " cruel and shallow money trench where pimps and thieves run free and good men die like dogs for no good reason " -- i.e. the rest of the television industry . <p> For what it 's worth , this is what I think their game is . I think it 's about the substitution of the news media ( young journalists in particular ) for the people . And since democracy itself is about " government of the people , by the people , for the people " , what we 're actually looking at is a bunch of journalists who no longer put much faith in democracy . Because , you know , there are so many people out there who are racists , misogynists and homophobes . As such , they should n't really be allowed to govern the country -- should they ? <p> What we 've got is a bunch of journalists who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of government of the media , by the media , for the media . They 're doing it for us -- of course they are -- because , you know , most of us really are n't up to the job of doing it ourselves . <p> Joining a political party , earning the trust and confidence of its members , being selected as a parliamentary candidate , getting elected . It 's all so tedious , so demeaning . Having to listen to ordinary citizens , secure their votes , stay on their good side . So much easier to cast the cloak of the media 's protection over the weak and stupid . So much more satisfying to slay the monsters -- like Winston Peters -- who , these journalists are pretty sure , are cheats and misleaders , live on the people 's airways , or luridly on private-sector newsprint . <p> Because , you must know that if the media does n't take on the role of the People 's Champion ; the People 's Prosecutor ; if charlatans and extremists are n't lured in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically executed ; then there 's every possibility that the people -- idiots that they are -- will re-elect them . <h> 24 COMMENTS <p> Chris this is your best criticism of media we have seen this year good on you ; as we need to ask ' who actually allowed this shambolic assault on a senior politician ' ? <p> Where was the guiding rule of " first use a " no surprises policy " as I clearly remember John Key swiftly made a rule around this policy of " no surprises " in his first year of Government aided by the stealth of Steven Joyce sending our a ' memo ' to all media staff to ' beware of making any negative remarks about Government or risk your job ' so someone now has mounted a political hit o the current Government and this must be investigated . <p> Do you recall the Simon Walker TV interview with Rob Muldoon back in 1976 ?

At least Muldoon did n't start calling Simon , Steve or Shane . <p> Peters could n't possibly care less about the diabolical loss of the livestock ship with almost 6000 cows onboard , most of which were pregnant . He and has party have already condoned the diabolical trade before the wreck , it 's crew and the cows have even been located . The crew had a say and going or not . The cows did n't . <p> It was clear the line of questions to Peters were contrived but that 's irrelevant in my opinion . Had Peters been given advance notice of the questions , he would have had a contrived answer prepared . We are in an election campaign where bullshit , dishonesty and skulduggery are always nearby . I know I 'd much rather have genuine real responses to meaningless , contrived and perfunctory responses . The performance by Peters was by far the worst I 've ever seen of him and it was VERY telling . It reflected extremely badly on him . He 's a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account , all the while escaping the spotlight being turned on his own questionable and at times highly dubious actions and those of his party . The worm has now turned . My only regret is it did n't happen sooner . <p> As an aside . Why would educational institutions be made smoke free ? Do you think such a location has greater significance than the general workplace in terms of being smokefree ? Would politicians who smoke be aware of these important factors ? <p> Yesterday , Winston Peters and Dunedin candidate for NZF Robert Griffith stood right in front of a NO SMOKING sign and ...... SMOKED . What a far king diabolical act of arrogance . <p> The clip is very telling . Ignore for a moment the actions of our Deputy PM for a moment who is expected to lead and set an example to at least his own party members . <p> Concentrate on the actions of Robert Griffith . He is clearly holding a cigarette in his left hand and flicking it . He becomes aware he is being filmed smoking at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look what he does next . He attempts to conceal his left hand behind his back while he transfers the cigarette into his out of view right hand . While doing this he is obviously telling Peters they have been sprung . This is not only a glaring example of NZF arrogance . It 's also yet another pitiful example of their transparency by attempting to hide the fact it 's even happening . This has become the epitome of NZF in recent years . <p> " Peters could n't possibly care less about the diabolical loss of the livestock ship with almost 6000 cows onboard , most of which were pregnant .

Myself , I hear it every morning now on Radio New Zealand and wince inwardly . The bias towards one interviewee over another is now detected by the microsecond pauses in the relentless questions , a slower delivery allows the subject more response time , an easier ride . National leaders from Bridges to Muller and Collins get this more often than the PM does imo . And the increasingly on the nose " sorry to interrupt Minister ...

MSM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; not good here when mainly only OAP 's -- Peter 's fans -- listen to or watch them , but often just for the company anyway -- and this age group wo n't budge in their loyalty . They think Peters is the only politician who cares about them . <p> I remember the Walker / Muldoon interview well as a young fella who enjoyed that sort of thing . <p> My only regret is that it was ended just as piggy started to lose the plot . So many interviews are cut short in similar circumstances siting they had run out of time . I would love to see any politician throwing a tantrum as that act alone shows viewers more than anything that was said in the interview . I recall then Deputy PM Bob Tizard losing it in an interview . I think it was with Paul Holmes . Tizard ended up ripping his mic off and storming off the set . I recall Holmes saying to him " this does not loog good " . On another occasion Tizard knocked a female journalists mic away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

He knows in his heart of hearts that the Winston First Party is dead in the water . He knows his legacy is on it 's way to the nearest landfill and he will blame anybody and everybody for that . Everyone of course except himself . <p> Brilliant article Mr Trotter . Nice to see you not following the baying hound critics thirsting for Winston 's blood . <p> Tame put himself in the same category as Hoskings ( who should be old enough to know better ) in not knowing the difference between an interrogation and an interview and was justly reprimanded by Peters . Actually I thought Peters was a bit rough on James ... sorry Jack . <p> The self -important attempts to ' ambush ' Peters by Tame were a bit more obnoxious than Tovah 's simplistic ' gotcha ' techniques . <p> I felt that Peters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ?

However on this occasion , to my surprise , I sympathised with him . <p> I thought Tame was insufferable as the " advocate " for the People . He was smug and arrogant . Despite Peter 's protestations , which he ignored , he persisted in asking questions that Peter 's was not prepped for , justifying this with statements along the lines that " the People have a right to know . " I have not conferred on Tane the right to ' prosecute ' Peter 's or anyone else for that matter on my behalf . <p> I asked my self whether Tane would take the same approach with Jacinda .

@@32068230 <h> Simplicity key to successful goat farming <p> Garrick Batten says it is important for farmers to remember that goats are not sheep . <p> Garrick Batten on why there should be more farmed goats . <p> One answer to why there are not more farmed goats is that modern commercial management can change attitudes to goats from hate to tolerance to love . <p> NZ leads the world in our pastoral systems and pastoral goat farming is now a long way from the small flocks and associated control , feet and worm problems of the 1980s . Garrick Batten explains . <p> The key message is to keep it simple . <p> Use goats ' intelligence , adaptability and complementarity and accept the need to acquire new knowledge . <p> Remember goats are not sheep . <p> Use a low goat stocking rate , specific feeding to suit the farm situation and goat objective -- as well as specific techniques for weed control and meat production .

They eat pasture from the top down with intake and production falling as height decreases below 7cm . Goats can eat 15 more plant species than sheep and prefer daily variety and range over distances , while trying to avoid soiled and damaged pasture . <p> Goats can be simple to feed so simple systems can be used , and initially the proportion to other stock will be low . The choices are to either spread them out over as big an area as possible or graze ahead of other stock on rotation with frequent shifts . KPI for a breeding herd is percentage of kids weaned -- therefore special management may be needed around kidding time . <p> Higher pasture heights reduce worm intake to even eliminate drenching . Well-fed goats have minimal health problems . Foot problems have been reduced with suitable genetics such as Kikonui ? developed especially for hill country . <p> It is far easier and cheaper to goat proof a large block of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can learn gateways , water sources , camping sites and mustering routes .

However , they will not need much under simple systems . <p> * Garrick Batten is a commercial goat farming expert and published author .

@@32084239 <h> Te Wiki o te Reo and the election : Comparing te reo Maori policies <p> Te reo Maori is a taonga and the government of this country is compelled under the Treaty of Waitangi to protect it . So how do the campaign policies our political parties stack up ? <p> In 1985 , the Waitangi Tribunal report on the Wai 11 , te reo claim , found that article two of the Treaty of Waitangi obliged the Crown " to recognise and protect the Maori language " . It also said the Crown had failed to protect the Maori language . <p> As a result of those findings , and many decades of activism and agitation by Maori advocates , te reo Maori was made an " official " language of New Zealand in 1987 and an accepted language in our courts of law ( albeit with the added step of having to fill out a " notice of intention to speak Maori " ) and schools . There are 306 Maori medium schools and 450 kohanga reo in Aotearoa but te reo Maori remains an optional subject in the mainstream school system . <p> This week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month away from the general election . It 's the one week of the year agencies , professional services , media and government pay particular attention to the reo , so what are our leaders doing to protect this taonga today ? <p> Unsurprisingly , the Maori Party has the most comprehensive policy , which includes officially changing the country 's name to Aotearoa . It also wants all Pakeha place names to be replaced with their original names by 2026 . <p> The party would invest $50 million into the establishment of a Maori Standards Authority -- an independent entity whose role would be to audit public service departments against cultural competency standards , including the monitoring and auditing of language plans . It 'd double funding to Te Matawai , the organisation charged with the revitalisation of te reo Maori , to $28 million , and invest $40 million for early childhood to secondary school teachers to develop their reo , and invest $20 million into the development of te reo Maori resources ( for comparison , that 's less than half of what the government has spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Maori Party co-leader Debbie Ngarewa Packer says the majority of tamariki Maori are in mainstream education and many are n't able to learn their own reo .

Cooper , who was confined to a wheelchair with muscular dystrophy , is shown sitting at a desk studying , his textbooks laid out in front of him . A small 35cm black and white television to the side . <p> For Peg Ellis , who lived with her parents in Otahuhu , the move was more daunting . <p> " I 'm really pulled two ways between my home and my independence , " she told the paper . <p> " But I 'm getting older now and wo n't always have my parents , so I decided to make a break , " she said . <p> Working four days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated she 'd have to get up at 6am every day . <p> " Tying my shoes and doing my hair are a bit of a problem , but I 'm hoping to overcome that , " she said . <p> Cooper and Ellis were two of 18 applicants selected from a pool of 67 , aged between 18 and 40 , who were partly dependent . The first building was intentionally designed to be a home and not a hospital or institution . <p> Each unit had a bed and a bathroom containing a toilet and shower . They either had carpet or cork tiles on the floor - according to the residents ' needs . A glass frontage gave both a view and light . Occupational therapists assessed every resident , and their unit was adjusted to meet their individual needs . For Cooper , that meant changing the height of his bed and bookshelves . <p> " Some people will spend the rest of their days accommodated at 224 Great South Road . In this home anyway , it is the trustee 's intention to provide as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person would have in their own home , " a report from the trust says . <p> The opening of the homes was a big event , and drew between 300 and 400 people to the Greenlane site , between the Great South Road and the southern motorway . <h> A vast need identified <p> Although it bears the name of the wife of the then-Governor General Sir Bernard Fergusson , the trust was a collaboration of community organisations and individuals that began some years earlier . <p> In 1966 , an enthusiastic group of representatives from charitable organisations including the Crippled Children 's Society , the Spastic Fellowship of New Zealand , churches , Rotary and a group of ladies , headed by Mrs T.H.C ( Mary ) Caughey , Lady Fisher and a Mrs W.E Henley , met to discuss the lack of accommodation for disabled adults . <p> To ensure there was no duplication of services , a fact-finding survey was organised by the Auckland Hospital Board 's superintendent of Medical Social Services Dr Lopdell . A total of 1083 responses were received from across the Auckland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about 630,000 . <p> The survey questioned people about their condition , their level of mobility , the extent to which they could live in the community and their employment status .

It identified 25 disabled people in urgent need of accommodation and estimated this would grow to 100 in five years , and 500 in 10 to 15 years . <p> It was decided the best way to address this was through a trust , whose primary objective was ; " to assist disabled persons in the solution of their residential problems . " The emphasis was on integration of the disabled into the local community , not an inward-looking , self-contained community . <p> And it was clear , " this is not just another charitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trust on the understanding it would be nationally focused . <p> The Wellington and Christchurch branches , which subsequently opened , are independent and unrelated to the Auckland operation . <p> The patron wanted to address two problems ; the number of disabled people living in psychiatric and geriatric facilities , simply because there was n't anywhere else to go . And she had a special message to parents of disabled children - the trust would safeguard these children 's future so that they would be cared for when the parents were no longer able to . <p> The units were funded by residents ' fees and voluntary contributions administered by the trust . <h> A community united and a Herculean task <p> Documents show the cost of setting up these homes for between 25 to 30 residents was about ? 60,000 ( $2.5 million in today 's currency ) .

Meeting minutes , accounts and various reports , produced on old-fashioned typewriters backed with carbon paper , show the hours of effort , time and money that went into establishing and running the trust . <p> So much that it could arguably be considered an Auckland institution . <p> The genesis lay in the powerful Ladies Auxiliary . Started in 1965 by Mary Caughey and Laura Fergusson , it supported discussions between hospital boards and social service groups . <p> In 1967 , the year the trust formed , the Ladies Auxiliary raised $62,000 ( about $1.1m in today 's terms ) . <p> Lady Fergusson lent her name to the Trust on the understanding it would be nationally focused .

It probably just does n't meet the new rules on banking . " <p> It just means they were paying interest of $200,000 to 300,000 a year , he said . <p> Since the announcement that the site is closing , Lane has met with O'Brien and his fellow board member Richard Glenn , and was keen to impress upon him the possible alternatives to continue running the site . <p> This included talking to the Caughey family about lessons that could be learnt from the recent sale of the site of the former Caughey Preston rest home in Remuera . <p> And he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land and transferring the operation to a well-proven provider like Southern Cross or a district health board . <p> He said the chairman listened , but was non-committal . <p> Meanwhile , the trust 's Rob Small told RNZ its requests for financial help fell on deaf ears . <p> " We have consistently asked the government to provide more funds for some of these services , and in some cases we have n't taken some clients , because we knew it would be unprofitable . " <p> Yet the ministry denies it ever received a request for additional funding . Subsequent OIA requests show neither the ministry nor the associate Minister of Health , Jenny Salesa , recorded any requests from Laura Fergusson Rehabilitation seeking financial help . <p> O'Brien , the chair , has refused to speak publicly since the closure was announced and none have revealed their future plans for the site . <h> Is an ongoing service possible , or will it be lost ? <p> Denis Lane warns selling the site would be irreversible .

" Many stores have also announced unprecedented closures on Thanksgiving Day . <h> Make your own informed decision . <p> Though Thanksgiving will probably look a bit different this year , it 's still an important time for families to make memories together . Sharon Nachman , division chief for Pediatric Infectious Diseases at Stony Brook Children 's Hospital , says making the decision to host and committing to doing it safely is important . You should give yourself enough time to think about how many people you can host , what you 'll make , and how you 'll serve it , as well as what people will do after dinner . That 's on top of your typical holiday stress . <p> " I think the right answer as a start should be great , we can accomplish this . We need to do this .

If you 're hosting , encourage anyone coming to do the same , and try to get a sense of what precautions they 've been taking . <p> " So essentially you want sort of a good idea of if everyone is being careful before you start your event , " Nachman said . " The last thing you want to do is have someone that 's completely not careful mixing with someone who 's incredibly careful because they have to be .

The same goes for spacing people out if you have the room to do so . <h> Keep things small . <p> View photos <p> Photo credit : Deagreez - Getty Images <p> In normal years , opening your home to anyone who wants to attend is one of the kindest thing you can do .

Maybe this is a good time to implement a kids table if you do n't already have one , seat higher-risk and older people in spots where they can more easily keep a distance , and/or seat people in close proximity to the people they live with . Think about your space and what makes the most sense for you and your guests . <p> Dr. Nachman again suggests altering your serving style by plating everyone 's meals for them or by serving things that are more individual , such as handpies . That said , that does n't mean you ca n't do things like dish out leftovers like you normally would . <h> Think about what the rest of your holiday looks like . <p> As much as we love to focus on the food , your holiday weekend might typically consist of things like shopping , football games , and family visits -- maybe even overnight .

" If they 're eating and then leaving right afterwards , that 's one set of things to think about and one set of planned events . Then if they 're sleeping over you need to think about well , who 's sleeping where ? Are you sanitizing the surfaces ? What are you doing about that ?

Despite many parties putting up a candidate -- this year there are eight contenders - the battle is traditionally between the Labour and National candidates . <p> National MP Jonathan Young takes time out to talk about the Creative Accelerator programme , which he is championing as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which includes Waitara , Bell Block and Oakura , in 2008 , toppling long-standing representative Harry Duynhoven , of Labour , by 105 votes . <p> He was elected at the same time John Key became Prime Minister , with National sweeping to power to end Labour 's previous nine years in Government . <p> Young , now 62 , has secured the seat in each general election since , seeing off his nearest rival , coming in the form of the Labour candidate , every time . <p> In 2011 and 2014 , he beat Andrew Little , who is now a senior Labour figure who carried hefty ministerial portfolios during the past term . <p> ANDY JACKSON/Stuff <p> New Plymouth candidate Glen Bennett has pitched himself as a new face for the city . <p> Three years later , Young took the seat again , this time winning over Labour 's Corie Haddock by about 8000 votes . <p> For the past nine years , National has won the lion 's share of the party vote in the New Plymouth electorate , although 2017 was the closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a gap of about 14 per cent . <p> Two nationwide polls released in the past week put Labour ahead of National by , on average , about 17 per cent . <p> When considering Young and Bennett 's fortunes on those figures , it would likely result in the National incumbent getting into Parliament , regardless of whether he wins the seat , due to his party ranking of 22 . <p> ANDY JACKSON/Stuff <p> Current New Plymouth MP and National Party candidate Jonathan Young has served the electorate for 12 years and wants another term . <p> Bennett would miss out on a list spot , with the political newbie ranked 72 , so his sole pathway to power is getting more votes than Young . <p> The challenge is not lost on the 44-year-old , but his confidence to do just that is high . <p> Born in Wellington and raised in the Salvation Army church , Bennett has lived in New Plymouth for two decades and has deep connections in the community , where he has worked as a facilitator , celebrant and a long-term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local body politics , but says making decisions about rates and rubbish for district residents would have not cut it for him . <p> Shaping policy and having a direct say in decisions for the entire country is what appeals to him about becoming a politician . <p> ANDY JACKSON/Stuff <p> Labour candidate Glen Bennett has his patter down in terms of the candidates ' debates . <p> Following him around on the campaign trail recently , he admits selling himself to people as a means to get their vote is out of his comfort zone . <p> He does n't even like the concept of calling the election a contest , but while he would be disappointed to lose , he has higher ambitions than that too . <p> He would not see his campaign as a failure if the voting turnout figures improved . <p> In the New Plymouth electorate , voter turnout in 2014 sat at 78 per cent while it bumped up to 81 per cent three years later . <p> The median age of eligible voters in the city sits at 40 . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change in the ways we come together and talk about meaty issues of the day . <p> Young says choosing to leave behind a teaching career and 22 years as a pastor in a Pentecostal church for a life in politics would have had his late father turning in his grave , out of surprise more than anything . <p> He says his father Venn Young , who was a National MP for 24 years , would have never picked him out of his sibling group to follow his footsteps into Parliament . <p> But during his 12 years in the role , Young has earned his political stripes by being a steady hand , a reliable MP for constituents to call on and someone who has toed the party line and steered clear of any major scandal . <p> The biggest scrape he 's been embroiled in came about when he was a newly minted MP in 2008 and was quoted as saying being gay was a choice . <p> However , Young is at a point now where he is helping develop party policy , has spokesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contender for a cabinet responsibility if National won power on October 17 . <p> Stuff <p> Advance voting in the 2020 general election runs between October 3-16 . <p> And if Young won the seat , and his party colleagues Barbara Kuriger and Harete Hipango are successful in their re-election bids , in Taranaki-King Country and Whanganui respectively , the trio could be a power block in terms of providing a united voice around issues which impact the region . <p> The two top contenders for the New Plymouth seat are Labour 's Glen Bennett and National 's Jonathan Young . <p> Meanwhile , the Labour party presence has been much less obvious in the city . <p> Andrew Little , who has personal ties to New Plymouth , has been a regular visitor in town , supporting Bennett and other Labour candidates standing in the region , but there has been a notable absence of others . <p> So for the most part Bennett has had to implement part of his election strategy , to build his public profile , on his own . <p> His billboards are everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Plymouth seat as part of his bid to reach the widest range of people possible . <p> He wants to talk to as many people as possible in order to get a sense of what matters to them . <p> During one day out campaigning recently , he visited Marfell Community School , two small business owners , met with professionals working in the energy sector and had a tour of building sites belonging to Pepper Construction . <p> One of the people Bennett met while out campaigning was Billow Bakery owner Jeff Fong . <p> Thankful for the wage subsidy , which was launched to combat with economic impacts of Covid-19 , Fong , a small business owner and new father , is worried about what 's still to come . <p> Fong says his vote will be influenced by two things -- what is best for his business and what aligns to his personal values and beliefs . <p> ANDY JACKSON/Stuff <p> Glen Bennett , who wants to win the New Plymouth seat at this year 's election , takes time for a coffee and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while on the campaign trail . <p> The role a well-liked political party plays in general voting behaviour also ca n't be dismissed . <p> When Young took the seat from Labour in 2008 , it was potentially carried by the momentum his party was taking into the election , and what marked the start of the John Key era , who enjoyed enduring popularity as Prime Minister with the public . 
@@32134236 <p> Report author Briar Lipson , a former British maths teacher who helped set up two charitable low-decile primary schools in London , says encouraging children to choose what they want to learn entrenches the differences that children start school with . <p> " It 's too much of a lottery , " she says . <p> " Students of unabridged Shakespeare are judged equally to those who study the lyrics of ' more relevant ' artists like Tupac or David Bowie . <p> " Such deference to relevance explains why the NZ Curriculum exacerbates variations between classrooms and schools . Rather than having a narrowing effect , it intensifies inequity . " <p> Lipson says New Zealand 's educational outcomes have declined in parallel with the rise of child-led learning . <p> International surveys show NZ 10-year-olds ' reading levels fell in 2016 to their lowest since the surveys started , and our 15-year-olds ' reading and maths levels declined in every survey between 2000 and 2018 . <p> In science , the 15-year-olds ' scores were stable up to 2012 but plunged in 2015 and 2018 . <p> " In reading and science , the average student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms ' worth of schooling , " Lipson writes . <p> " The drop was even worse in mathematics , where students lost the equivalent of nearly a year and a half 's worth of schooling . " <p> In contrast , Lipson says , England adopted a much more detailed curriculum in 2014 and international assessment scores were already improving . <p> Until the 1990s , New Zealand had a detailed syllabus prescribing what children had to learn in every subject . <p> But that changed to a much looser framework in 1993 and an even looser one in 2007 . <p> In social studies , for example , children in senior primary school are now expected to " understand how people view and use places differently " , as well as a more specific " understand how early Polynesian and British migrations to New Zealand have continuing significance for tangata whenua and communities " . <p> Children are expected to learn these often-vague topics through their own " inquiry " . <p> " Children might use the internet to research a topic , then report their findings to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this approach may work for children who already know something about the topic , but not for those who do n't know where to start .

Let 's also confirm that the new Jeep Gladiator is a truck , not a ute . <p> First impressions -- it 's big ! Not RAM 2500 big . However , at 5.6 metres long , it 's 300mm longer than a Ford Ranger . Its 3090mm wheelbase is also 300mm longer than that of a Hilux . This latter point has the effect of putting the load tray behind the centre line of the rear axle , which in turns promotes better weight distribution and a less choppy ride . <p> Based around the Jeep Wrangler JL , but with a 787mm longer frame and a 492mm longer wheelbase , the Rubicon-spec machine we lived with for a week certainly grew on you .

This pushes out 209kW power and 346Nm torque , and in turn is mated to a ZF-sourced 8-speed automatic transmission . It is responsive , delightfully smooth and best left to its own devices . Two versions are available , the well specified Overland and the upgraded Rubicon that was our red steed . Overland gets Jeep 's Selec-Trac Active On-Demand 4x4 system , 18-inch alloys , keyless entry and a removable hard top roof .

In addition , Tru-Lok front and rear locking differentials keep things moving and a front sway bar disconnect function keeps the wheels planted to terra firma . <p> With tough stuff in mind , 2-inch Fox dampers are fitted fore and aft , while a forward-facing trail camera gives a view of the terrain ahead . <p> During our week with the Gladiator , its size is quickly forgotten -- although not in the case of the domestic manager , who refused to climb up into the cab .

We have an inherent desire to have a companion as love is the most basic human need , " she says . <p> " A great example of how we see this is the movie Castaway , where Tom Hanks is the main character and he 's completely isolated on an island until he finds a volley ball , draws a face on it and names him Wilson , then Wilson goes everywhere with him . <p> " That 's quite the example that if you isolate us it 's going to drive us a bit crazy -- we really need that companion . " <p> Healthy relationships involving , parents , siblings , children , friends and colleagues have a bearing on our well being , but intimate relationships are central . <p> She says research shows the effects of intimate relationships are more beneficial to yourself and others . <p> " You have societal benefits . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being convicted of crimes . When they enter stable , committed relationships they are actually much less likely to commit crimes in the future , because the partner helps them confirm to social norms and follow rules . <p> " You also have reduced drug use . So , people who dealt in cocaine , when they enter stable committed relationships , the cocaine use drops dramatically and so you have reduced drug-related incidences and reduced burden on the healthcare system . " <p> In terms of finance , being in a stable relationship has a significant impact . Statistics show New Zealand poverty rates for single parent households are 62 percent . <p> " That 's so much higher from children in two-parent households , being at 15 percent . " <p> Tan says the research however does n't suggest you have to be in a relationship to be happier , but shows on a population level that coupled people are generally happier than singletons . <p> " But if you are in a toxic or unstable relationship that 's detrimental to everyone and there 's research that shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were arguing all the time and the children are actually happier when they 're separated . " <p> The physical impacts of a relationship on the body can be scientifically measured , she says . <p> Levels of the stress hormone cortisol can go down . Other research , she says , shows married people are three times more likely to survive a heart surgery than if you are single . Healthy relationships , which bring less anger and more conflict resolution reduce stress-related illnesses , inflammation and bring better overall immunity in the body . <p> Mental health is better too . A study where couples look in each other 's eyes for a period showed this activated parts of the brain associated with positive feelings , happiness and empathy . It also deactivated brain regions associated with negative emotions and sadness . <p> Maximising the health of your existing relationship can be as easy as saying thank you .

" <p> For singletons looking to tap into the benefits of a getting a healthy relationship , Tan says a relationship will not make you happy . You need to first be happy within yourself to attract a partner to share mutual happiness with . <p> " It should n't be the reverse , looking for a health relationship to make you happy .

There seems to be a sense abroad that people are ready to move on from the intensity that has typified politics this year . <p> When Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern followed former Prime Minister Sir John Key 's footsteps and announced the election date in February , neither she nor the country could have imagined the circumstances that were about to unfold as a result of the arrival of Covid-19 . <p> Rather , the political situation at the time was starting to look like we were in for New Zealand 's first one-term government since 1972-75 . That quickly evaporated as the government 's response to the pandemic took hold . <p> Political Rulebook rewritten <p> Soon , Covid-19 was dominating every aspect of our lives . <p> It even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date having to be deferred a further four weeks because of the Auckland outbreak in August .

Indeed , the harder the Opposition tried to criticise and draw attention to the government 's failings , the more popular the government became . <p> But now , most people just want to get the election over and done with , as the record number of those opting to cast their votes early suggests . The bizarre run of events this year seems so protracted and inexorable that it is no surprise people seem very keen to put 2020 behind them , and to start afresh on what will hopefully be a better year in 2021 . <p> However , while politics has run its course for many of us this year , there is still the ritual of election day to go through before we can settle down for the rest of the weekend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard , it is time to spare a thought for the candidates and Party workers across the board who have worked so hard in recent months to get their respective Party messages across , as they seek public support for their parties .

For some , it will be the culminating relief of having made it ; for others it will be the unexpected delight of having succeeded against the odds . For all , though , there will be the relief of the campaign being over , bringing with it the chance to return to a steadier pace of life . <p> And then there will be those for whom the outcome will be one of intense disappointment . <p> Demonstration of friendship <p> They may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would , or seasoned politicians having to come grips with the reality of being tossed aside unceremoniously and perhaps unexpectedly by the electorate , and their political careers , however long or brief , distinguished or not , now being at an end . <p> They will be alongside others whose expectations were much more realistically modest from the outset , and for whom the experience will have either whetted their appetites for next time , or simply turned them off politics altogether . <p> All of them will have been supported by a swathe of loyal volunteers who week in and out for months now have been trudging the streets , stuffing pamphlets in letterboxes , or knocking on doors to drum up support , and more recently checking that election billboards were not being damaged by either vandals or the weather . <p> They do this because of their commitment to their respective candidates and party 's ideals , at the expense of their own time . Even in the era of electronic communication and social media the system relies on their commitment probably more than ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or what we think of them or their policies , all these candidates and volunteers deserve our respect and gratitude for their tireless efforts to make our democracy effective .

The extraordinary collection of furniture , paintings , military memorabilia and artefacts housed in the homestead was amassed by Joseph Nichols , his mother Mary and his brothers Walter ( known as Harry ) and Cyril , all enthusiastic and eclectic collectors through the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . <p> Rooms are furnished just as they were when Joseph Nichols died in 1954 , with important antiquities , curios , paintings and a library of books that date back to 1471 .

But take your photos and eat up quickly , because Waitaki has a lot to discover . <h> Advertisement <h> The main town <p> Oamaru is a small town full of character , and characters .

Here you 'll find Nicol 's Blacksmith , a smithy named after Duntroon 's last working blacksmith , Nicol Muirden . Muirden retired in the 1960s , and the smithy lay empty for years .

@@32172239 <h> Siouxsie Wiles &amp; Toby Morris : Covid-19 and the Swiss cheese system <p> The effort to defeat the coronavirus relies on many layers of defence . Or , let 's call them , slices of cheese . <p> One thing that has really irked me during Covid-19 has been the labelling of any mistake in our systems or any unexpected transmission of the virus as a failure . Yes , I understand that the media and the opposition have a responsibility to hold the government and our public services to account , but screaming FAILURE from the rooftops has everyone looking for someone to blame and massively undermines public trust in New Zealand 's pandemic response . It 's also completely out of all proportion . If you want to see failure , look to countries like the US or the UK . Identifying mistakes or holes in our response is really important as it allows us to learn and adapt our processes , something that has been key to New Zealand 's success in managing Covid-19 so far . <p> Twenty years ago , James Reason , a professor of psychology at the University of Manchester in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Journal in which he described what he called the " Swiss cheese model of system accidents " . Reason was trying to move people 's thinking from treating mistakes as individual errors by " bad " people to a systems approach that accepts that humans are fallible and mistakes are to be expected . Rather than blaming individuals for failure , we should try to understand how and why the failure happened to prevent it from happening again . <p> But what has Swiss cheese got to do with all this ? <p> The idea behind the systems approach is to build in layers of barriers and safeguards . In an ideal world , each of these defensive layers would be impenetrable . But in the real world , they are n't . So Reason likened each layer to a slice of Swiss cheese -- it has holes in it . To be fair to the Swiss , they have lots of different cheeses , many of which do n't have holes , so it 's probably more accurate to call Reason 's model the " Emmental Model " . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many reasons . Slips , fumbles , mistakes . People not following procedure . Or they can even be built into the system . A hole in one layer of defence is n't necessarily a disaster if there are lots of other layers to fall back on . Then its only when all the holes line up that the defences are breached . Reason 's model is now used all over the place including in medicine , engineering , and the aviation industry . <h> Applying the Swiss Cheese/Emmental Model to Covid-19 <p> I 've seen several excellent applications of the Swiss Cheese/Emmental Model to Covid-19 , like this one by virologist Ian Mackay or this one by sketchplanations . They represent each of the different public health interventions we have for Covid-19 as layers of cheese . I love how they show that we actually have quite a few defences against Covid-19 but that none of them is impenetrable . <p> We have the use of border controls and putting travellers into isolation/quarantine to stop the importation of cases into a country or between regions . We also have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and isolation of infectious people and their close contacts . This test-trace-isolate strategy can be used very effectively to stop the spread of the virus . Then there 's limitations on gathering sizes or the movement of people , or on high-risk activities or places . <p> We also have all the things we can do as individuals . Things like physical distancing , washing our hands , practising safe cough and sneeze hygiene , wearing a mask , using contact tracing apps to keep a track of where we 've been and who with , staying home when sick , and getting tested if we have symptoms . And , finally , there 's cleaning and ventilation . Hopefully we 'll be adding vaccination next year . <h> New Zealand 's swiss cheese/Emmental model for managing Covid-19 <p> Around the world , countries are applying different layers of cheese depending on the strategy they are following to deal with the pandemic . Herd immunity ? What cheese ? Flatten the curve ? Some slices . Elimination ? All the cheese ! <p> Here in New Zealand , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first slice of cheese , along with physical distancing , handwashing , and cleaning . It was soon clear these were n't going to be enough and the virus was way ahead of us . That 's when the alert levels were brought in , a framework of escalating restrictions on movement and activities . <p> A good way of thinking about the different alert levels is as slices of cheese with fewer and fewer holes as you move from level one to level four . We soon applied the slice with the fewest holes , backed up by managed isolation and quarantine of travellers as well as physical distancing , handwashing , and cleaning . That minimised importation of the virus into the country , and massively restricted community transmission of the virus . It also bought us time to ramp up the country 's testing and contact tracing capabilities , including the development of an app . <p> Applying all those slices of cheese got us to elimination . But then one by one we started stripping back the layers as we became more and more complacent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and managed isolation and quarantine . Those slices have worked fantastically well , but we know they are n't impenetrable . <p> Fast forward to August , when someone in the community with no links to the border tested positive for Covid-19 . Quickly many of the slices of cheese we 'd used before were applied , as well as a new one , masks . And they worked , again . We 're back to no cases of Covid-19 in the community . It 's looking like we 've eliminated the virus again . <h> Elimination is something we have to keep working at <p> As long as people continue arriving in New Zealand from countries with widespread community transmission of Covid-19 , we 're going to need to keep working at elimination . Because our systems are so good now , we are able to track rare transmission events in ways other countries can only dream of . We 've had what seems to be transmission in managed isolation from a bin lid and a lift button . Then we 've just had the port worker who picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 've had several new arrivals in Christchurch test positive in managed isolation at their routine day three test . They are from a large group of workers from Russia and Ukraine who have recently flown to New Zealand on a charter flight to take up jobs on fishing boats . They all tested negative before flying . The first thing this highlights , yet again , is that just because people test negative before they board a flight does n't mean they are n't a risk . They could have taken an unreliable test , or could be incubating the virus , or could have become infected on the journey . It 's just more evidence for why our border controls and managed isolation and quarantine facilities need to stay in place . And why we need to keep using all the slices of Emmental at our disposal . <h> No room for complacency <p> I 'm noticing that complacency is starting to creep back in again . The number of people using the contact tracing app is dropping , just like it did before our second outbreak in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep up with washing our hands , practising safe cough and sneeze hygiene , wearing a mask , using the contact tracing app , staying home when sick , and getting tested if we have symptoms . That way , if the virus does get through our managed isolation and quarantine system , we 're far less likely to need to move up the alert levels to stamp it out again . Instead we can use testing , contact tracing , and isolation . <p> We 're in this for the long haul , and it 's up to all of us to play our part . <p> The Spinoff is subject to NZ Press Council procedures .

In today 's edition : System springs into action on Port Covid case , Labour opens up initial talks with Greens , and New Zealand travellers creating headaches for Aussie states . <p> A clarification on the new case of Covid-19 announced on Sunday -- it was not in fact a case of community transmission . Rather , it was a case in the community related to the border . For more details , read The Spinoff 's live updates from yesterday . The man who tested positive is a shipworker , and according to Dr Ashley Bloomfied , " we believe the most likely source of the man 's infection is a ship that he worked on in Auckland on the 12th and 13th of October , the Sofrana Surville , which had travelled from Brisbane to Tauranga and then on to Auckland , where eight crew joined from the Philippines . " Widespread contact tracing and testing is now underway . <p> A different ship with those close contacts is now the subject of some controversy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napier Port does not want it to dock as previously scheduled , to manage the risk of any possible cases spreading . Newsroom has a story on what is unfolding , with the option of either sending the boat back to Auckland , or having public health officials fly out via helicopter to conduct the required tests . Because of the close quarters nature of ship life , it 's potentially quite a dangerous situation if anyone does actually have the virus , though to reiterate , nobody on board is as yet displaying symptoms . <p> It appears there is something of a gap in testing , which the ministry is now looking to fix . Radio NZ reports ship crews in transit are n't routinely tested , which Auckland University public health expert Collin Tukuitonga said shows there are still holes Covid can get in through . " Even if you contain these people coming in from overseas , but obviously there 's potential interaction with people either on the ship or on the wharf , that 's why I would 've thought that testing would be mandatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been picked up at the Port of Tauranga , reports Business Desk ( paywalled . ) Port CEO Mark Cairns said that if it did in fact turn out to be a positive case , that 's a sign that the testing system is working as intended .

Stuff reports it was more of a chat than a negotiation , and after all there 's not an awful lot of room for the Greens to make demands .

" And for more on what 's happening within National , I highly recommend this piece from The Spinoff 's Justin Latif , who has covered speculation that National Party president Peter Goodfellow could also find his position under threat . <p> And finally , there were some quite poignant comments about the uncertainty of political life from an MP who once again faces the chop . Maureen Pugh told Checkpoint that as the last National MP on the list , she 's once again expecting to lose her seat on the special votes . And yet she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Gerry Brownlee resigns .

New Zealanders are allowed to travel without quarantine into New South Wales and Northern Territory , but after getting there dozens have slipped into other states , where many are now having to quarantine . An important bit of context here -- Australian pandemic management is largely taking place at a state level , so the rules in one place will be very different to the rules in another . The mayor of Adelaide , for example , told Checkpoint last night that the advice for any New Zealanders thinking of going there was very simple right now -- " please do n't " . <p> It has n't really been marked properly in the Bulletin yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exited parliament .

@@32174234 <h> This new study suggests who is most at risk of ' long Covid ' <p> When news of a virus began to percolate this January , the consensus was this : symptoms are flu-like . Most people , save for the elderly and those with pre-existing health conditions , experience a pretty mild illness . The effects of this generally taper off before a fortnight has passed . <p> For a little but profoundly impacted group , though , this simply is not the case . <p> As months have passed since the contagion first arrived , awareness has been increasing about ' long Covid . ' Here , people who contracted a version of the virus -- one that was not severe enough to require time in an ICU bed -- see the two-week line flash by and then zip into the distance . <p> They can be left with life-changing things like debilitating fatigue that leaves them unable to care for children or work , chest pains , strange heartbeat patterns or constant headaches . The mental challenge is profound : trying to live alongside a gnawing concern , one that has taken deep roots somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that might have caused irrevocable damage . <p> Yesterday , experts released fresh data which suggests some new findings with regards to this community . Dr Claire Steves and Prof Tim Spector at King 's College London have been running the Covid Symptom Study -- a project which collects data from an associated app , and into which people with Covid symptoms can track how they are doing -- since late March . According to analysis from 4,182 participants , one in 20 of those infected become ' Covid long-haulers , ' with symptoms stretching past eight weeks . <p> These people were tested for the virus , to ensure that they were confirmed cases . <p> To note : this study has been released as a pre-print , and , as such , has not been peer-reviewed , yet . <h> How long does ' long Covid ' last ? <p> ' Long Covid ' does n't have hard definition right now . ( One is to be announced by NICE by the end of October . ) The Covid Symptom Study research focused on those who had symptoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 20 people . ) While some see the illness appear to breathe its last around then , over one in 50 , per the study , see symptoms that persist after 12 weeks . A small section of people are reporting symptoms stretching on past the six-month mark . <h> Who is most likely to get ' long Covid ' ? <p> The data implies that you can roughly ' predict ' who will go on to be plagued with issues . The academics note that diverse and numerous symptoms indicate a greater chance , as does your age ( older people are " much more likely " to develop this form of the illness , with 10 per cent of 18-49 year olds affected , versus 22 per cent of over 70s ) . <p> Your weight is also a factor ( people who develop ' long Covid ' appear to have higher average BMIs than those with ' short Covid ' ) , as does your sex . Men are more frequently admitted to hospital with Covid , note the experts , but women suffer extended symptoms in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compared with 14.5 per cent of the latter . ) The researcher 's data indicates that having asthma also means you 're more likely to develop ' long Covid . ' <h> What does ' long Covid ' feel like ? <p> The study found that people dealing with this hardship fell into two camps : those whose symptoms were respiratory -- coughs , shortness of breath , fatigue , headaches -- and those whose symptoms were ' multi-system ' , with issues playing with many areas of their bodies , including the brain , gut and heart . <p> According to Long Covid SOS , a UK campaign for recognition and support of this group of people , those experiencing on-going issues receive little help . ( " Some health professionals seem to be unaware of the existence of this phenomenon ; those that do often lack the resources to help , leaving many struggling to get the care and recognition they need . Sufferers may be unable to get support from family and friends who do not understand why they are ill for so long , and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face a loss of sickness benefit , " reads their website . ) <p> It 's vital to note that some people who fit none of the aforementioned criteria can be plagued by symptoms . <p> Tom Stayte , who lives in London and is in his early thirties , has dealt with radically life-changing symptoms for over six months .

Finding a place to go to a Vogel St precinct shop or cafe is such a mission we gave up , plenty of empty parks all 5 minutes .

The entitlement of some people who think it is somehow a human right not to have to move their bum a single meter is unbelievable ! ! ! <p> Hey Lisa , companies provide parking for their customers .

Global equities down around 3% ahead of new country-wide restrictions for France and Germany <p> US and European equity markets have fallen significantly overnight ahead of new country-wide restrictions being imposed across France and Germany , as new cases of COVID19 surge . Despite the equity market sell-off , global rates markets have seen only small falls in yields . Safe haven currencies have outperformed , with commodity currencies near the bottom of the leaderboard . <p> The market focus overnight has been on the spread of COVID19 across Europe and the US , as new case numbers surge to record highs in many cases and hospitalisation and death rates increase . This is leading to fresh restrictions being imposed in a number of countries and states , which will likely see some reversal of the fledging economic recovery . <p> German leaders agreed to impose a one-month partial lockdown from Monday that will see bars , restaurants and leisure facilities closed -- while most other businesses continue operating -- with advice to keep social contacts to an absolute minimum and avoid all non-essential travel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with President Macron scheduled to soon address the nation .

The US 10-year rate has traded a tight 3bps range and is barely lower from the NZ close , currently 0.77% . Germany 's 10-year fell by just 1bp , suggesting a lack of safe-haven flows , even if yields were higher across the more troubled European nations , with Italy 's 10-year up 6bps . <p> Safe-haven currencies have outperformed , with the USD , JPY and CHF the best performing , although moves for most have n't been particularly large . The USD index is up some 0.5% for the day . <p> " Risk-off " has been the predominant force for commodity currencies , with CAD unperturbed by the latest Bank of Canada policy meeting . The BoC reduced its weekly bond purchases from CAD5b to CAD4b , but shifted purchases towards longer term debt . Its hand was forced in a way , as the BoC was beginning to own " too many " of the shorter dated securities , so this move has more to do with technical factors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a pushing out of forward guidance , as the Bank added 2023 for the timing of when the output gap is closed .

Kind of . As a coward with commitment issues , I decided to enter into a dietary Yes Man situation , where I would always say " yes " to eating vegetarian unless there was no other option left but to eat meat . It 's an extremely effective lifestyle choice that means I now basically never eat meat , with the exception of when I find myself randomly at the Federal Deli holding a chicken salad sandwich . <p> Throughout the course of this extremely mild social experiment , I have sampled what feels like every vegetarian burger option in the land .

I would just like to remind the jury , your honour , that this burger has already been found guilty on three counts of not having a patty . <p> " Who says that salad has to taste boring ? " pleads Wendy on her website , with the same desperation of David Brent asking whether famine has to be depressing .

So , kudos to this trailblazer , the first to take non-meat eaters seriously and not just expect us to sheepishly pack an empty cheeseburger full of chips and call it a night ( although this is yum and fine too ) . <p> BUT we have since moved on as a society and I think I speak for all of us when I say that we simply do not have the emotional capacity to deal with this much onion in 2020 .

Burgerfuel 's American Muscle is a great example , a jacked-up fake meat burger that simply does not need to be as angry as the roid-rage branding or gargantuan heft suggests . Honestly , the second that any fast food chain comes out with a fake meat patty that is n't the size of an actual bodybuilder 's bum cheek , it 's over for you bitches . <p> Anyway , while we are trapped in this weird machismo marketing dick-swinging competition , the Super King XL is about as hectic as it gets .

Shrouded in controversy and confusion for not actually being vegetarian at all , the McVeggie fuels its own chaos by only being available in selected stores . I can attest to its availability in Wellsford , but if you try to veg out in Point Chevalier you are going to be met with the advice to " pop an egg in there instead " and that 's your journey . <p> It might be for the best that you ca n't get it everywhere , because this burger feels like it contains an ancient curse . The patty vibes like a corn fritter , but then reveals itself to be basically a post-mammogram croquette . It contains cheese ( ! ) , cheerful bits of corn and green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Days when coffee was black or white instead of latte or mocha at some trendy site . <p> Would I marry it ? No .

Probably . <p> McDonald 's McVeggie <h> 4 ) KFC Vegetarian Burger <p> Full props to this humble burger for starting the public conversation about something many of us know in our most private and shameful of hearts -- that anything is basically fine if you put a hash brown in it . There 's a real subversive freedom to menu items like this , same food family as the burgers you can buy with glazed donuts instead of buns , or those Mexican Tank salads that you can get corn chips crushed into and it 's fine because it 's salad . I appreciate the no-nonsense , delicious approach that very much makes sense with the wider KFC fantasy . <p> Extra for experts : I know that I 've stayed strictly " on menu " up until this point but if I may make a rogue suggestion -- get supercharged sauce on this . You wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Carl 's Jnr Veggie Burger <p> I 'll be honest , I did not see this coming either . I had extremely low expectations for Carl 's Jr in the meat-free market , given that they are mostly known for quadruple-stacked beef burgers and making ladies writhe around on sudsy cars in their underclothes . But after trying their veggie burger , I was so stunned and impressed that I had to physically restrain myself from donning an American flag bikini and ascending onto the hood of our Mazda Demio . <p> This burger is crazy , good , and crazy good . It 's got smoky tomato chutney in it for god 's sake . Crispy fried onion straws ! Pickles ! Aioli ! Cheese ! Lettuce ! A sundried tomato , potato and kumara patty ! Full respect to Carlton and the team for actually giving non-meat-eaters a bit of texture and excitement to work with , but this should absolutely not be in the " lighter eats " part of the menu as I predict it weighs about three kilograms . That 's value . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rebel Whopper <p> Obviously The Whopper is a classic of the genre and Burger King 's plant-based alternative certainly appears to fool many Kiwi punters on the telly . But we need to be honest here , you can still tell the difference . Past the distractions of pickle , aioli , tomato -- and cheese if you 're fancy -- the patty is still not quite there . Rip a bit of it off on its own and you will still feel the unnatural rubbery feeling , the slightly laboratorial taste . <p> All that said , it 's still a bloody , bloody good burger and one that would happily get anyone through a hangover and/or roadie with no problem whatsoever . What holds this back from the top spot for me is that I feel like there 's a lot of places to hide in the Whopper format , and you could probably put a patty made of mouse crap in there and it would still taste pretty good . What this reviewer likes is confidence and simplicity , embodied by burger number one .... <p> Burger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With only four no-frills elements -- shredded lettuce , tangy lemony mayonnaise , a fake chook patty and the classic elongated bun , there are simply no bells , whistles or machismo to be found with the Rebel Chook . Chicken is easier to fake , given that chicken nuggets are basically made of knuckles and sawdust , which gives this meat-alternative a huge advantage . BK is so confident in its fake chook that you can also buy it in tender form , which speaks volumes . I have n't seen any fake beef rissoles on the menu , put it that way . <p> What else to love ? Another close contact pointed out to me recently that this is " the perfect driving burger . " And , as we all know , food consumed in the car , the airport and the movies does n't count , so that 's another tick in its favour . Fake chicken can be a bit on the dry side , but the Rebel Chook anticipates this with lashings of zesty mayo and crisp lettuce . Mark my words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officially here .

Now FHB who were borrowing X amount are now extendin their limit and borrowing X plus 20% to 40% more and in period where earning and jobs are at stake and possible because of distribution of money by government and very cheap loan .... Anyone can sense where all this is leading to in long term and than the same government and Mr Orr who will come out to point that one should have borrowed within limits but who is prompting by allowing to borrow without much support/deposit and also who is responsible for creating FOMO . <p> LVR is needed now more than before to protect . <p> All this has to end badly unless government in their obsession to prevent business/economic cycle keep on printing and distributing money but again this may delay but not avoid and bigger the delay bigger the crash . <p> For that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice but to continue supporting the ponzi as long as it takes , as they have entangled themselves by their narrow short term thinking of herd mentality . <p> Mr Orr and other governors follow fed to play safe , for if and when actions misfire will not be blamed . <p> Mr Orr has lost and his actions are now only based on Hope and have lost the opportunuty with forward looking thinking - Short term pain for libg term gain - reset . <p> May be time to reset agencies and Mr Orr to bring reset in NZ economy . <p> Because extreme RBNZ monetary policy actions have produced little in the way of economic growth that reflects a shortage of production capacity in need of expansion to meet overwhelming consumption demand.caused by said actions . <p> by Audaxes 23rd Oct 20 , 2:53pm The OCR has been cut in half five times since July 2008 , when it was 8.0% to 0.25% today .

You might find that the level of interest rates is immaterial to the price direction of this asset class . <p> .. the most important macroeconomic variable can not be the price of money . Instead , it is its quantity . Is the quantity of money rationed by the demand or supply side ? Asked differently , what is larger -- the demand for money or its supply ? Since money -- and this includes bank money -- is so useful , there is always some demand for it by someone . As a result , the short side is always the supply of money and credit . Banks ration credit even at the best of times in order to ensure that borrowers with sensible investment projects stay among the loan applicants -- if rates are raised to equilibrate demand and supply , the resulting interest rate would be so high that only speculative projects would remain and banks ' loan portfolios would be too risky .

As such Brash was powerless to affect inflation through the floating rate , your narrative is a bit misleading . <p> FH .. I seem to remember the floating rate was 11% and with rates looking like falling dramatically many people actually chose the floating rate waiting for rates to drop before ( re ) fixing . You might want to look at the graph he linked you showing rates were over 10% for about two years in mid 2000s <p> Because we have the benefit of seeing how these policies pan out as other countries ( e.g. Japan , the US ) have been running them for years .

Those that have recently bought face the prospect of a sudden drop in house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been removed . What does Orr do - not reimpose LVRs ...... <p> OCR needs to be increased to 3% overnight and lvrs for fhb brought back at a higher rate of 30% ... ban any banks lending to investors purchasing existing residential property ... the pain needs to happen now otherwise the pain felt further down the track will be catastrophic .... <p> While I agree , I am sceptical that neither the government nor the RBNZ are willing and will only extend and pretend until they ca n't , then adopt MMT to extend and pretend some more . The pain will be imposed upon us by something external - most likely a war . <p> The problem is the general public are blind to what is happening ..... not enough basic economics taught in schools ... for anyone that has studied economics at a high level the current economic situation is insane and economic suicide ... <p> They know what they are doing ... kicking the can down the road ... its all political ... without thinking of the overall good of the country long term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very messy when it does ... my grandfather would turn in his grave looking at this country now after risking his life for it ... <p> I strongly agree ( event though I would not go as high as 3% , as this would probably be too traumatic : I 'd think that an OCR at around 1.5% might be a reasonable balance in the current economic circumstances ) . Unfortunately the current inept and incompetent management at the RBNZ will never do that , and the Government does not care . It is easier to parrot failed loose monetary policies from Europe and Japan , hoping for a magically different result in NZ . But do not worry , when the times come for NZ to pay for these mistakes , Orr &amp; Co. will be nowhere to be seen . People forget that a fundamental part of the RBNZ 's mandate is to keep the NZ financial system sound , it is not just about inflation rate and unemployment levels . The current policies are in clear breach of this mandate and Orr should be sacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already has significant equity in other property is almost always a far better risk for banks than a FHB .

Borrowers two properties would need to fall 50%+ before banks risked losing but for FHBs .... Sad but true . <p> Well that 's it , housing is n't an investment ( investment has risk and return ) - there is no risk anymore .... the powers above have taken that away .

I feel singled out and blessed that this is where I get to be with my kid right now . " <p> Palmer has been holed up in a rental in the Hawkes Bay since the Covid-19 lockdown hit at the tail-end of her world tour There Will Be No Intermission . <p> It was not part of the plan .

She will probably just walk into each show and take her cues from the audience . <p> " I have n't written a set list , there is no plan . Every show will be quite different . " <p> She is very aware of how " privileged " she is to be doing the shows , given many of her colleagues in the United States are losing their jobs , the ability to make a living and their homes . <p> " To be able to sit on stage in front of flesh and blood people is so unprecedented .

I can release things as they come in my own time . That is good enough for me . It is not dirty , it is not begging , it is not charity .

His team called it buildbackbetter.com and declared " the Biden-Harris Administration can hit the ground running on Day One . " <p> As Trump spent part of the day airing grievances over Twitter , Biden pledged to govern as a unifier if triumphant . <p> " What brings us together as Americans is so much stronger than anything that can tear us apart , " Biden , appearing with his running mate Kamala Harris , said in his home state of Delaware on Wednesday ( local time ) . <p> " Democracy is very much alive in the United States ...

He hopes to avoid becoming the first incumbent US president to lose a re-election bid since George H.W. Bush in 1992 . <p> Trump has long sought to undermine the credibility of the voting process if he lost . Since Tuesday , he has falsely declared victory , accused Democrats of trying to steal the election without evidence and vowed to fight states in court . <p> Trump 's campaign fought to keep his chances alive with the demand for a Wisconsin recount as well as lawsuits in Michigan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State Jocelyn Benson called his team 's lawsuit " frivolous . " <p> His campaign filed a lawsuit in Georgia to require that Chatham County , which includes the city of Savannah , separate and secure late-arriving ballots to ensure they are not counted . <p> It also asked the US Supreme Court to allow Trump to join a pending lawsuit filed by Pennsylvania Republicans over whether the battleground state should be permitted to accept late-arriving ballots . <p> The manoeuvres amounted to a broad effort to contest the results of a still undecided election a day after millions of Americans went to the polls during the coronavirus pandemic that has upended daily life . <p> While fighting to stop the count in states where he feared losing , Trump blasted news organisations that projected losses in Arizona and Nevada , two states he thought he should be winning . He tweeted his consternation over mail-in voting . <p> " They are finding Biden votes all over the place -- in Pennsylvania , Wisconsin , and Michigan . So bad for our Country ! " he posted on Twitter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No one 's going to take our democracy away from us , not now , not ever , " he said . <p> Voting concluded on Tuesday night , but many states routinely take days to finish counting ballots , bolstered by a surge in mail-in ballots nationally because of the coronavirus pandemic . <p> Other closely contested states , including Arizona , Georgia , Nevada and North Carolina , were still counting votes , leaving the national election outcome uncertain . <p> Trump earlier continued to make baseless attacks on the vote-counting process on Twitter on Wednesday , hours after he appeared at the White House and declared victory in an election that was far from decided . Both Facebook and Twitter flagged multiple posts from the president for promoting misleading claims . <p> " We were getting ready to win this election . Frankly , we did win this election , " Trump said before launching an extraordinary attack on the electoral process by a sitting president . " This is a major fraud on our nation . We want the law to be used in a proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court . We want all voting to stop . " <p> Trump provided no evidence to back up his claim of fraud and did not explain how he would fight the results at the Supreme Court , which does not hear direct challenges . <p> The uncertainty only added to the anxiety many Americans were feeling following a vitriolic campaign that unfolded amid a pandemic that has killed more than 231,000 Americans and left millions more jobless . The country has also grappled with months of unrest involving protests over racism and police brutality . <p> Jeff Brower ( 48 ) , a registered independent in Atlanta , stayed up past midnight fretting about the vote count in Georgia , where officials are still tallying ballots . <p> " I woke up feeling as anxious as ever , " said Brower , who owns a general contracting business and voted for Biden .

The country has also grappled with months of unrest involving protests over racism and police brutality . <p> Supporters of both candidates expressed anger , frustration and fear with little clarity on when the election would be resolved . <p> Trump led in Georgia and North Carolina , while his lead dwindled in Pennsylvania . Without Wisconsin and Michigan , he would have to win all three as well as either Arizona or Nevada , where Biden was leading in the latest vote counts . <p> Biden would be only the second Democratic presidential candidate to win Arizona in 72 years . Trump won the state in 2016 . <p> In Pennsylvania , Trump 's lead dropped to around 320,000 votes as officials gradually worked their way through millions of mail-in ballots , which were seen as likely to benefit Biden . Trump campaign manager Bill Stepien called the president the winner in Pennsylvania , even though state officials had not completed the count . Biden said he felt " very good " about his chances in Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday was comfortably ahead of Trump , with about 3 million more votes . Trump won the 2016 election over Democrat Hillary Clinton after winning crucial battleground states even though she drew about 3 million more votes nationwide . <p> Legal experts had warned the election could get bogged down in state-by-state litigation over a host of issues , including whether states can include late-arriving ballots that were mailed by Election Day . Both campaigns have marshalled teams of lawyers in preparation for any disputes . <p> In the case in which the Trump campaign sought to intervene , the Supreme Court previously allowed Pennsylvania to move forward with a plan to count ballots mailed by Election Day that arrive up to three days later . <p> But some conservative justices suggested they would be willing to reconsider the matter , and state officials planned to segregate those ballots as a precaution . <p> Ahead of the election , Trump had said he wanted his latest US Supreme Court appointee , Amy Coney Barrett , confirmed by the Senate in case the court had to hear any electoral dispute . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected Barrett to rule in his favour . <p> Trump has repeatedly said without evidence that widespread mail-in voting would lead to fraud , although US election experts say fraud is very rare . <p> The election will also decide which party controls the US Congress for the next two years , and the Democratic drive to win control of the Senate appeared to be falling short . Democrats had flipped two Republican-held seats while losing one of their own , and five other races remained undecided - Alaska , Michigan , North Carolina and two in Georgia . <h> Comments <p> " We were getting ready to win this election . Frankly , we did win this election , " Trump said " so Trump gets lambasted by the media yet again but the other camp says " We 're going to defend this vote , the vote by which Joe Biden has been elected to the presidency " is n't lambasted , shows where the allegiances lie , ca n't tell me there is no bias in the media .

Biden has a roughly 20,000-vote lead after the county finished counting its absentee ballots Wednesday morning . <p> Ahead of Election Day , the Republican National Committee scaled up for a large-scale legal battle .

A judge heard a GOP challenge to about 93 absentee ballots in Montgomery County over how voters were given opportunities to fix ballots with issues that would have caused them to be thrown out . The Republicans alleged that the county had begun processing mail-in ballots too early and was illegally trying to allow voters to fix defects , such as by adding missing inner envelopes . <p> Also in Pennsylvania , GOP Rep. Mike Kelly and others filed a lawsuit in state court Tuesday evening accusing the Pennsylvania secretary of state of illegally advising that provisional ballots could be offered to absentee voters whose ballots would be rejected . <p> Officials in the states where ballots were still outstanding urged patience while the results are calculated . <p> " The President wants this settled . Joe Biden wants this settled . The people of Pennsylvania want it settled , " Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And the best way to settle this is to count .

Seven of the remaining eight were counties that Trump won over Clinton in 2016 , but they account for about 12% of the known remaining ballots to be counted . <p> North Carolina <p> The North Carolina State Board of Elections announced the number of outstanding absentee ballots remains 117,000 during a news conference on Wednesday afternoon , acknowledging the state will likely not report additional results until next week .

In North Carolina , an Election Day-postmarked ballot can be counted if it is received by 5 p.m . ET on November 12 . <p> Technology issues in multiple states <p> Several states had other issues pop up that led to delays in counting ballots .

As for weed the government gave itself an " out " with not making the referendum binding so even if it had passed and the current result was reversed they would have used the excuse that it did n't have majority support and may not have advanced it into legislation . Chloe Swarbrick i hope will continue to keep this whole debate about legalising cannabis alive and try again with another referendum and legislation on the issue .

Misuse and overuse of antimicrobials are the main drivers in the development of drug-resistant pathogens . Lack of clean water and sanitation and inadequate infection prevention and control promotes the spread of microbes , some of which can be resistant to antimicrobial treatment . The cost of AMR to the economy is significant . In addition to death and disability , prolonged illness results in longer hospital stays , the need for more expensive medicines and financial challenges for those impacted .

Especially alarming is the rapid global spread of multi- and pan-resistant bacteria ( also known as " superbugs " ) that cause infections that are not treatable with existing antimicrobial medicines such as antibiotics . <p> Without effective tools for the prevention and adequate treatment of drug-resistant infections and improved access to existing and new quality-assured antimicrobials , the number of people for whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Medical procedures , such as surgery , including caesarean sections or hip replacements , cancer chemotherapy , and organ transplantation , will become riskier . <h> What accelerates the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance ? <p> AMR occurs naturally over time , usually through genetic changes . Antimicrobial resistant organisms are found in people , animals , food , plants and the environment ( in water , soil and air ) . They can spread from person to person or between people and animals , including from food of animal origin . The main drivers of antimicrobial resistance include the misuse and overuse of antimicrobials ; lack of access to clean water , sanitation and hygiene ( WASH ) for both humans and animals ; poor infection and disease prevention and control in health-care facilities and farms ; poor access to quality , affordable medicines , vaccines and diagnostics ; lack of awareness and knowledge ; and lack of enforcement of legislation . <p> 1 Antimicrobials is a term that encompasses antibiotics , antivirals , antifungals and antiparasitic medicines used to prevent or treat infections in humans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

Organisers are calling up all the famous authors in the wider Auckland area to get along to local libraries to read their books in a fundraiser for the quake-stricken people of Christchurch . The event is jointly run by Auckland Libraries and the New Zealand Society of Authors . Society chief executive Maggie Tarver says libraries confirmed so far for 1pm readings are : Birkenhead , Auckland Central , Howick , Massey , Pukekohe and Waitakere Central . At 6pm there will be readings at Avondale , Botany , East Coast Bays , Devonport , Epsom , Grey Lynn , Highland Park , Leys Institute , Mt Albert , Mt Roskill , New Lynn , Onehunga , Pakuranga , Panmure , Parnell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waiheke Island , Warkworth and Whangaparaoa . Writers confirmed include Tessa Duder , Kevin Ireland , Ian Wedde , Emily Perkins , Christine Cole Catley , James George , Stephanie Johnson , Elizabeth Nannestad , Tusitala Marsh and Andrea Jutson . Christchurch author Joanna Orwin will be reading at the Waiheke Island library . Duder says it 's a pleasure and a relief to do something for the hard-hit southern province . " Practically the whole Auckland writing community is taking part in this fundraising event , and probably for the same reasons as me : simply making a small gesture towards a city in great need of whatever support we can offer , " she says . " For now , it is the journalist writers who are telling the stories of the Christchurch quake , often magnificently , but there is also a need for storytelling which tells of others rising to challenges , providing inspiration , hope and healing , particularly for the children . " Entry to the readings will be by gold coin , which will be collected by the Salvation Army.Further information , see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@32402237 <h> Study highlights ' moralisation ' of COVID response and restrictions <p> A collaborative study led by the University of Otago has shown that Covid-19 containment and elimination efforts have become moralised . As a result , people are more likely to accept collateral damage from these efforts , such as social shaming , lost lives and illnesses , and police abuse of power . This moralisation was so strong that people reacted negatively even when Covid-19 restrictions were merely questioned . <p> Published in The Journal of Experimental Social Psychology , the study , Moralization of COVID-19 Health Response : Asymmetry in Tolerance for Human Costs , examined how likely people were to overlook the harmful by-products of the elimination response , compared to similar actions unrelated to Covid-19 ( e.g. , reducing road deaths ) or those addressing the economic impact of Covid-19 . <p> The researchers gave NZ community participants one of two parallel lay-oriented research proposal descriptions . Although both proposals relied on the same research and presented the same information about the methods , the proposal questioning NZ 's elimination approach ( vs. a proposal which supported NZ 's elimination approach ) was rated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information , and people were less trusting of the research team . The article 's authors hypothesised that as Covid-19 is recognised as a formidable contemporary threat , efforts to combat it would be perceived as promoting the ' greater good ' because they presumably reduce overall suffering . Those efforts would be not only lauded as necessary and beneficial , but they may also become moralised . As a result , people would be more likely to accept human suffering resulting from Covid-19 containment or elimination strategies . <p> Both failing to properly contain Covid-19 and implementing restrictions to contain Covid-19 carry collateral costs . Collateral human costs that may result from failing to combat Covid-19 include increased cases , overwhelmed healthcare systems , health complications , and deaths . Prioritising control or elimination of Covid-19 also carries collateral human costs , such as unemployment , extreme financial stress , social isolation , substance abuse , and delayed cancer diagnoses . Left unaddressed , these forces may generate ' deaths of despair ' , whereby individuals perish from behaviours or worsened illnesses as a result of perceived bleak prospects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or question health-based policies , abuse of law-enforcement and government power , and deterioration of human rights . Lead author Dr Maja Graso , a Senior Lecturer in Business Ethics at the University of Otago 's Department of Management , says results supported the hypothesis , suggesting COVID-19 elimination efforts became moralised to an almost sacred level . <p> Although moralisation may be a natural response to such an imposing health threat , this process may also blind people to potential human costs resulting from a Covid-19 elimination strategy ( e.g. , extreme financial strain , undiagnosed illnesses ) . Importantly , moralization of Covid-19 may also mean that merely questioning elimination strategies is not acceptable . Indeed , this is exactly what their findings revealed . <p> " As a research team , we do n't take a stance on whether moralising elimination is good or bad , nor on how Covid-19 should be handled . Instead , we examine how people assess human costs , and we invite people to consider the possibility that the moralisation of Covid-19 elimination may lead us to overlook other , less visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deaths of despair . It may also lead us to discount peer-reviewed scientific evidence that documents human costs resulting from elimination-based strategies , " Dr Graso says . The paper describes that without tempered discussions , holistic assessments of human suffering will pose challenges for scientists , policy makers , and the general public alike . The current trade-offs facing decision-makers and individual citizens are difficult , unprecedented , and costly . Providing a nuanced understanding of how individuals evaluate these human costs can help guide an informed pathway towards weathering these ongoing difficulties and ultimately , minimizing human suffering . <p> All articles and comments on Voxy.co.nz have been submitted by our community of users .

@@32405233 <h> After the report , a challenge ahead <p> Armed police patrol the El Noor Mosque in the days following last year 's terror attack . PHOTO : STEPHEN JAQUIERY <p> The Royal Commission 's call to improve social cohesion on the back of Christchurch terror attack is its hardest -- and most important -- recommendation , writes Alexander Gillespie . <p> The most fundamental obligation of any state is the safety of its citizens . On March 15 , 2019 , New Zealand completely failed in this obligation . The Royal Commission of Inquiry into the Terrorist Attack on Christchurch Mosques was designed to tell us why and how this happened -- why 51 people were murdered , and what steps need to be taken to prevent such acts recurring . <p> In a nutshell , the commission concluded no-one was solely to blame . It was a collective failure , divided between the security agencies , the police and a population lacking social cohesion and with a fear of speaking out . <p> The failure of the security agencies was unremarkable in the commission 's analysis . They were alienated , under-resourced and overly focusing counterterrorism resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies were aware of right-wing extremism , their intelligence was underdeveloped -- but even if it had been better , the outcome may not have been different . <p> The primary reason the terrorist was not detected , the commission concludes , was due more to the operational security that the individual maintained , the legislative authorising environment in which counterterrorism operates , and the limited capability and capacity of the counterterrorism agencies . <p> Intelligence and police failures <p> So , there was " no plausible way he could have been detected except by chance " . And apparently , this failure to detect was " not in itself an intelligence failure " . In fact , no security agency failed to meet required standards or was otherwise considered to be at fault . <p> Views will differ on that , but the culpability of the police is clearer . The report concludes their administration of the firearms licensing system did not meet required standards , due to a lack of staff guidance and training , and flawed referee vetting processes . <p> This intersected with the regulation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploitation and was gamed by the individual " . <p> Even so , the commission concluded it was possible , perhaps likely , that the terrorist would eventually have been able to obtain a licence . Beyond that is supposition : an effective licensing regime may have delayed his preparation , but whether it would have changed his mind about the attack , the target , the weapons , or even the country he was in , will always be unknown . <p> Whether these failings are sufficient for ministerial and/or agency accountability is a matter of debate . The last time anything comparable happened was after the Cave Creek disaster in 1995 , when the responsible minister resigned over the systemic failure at the Department of Conservation . <p> Preventing another attack <p> Official accountability aside , the commission sets out the road map to prevent such an attack happening again . Fixing the firearms licence process will be the easiest . The six recommendations calling for enhanced standards and improved quality control dovetail with laws put in place after the attack . <p> The type of firearms used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " patterns of behaviour demonstrating a tendency to exhibit , encourage , or promote violence , hatred or extremism " can no longer be considered fit and proper to possess a firearm . <p> The other change will be harder . There are no fewer than 18 different recommendations aimed at the security agencies , starting with the creation of a new ministerial portfolio and establishment of a new national intelligence and security agency . <p> It will need to be well-resourced and empowered to meet a range of objectives , from developing a counterterrorism strategy to creating a public-facing policy that addresses , prevents , detects and responds to extremism . <p> Also among the recommendations are greater information sharing between agencies , public outreach , the reporting of " threatscapes " and developing indicators identifying a person 's potential for violent extremism and terrorism . <p> All commendable goals , but how they will be reconciled with existing security agency remits , and whether there is a budget to meet such ambitions , is not clear at this stage . <p> The need for social cohesion <p> Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likeliest thing to have prevented the attack would have been a " see something , say something " culture -- one in which those with suspicions about another person could safely raise their concerns with authorities . <p> " Such reporting , " the commission says , " would have provided the best chance of disrupting the terrorist attack . " This is a remarkable sentence , both brilliant and unnerving . It suggests the best defence against extremism was ( and is ) to be found within ourselves , and in the robust and multicultural communities we must create . <p> However , successive governments have failed in this area through their reluctance to make counterterrorism strategies more public , perhaps worried about alienating or provoking sections of the population . <p> It 's a paradox , to say the least , but the commission recommends several measures to enhance social cohesion , beginning with the need to support the ongoing recovery needs of affected family , survivors and witnesses . <p> These evolve into a variety of soft goals , ranging from the possibility of a new agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young New Zealanders ' cultural awareness . <p> Again , these recommendation are commendable , but the proof will be in their resourcing and synchronising with existing work in this area . <p> Free speech and public safety <p> Greater immediate progress may be made in the prevention of hate speech and an extension of the censorship laws to prohibit material advancing racial hatred , discrimination and/or views of racial superiority . <p> Although New Zealand already has law in this area ( covering discrimination and sentencing in crimes related to race , ethnicity or religion ) , there remains a large gap when it comes to what is and is n't permissible speech . <p> It then becomes a vexed question of the limits of free expression , and would be difficult to craft into law . But if the Government could do this , a significant advance will have been made . So , after all of these words , will the vision of this royal commission make New Zealand safer in the future ? The answer is yes , risks can be reduced -- but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexander Gillespie is a professor of law at the University of Waikato.

This , too , is ironic as Sam is the co-founder of Matassa , a now-legendary natural wine estate in France and co-author of a book on natural winemaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose to define " natural wine " to exclude the vast cadre of winemakers that work naturally and make moving classic wine -- Black Estate , Mount Edward , The Supernatural , Devotus and Herzog all come to mind . These conversations are now pretty old hat and I have personally seen winery owners go from telling me that it is " impossible " to make wine without added sulphur to doing so themselves in just a few years . <p> But Jim 's email goes even further than uneducated professional criticism . What I have never seen is the sort of vitriol directed at a single winemaker simply for making and selling a wine that someone did not enjoy : " You should be ashamed of yourself . Find a new hobby " . <p> Jim Harr ? ( Photo : Supplied ) <p> Certainly , the product of the " modern wine " is vast swathes of homogeneity . Wine style is ruthlessly enforced by the fact the vast majority of wine made is sold through supermarkets and chain liquor stores , made by international winemaking consultants and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to make wine the same way at a small handful of winemaking schools around the world still gather together to bestow gold , silver and bronze medals on bottles of wine , judged not for any inherent quality but by how close they adhere to very narrow , outdated set of style guidelines . What you have is a very small group of people effectively deciding what consumers should be drinking . <p> But guess what ? Some people want something different . <p> Natural wine is not a fly-by-night fad but a movement of winegrowers , retailers , restaurateurs and , most importantly , consumers who want to be challenged and inspired by the wine in their glass rather than smashing it down without thought ( although this still happens ) . As Mavromatis points out : " The world would be pretty boring if we all liked the same things " . This is what proponents of mainstream modern wine can not seem to comprehend . For years they have been able to decree what is good and what is not and thankfully , their reign is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these dinosaurs can not fathom that natural wine is good for the wine industry as a whole . Wine is under constant attack : from craft beer , from alcoholic seltzers and from the fact that people , especially younger people , are drinking a lot less or not drinking at all . Natural wine has empowered thousands of new wine consumers in Aotearoa alone to pay handsomely for wine they love . We need these consumers and most of them , from what I can tell , drink a fair bit of conventional wine as well . <p> While the email sent to Mavromatis may have been a slap in the face to her as a winemaker and as a person , I am also affronted about what it says about the people who love her wines and natural wine generally . It says " I 'm right , you 're wrong , drink what you 're told " . And that 's the way to lose customers , not gain them . <p> Jules van Costello is a wine professional , educator and writer based in Taranaki <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farms .

@@32408233 <h> The year Google taught us how to cook <p> In this cursed annum , when that purest of joys -- being fed by someone else -- was briefly snatched away from us , we turned in desperation to our lord and saviour , the world wide web . <p> It seems unfathomable now , but for 41 long days across March and April , we had to cook . Remember that ? No dinners out , no takeaways , just the stark reality of one 's own culinary skills , or lack thereof . <p> We hope never to return to those dark days ( keep using the damn tracer app , people ) , but there exist constant reminders of what we went through . One such memento : Google and its plethora of data , which shows that New Zealand searches for " easy recipes " were at an all-time high in March , as we stared down the prospect of a level four lockdown . <p> Furthermore , the just-released top trending searches of 2020 feature evidence aplenty that we spent much of the year trying to figure out how the heck to feed ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " searches , half are food-related -- how to make bread , how to make naan bread , how to make self-raising flour , how to make pancakes and how to make buttermilk . Of the remaining five , three are depressingly Covid-related ( how to make a face mask , how to make hand sanitiser and how to use Zoom ) . The others are " how to vote NZ " and -- even more depressing than the Covid ones , but about as predictable as 2020 was n't -- how to lose weight fast . <p> Food also featured in the top " what is ... " searches ( what is buttermilk ? ) ; as well as the " why " searches , with " why were cornflakes invented ? If you 're one of the many people wondering , my esteemed colleague and namesake Alice Webb-Liddall has covered that one here . <p> Bread , that most beloved of staples , featured so prominently that it 's worth breaking it down a little further . Did we go as nuts for sourdough as a certain podcast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at number four in the trending searches , behind " naan bread recipe " , " banana bread recipe " and " beer bread " , and in front of " bread and butter pudding " , " easy bread recipe " , " wholemeal bread recipe " , " soda bread " , " no yeast bread " and " fried bread " . <p> But let 's go back to beer bread for a second . New Zealand had the highest search interest for that term of any country in the world in 2020 , according to Google . Why ? I 'd wager a freshly baked lockdown loaf that one woman is responsible for this curious phenomenon -- a woman who happens to be among the top 10 most Googled New Zealand celebrities this year too . <p> That woman is Chelsea Winter , whose beer bread , aka " lockdown loaf " , was baked , it would seem , by every man , woman and quite possibly their dog during the dystopian days of alert level four . <p> The fact naan was the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of butter chicken amid the carb fest of the top recipe searches , hints at another strong theme of 2020 : we missed takeaways . God , how we missed them . <p> When we were finally allowed to order in , Google Maps searches for " takeaways " surged by 75% . Indian was the top takeaway variety hunted for , followed by Thai , Chinese , Korean and Japanese . The biggest surge from March to October went to kebabs , which , it must be said , are more a **35;94;TOOLONG foodstuff rather than a **32;131;TOOLONG foodstuff . And even before full-blown lockdown , remember , kebab-adjacent shenanigans were few and far between , with the lingering threat of Covid hanging over our heads reducing the appeal of squeezing into a packed bar . <p> So when we finally emerged , embracing the heady pre-resurgence vibes of alert level one , with a seemingly endless string of zero-case days lulling us into a blissfully ignorant false sense of security , we went out -- and we drunkenly searched for kebabs , and remembered the times when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought to you byFreedom Farms .

@@32408234 <h> All the fictional foods I would love to eat but ca n't <p> Grab a slice of moon cheese and sit back as Alex Casey imagines her dream multi-course dinner party plucked straight from our TV and movie screens . <p> This has been a simply scrumptious year for realising just how many things we ca n't do any more . We ca n't travel internationally . We ca n't press lift buttons with our turgid tongues . We ca n't even go to the toilet any more without having to " wash our hands " . However , what we can still do is dream ... about all the fictional foods that we can never nosh . <p> Declaration : this is not my first fictional food rodeo . Back when this website was but a humble widget only accessible via bing.com , I had a short-lived column where I tried to recreate meals that I had seen on television . It was an extremely sad and lonely journey that mostly saw me making horror holes in frankfurters and dipping fish fingers in custard . <p> My hunger was not satisfied . I continued to crave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or watching the worms in James and the Giant Peach wriggle like Day-Glo gnocchi . Not to mention the Giant Peach ITSELF in a GIANT COBBLER with lots and lots of CREAM . <p> So , in an attempt to get it all out of my system , I present this : my ultimate fictional feast for no real reason . <h> TO START <h> Lembas bread from Lord of the Rings <p> The essential carbo-loading fuel for hungry elves and ' obbitses , Lembas Bread is basically like a skinny hunk of dry toast wrapped in artisanal silver leaves . It is especially useful for expeditions because a single bite can fill an entire stomach , alluded to in the unofficial tagline " eat a little at a time , and only at need " . <p> Well , this is my dinner party and I 'm going to make me and my friends eat a lot of Lembas bread . I would break it into giant chunks with my fingers and dip it in olive oil or maybe even slather it in hummus with heaps of salt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( via space travel ) and we 'd be full as hell on Lembas and then have to go on a quest and/or run some errands to burn it off . It would be worth it . <h> Moon cheese from Wallace and Gromit <p> This is the correct cheese-to-cracker ratio and that 's on Nasa <p> We 've all been there . Heaps of crackers . No cheese . Quick trip to the moon . No harm no foul . Here 's some food history for you : the first mention of moon cheese was in 1546 in The Proverbs of John Heywood , which stated : " The moon is made of greene cheese " . Yum ! Fennel gouda one would think . Or perhaps a funky wasabi cheddar . <p> Like many , I have wanted to eat the moon ever since Wallace and Gromit 's A Grand Day Out when the pair travel to the moon to slice the top off of a particularly cheesy-looking moon stalagmite . " Not Wensleydale ... not Stilton , " Wallace muses . " It 's like no cheese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lembas bread and now we 're talking . <h> Grubs from The Lion King <p> Now that every man , woman and child is practically snorting cricket flour on every street corner , I think we can all agree that this one is n't even fictional any more , and anyone who 's seen The Lion King will agree and that Timon and Pumba sell this shit hard . Tastes like chicken . Slimy yet satisfying . Pecans with a very pleasant crunch . <p> People have made ice-cream versions of this Disney delicacy , but nothing compares to the primal power of the original . I 'm not interested in gummy bugs and sour snakes . I want to slurp a live worm out of the Earth like ramen noodles . I want to crunch a giant red grub that looks like it would taste like the crumb of an almond croissant . <p> But no ritual quite compares to Mr Bean 's park bench lunch , complete with credit card butter knife , sock as salad spinner , little herrings in a jar and a hot water bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time you saw a chef crush peppercorns with the heel of his shoe like Jackson Maine pulverising prescription pills before a show ? Pasture could never . <h> The Ratatouille ratatouille and/or the cooked weedrat from Shrek <p> Ratatouille vs weedrat <p> One is cooked by a rat , the other is a rat -- cooked . I would like to offer my guests the opportunity to try both depending on their dietary needs . <h> Imaginary feast from Hook <p> Sweet or savoury ? ! ? ! ? ! ? ! <p> I know , I know . It 's a feast within a feast , but this one is imaginary so should n't need too much prep . This scene in Hook is perhaps one of the finest examples of fantastical fictional foods , because not only does it not exist in this world , it does n't even really exist in the world of the film . After finally giving into his true identity as Peter Pan , Robin Williams unleashes hell on the lost boys in the form of an imaginary technicolour food fight . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are those green globs wasabi ? What about the blue swirls ? SWEET OR SAVOURY ? SWEET ? ! OR SAVOURY ? ! " It was just like frosting and crazy gobbledygook , but there was also ... like grey stuff , underneath it " recalled Dante Basco aka Rufio in this 2018 interview . I would give my life for the grey stuff underneath it . Mushroom souffle ? ! We can only ever wonder and drool , and that 's the tyranny of being alive . <h> Tossed salad and scrambled eggs from Frasier <h> BETWEEN COURSES <h> The Princess Diaries Palate Cleanser <p> The mysterious green palate cleanser <p> Much has already been written about this alluring mint green bowl of icy delight . It comes halfway through Mia 's first state dinner as the glowed-up Princess of Genovia , in a small crystal bowl , and by god does it look good . Someone at The Cut managed to find a restaurant that served something like it , and here was their review . " After all was said and done , the sorbet was ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasted more like ice . It did n't have that bright colour , or the buttery texture and scoopability I had envisioned . It was n't served in a fancy crystal glass . And it was n't even all that refreshing ! " Thanks , I 'll take a gallon . <h> DESSERT <h> Tubby Custard from The Teletubbies <p> This course would be an immersive experience hosted by none other than local artisan Po , who would wheel their giant Tubby Custard machine into the dining room ( this is a fictional situation where I have a dining room ) to wild applause . The Tubby Custard machine will then huff and fart its way to plating , with each of my guests getting a clear plastic bowl of the good pink stuff complete with in-built custard straw . But what would it taste like ? Shut your eyes now if you do n't want to know the truth -- Tubby Custard was actually just mashed potato and acrylic paint . <h> Bruce Bogtrotter choccie cake <p> 1 x cake and 1 x fork per person <h> Tim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but very hard to achieve . When Tim Canterbury pranks his co-worker Gareth Keenan by setting his stapler in jelly , the jape is elevated to the next level by the small box of staples on his desk -- also filled with jelly . There 's something about the firmness of his bite which makes me think the jelly would almost be like a lemon Turkish Delight , just mind any loose staples that may have found themselves in the mix . <h> TO FINISH <h> Willy Wonka 's teacup <p> The chocolate river ? Do n't be a hack . Everlasting gobstopper ? Change the record . Lickable wallpaper ? Hope you like ants . The ultimate after-dinner treat , perhaps with a shot of limoncello within , is this edible teacup . My guests would round off their delightful meal by plucking one of these from the indoor teacup bush , before taking a big old bite and realising the harsh truth . <p> Thank you all for coming to my party .

@@32408236 <h> Unleashing the billion-dollar business potential of New Zealand 's gaming sector <p> It 's the new national pastime and New Zealand 's fastest-growing tech industry . Jonathan Cotton finds out how New Zealand is staying connected to this billion-dollar global opportunity . <p> Gus , my 11-year-old son , will talk to you about gaming . He 'll talk to himself about gaming . Under the right circumstances , he 'll talk to a potted plant about gaming . <p> And once started , he 's unlikely to stop of his own accord . He 's on a path to glory , do n't you know ? He once came in the top 3% for a Fortnite Daily Duos Cup . <p> Turns out there 's much to know about competitive gaming -- or esports , for the uninitiated -- including genres , platforms , hundreds of titles , and a host of technical challenges too . In Gus 's case , it 's the refresh rate of the old TV monitor he uses that bugs him in particular . What he 'd prefer is a for-purpose 240Hz monitor , like the pros use . <p> But frame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that an aging console , inconsistent wifi , and a low capacity broadband internet connection he shares with the rest of the family trying to stream television and work from home . There 's a lot that can and does go wrong for the home-based gaming consumer when your set-up is n't optimal , but it does n't have to be that way . <p> The pros in action at at ESL One in Cologne , Germany in 2019 . A total of 16 teams from all over the world fight for the title in the game Counter-Strike : Global Offensive . ( Photo : Marius Becker/picture alliance via Getty Images ) <h> A global pursuit with regional challenges <p> Milliseconds count to gamers , especially to New Zealand ones connecting to overseas servers . A particular bugbear for gamers in this country is latency ( aka ping ) or the speed of the connection between device and server . For New Zealand players those servers are generally overseas -- Australia , Singapore , California , or anywhere else around the globe . <p> When latency is high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ input from the player . Physical limitations count for a lot here : old copper lines are among the worst for producing latency , around a third slower than fibre cable . Fibre-optic connections are therefore the first choice for most Kiwi gamers , and with fibre coverage now available to most of New Zealand , we 're fortunate in that respect . Developers can also build lag compensation into games -- inbuilt predictive functionality to smooth over more obvious lag problems -- but that can only do so much . <p> ( Interesting aside : As a consequence of lag , it 's been suggested that New Zealanders have developed a more defensive playing style than other esports players around the world , competing with opponents enjoying faster ping , or lower lag times . ) <p> Also important is the reliability of the internet connections themselves -- that is , not having connections drop out at inopportune moments . When it comes to streaming video or audio , buffering preloads a certain amount of data before commencing playback , ensuring interruptions to the data stream can be absorbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good solution for streaming video , but no help to those enjoying real-time interactions with a gaming server . Whether it 's competing in an online tournament -- or performing remote surgery -- those half-second dropouts can have a dramatic impact on outcomes . <p> And for domestic game players on shared connections , there are even more speed bumps : congested family networks can interrupt gameplay and spoil arranged gaming times , especially on days when extra bandwidth is required to download updates or new titles . <p> Hyperfibre is coming ! ( Illustration : Ezra Whittaker ) <h> Competitive gaming landscape <p> In New Zealand , gaming has quietly become the new national pastime : 84% of New Zealanders under 14 play video games . But most gamers are actually older and the average age of the New Zealand gamer is 34 years old . The gender split is almost straight down the middle . <p> Globally , esports is more than a billion-dollar industry . Competitive organised video gaming , playing the same titles home users enjoy , attracts enormous audiences -- around half a billion at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For example this year , the Counter-Strike : Global Offensive has a prize pool topping US$12,000,000 . About a million people viewed its 2020 Extreme Masters tournament earlier this year . <p> New Zealanders are competing -- and profiting -- on this international stage . New Zealand teenager Chris Hunt ( aka CoverH , a local celebrity , according to Gus ) and 23-year-old Sam " Twizz " Pearson , recently competed in the first-ever Fortnite World Cup final . While the team finished in last place , they still walked away with around NZ$76,000 each and such figures are n't at all unusual . <p> But that 's the size of the market . At esports arenas around the world such as the Copper Box Arena in London and the KeyArena in Seattle pack in tens of thousands of fans for events . Esports centres at the Staples Centre in LA and the Sydney Cricket Ground show esport events drawing crowds comparable to high-profile " proper " sports events . <p> New Zealand joins that list too , with Eden Park announcing the creation of its own ezports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destination , incubator for young players , and will give professional Oceanic teams -- such as the Dire Wolves group , famed for its flagship League of Legends team -- a place to train , compete and broadcast . <p> The crowd at the ESL ONE Counter-Strike video game tournament at the Lanxess Arena in Cologne , western Germany , on July 5 , 2019 . ( Photo : INA FASSBENDER/AFP via Getty Images ) <h> Developers , developers , developers <p> It 's not just the consumer end which is thriving : game development is one of New Zealand 's fastest-growing tech sectors . In 2019 , New Zealand interactive game developers earned more than NZ$200m , more than doubling 2017 earnings . And get this : 96% of the industry 's earnings came from export . <p> That 's a huge opportunity . Industry group The New Zealand Game Developers Association says that if the industry can maintain its average annual growth , the country could be looking at a new billion-dollar industry as soon as 2025 . <p> That 's a best-case scenario of course , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity . Game developers such as Henderson-based Grinding Gear Games ( acquired by Chinese tech company Tencent in 2018 for more than NZ$100m ) and Auckland-based Rocketwerkz are looking to do just that . <p> Rocketwerkz , founded by Dean Hall ( creator of hit survival game DayZ ) has just moved into new premises -- the penthouse floors of PWC tower at Commercial Bay . It 's a state-of-the-art fit-out with stupidly fast internet supplied via Hyperfibre , Chorus 's new broadband technology . <p> Capable of delivering speeds of up to 4,000 megabits per second -- about 40 times as fast as the average domestic Kiwi connection -- it 's more than capable of meeting the bandwidth-hungry company 's requirements . <p> " We 've been on Hyperfibre for about a month or so and we 've certainly found that not only is it faster , it 's more reliable , " says Rocketwerkz COO Stephen Knightly . <p> Knightly says that Hyperfibre is a good fit for the company , which would otherwise have to install its own dedicated fibre to the office , a job requiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Hyperfibre has filled that gap between a broadband connection and buying our own dedicated fibre connection , " he says . <p> " Amongst all the other things you have to do while building a new office , the fact that we can just call up Orcon and within a week or two actually have significantly better internet just here for us was great . It 's been one of the easiest things to organise while moving into a new office . " <p> In addition to stable and very fast internet , Knightly says that packet loss -- information sent over the internet that does n't get delivered for whatever reason -- has been vastly improved . <p> " Before we had packet loss around 25% , " he says . " Now we get zero .

@@32408237 <h> Ambulance at the top of the cliff : the tech making paramedics fast and smarter <p> Technology has the potential to save the lives of communities with health issues , as long as it is n't to hard to use . Ben Fahy learns how St John is using the Internet of Things to respond faster and better to emergencies . <p> In March this year , the day before Aotearoa first went into Covid-19 lockdown , St John New Zealand deputy chief executive Pete Loveridge was regaling an audience with tales of his organisation 's experience with the Internet of Things ( IoT ) . After recounting an entertaining story about the time his smart toothbrush told him he had poor brushing technique -- an example of the ' Internet of Pointless Things ' , in his words -- he played a video featuring a man named Terry , this time illustrating what Loveridge calls the ' Internet of People 's Things ' . <p> Tears welled in Terry 's eyes as he talked about the time he fell over in his kitchen and was unable to reach the phone to call anyone for help . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move out of their own homes . Terry was among that number , but after that accident , he was n't sure he could remain there . He needed to feel safe , and his loved ones needed to know he could get help if he needed it . A St John medical alarm was the thing that gave everyone the confidence required for him to stay -- and the thing that gives the organisation 's team the opportunity to ask the question that matters most to them : are you OK ? <p> Loveridge admits that previous iterations of the alarm system were a bit on the bulky side , but function beats form in this context : more than anything else , the device needed to be bulletproof and work every time . He 's seen too many hardware peddlers offer him shiny new solutions that end up being too difficult for older people to install , need charging at night ( when his customers are more likely to need them ) and require another set of software for his own team to install and integrate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been with the company for 22 years and has been working with St John since 2001 . He says that choosing a favourite example of IoT in action among its customers is like choosing a favourite child , but St John stands out both for the tangible benefits that connected devices have had on its customers ' lives and for how the organisation has used continual experimentation to improve the way it works . <p> The alarms themselves used to rely on the customer 's landline to call out if there was an emergency , which meant users had to stay fairly close to the physical hub in their home . The newest version of the alarm , however , takes the form of a medallion that can be worn around the neck , which stays charged for up to a month and communicates primarily through the cellular network ( with the landline used as a back-up ) . Launched three months ago , this new technological step means that customers can press a button and talk through the alarm unit to the contact centre . <p> McLay sees the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it says on the tin : increasing mobility . Users might now have renewed confidence in mowing the lawn , spending time in the garden , or getting out into their community . For Loveridge , it 's another great example of his ' IoPT ' in action ; balancing technology with human interaction , and delivering tangible and meaningful results . <p> St John want to move from a reactive to a preemptive model , and use technology to keep people healthy ( Photo : supplied ) <h> Each to their own <p> One of the most challenging aspects for St John is in its demographic : many of its customers have lower technology literacy , so newer solutions may not actually be the most effective -- or may encounter resistance . <p> Voice-activated technology may seem like an obvious answer here , with people able to ask their smart speaker to call in an emergency . But Loveridge says its trials with Amazon Alexa in customers ' homes showed those who were less tech-savvy or who had age-related memory issues tended to forget the name of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a card above Alexa to remind them , " he says , which is not too helpful in an emergency . <p> While Loveridge certainly is n't anti-technology , his work has shown him some of the blindspots of the people who develop it -- and the lengths some will go to make sure they walk a mile in their customers ' shoes . St John is currently working with a company that has developed a tablet device to check on elderly customers ' health . It works straight out of the box and syncs easily with other devices , but St John also had its developers wear glasses with Vaseline smeared all over them and said " try to operate this tablet " . <p> " Because that 's what it might be like for someone with early signs of cataracts , " Loveridge says . And the lesson is that you need to closely observe customer behaviour and design appropriate solutions for your specific market . <h> Taking the initiative <p> Medical alarms are , by design , a reactive technology . If someone falls over and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push a button and get help ( although another quirk of St John 's customer base is that some customers , including McLay 's grandmother , have spent the night on the ground after a fall , simply because they did n't want to push the button and disturb anyone at night ) . But in some cases , its alarms are starting to be activated automatically . The organisation is currently working with EROAD , a company that monitors fleet vehicles , to install devices that can alert St John dispatchers automatically if a crash happens . Monitors worn by lone workers in remote areas can do the same . <p> But rather than just responding to events that have already happened , the next step is trying to stop accidents from happening in the first place . Ultimately St John want to move from a reactive to a more pre-emptive model , and to use their technology to try and keep people healthy . <p> " We 've been quite lucky to do a proof of concept with St John , " says McLay . " The question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is there a ' normal ' that we can assess , so that when something is abnormal , we can detect it and respond ? Is there a possibility of early intervention ? That 's our aspiration and it 's definitely on our roadmap . " <p> Initial options could include things like the temperature inside the house and sensors that can detect movement ( or lack thereof ) so if anything is awry the team can do a welfare check . In time , Loveridge says they might even be able to see if a customer 's behaviour changes after they 've taken some medication , so they could get in touch and ask them how they 're feeling . <p> Spark has been working with St John since 2001 ( Photo : supplied ) <h> Doctor , doctor , give me the news ! <p> For those of us who have embraced the quantified self and allow ourselves to be constantly monitored , the future of health is looking much more precise . The latest Apple Watch can take an electrocardiogram and notify you if there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of companies are making smart devices that can measure things like heart rate , body temperature and sleep quality , as well as things like cortisol levels for signs of stress or body fat percentage . These trackers work out what 's healthy for you , and then , if the data goes outside those boundaries , alert you to the issue . Some even believe that a wave of connected ingestibles will also offer better information about individual patients and their insides , so their treatments can be more personalised . <p> As with all the best IoT solutions , the more you know the better . And as these systems collect more data , the more adept they 're getting at providing insights . But given that health data is more sensitive than , say , information about your favourite colour setting on the smart lights , McLay says security is even more paramount . <p> " It 's a foundation of what we have to build . But this is an access point to your network , so you need to think about what info bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " <h> Home is where the heart is <p> While St John and Spark are looking to monitor homes for accidents , the big tech players ' investments into IoT platforms and their ongoing battle to dominate our homes is also making us more comfortable and efficient . <p> McLay is an Apple HomeKit advocate and says his phone is able to tell his home that he 's on his way . He 's set up rules for the air conditioning and lights automatically , and he gets notifications if the security cameras detect movement in the home . Perhaps best of all , it was relatively easy to set these things up . <p> " In the past you had to pay people a lot of money to install these kinds of products , " he says . <p> But McLay also sees potential for IoT and monitoring to improve our health at work . After a day of breathing in our mostly full offices , how much CO ? is in the air ? If it 's a bit too much , could the afternoon slump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unhealthy particulates are in the air ( and how many more dangerous toxins might be floating around after the work Christmas party ) ? If you know that people have different preferences for temperature and lighting in different areas , how can you tweak conditions for specific locations or at different times ? <p> McLay defines his role as listening to customers ' problems and bringing what he has in his kitbag or using what 's worked before for other customers . He admits that it 's taken a while for the IoT to prove itself , but after years of experimentation and some major investment into networks , things just work now : the battery life of devices is improving and the cost is decreasing ; the connectivity is more reliable , even in more remote areas ; and organisations -- and individuals -- are starting to figure out what information is valuable and how they can change their behaviour based on the insights they 're getting . <p> Like Loveridge , McLay says Terry 's story has really stuck with him . He passed away a few years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continue to tell his story in an effort to convince more people like him that the technology could enhance their final years . <p> Terry 's alarm let him remain in the place he felt most comfortable . The next iteration of the alarm will give people like him even more freedom to move about the world with confidence . And in the future , the monitoring technology on us , around us and possibly inside us will learn what 's normal and intervene when necessary . <p> " We 're all going to benefit from this , " says McLay .

@@32408239 <h> Review : The Prom is another act of cultural vandalism from Ryan Murphy <p> Another Ryan Murphy joint , another shitshow . Netflix 's The Prom , adapted from the Broadway musical of the same name , is the latest outrage from writer-director Ryan Murphy , and Sam Brooks has had enough . <p> I 'll put this up front : I think Ryan Murphy is one of the worst things to happen to television in the past decade . Time after time , Murphy has run a promising concept into the ground , through lack of vision , depth and follow-through . Even when he does make good work -- both seasons of American Crime Story are rightly acclaimed , as is Pose -- it has the same grubby affect as the rest of his work . Camp is a safe place for Ryan Murphy , because it means his work is relieved from the burden of being actually good . <p> It 's this success that has given him scope to adapt not only some of the most salacious stories of our time -- the OJ Simpson trial , the Gianni Versace murder and , soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our most important queer texts . In recent years he 's given us his movie-of-the-week adaptation of Larry Kramer 's The Normal Heart , the definitive literary response to the AIDS crisis , and his Netflix version of The Boys in the Band , the first mainstream play that addressed living as a gay man , way back in the ' 60s . These adaptations are aggressively fine : made with zero style or flair , but dotted with recognisable faces giving colourful performances . They are in no way worthy of their source material , and add absolutely nothing to it . They are pale imitations of titanic works of art . <p> The Prom , a poppy Broadway musical first performed in 2016 , is neither The Normal Heart nor The Boys in the Band . It 's not a seminal piece of queer fiction , it 's merely a great show that was critically acclaimed but commercially troubled . But it 's beloved by those who know it , and utterly foreign to those who do n't . Chances are , a vast majority of viewers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> That this feature film will be their first exposure to The Prom is an atrocity . The sharp and uplifting musical has been put through the classic Murphy process , with pitiful results . Roles originally written for Broadway stalwarts have been handed to stars -- Meryl Streep , Nicole Kidman and James Corden -- who are ill-suited for them . The music , produced by Glee music producer Adam Anders , sounds as though it 's been run through a dishwasher and is so terribly lip-synced that it makes you wonder if anybody actually learned the songs to begin with . <p> The plot of The Prom is very loosely based on real events . Back in 2010 , Constance McMillen planned to bring her girlfriend to her senior prom , but was banned from attending by the school board . Celebrities got wind of it , and helped sponsor another prom , where the couple could attend without prejudice . <p> The Prom takes the broad arc of this depressing yet ultimately uplifting story and puts a few twists and accessories on it . Instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's two reputationally bankrupt Broadway stars , Dee Dee Allen ( Meryl Streep ) and Barry Glickman ( James Corden ) who arrive in the teen 's small town to save the day in person . Perpetual chorus girl Angie ( Nicole Kidman ) and former sitcom star Trent ( Andrew Rannells ) come along for the ride . <p> You know what happens next : Emma ( newcomer Jo Ellen Pellman ) finds her confidence , the bigots who oppressed her discover tolerance , and the Broadway stars learn to be a little less craven . It 's an arc that 's hard to mess up , but nearly every aspect of Murphy 's adaptation works against it , draining the plucky soul of the stage musical bit by bit , moment by moment . <p> This is most obvious in the casting . As a theatre lover , I 've long become accustomed to the fact that the actor who originates the role in any play or musical is very rarely going to be cast in the film adaptation . The casting in The Prom is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hold a tune -- but the starfuckery is really hard to ignore . Instead of watching an actor sink into a role , you 're always watching a very famous person sing and dance . As Dee Dee , Meryl Streep does her best Glenn Close impression , glazing every line and glance with a massive dose of ham . Nicole Kidman is uncharacteristically fun and loose as Angie , but she 's neither a belter nor a hoofer , and is never believable as a chorus girl , past , present or future . And , well , if casting the straight James Corden as a gay man is n't inherently problematic in 2020 , then his overly effete , breathily lisping performance is a flat-out hate crime . It 's hard to believe that he was once a beloved thespian , because what he does here is the acting equivalent of a pianist slamming their hands on the keys and hoping that some of the notes are the right ones . <p> Everybody else is more or less fine , with Kerry Washington a bizarre standout as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scandal-like intensity that nobody else even tries to approach . With the exception of Rannells , not a single person in the cast is a Broadway singer . Which , somewhat ironically , does n't much matter given the production slathered over what , in their original form , were great songs . Everybody 's voice is processed and cleaned up to the point where they barely sound like themselves anymore . The songs , whether a heartfelt ballad or a big first-act closer , sound cheap and nasty , as though played on a child 's Casiotone . The Prom takes the strong bones of the original soundtrack and crushes them into mush -- it sounds like another episode of Glee , and nobody needs any more fucking Glee . <p> The cast of The Prom , if you can see them past all the lighting . ( Photo : Netflix ) <p> Ryan Murphy now has 21 directing credits to his name , across both television and film , and it boggles the mind that he still has so little grasp on the basics of his chosen medium @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of rhythm , cohesion , or simple adherence to where people are standing in relation to each other at any given moment . This incompetence renders the emotional crux of the film , a cruel prank on Emma , impossible to follow , either cinematically or emotionally . <p> The musical numbers are lit with all the garish clumsiness of a first year design student having a hoon on Photoshop , and the choreography and editing might be even worse . These scenes do n't just highlight the main cast 's lack of dancing ability , they make it look like these actors are incapable of any movement whatsoever . If it seems cruel to blame Murphy for everything that goes wrong with this project , I 'd point out that each one of his shows have identical flaws : the same messiness , the same gaudiness , the same technical ineptitude . It seems that working with talent does nothing to eclipse his lack of it . <p> The unfortunate thing about The Prom is that it 's business as usual for television 's most successful charlatan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simplistic reimagining of Golden Age Hollywood , a somehow more misogynist take on One Flew Over the Cuckoo 's Nest 's Nurse Ratched , and a second season of 2019 's worst show , The Politician . He 's a magpie in a jewellery store , plundering the best bits of our history and culture for his own gain , and tainting them with his shit . He reframes stories through his garish lens , making them uglier and shallower as a result . But what makes The Prom unique , and especially sad , is that the musical has n't had the chance to become its own cultural artefact yet . And now ? Now , it 'll only ever be known as the shit Ryan Murphy musical . <p> ( If you want to see one of the original show 's best songs , performed how it 's meant to be performed , by the singer it was written for , I give you Beth Leavel singing ' The Lady 's Improving ' .

When he woke up after surgery , he could no longer form new long-term memories , despite retaining normal cognitive abilities , language and short-term working memory . <p> His condition ultimately revealed that the brain 's ability to create long-term memories is a distinct process that depends on the hippocampus . <p> Scientists had discovered where memories are made . But how they are made remained unknown . <p> Now , neuroscientists at Harvard Medical School ( HMS ) have taken a decisive step in the quest to understand the biology of long-term memory and find ways to intervene when memory deficits occur with age or disease . <p> Newly identified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they describe a newly identified mechanism that neurons in the adult mouse hippocampus use to regulate signals they receive from other neurons , in a process that appears critical for memory consolidation and recall . <p> The Study was led by Lynn Yap , HMS graduate student in neurobiology , and Michael Greenberg , Chair of Neurobiology in the Blavatnik Institute at HMS. <p> " Memory is essential to all aspects of human existence . The question of how we encode memories that last a lifetime is a fundamental one , and our Study gets to the very heart of this phenomenon , " Professor Greenberg said . <p> As well as being the HMS Nathan Marsh Pusey Professor of Neurobiology , he is Corresponding Author of the Study . <p> Activating sparse neurons <p> The researchers observed that new experiences activate sparse populations of neurons in the hippocampus that express two genes , Fos and Scg2 . <p> These genes allow neurons to fine-tune inputs from so-called inhibitory interneurons , cells that dampen neuronal excitation . In this way , small groups of disparate neurons may form persistent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " This mechanism likely allows neurons to better talk to each other so that the next time a memory needs to be recalled , the neurons fire more synchronously . We think that coincident activation of this Fos-mediated circuit is potentially a necessary feature for memory consolidation , for example , during sleep , and also memory recall in the brain , " Yup said . <p> Circuit Orchestration <p> In order to form memories , the brain must somehow wire an experience into neurons so that when these neurons are reactivated , the initial experience can be recalled . <p> In their Study , Greenberg , Yap and team set out to explore this process by looking at the gene Fos . <p> First described in neuronal cells by Greenberg and colleagues in 1986 , Fos is expressed within minutes after a neuron is activated . <p> Scientists have taken advantage of this property , using Fos as a marker of recent neuronal activity to identify brain cells that regulate thirst , torpor , and many other behaviours . <p> Critical role of Fos <p> Scientists hypothesised that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but for decades , the precise function of the gene has remained a mystery . <p> To investigate , the researchers exposed mice to new environments and looked at pyramidal neurons , the principal cells of the hippocampus . They found that relatively sparse populations of neurons expressed Fos after exposure to a new experience . <p> Next , they prevented these neurons from expressing Fos , using a virus-based tool delivered to a specific area of the hippocampus , which left other cells unaffected . <p> Mice that had Fos blocked in this manner showed significant memory deficits when assessed in a maze that required them to recall spatial details , indicating that the gene plays a critical role in memory formation . <p> The researchers studied the differences between neurons that expressed Fos and those that did not . Using optogenetics to turn inputs from different nearby neurons on or off , they discovered that the activity of Fos-expressing neurons was most strongly affected by two types of interneurons . <p> Neurons expressing Fos were found to receive increased activity-dampening , or inhibitory , signals from one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ type . <p> These signalling patterns disappeared in neurons with blocked Fos expression . <p> " What 's critical about these interneurons is that they can regulate when and how much individual Fos-activated neurons fire , and also when they fire relative to other neurons in the circuit . We think that at long last we have a handle on how Fos may in fact support memory processes , specifically by orchestrating this type of circuit plasticity in the hippocampus , " Yup said . <p> Imagine the day <p> The researchers further probed the function of Fos , which codes for a transcription factor protein that regulates other genes . They used single-cell sequencing and additional genomic screens to identify genes activated by Fos and found that one gene in particular , Scg2 , played a critical role in regulating inhibitory signals . <p> In mice , with experimentally silenced Scg2 , Fos-activated neurons in the hippocampus displayed a defect in signalling from both types of interneurons . These mice also had defects in theta and gamma rhythms , brain properties thought to be critical features of learning and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a neuropeptide protein that can be cleaved into four distinct forms , which are then secreted . In the current Study , Yap and colleagues discovered that neurons appear to use these neuropeptides to fine-tune inputs they receive from interneurons . <p> Together , the team 's experiments suggest that after a new experience , a small group of neurons simultaneously express Fos , activating Scg2 and its derived neuropeptides , in order to establish a coordinated network with its activity regulated by interneurons . <p> " When neurons are activated in the hippocampus after a new experience , they are not necessarily linked together in any particular way in advance . But interneurons have very broad axonal arbors , meaning they can connect with and signal to many cells at once . This may be how a sparse group of neurons can be linked together to ultimately encode a memory , " Professor Greenberg said . <p> Possible Molecular Mechanism <p> The Study findings represent a possible molecular- and circuit-level mechanism for long-term memory . They shed new light on the fundamental biology of memory formation and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ researchers note , however , that while the results are an important step in our understanding of the inner workings of memory , numerous unanswered questions about the newly identified mechanisms remain . <p> " We are not quite at the answer yet , but we can now see many of the next steps that need to be taken . If we can understand this process better , we will have new handles on memory and how to intervene when things go wrong , whether in age-related memory loss or neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer 's disease , " Professor Greenberg said . <p> The findings also represent the culmination of decades of research , even as they open new avenues of Study that will likely take decades more to explore , he added . <p> " I arrived at Harvard in 1986 , just as my Paper describing the discovery that neuronal activity can turn on genes was published .

@@32440231 <h> Lack of south Auckland abortion services ' unacceptable ' <p> Local abortion services remain unavailable to people living in much of the sprawling south Auckland area - which has a population of close to 600,000 and encapsulates some of the most deprived suburbs of New Zealand - despite the issue being repeatedly raised for more than 12 years . <p> People living within the Counties Manukau District Health Board ( DHB ) catchment who need an abortion must travel to the affluent central Auckland suburb of Greenlane . Experts say this creates an access barrier for south Auckland women . <p> Financial barriers created by the lack of a local service can include the cost of travel , childcare and taking time off work . For people living in Counties Manukau , where the population is younger , and more deprived than elsewhere in New Zealand , those costs can be significant . The area is also home to a high number of Pacific peoples , of whom 64 percent are ' highly deprived ' , according to Health Ministry data . The Counties Manukau DHB describes Pacific peoples ' engagement with and access to health services when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For 42 years , the Auckland District Health Board 's Epsom Day Clinic , at Greenlane Clinical Centre , has been the only public hospital that provides first trimester abortion services for people living anywhere in the Counties Manukau catchment , which covers east and South Auckland from Otahuhu to south of Port Waikato . <p> Concern about the lack of local abortion services in south Auckland was first raised in 2008 , by the Government-appointed Abortion Supervisory Committee , during a visit to south Auckland . In 2014 , the issue was raised a second time by the Committee during the licence renewal process , and a third time in its annual report . <p> " We are extremely concerned with the access issues of greater Auckland , particularly the burden placed on the women of south Auckland in relation to their access to local services , " the report read . <p> In 2017 , the Committee described the situation in Auckland as " unacceptable and untenable with a climbing and sprawling population " , and called for the establishment of a first trimester service in south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March . But in south Auckland , there is still no service . <p> For solo mum Amber* , accessing an abortion earlier this year meant an hour-long slog to Greenlane , then another hour back to her south Auckland home . The trip - which she had to make twice , for two appointments - cost her petrol and parking money , which she could barely afford . <p> Each time Amber took the motorway north to the clinic , she passed the East Tamaki off ramp that leads to her local hospital , Middlemore , where she wishes abortion services were available . " It would 've been much more convenient " , she says . <p> Even before dealing with the drive out of Counties Manukau , Amber faced the challenge of arranging appointment times that coincided with her kids being at school . <p> Once that was sorted , Amber says she was n't supposed to drive herself home after having the procedure . But at about $40 each way , a taxi was out of her price range and she did n't have anyone to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or train , she would n't have got back to south Auckland in time to pick her kids up from school . She had no choice , she says . <p> " I lied . I told them I had a friend to drive me back , but I did n't . I drove myself . " <p> It 's not only people living in Counties Manukau who face this issue . Waitemata DHB - which covers Auckland 's North Shore to north of Wellsford , as well as parts of West Auckland - also sends people to Greenlane for first trimester abortions . <p> According to the DHBs , 70 percent of women who access abortion services at Greenlane come from outside the area - 40 percent from Counties Manukau , and " approximately 30 percent each for Waitemata and Auckland " . <p> From parts of the Waitemata and Counties Manukau catchments , a return trip by car to Greenlane Clinical Centre can take more than two hours , with travel times varying depending on traffic .

She told RNZ she was frustrated that local services are still not offered to people in South Auckland . <p> " We 've been aware of this issue for over a decade and it is something that at the time of the disestablishment of the committee we were still concerned about . " <p> Due to the country working under COVID-19 restrictions from the day after the Act came into force , there was no " handover meeting " where Dame Linda and the Committee 's two other members were able to speak with senior Health Ministry officials about their concerns , she said . <p> Had such a meeting taken place , the lack of abortion services in South Auckland would have been " amongst the issues that we would have raised , " Dame Linda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has been so disappointing for so long . " <p> In information provided to Parliament last year , the Supervisory Committee noted the reasons why a DHB might not provide abortion services could include " conscientious objection , perceived community resistance , or resistance of senior medical professionals within a women 's health service . " <p> RNZ asked the Counties Manukau DHB why local services were still not available , when concerns about the lack of local abortion services available to women in South Auckland were first raised 12 years ago . <p> The Counties Manukau DHB has not responded to that , or other questions from RNZ . Instead , questions were passed on to the Auckland DHB , which is also yet to respond . <p> In 2018 , more than a decade after the concerns about the lack of abortion services in south Auckland were first raised , the need for a service review in the region was noted as an " emerging issue " in planning documents published by both Waitemata and Auckland DHBs . <p> In October this year , the region 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of first trimester abortion services within the Waitemata and Counties Manukau catchment areas . <p> " We want to increase equity and access to high quality first trimester abortion services for women living in Waitemata DHB , Auckland DHB and Counties Manukau , " the document reads . <p> " This is an opportunity to improve access to high quality first trimester abortion services for women who currently face access barriers . This service will improve women 's choices in terms of where she can access a first trimester abortion , and ensure that women 's choice regarding access to medical and surgical options is respected . " <p> South Auckland-based Labour MP Louisa Wall said barriers to accessing good quality , timely healthcare are an ongoing issue for women in south Auckland , but abortion law reform was a step in the right direction . <p> " I think that the passing of the Abortion Legislation Act will make it a necessity that we provide those surgical and medical services within the catchment area .

Under prediction No. 2 - " The Cloud Changes Development " - it notes that the cloud not only makes software development much faster , but that the process becomes " more iterative . " It explains : " When changes can be made on the fly , companies can deploy once and then adapt an application as business needs change or become clearer . " The rise of talented developers in networked environments , this prediction adds , will " challenge traditional systems integrators that are used to hiding behind billable hours and big bang projects . " <p> But under the heading " The Productive Enterprise , " Nucleus singles out as its No. 1 prediction how the social-network elements championed by Salesforce.com 's Chatter , and other vendors like HubSpot and Yammer , will drive steep , company-changing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " will leverage social technology to build the productive enterprise , " says Nucleus . " They will take advantage of mobile device access to collaborative networks to spur employees to work during down time , day time , and night time , " for one thing . <p> A Lot Like EMail 's Rise <p> Rebecca Wettemann , vice president , research , for Nucleus , tells CFOworld.com that the advance of social networking in the enterprise merits its No. 1 prediction because the trend is comparable to the rise of e-mail 10 to 15 years ago , with the enormous changes that it brought to operations . <p> " We 've found , in fact , that one of the most common use cases for applications like Chatter and Yammer is for executives to share insights , news , results , and other information that would normally be on a bulletin board or mass e-mail , " she says . " It also enables finance to keep track of things it would n't necessarily know about otherwise , like activities with a particular client or project .

No. 4 -- " Users Choose Big Over Best of Breed " - describes the tendency of IT buyers to no longer concentrate on vendors that " offer targeted functionality with clear net benefits , " rather than " broad commodity products . " Today , Nucleus argues , large-scale vendors like IBM and Oracle " improve productivity by delivering more functionality in a single application and enable organizations to do more with a single data source .

@@42500237 <h> The new energy diet <p> Sal Azzaro , director of facilities for Time Warner Cable , is trying to cram additional power into prime real estate at the company 's 22 facilities in New York . " Its gone wild , " says Azzaro " Where we had 20-amp circuits before , we now have 60-amp circuits . " And , he says , " there is a much greater need now for a higher level of redundancy and a higher level of fail-safe than ever before . " <p> When it comes to the power crunch , Time Warner Cable is in good company . In February , Jonathan Koomey , a staff scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and a consulting professor at Stanford University , published a study showing that in 2005 , organizations worldwide spent $7.2 billion to provide their servers and associated cooling and auxiliary equipment with 120 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity . This was double the power used in 2001 . <p> According to Koomey , the growth is occurring among volume servers ( those that cost less than US$25,000 per unit ) , with the aggregate power consumption of midrange ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $500,000 ) servers remaining relatively constant . <p> One way Time Warner Cable is working on this problem is by installing more modular power gear that scales as its needs grow . Oversized power supplies , power distribution units ( PDU ) and uninterruptible power supplies ( UPS ) tie up capital funds , are inefficient and generate excess heat . Time Warner Cable has started using Liebert Corp . ' s new NX modular UPS system , which scales in 20-kilowatt increments , to replace some of its older units . <p> " The question was how to go forward and rebuild your infrastructures when you have a limited amount of space , " Azzaro says . <p> With the NX units , instead of setting up two large UPSs , he set up five modules - three live and the other two on hot standby . That way , any two of the five modules could fail or be shut down for service and the system would still operate at 100 per cent load . <p> Other approaches <p> Some users are trying innovative approaches . One new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined heat and power , or cogeneration , which combines a generator with a specialized chiller that turns the exhausted waste heat into a source of chilled water . <p> Another new approach is to build data centres that operate off DC rather than AC power . In a typical data centre , the UPSs convert the AC power coming from the mains into DC power and then back into AC again . Then the server power supplies again convert the power to DC for use within the server . <p> Each time the electricity is switched between AC and DC , some of that power is converted into heat . Converting the AC power to DC power just once , as it comes into the data centre , eliminates that waste . Rackable Systems Inc. in Fremont , Calif. has a rack-mounted power supply that converts power from 220 VAC to -48VDC in the cabinet and then distributes the power via a bus bar to the servers . <p> On a larger scale , last summer the Lawrence Berkeley lab set up an experimental data centre , hosted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 380 VDC power for distribution to the racks , eliminating the use of PDUs altogether . Overall , the test system used 10 per cent to 20 per cent less power than a comparable AC data centre . <p> For Rick Simpson , president of Belize Communication and Security in Belmopan , Belize , power management means using wind and solar energy . <p> Simpson 's company supports wireless data and communications relays in the Central American wilderness for customers including the U.K. Ministry of Defence and the U.S. embassy in Belize . He builds in enough battery power - 10,000 amp hours - to run for two weeks before even firing up the generators at the admittedly small facility . <p> " We have enough power redundancy at hand to make sure that nothing goes down - ever , " Simpson says . So even though the country was hit by Category 4 hurricanes in 2000 and 2001 , " we have n't been down in 15 years , " he says . <p> Belize Communications equipment all runs directly off the batteries and UPSs from Falcon Electric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to charge the batteries . <p> Scaling up <p> While there is a lot of talk lately about building green data centres , and many hardware vendors are touting the efficiency of their products , the primary concern is still just ensuring you have a reliable source of adequate power . <p> Even though each core on a multicore processor uses less power than it would if it was on its own motherboard , a rack filled with quad-core blades consumes more power than a rack of single-core blades , according to Intel . <p> " It used to be you would have one power cord coming into the cabinet , then there were dual power cords , " says Bob Sullivan , senior consultant at The Uptime Institute in Santa Fe , N.M . " Now with over 10 kilowatts being dissipated in a cabinet , it is not unusual to have four power cords , two A 's and two B 's . " <p> With electricity consumption rising , data centres are running out of power before they run out of raised floor space . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centres will not have sufficient power for expansion by 2008 . <p> " Power is becoming more of a concern , " says Dan Agronow , chief technology officer at The Weather Channel Interactive in Atlanta . " We could put way more servers physically in a cabinet than we have power for those servers . " <p> The real cost , however , is not just in the power being used but in the costs of the infrastructure equipment - generators , UPSs , PDUs , cabling and cooling systems . For the highest level of redundancy and reliability - a Tier 4 data centre - for every kilowatt used for processing , some $22,000 is spent on power and cooling infrastructure . <p> To cut down on costs and ensure that there is enough power requires a close look at each component individually . The next step is to figure out how each component impacts the data centre as a whole . Steve Yellin , vice president of product marketing strategies at Aperture Technologies Inc. , a data centre software firm in Stamford , Conn. , says that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall data centre efficiency - the chip , the server , the rack and the data centre as a whole . Savings in any one of these components yields savings in each of the higher area above it . <p> " The big message is that people have to get away from thinking about pieces of the system , " Stanford University 's Koomey says . " When you start thinking about the whole system , then spending that $20 extra on a more-efficient power supply will save you money in the aggregate . " <p> Going modular <p> There are strategies for cutting power in each area Yellin outlined above . For example , multicore processors with lower clock speeds reduce power at the processor level . And server virtualization , better fans and high-efficiency power supplies - such as those certified by the 80 Plus program - cut power utilization at the server level . <p> Five years ago , the average power supply was operating at 60 per cent to 70 per cent efficiency , says Kent Dunn , partnerships director at PC power-management firm Verdiem Corp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 80 Plus . He says that each 80 Plus power supply will save data centre operators about 130 to 140 kilowatt-hours of power per year . <p> Rack-mounted cooling and power supplies such as Liebert 's XD CoolFrame and American Power Conversion Corp . ' s InfraStruXure cut waste at the rack level . And at the data centre level , there are more efficient ways of distributing air flow , using outside air or liquid cooling , and doing computational fluid dynamics modeling of the data centre for optimum placement of servers and air ducts . <p> " We 've deployed a strategy within our facility that has hot and cold aisles , so the cold air is where it needs to be and we are not wasting it , " says Fred Duball , director of the service management organization for the Virginia state government 's IT agency , which just opened a 192,000-square-foot data centre in July and will be ramping up the facility over the next year or so . " We are also using automation to control components and keep lights off in areas that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit <p> There is no single answer that meets the needs of every data centre operator . <p> When Elbert Shaw , a project manager at Science Applications International Corp . in San Diego , consolidated U.S. Army IT operations in Europe for several dozen locations into four data centres , he had to come up with a unique solution for each location . At a new facility , he was able to put in 48-inch floors and run the power and cooling underneath . But one data centre being renovated only had room for a 12-inch floor and two feet of space above the ceiling . So instead of bundling the cables , which could have eaten up eight of those 12 inches , blocking most of the airflow , he got permission to unbundle and flatten out the cables . In other instances he used 2-inch underfloor channels , rather than the typical 4-inch variety , and turned to overhead cabling at one location . <p> " Little tricks that are OK in the 48-inch floor cause problems with the 12-inch floor when you renovate a site , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and each has its own little quirks , " Koomey says . <p> Power management tips <p> Various experts suggest the following ways of getting all you can from your existing power setup : <p> - Do n't oversize . Adopt a modular strategy for power and cooling that grows with your needs instead of buying a monolithic system that will meet your needs years down the road . <p> - Plan for expansion . Although you do n't want to buy the extra equipment yet , install conduits that are large enough to accommodate additional cables to meet future power needs . <p> - Look at each component . Power-efficient CPUs , power supplies and fans reduce the amount electricity used by a server . But be sure to look at their impact on other components . For example , quad-core chips use less power than four single chips but may require additional memory . <p> - Widen racks . Use wider racks and run the cables to the side , rather than down the back where they block the air flow . Air flows from the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . There are no inlet and outlet vents on the sides . It is similar to a PC , and you can put a piece of plywood along the side of server without affecting airflow through the machine . But , if you put the wood along the back , it will overheat . <p> - Install a UPS bypass . This is a power cable that goes around the UPS rather than through it . That way , if the UPS is taken offline , there 's still a route available for the electricity to flow through and you have power redundancy when you bring a UPS device down for maintenance . <p> Copyright 2020 IDG Communications .
