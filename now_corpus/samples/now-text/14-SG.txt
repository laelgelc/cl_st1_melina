The company recently released the N3 and R5 smartphones in a number of Asian markets , and is now gearing up to launch three new smartphones according to recent leaks . The Oppo 3005 and 3007 models were recently leaked on China 's TENNA and now the 3006 model has been certified by SIRIM in Malaysia . <p> Although no confirmed details on the 3006 model are available , it is expected to be very similar to the 3005 and 3007 models . The smartphone may be a mid-range offering with a 4.7 " 1280 x 720 HD resolution display , 1.2GHz chipset , 1GB RAM , 8GB internal storage with a microSD card slot for further expansion , 8MP rear camera , 5MP front-facing camera , dual-SIM support and 4G LTE connectivity . The device could also be quite thin for a mid-range device at just 8.95mm and weigh around 126 grams , which is quite decent for a smartphone with a 4.7 " display . It will be running Android 4.4.4 KitKat , with Oppo 's ColorOS 2.0 UI layer running on top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ includes a number of changes over the previous version that was based on Android 4.3 JellyBean . <p> It is not clear if the device will be launched in many other markets apart from China and Malaysia , but since Oppo is aiming at expanding its presence in new markets and also increasing focus on smartphones priced at around $160 , we can expect to see these smartphones launch in a number of Asian markets and perhaps some markets in the west as well , at least as an unlocked device . The prices should be quite reasonable too we reckon , making it one of the most affordable 4G LTE smartphones that you can get when it launches in the coming weeks . We hope to find out more details on this one in the coming weeks .

This year , it is an apparels industry symposium on valuing and accounting for natural capital . <p> Today , this sounds such a perfectly natural statement . After all , it is almost three years since Puma published the first " EP&amp;L , " a cradle-to-gate valuation statement of its environmental externalities . And four years since TEEB ( " The Economics of Ecosystems &amp; Biodiversity " ) published a business framework to value and account for natural capital . But how many of us , if asked five years ago , in 2009 , could have predicted such traction for the idea that natural capital must not only be acknowledged as a foundation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported to the public ? <h> " <p> It is about the inadequacy of today 's statutory reporting architecture to report the impacts of corporations on capitals that are not privately owned by shareholders , but by a whole universe of stakeholders <p> This is certainly progress , but two questions still bother me . <p> The first is whether all this progress ( to use Marc Gunther 's words last month in The Guardian ) is ' breakthrough or buzzword ' ? Today , there are over fifty international organizations and projects with the words " natural capital " within their name . Hundreds of sustainability staff at major corporations are talking the talk . Natural capital is in fashion ( in more ways than one , given the interest of the fashion industry ) but will it get mainstreamed , the goal of TEEB ? <p> The second question is whether this ' natural capital eureka moment ' in the corporate world might cloud a wider and equally important issue , viz , the measurement , valuation , reporting , and even the notion of ' success ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Redefining success is a central concern for the B Team , for IIRC , the International Integrated Reporting Council , and others . It extends beyond the economic invisibility of natural capital in corporate management and accounting . It is about the inadequacy of today 's statutory reporting architecture to report the impacts of corporations on capitals that are not privately owned by shareholders , but by a whole universe of stakeholders . <p> Addressing these two questions needs us to recognize that business operates in a multi-dimensional world of natural , social , human , manufactured , and financial capital . It impacts not just private capital owned by shareholders ( such as land , factories , cash ) , but private capital owned by other important individuals ( such as the skills and health of staff -- i.e. forms of human capital ) , shared capital owned by communities ( local amenities ; relationships with local residents and staff , etc. -- i.e. physical and social capitals ) and public capital owned by society at large ( clean air ; a stable climate ; law and order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capitals ) . Today 's one dimensional approach which measures and reports changes to only shareholder owned financial capital in effect prioritises the financial goals of shareholders against a host of other interests of society and the planet . This is not only unsustainable , but also self-defeating : without sufficient social and natural capital , businesses can not function over time . <p> Mainstreaming the initial uptake of natural capital valuation and reporting by business -- from an initiative of few leading companies to becoming the norm for business in tomorrow 's world -- will need guidelines and rules in place , as part of statutory reporting requirements to make sure it happens , but an integrated , holistic statutory reporting . Imagine an enhanced future three-dimensional version of today 's one-dimensional annual report and accounts ... <p> I believe stakeholder reporting of this kind will redefine corporate success . We are used to managing what we measure , so a comprehensive report that measures impacts across natural , human and social capital will be more than just informative - it will be transformative . It could trigger a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I have called ' Corporation 2020 ' : one whose goals are aligned to society and the planet , one which as a rule generates positive externalities while it makes profits . <p> In other words , both the questions that still nag me have the same answer : engage businesses and accountancy regulators in an international effort to redefine corporate performance and report it in a holistic way . My hope is that the ongoing efforts of The B Team , the many partners of the Natural Capital Coalition , the accounting majors , and others will coalesce , bear fruit and make this happen . But it needs to happen fast , before our current business model has pushed us past planetary boundaries . <p> System change usually happens by default , by design or by disaster .

Croesus Retail Trust <p> Broker : OSK-DMG <p> Japan is the 3rd biggest retail market in the world with 127 million consumers contributing an average of US$54,000 per household . Croesus Retail Trust , with a 8 per cent dividend yield and close to 100 per cent occupancy rate , is the first Asia-Pacific retail business trust and the only proxy on the Singapore Exchange into the Japanese retail scene with six Japanese retail mall assets . <p> With " Abenomics " policies in place to create inflation and boost the Japanese economy , Croesus Retail Trust is poised to be one of the key beneficiaries as traffic flow at its malls has been increasing while capitalisation rates for its existing malls and other malls in Japan have been decreasing . <p> Its portfolio has a weighted average lease expiry of 10.2 years , which ensures long-term stability .

Frasers Centrepoint Trust ( FCT ) <p> Broker : CIMB <p> FCT 's Q3 and nine-month results were largely in line , with distributable profit for the first nine months at 75 per cent of our full-year forecast . Gross revenue and net property income were up 2 to 3 per cent , as the better performance at key malls more than offset the weak performance at Bedok Point . <p> FCT remains our top pick in the retail Reits space as we believe it is strong operationally with growth expected from both rental reversions and contributions from Changi City Point ( CCP ) . <p> We expect FY2015 's revenue to grow by 14 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we believe organic growth will be driven by the 39 per cent and 27 per cent of leases ( by gross rental income ) expiring in FY2015 and FY2016 , with the majority of the expiring leases emanating from Causeway Point , Northpoint and CCP . <p> Suntec Reit announced Q2 distribution per unit ( DPU ) of 2.266 cents , up marginally by 0.8 per cent year-on-year . <p> However , we note that only $5.0 million in capital distribution was made in Q2 , as opposed to $7.8 million a year ago . Excluding the capital payout , DPU would have risen 8.5 per cent year-on-year . <p> We note that Suntec Reit 's office segment continued to gain traction in Q2 , posting 4.7 per cent growth in revenue on the back of positive rental reversions . Looking ahead , Suntec Reit remains positive on its office portfolio performance .

@@2664231 <p> Lenovo is nearly ready to throw its hat in the Quad HD smartphone ring , although the K920 , due to be formally announced on August 5 , has a lot more going for it than just an outstanding , somewhat gimmicky display . <p> Hey , remember the Vibe Z2 Pro powerhouse Lenovo unintentionally spilled the beans on back in May ? Apparently , it 's to properly break cover at last in less than two weeks ' time , probably under the K920 moniker that makes it clearer we 're looking at a sequel for the Vibe Z K910 . <p> Sequel ? Huh , if only cinematic follow-ups in Hollywood would be as spectacular as this bad boy 's endless list of upgrades . The Quad HD , i.e. 2,560 x 1,440 pixels resolution , IPS display with a ginormous 6-inch diagonal is merely the tip of the iceberg , as we reckon speed addicts will be extra-dazzled by the quad-core Snapdragon 801 processor and 3 GB RAM . <p> I mean , sure , I can totally appreciate the fine aesthetical value of a handheld measuring 7.7 mm in thickness , but think about it , if Lenovo upped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell could have possibly been bumped to 5,000 mAh . <p> As things stand , the 4,000 mAh juicer should handle the pressures of the power-demanding Quad HD panel and S801 CPU rather gracefully .

Amazing ! <p> As you can imagine , the near flawless high-end Android ensemble wo n't go very easy on your budgets , with KitKat pre-loaded and 32 GB of internal storage space standard , albeit knowing Lenovo , they 'll go out of their way to undercut Samsung and LG . Sooo , $500 , $550 is a good guesstimate . Fingers crossed for a swift commercial launch on the heels of the August 5 intro , and especially , a wide-scale run in stores . 
@@2664232 <p> Singaporeans tend to have a strong attachment to space , perhaps because there is so little of it , and so little that remains the same . <p> In recent years , thousands have thronged the OH ! Open House art walks , peeking into heartland homes in Marine Parade and Tiong Bahru ; others might have experimented with a spell#7 audio tour through alleys and MRT trains . Audiences here seem to love interacting directly with spaces and excavating their stories , perhaps a spillover from our anxieties over our lack of physical heritage and fears of being cast adrift by the very spaces we call home . <p> Which brings us to the third edition of Drama Box 's IgnorLAND series , which previously brought audiences to places such as Geylang and Labrador Park . The place in this year 's spotlight is Bukit Ho Swee , most notoriously connected to the 1961 fire that wiped out thousands of homes and displaced thousands of people . Today , conspiracy theories continue to abound over the neighbourhood 's history , but Drama Box wisely avoids the ceaseless politicking of assigning blame , and chooses instead to celebrate the people who built this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour of the area with a few dramatic flourishes , a two-hour traipse through flats and shops ( comfortable clothes and shoes are recommended ) . Its narrative framework is very simplistic - an older woman ( played by Fanny Kee ) brings us around while feeding us nuggets of history and offering us a glimpse of her relationship to the area , a heavy-handed metaphor for our own relationship to the past . <p> Kee almost seems to be playing an extension of her character in Jean Tay 's popular 2008 play , Boom , an ageing mother who can not bear to let go of her decrepit home . Incidentally , Tay helped to write the script for IgnorLAND . There are clear resonances between the two scripts , which fit into the same push-pull of holding on and letting go of our past . <p> In this sense , the performance-tour does not quite do anything particularly groundbreaking . Yes , the stories told here are important and intriguing , but there is little of a new approach when it comes to exploring our country 's history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , there is nothing wrong with continually examining our links to the past , but there comes a time where we must go beyond despairing over our disappearing physical heritage , because it can confine rather than enable . <p> " The past is a cage ! " our narrator declares , dispensing similar platitudes from time to time , and she later requests that we walk " hand in hand with the past " as we leave . This is often what I find most problematic with the art of nostalgia , the way productions embrace its rosy glow but do not inspire us to reclaim what is lost , or assess the possibilities of the future - choosing to be instructive over being constructive . As much as we look back , we must also remember that we are inevitably going forward . <p> But IgnorLAND does strengthen this narrative with a timely and powerful reminder that our physical heritage is not just the attap huts that have burned down , or the languor of kampung life that has all but disappeared - but also the mortality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first people to make a living in this country , to iron out the teething pains of a young nation . <p> The elderly Mr Tay Ah Chuan , 75 , for instance , who helped to found the Beo Crescent Market Hawkers Association , had to deal with the roughness of gang life around him and smooth over conflicts affecting his hawker colleagues . Mr Tay almost glistens with pride when he points out the association 's tiny office space , and how they introduced a public address system in the hawker centre so that everyone could hear announcements at the same time , or even listen to a little light music . Then there is soya bean milk seller Alison Koh , who was elected chairman of the Hawkers Association by her fellow hawkers last year , much to her surprise , and who offers insight into what it means to adapt and be part of a community . <p> It is Drama Box 's wonderful work with these community performers - mostly senior citizens - that gives this edition of IgnorLAND its heart . It is clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a genuine and large-scale effort to engage the Bukit Ho Swee community in presenting their universe to us , and here , there is an echo of the well-received Parallel Cities performances that the theatre company also helped to curate for the 2012 Singapore Arts Festival , where audience members made voyeuristic visits to a printing factory in Kallang . <p> I hope groups will continue to wrestle with this question of space , but in ways that interrogate our past , not simply memorialise it . And Drama Box does this best when it also connects with people rather than solely fixating on place . <p> As we meandered through the tightly-packed neighbourhood , observing its lights rising against a thick night sky , there was the sense that we were interrupting others ' daily lives ( we picked up many curious passers-by at each stop ) , but that we were also part of this larger fabric of our community - a reminder not to forget who our neighbours are , and how important they were in bringing our country to life . <h> Follow ST <h> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subscriber log-ins and apologise for the inconvenience caused .

@@2868237 <h> The luxury of travelling to remote places <p> Founder Hajar Ali of this Singapore-based travel company seeks to bring travel to its most exciting , educational and comfortable peak . She spoke to Eren Cervantes-Altamirano <p> A boy from a tribe in the Omo Valley , Ethiopia . Photo by Hajar Ali <p> Are you an adventurous girl looking for an exciting trip ? Have online booking sites fell short in providing amazing ones ? Then check out Urbane Nomads : a luxury travel company seeking to deliver memorable experiences rather than simply a plane ticket and a hotel reservation . Founder Hajar Ali from Singapore , a lively woman who enjoys travel with a different flavour , said that the idea for Urbane Nomads came from her own experience . <p> " The idea for Urbane Nomads was conceived during my trip to Patagonia where I thought of a travel company specialising in luxury travel to remote places , conducting the kind of trips that I would go on myself . This is a company that started in an age when most travel bookings are made online , without an agent in the picture . Urbane Nomads was conceptualised for trips and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you have booked vacations online , as I recently did while planning my next December vacation , you will know that it can be a frustrating process . First , one has to check prices across several sites , where the difference can vary greatly . Then , if one is not familiar with the country , it is very easy to book a hotel or trip that wo n't meet your expectations . Furthermore , mainstream travel agencies are often staffed with people who are rarely familiar with the trips they sell . Thus , an agency like Urbane Nomads can help ensure that you get what you expect . <p> For example , Urbane Nomads offers a $18,700 itinerary for two to Peru , Bolivia and Chile for 22 days . In this trip , travellers visit Cuzco and the site of Machu Picchu ( Peru ) , La Paz ( Bolivia ) and La Patagonia ( Chile ) , among others . The package includes domestic transfers , tours , accommodation and some meals . Whereas the price is quite high even for travellers who live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trips incorporating off-the-beaten-track elements " . Another advantage is peace of mind , guidance and expertise from travellers who know their destinations well . <p> Urbane Nomads also markets itself as a responsible-travel company , favouring trips that do not negatively impact the environment and societies . <p> " It has everything to do with not adversely impacting on the landscape for both environmental and cultural reasons . You do n't want a mega development in a beautiful , natural environment and the luxury travel industry understands this all too well . There is a trend amongst luxury hotels located in pristine , natural areas to source materials locally , adopting the vernacular style of architecture ; an unobtrusive presence once completed . " <p> Sulphur lakes in the Danakil Depression , Ethiopia , the hottest place in the world . Photo by Hajar Ali <p> Hajar sees a larger purpose for her company in pioneering in a new way of travelling . She believes that tourism can be a positive force in the economic development of the areas where her company has operations . " With luxury tourists , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower numbers of visitors , " she said , citing one advantage . She also believes that luxury lodges and local business have become very aware of their social and economic responsibilities where they operate . Thus , they provide employment and further business opportunities to local communities . <p> She sees a lot of potential in this kind of travel in areas like Pakistan , Afghanistan and Mongolia , where tourists are not as common because of the political situation . " Just a small increase in tourism would create an industry and jobs that would sustain many . To serve this need , I came up with another initiative called ' Travel Like A Humanitarian ' which is a platform for NGOs to market their travel-related offerings to travellers . " <p> For me , I would like to explore in more depth the social responsibility of travelling . One of my concerns is that some foreign companies offering luxury accommodations benefit from exploiting local resources , which often belong to indigenous populations . However , Hajar believes that even Western businesses are starting to develop alternative models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually stayed for a good many years in the country and know it very well , might have married a local and are able to incorporate Western standards of service and quality as the tourists have come to expect , within a responsibly run business . " <p> Urbane Nomads offers an interesting proposal , and one that will suit the needs of many travellers seeking to book extraordinary adventures . Whether it is a honeymoon or a family vacation , a trip designed specifically for you may be worth a little extra money . Nevertheless , as social responsibility in travelling still remains primarily in our hands , let 's be sure that we make choices that truly benefit communities , do not destroy the environment , or negatively impact local communities .

@@4808238 <p> SINGAPORE -- To better capture price movements of flats in the newer towns and the varying age profiles of units across the island , the Housing and Development Board ( HDB ) will revise how the Resale Price Index ( RPI ) is computed . <p> The revision is also driven by the fact that there is a wider range of flats on the market , differing in terms of designs and attributes . <p> Writing on his blog yesterday , National Development Minister Khaw Boon Wan announced that the HDB had recently completed a review and shared the reasons the authorities had re-examined the methodology , which was last tweaked more than 12 years ago . <p> " With significant changes in the HDB resale market , the current RPI may not adequately reflect the resale market . It is therefore timely to review the RPI methodology to better capture price changes over time and control for the variations in attributes of the resale flats transacted , " said Mr Khaw . <p> " This will allow the index to continue serving its purpose of providing timely and reliable information on resale market movements .

Among other things , the range of flats available on the market has widened . For example , newer flat models , including taller blocks , are increasingly being transacted in the resale market . The Government has also reintroduced three-room flats since 2004 , after the current RPI was last revised in April 2002 . <p> He also pointed out that there are currently many more resale transactions for flats in newer towns such as Punggol , Sengkang and Sembawang . However , these towns are not included in the representative basket . <p> Unlike the past , the age profile of flats being transacted in the resale market varies to a greater extent .
