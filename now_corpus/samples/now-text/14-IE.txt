It 's the time of year I dread the most , and one that I hate to even start thinking about . <p> There were no past experiences that scarred me for life , or any one moment that made me detest the celebrations -- I adore Christmas and everything about it -- I just ca n't stomach New Year 's Eve . <p> I think for myself , and probably a lot of others too , the dislike of New Year 's Eve can be the same reason some might not look forward to the Christmas festivities -- it 's the pressure one feels to have this incredible time on the night . <p> And if you happen to not have that , you can really be left feeling really inadequate .

I find it can be a burden , and can force one to end the year on a low point , instead of reflecting on the good things that have happened throughout the year . <p> The end of the year can typically be associated with a time of reflection , and though I 'm usually always a ' glass half full ' type of person , I often find myself feeling that I have n't accomplished enough throughout the year , and reflecting on this , which can inevitably heed more negative thoughts . <p> However , I know not everyone feels this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associations with the festivities are my own , and wo n't be everyone else 's . <p> I know some friends who live for the night , and love to go out , forget their troubles , and party the night away .

Some just take it as a time to go out and enjoy the end of another year celebrations with friends and family , and think nothing else of it . <p> I know I have so much to be thankful for this year though : friends , family , heath and so on , so I ca n't wait for New Year 's to be finished , so I can really look forward to 2015.

A UK version of the programme , also starring Lawson , begins on Channel 4 next week , and coincides with the reissue of her entire cookbook collection . <p> Lawson is said to have sold six million books worldwide and amassed a personal fortune of ? 20m based on her fame in Britain . When it first aired in the US last year , The Taste was considered her long-overdue entr ? e into the living rooms and kitchens of Middle America .

If they remain flaccid , however -- jeopardising the chances of a third series -- then the prospects for the domestic goddess could look a lot less appetising . <p> The nation 's sweet-toothed sweetheart saw her reputation sour with the recent fraud trial of sisters Francesca and Elisabetta Grillo , formerly her close aides , whom Saatchi accused of unlawfully spending his money on frivolous luxury items including flights and designer clothing . The Grillos were acquitted , but only after a painful public trial during which Lawson was forced to admit to having used cocaine , and to smoking cannabis in front of her children . <p> The defendants claimed their spending had been the price for their silence about Lawson 's alleged drug-taking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the case as a forum in which to attack his former wife .

During her appearance on ABC 's Good Morning America to publicise The Taste , Lawson said she had been " maliciously vilified without the right to respond " . Although illicit drugs went unmentioned in the exchange , the TV cook did admit to having eaten " a lot of chocolate " since the trial . <p> America 's distaste for the UK 's tabloid culture may make its audiences sympathetic to British celebrities who have been humiliated at home .

" We were high all the time , sneaking off to the walk-in refrigerator at every opportunity , " he wrote . Yet he went on to become the executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles in Manhattan , and later translated his edgy past into an edgy TV persona with incredible success . <p> Several of the amateur cooks featured in Thursday 's audition episode of The Taste cited Lawson as an inspiration , and the Twitter response to the show , and particularly to its British star , was almost universally positive .

@@2219231 <h> Eamon Delaney : That mix of alcohol with altitude is no excuse for famous-name tantrums <p> The farcical events in Shannon where Jennifer Lauren , the niece of mega-fashion designer Ralph Lauren , was taken off a transatlantic flight and fined for abusive air-rage epitomises the modern phenomenon of well-connected people behaving badly in public and expecting to get away with it . <p> In this case , the intoxicated behaviour of Lauren , who owns a luxury fashion outlet in New York and sports a very famous surname , was more than obnoxious , telling an air stewardess she was " a f**king blonde bitch " and asking an arresting garda " can you say that in English , please ? " , which has been interpreted as a sarcastic comment on the garda 's Irish accent . <p> But given that she thought she was in Spain , maybe she was just confused by all the drink . <p> Adding to the bizarre nature of proceedings , the authorities found the perfect place to hold the initial court hearing into a case of drunken air rage -- The Brian Boru on the Hill pub in the small town of Ballina . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the designer was very drunk could be used as a mitigating factor : that she was not in full control of her thoughts and tongue and was ' under the influence ' . But this is too easy a let-off . <p> Alcohol impairs judgment and for many aggravates an aggressive gene , but it is not a completely mind-altering drug where the subject does n't know where they are or the consequence of their actions . Jennifer Lauren was well aware that she was on a flight , and was behaving unreasonably and then obnoxiously in a confined space with many others . <p> And that may have been the problem . For all that wealth creates distinctions between people , and ways for the rich to escape the discomforts that ordinary mortals must suffer , the fact is that the main means of international movement is air travel , and this pits rich and poor into the same confined space , high up in the air , and sharing the same journey . <p> Granted , there is economy class for most of us and first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but this is still just a curtain-divided step away from the groaning and shifting masses . <p> So the rich and powerful have to slum it , relatively speaking , when they go airborne . And for many of them , getting through it is more bearable with a quantity of alcohol . <p> And to many , far from alcohol being a distortion of personality , it is a case of ' in vino veritas ' , the drink has stripped away the person 's inhibitions and revealed their true attitudes -- which , in this case , is one of sheer contempt for the ordinary people just trying to do their job in what is an often stressful and nervous environment . Hence Lauren 's language was not just incoherent rambling but quite vicious and precise , telling one stewardess that she was " a f**king ugly bitch " and another that she was a " f**king ugly unhappy blonde bitch " , seeking to strike at some psychological core . <p> A male co-pilot was merely dismissed as " an a-hole " . <p> Clearly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an immediate walk-on part in a Martin Scorcese film or a Roddy Doyle novel . Her initial outburst was to tell an air stewardess , trying to fix Lauren 's seat back , to " get the f**k out of my face " . <p> In her defence , Lauren has claimed a number of grounds , such as the ill-fated combination of three drinks with an ( unspecified ) medication , as well as the fact that she was separated on the plane from her flying partner and had also been reflecting on the loss of her mother . <p> Perhaps the combination of all these was the perfect ( air ) storm for personal combustion , the potency of the high altitude was also invoked by lawyers . Lauren 's gratuitous insults appeared to come so easily to her , that one had to wonder if her language was just as colourful , on or off planes . And one must also wonder if walking around with one of the most famous names in the history of fashion gives one a licence to behave badly to mere mortals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one does n't want to be too judgmental here .

Mellon then proceeded to abuse staff and gardai , and was hauled before the courts . <p> His behaviour was n't as bad as Lauren 's outburst but it was enough to make him highly apologetic and get him to swear himself off drink for the last year . <p> There was no sign of such a promise from the stellar-named Ms Lauren when she walked away from Ennis Court with a ? 2,000 fine .

In a snowstorm , at night , it can be hard to impossible to see the white or yellow lines or the ditch at the side of the highway . In daytime a " whiteout " is a frightening experience . Even in good driving conditions I look out for those big sheets of ice that shear off the top of the 18-wheeler 50 meters ahead .

During a winter storm it becomes a sort of black hole for travelers -- so hard to escape from . <p> But there is much that is good about winter . Once you step outside the constraints of getting to and from work , you will find it a very beautiful season . <p> To begin with there 's the sunshine . There 's a lot more of it . Montreal , on average , from November , to April , receives about one extra hour per day of sunlight compared with Belfast . Per year , Montreal receives 1,860 hours of sunlight to Belfast 's 1,285 hours . That extra light makes a difference ; it is a great morale ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the light . Winter is a feast for the senses . It is the sound of snow scrunching hard and dry under your boots , while your breath hangs white and frozen behind you in the night air . It is the unique sound of steel on ice as you outdoor skate in the evening ; the Christmas lights strung on the trees , the Blue Danube and that hot chocolate that you treat yourself to . It is cross-country skiing under a blue sky , and seeing a big buck deer emerge from the forest , front quarters already airborne , then sailing over the twenty foot wide ski trail and landing somewhere inside the trees , on the opposite side of the trail , without making one single sound ( I witnessed this once only ) . It is walking home through the maze of little streets , in east end Montreal , past the outdoor balconies , and stairways , festooned with their Christmas lights . It is the city falling silent during a big snowstorm . It is the frozen Saint Lawrence River at sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pink to blood red . <p> To live in Canada is to accept that winter will occupy up to half your life . To spend half your life upset at winter is not an optimal emigration experience . If you are to enjoy Canada fully you must find a way to love the winter .

" Weights wo n't help me for football/hockey/ athletics , " they insisted . <p> However , more and more ladies are ditching the ' eternal diet plus hours on the treadmill ' routine and telling us that ' strong is the new skinny . ' Lift heavy , eat well , rest well . Maybe you ca n't exactly ' eat what you want ' -- but an exercise regime where eating plenty of real food is an absolute requirement may even deserve a Facebook ' meme ' of its own . <p> Strong people are , after all , more useful and -- so I 'm told -- harder to kill ! <p> James Hanley is the owner of the Revolution Fitness gym . He has been involved in the health and fitness industry for 10 years . <p> A national champion and world record-breaking powerlifter , James left his " safe career " in accounting to open RevFit -- just a few dozen walking lunges from Shelbourne Football Club 's Tolka Park home . <p> RevFit styles itself as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prides itself as being " a gym where machines are n't used -- they 're made " . <p> The Ladies Lifting Workshop came about thanks to James , his partner ( in work and life ) Sarah Doyle -- who spoke to the class about nutrition and making your training ' goal focused ' -- and Karla Kelly , a primary school teacher in Ballymun who is living , breathing proof of why ' ladies who lift ' reach their fitness goals quicker than the rest . <p> Now a qualified personal trainer , Karla explained that " it is only in the last three years that I started to get serious about my training . I started to strength train back in 2010 , thanks to a workshop I attended -- similar to our own here today -- and I fell in love with the main compound lifts immediately . <p> " I loved the sense of achievement I got from lifting and I loved how my self-esteem and self-confidence started to soar .

" <p> The structure of the session was tight , comprehensive and hugely informative . As James himself points out : " if you want to build the biggest pyramid , you must first build the largest base .

This final piece of the puzzle , essentially , gave the class the ability to write their own training programmes -- a basic template for progress , if you like . <p> The class was encouraged to " not just exercise -- train " . And train with a specific goal in mind . That goal might be anything from ' complete one pull-up ' to ' squat twice my bodyweight ' . But a goal , we 're told -- something attainable to strive toward -- is almost as important as the training itself . <p> It was truly eye-opening to see some participants go from , at first , having difficulty with basic mobility movements to , as their confidence grew , ripping up deadlifts with near perfect form .

The same cup of kale contains just 33 calories . <p> The only question left worth asking is : does anyone really like kale ? The short answer to that is : not until quite recently . John Wyler , the chef at Forest Avenue restaurant in Dublin , has had kale on the menu since November , where it can be found in risottos or blanched in boiling water , refreshed in cold water and fried with seasoning and a touch of garlic . <p> Both Ryan and Wyler agree that in the vegetable world , cavolo nero could be the next big thing .

She had decided to appeal and the State was now seeking costs against her . He did not consider that was unfair as the normal rule in litigation was that costs go to the winning party and an appeal would impose further costs on the State . <p> When Mr McDowell submitted the court should also take into account its rejection of Ms Collins 's argument that the D ? il must , in advance of draw-downs of public monies from the Central Fund , set a maximum limit on such draw-downs , Mr Justice Hogan asked was that issue , in itself , not of " far-reaching public importance " . Mr McDowell himself had previously said that issue had never been considered by the courts , the judge noted . <p> Mr McDowell said he accepted the issues were serious but he did not accept they were " weighty " . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court had found Ms Collins 's arguments were misconceived , he added . <p> Mr Justice Hogan said other cases had been taken and lost but it had been found in the public interest to bring them , such as the " tragic case " of Marie Fleming who had secured all her High Court costs , and half of her Supreme Court costs , against the State . <p> In dismissing Ms Collins 's action last November , the High Court ruled the promissory notes were validly issued under a law which was constitutional .

Before I even know what the word meant I was sure I wanted to work with wildlife around the world . This passion was cemented when my family moved to Tanzania when I was 10 . Other kids my age were cheering on Ireland at the World Cup , while we were driving through the Serengeti , watching migrations and identifying birds . <p> Following my dream was always going to be hard as I 'm quite badly dyslexic and could n't get the points to go to an Irish college or university . I could n't do Irish for the Leaving Cert and only did five pass subjects , so I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Diploma in Wildlife Management . <p> This course allowed me to get into second year of a zoology degree at the University of Aberdeen . <p> But I always wanted to study in my own country so after my degree I stalked a Trinity College academic to see if I could study for a PhD there . As luck would have it a PhD on badgers , funded by the Department of Agriculture , came up . I spent months researching everything I could on badgers and was accepted . I really loved doing the PhD and working with farmers from all around Ireland . <p> In 2007 , during the last year of my PhD , myself and my husband Bill started the visa process for moving to Australia .

A year to the day after we came to Australia he disappeared , which broke my heart . <p> I worked as a volunteer in Taronga Zoo for a year learning about Australian wildlife and applying for postdoctoral grants . Working with academics from University of New South Wales , we received a grant to reintroduce native rats which had been pushed out by black rats . The project attracted a lot of public interest .

Koalas are quite an urban species ; 80 per cent of them are found on private land and are declining in many places due to threats such as dog attacks and vehicle strikes . Part of my work was to run a Great Koala Count , using a smartphone app that allows people to record where they see Koalas .

@@2270231 <p> The Walsh Cup offers Kilkenny supporters an early opportunity to assess the form of the players at the start of another year , writes Nickey Brennan . <p> Supporters looked particularly excited in Freshford on Sunday week when Kilkenny lined up against the Dublin Institute of Technology . It is quite a number of years since Kilkenny followers had to wait so long for a competitive game after exiting the previous year 's championship . <p> The Kilkenny side against DIT was a typical first outing side with a few of last year 's panel , plus others hoping to breakthrough to the senior ranks in 2014 . <p> The visitors were a huge disappointment . With a number of inter-county players in their ranks I expected a better challenge , but they were well beaten long before the final whistle . <p> Conclusions can not be drawn from any games played in January , irrespective of the opposition , but the attitude of the Kilkenny players was excellent . <p> The work rate and commitment from the players was top class and , unlike their opponents , Kilkenny played as a team . <p> On Sunday Galway came to Freshford and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amber . Freshford hosted its largest crowd for some time and it is fair to assume that most came to see the return of Henry Shefflin . <p> Sharp and keen <p> They would have left in no doubt that our finest ever hurler looked as sharp and as keen as ever . However , it was a January fixture so we need to keep all assessments of Shefflin and his colleagues in context . <p> Kilkenny put in an impressive opening 20 minutes and while Galway dominated the rest of the half it was clear that their five-point interval lead would be insufficient against a Kilkenny side with wind-advantage after the break . <p> Colin Fennelly 's first half goal was a real blow to the visitors , but in truth they were coming out second best in many of the duels . <p> Superb defending , particularly from Paul Murphy and Brian Hogan , kept Galway 's scoring in check in the first half but the Westerners did impress as the game ebbed towards the interval . <p> Kilkenny 's nineteen points to three for Galway pretty well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lack of discipline did not help their cause as they conceded a string of careless fouls . A red card to one of their players for a crude stroke on Eoin Larkin was an inevitable consequence of some over-robust play . <p> For Kilkenny this game was another step in the right direction and an ideal opportunity to give more of last year 's squad some game time . <p> Henry Shefflin 's return went as well as anyone could have expected and he , along with Colin Fennelly and newcomer Jonjo Farrell , gave the Galway defence a torrid time . <p> These games are a process towards sharpening players and building up the squad . At the moment some well-known players are not in the squad . <p> I hope they are continuing to keep in shape because we will need them come the Summer . <p> Galway was minus the Portumna contingent but it is clear that Anthony Cunningham has plenty of work to undertake with his squad . <p> The Westerners will be back in Kilkenny on March 9 for a National Hurling League game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to properly assess their prospects in 2014 . <p> On Saturday ( 5pm ) as part of a very attractive double bill in Croke Park with the Dublin/Kerry National Football League opening round game , Kilkenny and Dublin will play the final of the Walsh Cup . <p> It is a good game for both counties to get with the start of the National Hurling League just around the corner . The winning or losing of games is not of major importantance so early in the season . <p> Getting players and permutations sorted before the start of the League is what it is all about , really .

@@2270238 <h> US sensation Girls has grabbed headlines with its no holds barred approach to sex , body image and mental health issues . Lena Dunham talks to Declan Cashin about how series three feels like a recovery <h> Declan Cashin <p> Fans of the TV show Girls are quite accustomed to seeing Lena Dunham in the flesh . Yet despite , or perhaps because of that , it takes Day &amp; Night a moment to recognise the 27-year-old when we encounter her in person in a suite in London 's Soho Hotel . <p> She 's fully covered up for one thing -- unlike her screen alter ego Hannah Horvath , who , when she 's not wearing ill-fitting T-shirts and blouses , proudly and un-self-consciously lets it all hang out . <p> Today Dunham is dressed in a stylish Mother of Pearl print dress , paired with red YSL boots , her short hair unfussily styled and her pretty face mostly unadorned of make-up . That stripped-back look is good for her : she 's very pretty , with beautiful skin . <p> As if pre-empting our reaction to her real-life appearance , Dunham says : " It 's so funny because people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do on TV , have you lost weight ? ' And I 'm always like , ' No , it 's just that on the show I stand slouched . Hannah has a funny , anxious posture that 's different from my own ' . " <p> Dunham 's looks and body shape became major pop cultural flashpoints during the two hectic years that her creation , Girls , has been on our screens . <p> In the past week , there 's been further controversy over Dunham 's photo-shoot in Vogue magazine , with some disappointed critics accusing her of betraying her sterling feminist credentials by allowing the snaps to be digitally touched-up . <p> We meet just as the magazine has hit the stands , before any of the brouhaha blew up , and Dunham was taking the nascent cover girl attention in her stride . <p> " I ca n't imagine what the Vogue cover would change , beyond that it makes me feel like a slightly more acceptable-looking person for one week , " she says . " Then there 'll be a new Vogue cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ definitely an amazing opportunity and made my mom really happy . " <p> Personality-wise too , Dunham could n't be more different to Hannah . She 's a very attentive , charming interviewee and unfailingly polite . She 's in London to promote the third series of Girls , in which she stars , as well as writes , directs and produces to multi-award-winning effect ( reminder : she 's still only 27 ) . <p> For those who do n't know , the show is set in the hipster-Wonderland of Brooklyn , and focuses on the lives of four struggling 20-something girlfriends . <p> Everything about the show is gritty and real : the sex , the nudity , and , more than anything else , the monstrous -- and intentionally provocative -- selfishness , sense of entitlement and lack of self-awareness of its central characters . <p> As Dunham herself succinctly puts it : " Hannah is such a dick . " <p> The first series was a sensation , acclaimed by critics and embraced by Millenial viewers . But the second season -- a much darker affair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' bottle episodes ' ( like the one telescoping solely and surreally on Hannah 's brief fling with a wealthy , handsome doctor ) , and a challenging focus on Hannah 's spiralling mental health issues -- was a much more divisive affair . <p> Not that Dunham was aware of any ' difficult second album ' wobbles . " It 's so funny because I did n't even know that until recently , " she says , not entirely ingenuously . " People were like , ' What 's it like to launch the season after all the negative attention season two got ? ' And I was like , ' It did ? ! ' I was in my own private world , I had no clue . " <p> So the third series -- which on the evidence of its first few episodes is of a much lighter , comedic bent , with Hannah living in seemingly happy domesticity with gonzo boyfriend Adam ( Adam Driver ) -- was n't borne out of a sense of course-correction ? <p> " No , because we shoot our whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting reviews that make us think , ' Oh , we should change this up ' , " she replies . " I feel lucky for that because we 're not having to listen to feedback and make a big shift . <p> " We get to write in our own happy bubble . Now I understand that season two did n't work for everybody , but there were so many personal stories in there that were so meaningful for me to tell that I just feel lucky we got to do it . " <p> If the new season has an over-arching theme , it would be one of recovery and rehabilitation . <p> Dunham explains : " Everybody has been through very dark things -- Shoshanna Zosia Mamet finished her relationship , Jessa Jemima Kirke is literally in rehab , Hannah 's had a breakdown and Marnie Allison Williams has been through a break-up . So they 're all figuring out how to take the next step in their life and it 's not easy . I think it 's about moving on . " <p> In reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on from the debates and arguments that have followed the show -- and Dunham -- around since the start : mainly , the relentless focus on Dunham 's nudity on screen . <p> By her own admission , she does n't have the type of body that is normally shown in all its glory on television -- but the extent to which it exercises people is still astonishing . <p> Last month , during a public Q&amp;A in the US , Dunham and the show 's co-creator Jenni Konner got into a tense exchange with a journalist who asked a very poorly-phrased question about Dunham 's fearless approach to ' dropping trou ' . <p> But is she conscious that , rightly or wrongly , her casual exposure of what many real people would consider a ' normal ' female body , is deemed to be a political , even a revolutionary act ? <p> " I recognise why people responded to it intensely and what it meant to certain people , " Dunham says . " And I also recognise that it might have made certain people uncomfortable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meaningful , but now people just need to experience what 's new about the show . The nudity is kind of what 's old about the show . <p> " But I also do know that , inherently , putting my particular body on screen in those situations is a reaction to what 's currently on television . And I hope it 's been comforting for some people . " <p> The third season of Girls is already in the can , and the fourth has just been commissioned . " We 're starting to think about the arc of that now and it 'll make itself clearer once we start writing , " she says . <p> At the same time , Dunham is developing a second series for the HBO network ( about Betty Halbreich , a renowned personal shopper at Bergdorf Goodman department store in New York ) , as well as making a documentary about illustrator Hilary Knight . <p> That 's in between finishing her first book , a memoir-essay collection , due out later this year , and for which she secured a reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning out ? " I do think it 's really important , even when it does n't feel good , to take time off , " she says . " It 's such a lame thing to say , but I 'm really bad at taking vacations .

And I do n't think it 's healthy . <p> " I have trouble going to sleep at night because I think , ' There 's so much I should have done today ' . You just have to be able to shut that down . I meditate which is really helpful . I make sure I have those breaks even when I do n't feel I want them , especially when you 're getting so much feedback on your work . It 's really easy to collapse .

But I know some people have watched and said , ' Why should I take your thoughts on this seriously when your life is going well ? ' <p> " And my response is , ' Well , it 's fiction ! ' " <p> Girls is on Sky Atlantic , Monday nights at 10pm . <p> LIFE AFTER GIRLS ? <p> How long does Dunham see Girls lasting ?

@@2304233 'd expect one of the first things to strike you about a Liverpudlian is their accent but that 's not the case with Queen 's Quay Social Executive Chef , Darren Iddon . <p> Darren 's scouse accent is certainly present and correct but it 's his passion for amazing service and superior tasting food that shines through . <p> Darren was born in 1976 and reared in Liverpool and when he was a youngster his parents Jez and Christine and younger brother moved to New Brighton . <p> " I grew up in the Wirral area of Liverpool and one of my fondest childhood memories is of all my mates always wanting to come to our house for dinner . <p> " My mum came from a family of cooks and I remember Saturday nights when I was a young boy , she spend the day making homemade tandoori chicken and homemade samosas - they were great days . " <p> Darren was extremely academic at school and was also an accomplished rugby player but it was because of his upbringing and his love of food that he wanted nothing more from life than to become a professional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is also the only one in the family who is n't a cook - my brother is a chef too . " <p> After leaving school at the age of 16 , Darren moved to Woolacombe Bay in North Devon where he went to work as an apprentice in The Ship Aground restaurant . <p> " I worked in The Ship Aground for three years and they were three of the best years of my life . It was a fantastic place to learn the basics of cooking and the chef I worked under was top class . " <p> On leaving The Ship Aground , Darren decided to travel around Europe and to this day he still finds inspiration from some of the culinary wonders he experienced in places like Italy and France . <p> " Travelling was perhaps one of the best things I could have done because it really opened my eyes to so many other things and techniques I did n't know about cooking . <p> " I worked in a few restaurants in France and some of them would have had one or two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work and I enjoyed every minute of my time working there . " <p> After a few years on the road , Darren returned to England where he went to work for ' The French Restaurant ' in the Midland Hotel in Manchester . <p> " My dad 's law practice was in Manchester so I got a job working at The French Restaurant in the Midland Hotel . <p> " I learned so much from my time at The French Restaurant . It was a really vibrant place to work . " <p> The next thing to happen Darren saw his career go transatlantic when he was offered the chance to go and work for renowned chef and restaurateur , Peter X. Kelly in New York . <p> " I started out working in Peter 's restaurant in Piermont in New York . The restaurant overlooked the Hudson River and the quality of food there was out of this world . <p> " Peter had a real fascination with South American cuisine . There was a real intelligence to the way he went about creating his menus and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Darren soon began to progress up the ranks . After working in Peter X. Kelly 's restaurant he went to work in his brasserie . <p> " Working in the brasserie was a different experience entirely because in the restaurant in Piermont we would have done about 34 covers but in the brasserie we could have been doing anything between 140 and 240 covers every single day . <p> " Every cover was a la carte which meant it was seriously busy and that 's the way it was for six days a week for a few years . <p> " I loved every minute of it and soon after working in the brasserie I started working in Peter 's flagship restaurant , Restaurant X in Congers . <p> " Restaurant X was a top class place to work because the food worked on and created was amazing . " <p> In 2002 Darren left New York and moved to Derry where he secured a lucrative Junior Sous Chef position in Michael Deane 's one star Michelin restaurant , Deane 's , in Belfast . <p> " I travelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long slog but the experience of working in yet another Michelin star restaurant was tremendous . <p> " After about a year at Deane 's , my career took an unexpected turn when the opportunity arose to go and work for a restaurant management organisation called Capella Hotel Group . <p> " I was offered the position of Executive Sous Chef at the Solis Lough Eske Castle Hotel in Donegal . <p> " Working for the Capella Hotel Group was perhaps one of the most fascinating and amazing things to happen in my career . <p> " Along with an amazing team , the Solis Lough Eske Castle Hotel was a huge success but after two and a half years the Capella group offered me the chance to go and work in their Capella Singapore Hotel and Resort - it was Capella 's flagship property in Asia and is located on Sentosa Island , Singapore . <p> " Working in Singapore not only opened my eyes to a whole new aspect of cooking but it also taught me how to manage a team of people . I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any one day we could have four or five banquets on and due to the fact it was a six star resort , the food had to be flawless . <p> " It was during my time with Capella I met Swedish chef , Jakob Esko . I 'd worked with Jakob at the Lough Eske and when he left for Singapore , he requested I come with him . <p> " Jakob is my best friend and he is like a brother to me and we still stay in regular contact . " <p> Darren was the only English born chef working with Capella so in 2011 he was asked by the company to head up the opening of the Raithwaite Hall Country Retreat in North Yorkshire . <p> " That really took it out of me because I was in charge of developing everything from scratch . <p> " From the design of the kitchens , the uniforms to employing the staff . It was a very emotional time when the restaurant opened . " <p> The owners of the hotel decided that they wanted to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people from his time working in Donegal and soon after he opened his own restaurant , Queen 's Quay Social , in Derry . <p> " I 'd honestly no intention of ever opening my own restaurant . It just sort of happened . <p> " I 'm delighted with the way it has gone so far . We are so passionate about amazing and interesting food and top class service here . <p> " When I decided to open the restaurant here in Derry I spoke to a few of the people I worked with during my time at Capella . <p> " I meet with Zsolt every morning to discuss the day ahead , I then meet with Alan to discuss any new drinks he 's thinking about or to ask him if there are any events he wants to attend . <p> " I also meet with Lauva to discuss everything about the restaurant .

@@2304238 <h> Making a raised bed <p> Sunday , February 16 , 2014 <p> By Peter Dowdall <p> Rob the veggie gardener 's staple , says Peter Dowdall and you can have an easily managed mix in your garden <p> Over the last few years there has been a huge increase in people growing their own food . People who before now , may well have thought that potatoes did actually grow on the shelves in the supermarket and are amazed to discover how easy it is to grow one 's own . <p> Some good seeds or young plants mixed with the right soil , correct amounts of water and levels of sunlight and off you go . This huge growth in popularity is due to several factors : More awareness of the health benefits of growing your own food ; gardening programmes on television and radio ; and economic circumstances . <p> Whatever the reason , it is great to see so many people out and about in the garden . Take a walk through any busy allotment or community garden now and you will see the place buzzing . Neighbours who might otherwise never really know each other , are out getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhubarb stalks . They might otherwise be cooped up watching television , living just feet from each other but not knowing the other . <p> The benefits of this resurgence goes hand in hand with the explosion in popularity of raised beds . They are a great way to grow many vegetables and also , it was believed in times past that plants performed better in raised beds as they were closer to the sun and to God . Who am I to scoff at these beliefs and what is certainly true is that many plants do better in beds that are elevated . <p> Again there are several reasons , not least is that by being closer to the sun they are therefore warmer and grow better . By creating a raised bed you can control the growing media that goes into it , for example if you want to grow carrots , parsnips and other root crops you can ensure that the soil is stone free and sandy , ideal for these plants . Also by raising the bed high enough , you can ensure that the carrot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to claim back the raised bed from the veggie brigade for all of us . It 's not just for fruit and vegetable gardeners . Ornamental plants will also thrive in these beds . Maintenance of your horticultural beauties is much easier in a bed that may be as high or higher than your knee as you are not stooping to get to the weeds . Believe me , it 's a long time since my fingers have seen my toes and to keep gardening from becoming a chore , such tasks as weeding , pruning , dead heading etc can all be made easier by raising the plants . <p> If you have ever been lucky enough to visit the RHS gardens at Wisley then you will have seen some fabulous beds created from stone and raised about 60 cm and used as alpine gardens . Artificial rockeries , and what a sight they are , are for me , the highlight of a trip to these Surrey gardens . <p> Again , the soil can be created to match exactly the well drained growing conditions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anything can be grown in this way , bedding plants , Herbaceous beds , even shrubberies if you want . A working herb bed is never a particularly beautiful looking addition to the garden as the plants are constantly being harvested and picked at , and again . What better way to grow them than in a raised south facing bed . If you are not over-endowed with space in your garden and you can not afford the luxury of allowing a bed to be used exclusively for herbs , then why not put some nice alpines into the same spot to give it the wow factor as both groups of plants like the same growing conditions . <p> Many materials can be used to create a bed like this and the design is limited only by your imagination . Just bear a few things in mind : take care of overall dimensions , make sure you can easily access all parts of the bed for maintenance , weeding and harvesting . Make sure the bed is on a surface that allows it to drain freely , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will leech into the soil and it has been proved to be carcinogenic . <p> There are of course ready made raised beds , kits and sleepers without creosote available at your local garden centre so enjoy making your new bed , planting it and sit back to enjoy the fruits of your labour .

It was only on January 31 that Minister of State Alex White announced the commencement of a consultation process on the content and scope of a new GP contract for the provision of ' free ' care to children aged under six . Today ( February 21 ) -- just three weeks later -- he is putting up the shutters , as this is the official closing date for receipt of written submissions on the proposal . Did you send yours to the HSE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ email your thoughts to **25;418;TOOLONG , although try not to be too abusive . I wo n't be alone in sending in an FOI request . <p> But really , three weeks ! I 'll get to the IMO 's beef over the absolute failure to negotiate in a moment , but firstly this 21-day time frame in itself is a farce . As you read this editorial , I am only back at work two weeks , and certainly the draft contract was not the very first item I got to peruse ( although perhaps it should have been ! ) . <p> And while certain things immediately jumped out at me -- such as the inclusion of chronic disease management , routine phlebotomy services , active involvement in primary care teams , new audits and performance reviews , new building standards for surgeries ( including breast-feeding facilities and paint inspections ) , additional disciplinary procedures , and gagging clauses to protect the HSE 's reputation -- I certainly had to take notes and go back and re-read certain sections ( what was that about ' lock-outs ' in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I 'm still not 100 per cent sure of the full ramifications of the ' three strikes and you 're out ' provision for terminating contacts , as contained in Schedule 2 , Section 3.1.10 , and pursuant to Clause 6.7.3(a) . It 's not all as bad as that , but the 38-page document can be pretty dense in parts . <p> Of course , even three months of a ' consultation process ' would probably not have satisfied the IMO , which last week said the draft contract would " destroy " the confidentiality of the doctor/patient relationship , prevent GPs being whistle-blowers against the HSE , and reduce the time GPs have to treat patients due to additional " mindless bureaucracy " . In a letter sent last week to Ministers James Reilly and Alex White , the GP representation body stressed it was just that -- a body registered as a trade union on February 15 , 1962 , granted a negotiation licence on October 19 , 1962 , which authorises the IMO to carry out negotiations for the fixing of wages or other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sticking to their view that competition law precludes negotiation with GPs and their union -- something the IMO flatly refutes , and which is the subject , if you recall , of proceedings presently pending before the Competition Division of the High Court . Those proceedings are listed for a hearing on April 30 . For the IMO , the position is clear : the decision not to negotiate with it on the GP contract denies the legal entitlement which has been expressly conferred upon the IMO by virtue of that statutory negotiation licence . The union believes that the position adopted by the Competition Authority is as fundamentally wrong in law , as it is contrary to common sense , as GPs do not operate in a ' market ' for GMS services . <p> In response to the draft contract , the IMO has warned the Department that it will consider seeking an injunction to prevent the Department introducing these changes without the agreement of the union . " The proposals are obviously amendments of existing contracts negotiated between the Government and the IMO and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any such changes can be introduced , " according to GP Committee Chairman Dr Ray Walley . <p> So perhaps he forgot today 's deadline : the IMO has set its own of February 27 or 28 , depending on when Ministers James Reilly and Alex White received the union 's damning correspondence on the proposal , by which time the Department must cease and desist . " If you do not within fourteen days of receipt of this letter undertake to suspend the consultation process in respect of the new contract and embark upon proper negotiations with IMO , we will upon the expiry of that period , institute the appropriate proceedings without further notice to you , " stated Susan Clyne , IMO Chief Operating Officer . There go the shutters again . What happened to change the Department 's view that engagement with the profession was " both necessary and desirable " ? <p> Much has been made of the Government using the draft contract as a ' Trojan horse ' to push through a radical reform of the terms and conditions of doctors . Could it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all the hallmarks of being another epic . <p> And one wonders should the public -- and particularly parents of children aged under six -- be afraid of Ministers bearing gifts ?

@@2314238 <h> REVIEW : Sony Xperia Z1 Compact <p> Sony 's Xperia smartphones have been getting better and better over the last year . Firstly at CES 2013 they unveiled their Sony Xperia Z and on paper the original Z featured all the necessary features to be an excellent smartphone . It came loaded with a top-end Sony Bravia screen , Exmor camera technology and a powerful quad-core Qualcomm processor , but a poor battery hampered the phone 's ability to shine . <p> Sony learned from its mistakes and came back months later with its Xperia Z1 flagship smartphone with its 20.7MP rear camera , super fast 2.2GHz quad-core Krait Qualcomm MSM8974 processor and with it being water and dust resistant , the Z1 was one of 2013 's best smartphones . <p> The Xperia Z1 Compact is designed to offer the same top-end performance and life-proof design , but in a smaller , pocket-friendly size . <h> Design <p> Thanks to its shrunken-down 127x65x9.5mm size and 137g weight , the Compact also feels much more comfortable to hold than the Z1 . The Z1 by comparison measured in at a significantly larger 144x74x8.5mm and weighed 169g . The Compact 's comfy feel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power , volume and camera shutter buttons are on its right-hand edge . The power button is at the centre of the right edge just above the volume rocker . Below these , the shutter button is at the bottom right-hand corner of the phone . The placement means the buttons sit where your fingers naturally fall when holding the Compact one handed . Putting aside the reassurance offered by its IP certifications , the Z1 Compact also feels very top-end and robustly built . The phone has metallic sides , a polished polycarbonate back and Gorilla Glass front . We found the Compact 's unremovable back did n't give at all when met with pressure and it also lived up to its waterproof branding , managing to survive an accidental drop into a water-filled kitchen sink . <h> Display <p> The Xperia Z1 Compact has a 4.3in 1280 ? 720 Triluminos display with X-Reality technology . In general the Compact 's screen is n't as vibrant as the Amoled and in-plane switching ( IPS ) displays seen on competing handsets , such as the Galaxy S4 and iPhone 5C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compact 's automatic brightness level is significantly lower than most other similarly priced smartphones . While this can be fixed by manually setting the screen brightness to be higher , it does mean the Z1 Compact 's screen looks fairly dull out of the box . <p> Being fair to the Z1 Compact , though , its display is still miles better than many similarly sized competitors . Compared with devices such as the Galaxy S4 Mini or One Mini , the Z1 Compact 's display is great . <h> Operating System <p> The Z1 Compact runs using a heavily customised version of Google Android 4.3 Jelly Bean . Sadly there 's no word as to if or when the Z1 Compact will be upgraded to the latest 4.4 KitKat Android version . That said , the skin added by Sony is n't the worst we 've experienced by a long shot . By and large Sony has limited itself to making minor changes to Android , loading it with a few applications , widgets and minor user interface changes . Some of these are fairly pointless , such as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while others are quite good , such as PlayStation Mobile , which grants you access to a host of custom games that are n't available on the main Google Play store . <h> Performance <p> The fast 2.2GHz Qualcomm MSM8974 quad-core processor is one of its biggest selling points . In the past Android phones in the Compact 's size bracket have run using dual-core processors , which has meant they mostly offered average performance . Featuring 2GB of RAM and LTE connectivity , the Z1 Compact fixes this problem and we were surprised by how fast it was . The Compact opened applications and webpages in milliseconds and proved more than capable of running even the most demanding of applications hassle free . <h> Camera <p> Camera technology is a big deal in the smartphone world and Sony has worked hard to meet smartphone buyers ' high expectations , loading the Compact with a 20.7MP camera and Sony Exmor RS mobile image sensor . By default the camera shoots photos using a Superior Auto mode . We were impressed by how well images taken in regular light came out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were great . The shutter speed was also fast enough that we never found ourselves struggling to get our shot in time . This was even more true when using the Compact 's Timeshift Burst mode . The mode makes the Compact shoot 30 photos in rapid succession . The user can then pick the best of the bunch to be stored on the phone and automatically delete the rest . <p> The Z1 Compact 's Info Eye shot mode is another standout feature , which lets the user take a photo of the surrounding area and then alters it to feature interactive information about it . These include nearby transport links , the location in Google Maps , and nearby restaurants or shops . <h> Battery &amp; Storage <p> The Xperia Z1 Compact is powered by a 2,300mAh battery that Sony lists as being able to last for up to 12 hours of video playback off one charge . Battery burning the Compact by constantly looping a video file stored on the phone with the screen set to automatic brightness , it fell well short of Sony 's maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our first burn , a more impressive eight on our second and a slightly shorter seven and a half on our third . While this is a lot less than the listed life , it still means the Compact is above average . In general smartphones usually last between six to seven hours when task ed with the same test . <p> Storage-wise the Compact comes with a slightly disappointing 16GB built in . Luckily this can be upgraded using its microSD card slot . <h> Overall <p> The Xperia Z1 Compact is leagues above other smartphones in its size bracket . For its price , the Compact offers top-end , quad-core performance and a 20.7MP rear camera that blows all other compact competition in the Android ecosystem out of the water . <h> 3.9 <h> Nice Compact Mobile Device <h> About the Author <p> GimmeDigital Contributor The Gimmedigital Contribs are made up of a selection of submissions from GD Readers and also from Partner websites .

@@2364232 <p> Sligo 's flying start to last year 's campaign might be best remembered for Anthony Elding 's goal-spree but six clean sheets in their opening eight games certainly played their part , reports Emmet Malone . Two games in this year and Ian Baraclough 's defence is struggling to discover that sort of form . <p> Three of the club 's last four visits to the Carlisle Grounds had ended without either side scoring and by the end tonight , obviously enough , the visitors would have settled for making it four out of five . They simply had n't earned it , though . <p> On a succession of occasions Sligo looked shaky at the back and while Bray lacked the quality to convert the bulk of their chances , the visitors paid for presenting Jake Kelly and Ciaran Byrne with one that they clicked quite well for a minute or so into the second period . <p> All the Rovers pressure late on could well have yielded an equaliser for Bray , on more than one occasion , seemed to ride their luck a little as Rovers piled forward . In the last couple of minutes , in particular , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eric Odhiambo , both of whom narrowly missed big chances . On the whole , though , it would be hard to begrudge the locals their first win in 17 over opponents who may come to view the lost points as costly . <p> Rovers actually made the brighter start and might have led within the first few minutes through Danny North who had two good chances ; one a close range shot , the other a header at the far post . The first produced a decent reaction save from the generally impressive Shane Redmond but for the second the goalkeeper was helpless and the striker really should have found the target . <p> The early Rovers dominance seemed likely to set the pattern for what was to follow but Bray gradually battled their way into things , working hard to close their opponents down as they tried to play their way out of defence and reducing them at times to long balls forward that , in the blustery conditions , had little chance of setting North on his way . <p> More than that , though , Wanderers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's defence coping pretty poorly when put under pressure . Initially , the threat did n't amount to too much but the one real exception came just short of the midway point in the opening period when Byrne controlled a long ball out of defence well and then , as the entire Rovers back four closed in , released Kelly with a perfectly weighted pass into space . The 23-year-old winger took off after it with all four defenders in chase but despite having enough time to pick his spot from the edge of the area , his shot was poor and Rogers , who had come well to narrow the angle , waved with his feet . <p> The let off should have een enough to wake Sligo up but they still looked a little too pedestrian when defending around their own are or trying to work their way forward from the edge of it . <p> For all that , though , the way they fell apart for the Bray goal immediately after the break was still a shock . Shane Byrne 's original cross from the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sliced his attempted clearance while Kalen Spillane turned his back rather than attack the loose ball . It ran to Kelly shifted it first time to Byrne , who was there to turn it home even if the very last touch looked to be off Evan McMillan . <p> For most of what was left of the contest , Wanderers sought to dig in and asked no more of their lone striker than to hold the ball up occasionally . As the pressure mounted , he did n't even get to do that much but Redmond , despite having to come off his line to tidy things up once or twice , never actually had to make a good save through the closing stages which says something about the performances of those in front of him ... from both teams . <p> Gary O'Neill scored twice , the second a late equaliser , as Drogheda came from 2-0 down to somehow salvage a point from Dalymount Park to stay top of the Premier Division table . <p> Though Robbie Horgan 's side , to their credit , never lied down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were left to rue a host of missed chances to have won and gone top themselves <p> St Patrick 's Athletic 3 UCD 2 <p> There were dramatic late scenes as Christy Fagan popped up with an injury-time winner to help St Patrick 's Athletic overcome UCD 3-2 at Richmond Park . <p> The deadlock was broken when Greg Bolger 's pass split the UCD defence in the 25th minute and Conan Byrne flicked a confident finish beyond Conor O'Donnell from 12 yards . <p> The league holders struggled for fluency in the opening-half with Keith Fahey and Lee Lynch largely anonymous and they were made to pay for their lethargy as the students levelled matters in the 38th minute . The move originated down the UCD right flank as Cillian Morrison was afforded far too much space to pick out an unmarked Chris Mulhall , who rolled a calm finish across Brendan Clarke . <p> Further defensive uncertainly saw the champions fall behind in the 42nd minute as Ken Oman needlessly hauled down Mark Langtry , with Mulhall exacting full retribution with a 25-yard free-kick that Clarke allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharper upon the restart but still required a moment of sublimity from Byrne to restore parity as he curled a glorious free-kick beyond O'Donnell in the 64th minute . UCD looked more likely to grab the winner in the closing stages but they fell to Fagan 's sucker-punch in the 92nd minute , with the centre-forward crashing a powerful shot across O'Donnell from 10 yards . <p> Athlone Town 1 Shamrock Rovers 4 <p> It was an emotional night for Athlone Town , who hosted a first top flight home fixture in 18 years , but Shamrock Rovers refused to be too sentimental easily pocketing the spoils . <p> Disappointing when drawing with Derry City last Sunday Trevor Croly 's side were far slicker in the midlands as Shane Robinson , Ryan Brennan , and Ronan Finn , in particular , supplied the midfield guile . <p> With Simon Madden eager and willing to attack from the right Rovers shaded the opening quarter as Athlone were forced to defend .

Ireland secured victory on each occasion , eking out vital away wins on a 2-1 score line . <p> Although better equipped to deal with Georgia 's potent attacking threat , the O'Neill-Keane alliance may find its resolve severely tested , especially on their travels . <p> Georgia remain an unknown quantity , rebuilding after a disastrous World Cup campaign , in which they finished fourth and suffered at the hands of two European giants , Spain and France . Despite being on the wrong end of a 4-0 drumming in Dublin last year , Ketsbaia 's charges have a number of players plying their trade in Russia , Romania , Ukraine , and further afield .

Could he be tempted to soldier on for another few caps ? <p> Considered minnows and rank outsiders by many , the men from ' The Rock ' may well struggle , but that is to be expected in what is a very challenging group overall .

Martin O'Neill and Roy Keane represent the perfect duo , having extensive managerial and playing experience across the channel . The Celtic connection is back , and any boos reserved for the Italian have long since waned . Confidence is being restored , players once overlooked are being scouted and joining ranks , and youth is being primed and readied for action . <p> Proponents of Trap 's system will say that " he got the best out of a bad lot " .

James McCarthy , James McClean , Seamus Coleman , Anthony Pilkington , Wes Hoolahan and Stephen Ireland will more than likely be given the chance to flourish and impress , having suffered greatly in recent times . New constraints , systems and tactics will be implemented , but the slate is wiped clean . <p> Germany are the benchmark , but the race for second is a three-way split . Poland and Scotland are vying that spot too . <p> Matchday four sees Ireland make the short trek to Scotland on November 14th .

The Scots crashing out to arch rivals England by a solitary away goal , and the men in green firing blanks in Turkey . Hardship and near misses are central to Scottish and Irish identity , but in Strachan , the SFA have appointed a great motivator and patriot , someone who can lead them into battle and relive the glory days of Euro 96 . <p> Scotland also have a large Premier League and SPL contingent .

The Euro 2012 co-hosts failed to live up to their early promise , finishing well behind England , Ukraine and fellow strugglers Montenegro , in failing to qualify for this year 's World Cup . The sides last met in 2013 , Ireland winning 2-0 at home and drawing 0-0 away in the return friendly . <p> Poland 's current form can be described as patchy at best , but they still have the calibre of player needed to hurt and cause Ireland problems .

@@2389230 <p> The Ides of March are the 15th of the month . No matter , whether by design or a quirk of timing , Scholes chose the most conspiratorial of months to offer a startling contrast between Manchester United 's glorious past , dire present and dilemmas of the immediate future . <p> In his role as a TV pundit , Scholes delivered an assessment of understated brutality on the Manchester United he left behind . His conclusions must have left United fans nodding as furiously as Steve Round every time David Moyes offers a suggestion on , well , presumably anything . <p> It was a little after 11pm . Old Trafford was deserted and the United stewards were considering if military protection was required to ensure ' The Chosen One ' banner remained intact . Scholes and his co-analyst Gary Neville dissected the state of their own club and in doing so offered the only crumb of consolation on an abject evening for United supporters . There are obvious successors to Sir Alex Ferguson if you look hard enough . It is extraordinary the man himself chose not to . <p> Planned or not -- and in fairness only a mischievous mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escape the conclusion Scholes and Neville were taking their first tentative step towards a silent coup to wrestle back control of their club in the wake of a dismal Premier League season . <p> They chose their words professionally and studiously - they came neither to praise nor bury Moyes - but pieced together they were damning . There were traces of perplexity but there was mostly annoyance and frustration in every syllable . <p> Throughout his mesmerising performance , Scholes often had the demeanour of a teenager who found himself sitting with his parents while watching an adult movie scene . His head was bowed , he shuffled in his chair and every time he was cut short for a commercial break he looked like he might take the opportunity to do a runner . <p> Despite this , with his first nods and grimaces whenever Graeme Souness was speaking , Scholes immediately became a more insightful pundit in 60 seconds than Garth Crooks has managed in 25 years . <p> When he did speak , you wanted to increase the volume , pause and rewind . Much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't beat people who know what they 're talking about .

The strikers , he concluded were all right . <p> Neville said United were suffering an identity crisis , neither one thing nor the other , and the suggestion the chequebook was the answer ignored the fact ? 80 million has been spent since Ferguson 's retirement . <p> It was perceptive enough when the cameras were rolling so one could only imagine what was said when microphones were off . <p> The problem for Moyes -- one of many -- is that the United legends are easily envisaged back in their tracksuit . They would represent vibrancy and youthful dynamism as coaches as much as they did as players when they made their debut . <p> It is true at least two graduates from the famed ' Class of ' 92 ' are already part of Moyes coaching staff , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother is rather like comparing the merits of JFK with Teddy Kennedy . ' Assistant ' Ryan Giggs is not tarnished by association . Real or not , the distance many have observed between the Welshman and the current ' inner circle ' serves him well longer-term . It is ironic it is probably the 40 year-old 's performance against Olympiakos that has ensured Moyes will last beyond this week . <p> Perhaps it is misguided to see Scholes 's move into punditry in seditious terms , but with every withering ( and wholly accurate ) comment he demonstrated the detachment between the United he knows and the one he was confronted with last night . <p> He , rather like Neville , seems too proud , too wise and too passionate about his club to tolerate such a rapid dip into mediocrity . It is not in either 's nature .

@@2389233 <h> Recording may well amount to criminal offence <h> TJ McIntyre <p> The revelation that telephone calls to and from garda stations have been systematically recorded since the 1980s raises many fundamental issues for the Garda Siochana and for the wider criminal justice system . <p> The most grave issue is that each recording likely amounted to a serious criminal offence . Under Irish law , the recording of a telephone conversation on a public network without the consent of at least one party to the call amounts to an " interception " , a criminal offence carrying a possible term of imprisonment of up to five years . <p> Interceptions can only be authorised by a warrant signed by the Minister for Justice , but such warrants are restricted to specific cases involving serious offences and are limited to three-month periods . There is no suggestion that any such warrant was issued in relation to this system , and it is clear that the system as a whole fell well outside the bounds of any possible warrant . <p> Consequently , unless gardai were notified that their calls might be recorded then a large number of criminal offences are likely to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This interpretation is confirmed by the 2011 case before Waterford Circuit Criminal Court , which first drew attention to the system . <p> In that case , four gardai were accused of involvement in an assault on a member of the public .

However , the Circuit Court held that the recording could not be used in evidence as " the practice engaged in by the gardai at Waterford garda station of recording all incoming and outgoing calls on a particular phone line was in breach of the relevant statute on the recording of telephone conversations , which requires that at least one of the parties to a phone call has consented to its being recorded " . <p> This finding would have been known to the Director of Public Prosecutions ( DPP ) at the latest in November 2011 when that case concluded , and one might have expected that it would be made known to the Garda Siochana . <p> It is , therefore , very surprising that the recording @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a breakdown in communications between the DPP and the Garda Siochana -- at worst , the practice continued despite garda management knowing that it had been found unlawful by the Circuit Court . <p> A second issue relates to data protection law .

@@2424230 <h> The man behind the under-the-stairs cloakroom on Dragons ' Den practises what he preaches and his own home is a model of clutter-free living <p> Paul Jacob , the civil engineer behind Smart Storage , the company that makes those clever under-the-stairs drawers , has squeezed every inch of space out of his three-bedroom semi , without losing a centimetre of floor space . <p> " Storage is considered a luxury when in fact it should be treated as a basic , " says Jacob , aka Mr Storage , Sarah Beeney 's go-to man for solving her storage problems . <p> In the Greystones home he shares with his wife , Clodagh , and their daughters , Ellen and Holly , he has added four cubic metres of secret storage ; in the attic , under the stairs and behind the bath , which amounts to 75 percent of the size of his small third bedroom or box room . This is without losing a single centimetre of floor space -- all this storage is situated in unused cavities in the home . <p> And they 're in every property , he says . " We need to reconsider the cubic volume @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> His house has become a laboratory for his smart storage ideas . <p> He extended the property , which was situated on a triangular-shaped plot that faced east to the rear , following the lines of the plot so that their kitchen could expand to become a large kitchen , diner , livingroom and the room adjacent become a TV room for Ellen and Holly . This added 51sq m ( 550sq ft ) to the 102sq m ( 1100sq ft ) house . An attic conversion gave him another 23sq m ( 250sq ft ) . <p> What is far more interesting is how he made use of so-called " dead zones " in the house -- the hall , landing , attic , bathroom and outside shed -- to create living spaces that are blissfully clutter free . " It 's not expensive but it does involve joined up thinking , " he says . He wants architects , interior designers and developers to consider storage in order to create better functioning homes that are more pleasurable to live in . <p> HALL The hall is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the property , Jacobs says . Coats , school bags , sports kits and shoes are the " road works that block the free flow of movement " . Under the stairs he has a cloakroom for coats and deep drawers that can accommodate the rest of the clutter listed above . The drawer system featured on the television show Dragon 's Den and inspired Norah Casey to back his business . Since then Jacob has built a flatpack version that can be purchased in places such as Woodie 's and installed by trained fitters anywhere in the country . <p> BATHROOMS The space behind the bath facia in the family bathroom is another untapped void , says Jacob . " Forty per cent of the space within it is unused . " By turning the bath facia into a pullout flap he plans to create a place for secret shelving that can store 12 to 15 family-size bottles of shampoo . <p> BEDROOM <p> The Jacobs turned their three-bedroom house into a two-bed because the box room was " unusable " Jacob explains .

The hot water cylinder in it was so well insulated that it gave off very little heat so Jacob moved it outside into one of two sheds he had custom built . He retained the hot water pipes meaning the warm air had increased space to circulate and dry clothes . There 's also lots more shelf space to store bed linen and towels . <p> ATTIC Suitcases and Christmas decorations are kept in the attic in the original storage which was created when he converted the space 10 years ago . It added 23sq m ( 250sq ft ) to the house .

By investing in a water pump he 's retained water pressure levels . " As well as minimising noise levels , having them there means if a tank leaks there will be no damage done to the house , " he says . The space also houses golf clubs , the lawnmower , fishing tackle and the family 's bikes . <p> LAUNDRY In a second shed , two metres by one metre in size , along the same perimeter wall , Jacob installed the hot water cylinder and the condenser boiler , one at each end .

A sheet of light plywood hung in front of the pipework doubles as a place to hang additional storage baskets , sports equipment and tools . <p> GARDEN RE-ORIENTATION The back garden faces east . The Jacobs moved their deck and patio to the east-facing perimeter wall at the far side of the garden , opposite the sliding doors that open from the kitchen and adjacent TV room . Originally a garden shed occupied this space but Jacob noted that the family dog , Obi , used to lie in front of it to sleep in the sun .

According to property portal myhome.ie , in the first quarter of 2011 , some 6,792 properties were for sale in Dublin . Fast forward to the same period in 2013 and this had dropped by 47 per cent , falling further to just 3,010 for the first three months of this year . <p> " It 's no surprise to anyone close to the property market that there is a potential for a housing crisis in the not too distant future , " warns Michael Walsh , head of legal firm Byrne Wallace 's property practice . <p> So why is n't there more construction taking place ? To start with , funding remains tight , with banks still reluctant to lend for property . <p> And where finance is available , Jimmy Healy , public affairs manager with the Construction Industry Federation ( CIF ) , says that developers have to put up 50-60 per cent of the equity themselves , which is " making life difficult " . <p> Strategic development zones Where development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sources -- New Generation for example , which is launching a new development in Sutton , north Dublin , is funding its developments itself , with the backing of cash-rich investors . <p> This begs the question as to why cash- rich international investors are n't spotting an opportunity to come in and build in Dublin . After all , US property outfits such as Kennedy Wilson are happy to acquire completed or partially completed apartment blocks , so why not build from scratch ? <p> But it 's not just about funding . The industry says that it is simply not economical to build -- despite the fact that land prices have plummeted . <p> Walsh points to the experience of developer clients who have land banks and " are simply saying that it 's uneconomical to develop " . <p> Healy agrees . " While there has been a slight reduction since the boom years , it 's still not really competitive , " he says , adding , " land costs have diminished but beyond that nothing else has really changed . Material costs are the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxes and levies are the same . " <p> Figures from the CSO support this , showing that construction costs have held steady , while the price of some elements , such as insulating materials , has soared . Healy suggests that the cost of building a typical three-bed semi-detached house would be about ? 197,000 -- and this excludes taxes and land costs . <p> But what about a developer who has recently bought land at a knock-down price ? For Walsh , this " certainly helps " , but he notes that they will still be faced with increased development costs . <p> One factor that can help developers undertaking new construction is planning certainty , and in Dublin there has been a significant roll out of strategic development zones ( SDZ ) , with four ( Grangegorman , Monard , Cherrywood and North Lotts and Grand Canal Docks ) introduced since 2010 . <p> " The benefit of an SDZ is certainty for the developer , seeing as much of the thinking around property development for a designated area is frontloaded . Greater certainty leads to more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Walsh . <p> For chartered town planner Tom Philips , the expense of levies can negate the value of a zoned area of land . In Kilternan for example , the cost of levies and financial contributions could be ? 250,000 per hectare for the Luas , and ? 60,000 per unit . <p> " You could n't make a scheme in Kilternan stack up financially , " says Philips . <p> Another inhibiting factor is the Part V regulations , which require developers to make available up to 20 per cent of any development for social housing . This results in a cost of between ? 6,000- ? 30,000 per unit for the developer , Healy says , while Walsh notes that it " severely limits viable development and requires reform " . <p> A centralised planning authority could be helpful , and the impending reduction of planning authorities from 88 to 34 is welcomed , but the role and timeline of an independent planning regulator still remains unclear . <p> Yet another issue is the density of developments that planning authorities still request , with views differing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . <p> High vs low densityJohn Moran , secretary general at the Department of Finance , recently argued that we need to move on from the ideal of three-bed semis . Walsh agrees with this view , saying " we need to build a housing strategy that extends beyond the three-bed semi . " <p> However , others suggest that high density is not the way to go . <p> " Some local authorities have higher expectations of density than is appropriate , " Philips says . In the D ? n Laoghaire Rathdown area for example , the council looks for 35 units per hectare -- even though this may not be appropriate in more rural areas such as the aforementioned Kilternan . <p> However , Philips maintains that councils appear to be reluctant to row back on high density planning -- despite the market appearing to take a different view . Meanwhile buyers continue to favour a " house " over an apartment or duplex , hence the rapid rise in Dublin prices . <p> In south Dublin for example , a new apartment development of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school in Stillorgan is being rented out , rather than sold , while NAMA has indicated that it will rent or sell apartments in two developments in south Dublin it is funding to complete depending on what offers the best return . <p> " The market wants lower density but planners are insisting on higher density , " says Philips . Healy agrees : " there is no real desire in the market for apartments " . <p> In the meantime then , for new developments to really take off , it appears that property prices will continue to rise until the risk/costs/reward ratio reaches a level that makes new construction financially worthwhile . <p> But is this what we really want ? <p> One way of easing the problem would be for local authorities to reduce their development charges , and change how they view their sources of income , ie if more new houses are built , revenues from local property taxes will increase . <p> " They should decrease their charges having regard to the revenue that is flowing , and is likely to flow on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " argues Walsh . <p> While members of the Government have made pronouncements on the property market in recent times , a coherent strategy , which could offer some solutions to the current stalemate , has yet to emerge . Indeed for Walsh , there is no strategy " which we can say is fit for current purpose " . <p> Minister of State with responsibility for housing Jan O'Sullivan said last week that the Government 's construction strategy , due to be published within weeks , will examine the planning process to ensure it is fit for purpose . <p> In the meantime , there may be a chance for a planning strategy which better reflects what people want , with D ? n Laoghaire-Rathdown county council currently embarking on a revision of its development plan for 2016 . <p> We reserve the right to remove any content at any time from this Community , including without limitation if it violates the Community Standards .

In a day 's time we 'll know what 's competing for the Palme d'Or . <p> Donald Clarke <p> Donald <p> Wed , Apr 16 , 2014 , 10:01 <p> The poster for the 67th Cannes Film Festival , which begins in a month 's time , features a rather lovely image of the great Marcello Mastroianni in Federico Fellini 's 8 1/2 . " The way he looks at us above his black glasses draws us right in to a promise of global cinematographic happiness , " the poster 's designer tells us . " The happiness of experiencing the Festival de Cannes together . " All right then . Those of us at the festival had better get used to the image . It is plastered on every lamp post and appears , in monster form , above Les Palais des Festivals et des Conrg ? s . I think this one should do very nicely . <p> So what films are we going to see ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost nobody felt that Alexander Payne 's Nebraska would be ready . Yet there it was . We hoped that 12 Years a Slave had a chance . In the event , Steve McQueen 's picture did not turn up until the Venice Film Festival . Be under no illusions . Directors really want their films to premiere on La Croisette . Just look at the last three winners : The Tree of Life , Amour , Blue is the Warmest Colour . Whatever you think about those pictures , you would have to admit that they helped define the relevant cinematic year . <p> We 'll list a few more possibles at the bottom of the article . The most eagerly anticipated film of the year , Paul Thomas Anderson 's Inherent Vice , does not , sadly , seem likely to make it . Most everyone has it now marked down for Telluride or Venice in the autumn . But you never know . Remember Nebraska . <p> Anyway , here are predictions in no particular order . As always , one or more of these films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strand . Both that and the main programmes are announced on Thursday . <p> THE HOMESMAN ( Tommy Lee Jones ) <p> If Tommy Lee Jones 's western is half as good as its trailer then it will be among the greatest films ever made . Honest injun . Just look at this thing . The director stars as a hard-nut escorting three mad women across the plains . It opens in France at the end of May . Jones is a previous winner here . As cert as dead certs come . <p> JIMMY 'S HALL ( Ken Loach ) <p> The film is all finished and will open here at the end of next month . Ken Loach directs the story of an Irish rebel who fell foul of the authorities while running a meeting place in the years after independence . Loach is a great favourite and this is reportedly his last film . Sure to be there . <p> MR TURNER ( Mike Leigh ) <p> At times it feels a little as if Ken Loach and Mike Leigh have been manacled together since birth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as recently as 2010 , competed against one another in the main competition . Leigh 's film about artist J M W Turner seems to be ready . <p> TWO DAYS , ONE NIGHT ( Jean-Pierre Dardenne , Luc Dardenne ) <p> The Dardenne brothers are among the small band of film-makers to have won the Palme d'Or on two occasions . Their latest film -- featuring Marion Cotillard as a woman trying to convince colleagues to give up their bonuses to save her job -- looks certain to be selected . Could they become the first directors to score the hat trick ? Do n't bet against it . <p> LEVIAFAN ( Andrey Zvyagintsev ) <p> Why is Andrey Zvyagintsev not more of a star in world cinema ? Two of the Russian director 's first three films -- The Return and Elena -- have been masterpieces . His latest picture is said to concern corruption in local government . We 're betting it 's more poetic than that synopsis suggests . <p> A PIGEON SAT ON A BRANCH CONTEMPLATING EXISTENCE ( Roy Andersson ) <p> Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you back . The Swedish film-maker is one of world cinema 's masters of the absurd . What a shame he works so slowly . The follow-up to 2007 's magnificent You , The Living promises more creative oddness . Early plot details are too vague to be worth bothering with . <p> MAPS TO THE STARS ( David Cronenberg ) <p> David Cronenberg has stumbled a little of late , but we trust him to come back swinging . His latest picture stars Julianne Moore , Robert Pattinson and Mia Wasikowska in a Hollywood satire that seems charged with decadence and surreal energy . The film is also set to open in France in May . So we have it marked down as a dead cert . <p> WINTER SLEEP ( Nuri Bilge Ceylan ) <p> You feel that Nuri Bilge Ceylan , Turkish director of Uzak and Once Upon a Time in Anatolia , has a Palme d'Or coming his way at some point . He is , in fact , among the most garlanded directors at this event . At least one reliable punter already has Winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Naomi Kawase ) <p> Kawase requires no special pleading . Her superb feature The Mourning Forest was a deserved winner of the Grand Prix in 2007 . But the Cannes authorities will be aware that they have had an atrocious record as regards the inclusion of women recently . If Kawase does n't get in then which female director will ? Maybe Liv Ullmann . <p> BIRDMAN ( Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu ) <p> If it did n't have Inarritu 's name on it Birdman would n't look to have a chance . Zach Galifianiakis , Emma Stone and Michael Keaton star in a serious comedy about an actor trying to regain respect after years playing a superhero . The Mexican 's reputation should be enough to sneak the American picture into the main competition . <p> Also in with a chance : <p> We 're not ruling out Inherent Vice just yet , but it does look like an outsider at best . Morten Tyldum 's The Imitation Game , starring Benedict Cumberbatch as Alan Turing , also does n't look to be ready in time . We will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of competition , as he does n't like being in the races . Liv Ullmann 's Miss Julie , starring our own Colin Farrell , is far from out of the question . The brilliant Xavier Dolan should be there with Mommy . Director of Animal Kingdom , David Michod has a chance with his thriller The Rover . If Peter Bogdanovich 's Squirrel to the Nuts is half decent then Cannes will give him a chance . And then there 's something that everybody 's ruled out that will come to surprise us all .

Video : Darragh Bambrick <p> Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin will be 10 years in that role on Saturday next . Photograph : Brenda Fitzsimons / The Irish Times <p> The Archbishop of Dublin Diarmuid Martin will be 10 years in that role on Saturday next , April 26th . He reflects on the past decade in an interview with Religious Affairs Correspondent Patsy McGarry . <p> What was the high point of the past 10 years where you are concerned ? <p> " It was the way in which the peoples in our parishes rallied after the Murphy report ( it investigated the handling of clerical child sex abuse allegations in the Dublin archdiocese and was published in November 2009 ) and the establishment of robust child protection facilities . It was very impressive to see how people took responsibility to address a problem and a challenge which they did n't cause . The 2012 Eucharistic Congress was an important event . Will it go down in the corporate memory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer is no . " <p> And the low point ? " The Murphy report . The most traumatic experience was the gathering and acquainting myself with the information involved with the report , as well as listening to victims , which is still going on . Listening to the trauma brought on them , families , spouses and children ... The Murphy Commission could n't have worked if we had n't co-operated . Some say garda ? and HSE got off light . We provided information and I have n't the slightest remorse about having done that . I believe it was absolutely important that it come out . Looking back , the most frightening for me is that we had , at the same time , 10 serial ( clerical ) paedophiles active in the archdiocese of Dublin ( in 1970s ) . There 's no way you can say that was system 's failure . That was a terrible thing . It 's very hard to explain it . " <p> Critics of the Murphy report have been busy of late . What 's your view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Murphy report abroad . I have no mandate to defend Judge Murphy but there was a reality there . If people do n't say that should n't have happened then I do n't know what world they belong in . The Pope himself has said that he wants to take/assume a responsibility within the Church for what happened . There can be no denial of that and there can be no denial that the Church in which that happened had got it severely wrong . <p> " It did n't seem to dawn on them ( revisionists ) that if you wanted to get a priest who has a wide understanding of what went on with the Murphy report I could have had something to say . I was never asked by any of them . In some cases I 'm clearly criticised in public and what I 'm finding is that these people are doing exactly what they accuse the Murphy Commission of doing , they 're giving me no right to reply . " <p> What about those who say the aftermath of Murphy was n't handled well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do enough to deal with the trauma of priests . That 's a fair criticism . But the trouble was the atmosphere afterwards became so difficult that it would n't have been easy to do that . A lot of priests were genuinely traumatised but a polarisation came out of that . Meetings held were not about the Murphy report , which was about children who were abused . Much of the reaction was about church personalities not about the children " . <p> " What upset me after publication of the Murphy report were the sort of bland apologies . It just was n't to me the sort of reaction that should be coming from a situation within the Church of Jesus Christ . The sort of things said to me included I studied law and in all my course there was never mention of paedophilia . ' Paedophilia is n't a crime . Rape , the sexual abuse of children are crimes . In Archbishop McQuaid 's time canonical trials took place . We had a priest arrested in the 1950s for child sexual abuse . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison because they were considered the lowest of the low , which means there was an awareness in legal circles that child molesting took place . " <p> Were you surprised the resignations offered by Dublin 's two remaining auxiliary bishops after Murphy were not accepted by Rome ? " That 's a story which will be told when the archives are opened . All I can say is this is that the majority written on this is pure speculation . It does n't tell a very complicated story . Most of what is there is speculation and it 's wrong . " <p> How are relations between you and the two auxiliary bishops concerned ? " We have good working relationship . " <p> What of the 2010/2011 apostolic visitation sent by Rome after Murphy to investigate the Irish Church ? " It set expectations it was never going to realise and I think there are lessons to be learned for future events of that kind . It actually , in some ways , delayed reforms in the Irish church because , somehow or other , it created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term the changes and the reforms are beginning to take place now . This is not just with the appointment of new bishops , it 's going on in parishes . To some extent the apostolic visitation froze the Irish church at a particular moment and that is n't a criticism of those who carried it out , maybe a criticism of those who planned it . But , for the future the Irish church has to find the answers for the Irish church and where it has done so it has done so well , with the National Board for Safeguarding Children ( NBSC ) . Towards Healing , etc. for instance . " <p> The NBSC seems to be in difficulty ? " I think it has done a great job . Ian Elliott ( retired chief executive ) did extraordinary work . He certainly was the right man in the right place at the right time . Only a person with his dogged determination would have got the systems going . Everybody recognises that . I have great confidence in Teresa Devlin , also a person of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board is not weakened . That is n't in the interests of anybody . But there are tensions . " <p> Are there difficulties where brother bishops are concerned ? " You 'd have to ask them . I would be considered at the bishops ' conference as speaking in a forthright manner but I think bishops respect that . When serious problems arise I am turned to as well . I 've no personal problem with any individual bishop . " <p> What about your well-known reluctance to return to Dublin ? " I 'd spent most of my life in a very different world . I was happy in various positions I had . I felt that maybe somebody who was closer to the realities of being a diocesan bishop would be better . I know my own limitations and , somebody said , if I do n't feel up to it I should resign . None of us are perfect . I know where my abilities and talents are and where my lackings are and as time goes on I 'm more aware of these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the third Council of Priests that has taken place in my time . Our Council of Priests meets more regularly than most Councils of Priests . It does a good deal of business . It shapes pastoral planning . Parish pastoral councils came from them , parish pastoral workers came from them , a re-look at the financial system came from them , this time a revision of the deaneries to incorporate more lay people into running them ... these all came from the Council of Priests . We also took up problems of priestly life . I do n't make up decisions on my own . Someone said parish pastoral councils was my idea . It was n't . <p> Have you enjoyed the job ? " Yes . I am doing 40 Confirmations this year and it 's great meeting , listening and talking to people at an important moment in their lives . You see I like my native city , always did . I 'm very much aware of the fact the archdiocese of Dublin is n't just Dublin city . I 've really tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality in big towns such as Athy , Wicklow and Arklow . " <p> What about the rumour that you may be en route back to Rome at Pope Francis 's request ? " That was a perception greatly cultivated by a number of journalists on the basis of , effectively , clerical gossip . Anybody who tries to interpret Pope Francis 's ideas does n't know what they are talking about . Pope Francis reveals his intention when he has done it . " <p> Looking at Ireland now what do you think where attitudes generally are concerned ? " We have to develop a mature relationship with our past , our present , with secularisation and with the strong commitment and interest of people of faith in this country , who are still there . We have to find ways which are creative , which allow each of us to flourish in our own traditions . And also to flourish in public in our traditions . <p> What about pluralism in schools ? " I took a lead because I believe we will only have pluralism when , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allows people of different traditions to flourish within their tradition and that those who want a faith-based education will be allowed to have that and those who want something different , they also have a civic right to have that provided for them . It does n't mean that Catholic schools would simply be Catholic ghettoes . No one would want that . <p> " We 've given a lead but are still running into difficulties and challenges , usually around local issues . Maybe , for the future , a more robust collaboration between the Department ( of Education ) and the Church would make these things move a little quickly . Consultation is a slow process and it is n't moving quickly <p> The demography of Ireland is quite complex . Demographers will say that by 2050 the population may come back to the mythical eight million figure and more than of those will live on a narrow strip along the east coast , which means a huge number will be in the archdiocese of Dublin . We have more children under four than we have people over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very young population . Talking to one parish priest the other day he had 330 baptisms last year , that 's 10 school classes . We have to be looking at that . " <p> What about the ideological battles between conservatives and liberals in Ireland today ? " We have to learn to fight our agendas robustly but respectfully . I still say we 're a stage in secularisation in Ireland where there are still what I call adolescent elements , on both sides , who are reacting rather than coming into mature debate . If I look at the debate on religious pluralism in Germany , or in Switzerland , or even in Italy it 's a very different type of debate . The religious culture of Ireland is actually very complex and quite original . You can get into a debate and get hit in the face by one side unexpectedly . " <p> What is the position of Irish Catholic hospitals when it comes to implementing measures allowed by the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Act ? " As yet the Government has to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ethos is contractual and ca n't be legally broken . I would hope there 'd room for conscientious objection of individuals , which again has n't been defined . I believe that most of our hospitals have been dealing with the conflicts covered in the new legislation in a very serious manner and one which protects the life and health of all people . We should n't lose that . " <p> What of the derogation in equality legislation which allows churches to not employ people in schools and hospital whose lifestyle is deemed not to be compatible with their ethos ? I refer to gay people , single mothers , co-habiting couples . " I believe that the more pluralism we have in types of school then individuals who 've got problems of ethos or personal questions would be free to find a place where they would be happy with the ethos . <p> What about teachers in particular ? " In the discussion on divesting and pluralism in education not enough has been said about teachers . I 'm not happy with somebody who really does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a school . It is n't what I would want in a Catholic school . There has to be a way for teachers to be able to move to the type of school where they would be happier in accordance with their own conscience and convictions . A further complication is that there 's nothing more local than the local school and there 's nothing more complex than teacher politics . If we want to move forward into a truly pluralist system , then we have to find ways of accommodating people and of everybody taking a courageous stance over their convictions . " <p> How do you see the future of the archdiocese ? " At the moment the number of priests has gone below 400 for first time . Of those about 130 are retired , out of ministry , sick , so on . For 199 parishes we 've got about 250 active diocesan priests . The age ratio very high . We have the support of religious congregations in 20 or so parishes . We have at the moment one parish without a priest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real participation . There 's something happening with very strong lay participation . I ca n't explain this but in the past 12 months this has become more visible to me . The decrease in priests ' income , that 's stabilising . In some areas there 's been a stabilisation in Mass attendance . Are we stabilising at too low a level ? I think we are . This is where we need a much stronger missionary outreach , particularly to young people , to help them feel within themselves what we felt at their age in an understanding of faith and commitment . <p> " We have to reach out to that strange gap between faith and public life . Right across Europe you have a group of people , who even enter politics , faith-driven in that their concept of politics as a service comes from their faith . To some extent the Church retreated from a strong cultural presence because the strong cultural presence we inherited was not the right one and was being rejected , and therefore we might be retreating back away from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very different diocese today . It is a better diocese . I do n't look for praise for leadership . I 'm not doing it , priests are doing it . Despite everything we have enough priests to continue for a number of years . We 're not in the dramatic situation of Latin America and so on . I think the parish of the future will look very different . And many of the things priests are doing will be done by others . The priest will be the one who will lead the liturgy but even the liturgy will be different . Going out to the parishes I 'm finding this is already taking place and it is n't a devaluation of the role of the priest . It 's a different relationship . If that develops and flourishes I think we 're going to have a more vibrant , a smaller church . <p> " I 'm getting older ( 69 ) . I do n't have the energy I had . We have to get a younger generation within the church who are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way we did things in the past . It wo n't be running institutions . <p> How many of the recent Popes did you know personally ? " I did n't know Pope John Paul . I would have met him . I did n't know Pope Paul VI well but I would have known Pope John Paul II , Pope Benedict and this Pope . " <p> What about Pope Francis ? " The thing that fascinates me about Pope Francis is this ability to see the rigorism and laxism he mentions . We ( in Ireland ) came from a very rigorist tradition . The tendency is that we might move into laxism now . Pope Francis has this amazing ability to place himself in the grey area in between and to say the rigorist and the laxist have both got it wrong and that all of us are sinners and all of us are journeying . We 've to find a new way of talking about this and a new way of being the Church . <p> " People are quite surprised at some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing the Church 's teaching . He 's saying look , we live in this world , me as Pope included , of not really living up to the teaching ' . <p> " He has certainly , with regard to the Vatican , brought about change which is quite radical . And he has done it in unusual ways . He has shown a real sense of governance . He had done what the great CEOs do , he has changed the whole atmosphere of a place where people are more proud to belong to the organisation . He has done that by charism and by dedication , but he has also shown a very sharp sense of governance . His moving to Santa Marta is n't simply that he likes to live in communion . <p> " He has broken down a whole system of people who managed access to him and he has n't relinquished on that . He 's still very , very determined that he 's not going to be pushed into the system . You can see in certain parts of the Church a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what next and they 're right . The leaders in policy there are not the heads of the dicasteries ( Roman Curia ) but eight cardinals from around the world . " <p> Is it likely that there will be greater emphasis under this Pope on decision making at local level ? " I think there will . If you listen carefully to him he wants to hear what is happening at the local level but he 's not saying everybody go their own way . He has said no local church should go off on its own . He 's renowned for listening , for gathering but he 's quite strong about his own responsibilities . " <p> You met him last week . " I 've met him a couple of times . I met him at synods and he knew who I was but he always refers to a conversation we had in Quebec ( 2008 ) during the Eucharistic Congress then . But I do n't know him in the way I would have known Pope Benedict , who I know on a personal level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work basis but the present Pope is always very affectionate towards me . " <p> Were you surprised at speed with which the canonisation of Pope John Paul II is going ahead ? " There 's a certain wisdom in canon law that indicated you do n't rush into canonisations , but I 've no particular difficulty . Saints are not perfect people . They 're people who tried to live in a saintly way but they would all have their characteristics . It is interesting that Pope Francis decided to have the two canonisations together ( of Popes John XXIII and Pope John Paul II ) . He 's never explained that . <p> The interesting thing is that most people today do n't know who Pope John XXIII was . I remember watching his election on television . It was before RTE existed . When I was born we prayed for Pope Pius and our Archbishop John Charles . I was 12 or13 . Seeing this chubby Pope who did n't seem nearly as perfect as Pius XII had been presented . Then the idea of him going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been the prisoner in the Vatican . There are , in that sense , many similarities between Pope John and this Pope <p> Pope John was only a few days pope when he started talking about the Vatican Council . Both of these popes ( Francis and John XXIII ) within days were making decisions . They both had an idea as to what they wanted to do . They were n't totally baffled and surprised . " <p> Pope Francis has called for a poor church for the poor . How is that compatible with Archbishop 's House in Drumcondra ? " My living quarters are smaller than his ( Pope Francis ) . He uses the Vatican , he receives people there all the time . My staff is half that of my predecessor . I probably cook more meals for myself than he did . I look after myself , do my own shopping . I also have to ensure those 100 something priests who are retired that they are supporter and get the quality of support they need . That 's not easy today . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . " I think more a change in the atmosphere in which people are being asked to live , than a change in teaching . But that is not to be underestimated . It would be a more realistic way in which all of us will understand we 're all imperfect in the way we live . It 's saying to everybody you take responsibility for the way you live . " <p> Of the Popes you knew what were they like ? " All were very , very different . Pope Benedict worked for Pope John Paul but is also a very different man . Benedict is a man of very deep intellect and extraordinary sensitivity . Pope John Paul was a very practical man . He was also a very sensitive person , a man who always wanted to say thanks to anyone who helped him . It was quite humbling .

He did n't have that sense of reaching out that he has now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed at the age of 78 which is quite a remarkable achievement . <p> " Both Pope John XXIII and Pope Francis are similar .

Photo : Gareth Chaney/Collins <p> THE Government has backed the controversial ? 843,000 pay packet awarded to Bank of Ireland boss Richie Boucher last year , as some shareholders branded it as " disgraceful " . <p> At the bank 's annual general meeting in Dublin yesterday , shareholder William Malone slammed the bank chief 's remuneration for 2013 . <p> " It 's a disgraceful amount of money to pay a man who two years ago lost ? 2bn , " he told the AGM , or annual court , as Bank of Ireland refers to it . <p> But the Government used the taxpayers ' 14pc stake in the bank to lend its support to Mr Boucher 's pay award . <p> Almost all the bank 's shares that were voted yesterday -- 99.36pc -- were cast in favour of his and other board members ' pay packets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to approve the 2013 packages for directors .

@@2458233 <p> There are those who regard the availability of metaphor as a blessing , an enhancement of the ranges of life . In one of the epigraphs to Denis Donoghue 's subtle and engrossing new book , the poet John Donne , with the faintest of apologies for a possible irreverence , calls his maker not only " a literall God " but also " a figurative , a metaphoricall God " . <p> Of course we are not to think of God himself as a metaphor , but we find in his words , Donne says , " such a height of figures , such voyages , such peregrinations to fetch remote and precious metaphors " that God seems to fly while every human author crawls . Voyages , fetch , remote , precious : the terms , here used positively , suggest the distance from humble , present reality that is deplored by the enemies of metaphor , from John Ruskin to Susan Sontag and beyond . How often do we use " far fetched " as a compliment ? <p> Donoghue suggests that even Aristotle , who said " a command of metaphor " was " the mark of genius " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it , as George Eliot asks in The Mill on the Floss , " that we can so seldom declare what a thing is , except by saying it is something else ? " <p> She is half-joking , in her rather earnest way , but the definition is basic and still current , and Donoghue uses it in much the same form if with quite a different tone . " On the face of it a metaphor . . . is bizarre . Why say that something is something else ? " <p> More elaborately , and with ironic caution , he announces , " We are engaging in metaphor when we see , or think we see , or propose to see , one thing in the light of another . " Why is this a blessing or a worry , and do we have to take sides ? <p> Not entirely . Or perhaps we do , but our decisions will depend on the case and the day . One question is whether we can manage without metaphor , whether the idea of dispensing with it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphor some of the time -- although " get along " would be an instance of how easily it returns . As Donoghue says , " ' The literal ' is rampant with metaphors , new and old . " <p> That is , if we ca n't call things by their proper names because we are not Adam we can at least , to quote Eliot again , " call things by the same names as other people call them by " . But then some of these same names are going to be metaphors , and how long will it be before we ask a friend to pull herself together or conquer her fear ? <p> " There are no dead metaphors , " Donoghue persuasively says , " only sleeping ones " , wittily conjuring up a tribe of such snoozers : the heart of the matter , in the fullness of time , the leg of the table , the heel of the hunt , comfort zone , brass tacks , the leaf of the book , picture of health , a wild goose chase , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wolf in sheep 's clothing , Freudian slip , no-win situation , toxic assets , push comes to shove . <p> The case against metaphor here is no case at all , as these sleeping tropes are just doing the same work as their literal cousins , fuzzily referring to whatever these phrases usually refer to . <p> Departure from the usualWhat 's striking about working metaphors is their departure from the usual . They are often literally nonsense , as philosophers like John Wisdom and Donald Davidson have said . But this may only mean , and often does , that the literal is not enough for us and that our idea of sense is gravely impoverished . As Donoghue very well says , " If you take the metaphor seriously , you provoke the resistance of common sense . A metaphor incurs resistance from our sense of absurdity and is indifferent to shame . " <p> His book is full of wild and beautiful examples . Can anyone " sigh blood " , as is promised in The Revenger 's Tragedy ? Did any woman ever play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure does in The Waste Land ? Do we even know what " bisqued " means when Wallace Stevens writes of " a purple Southern mountain bisqued / With the molten mixings of related things " ? <p> We have recourse to our sense of absurdity in order to register the stretch and strangeness of these images . But then we need to let it go so that the images may do their enchanted work ; Donoghue says , in a memorable phrase , that he thinks of reading " as enchanted interpretation " . <p> This is his repeated , lyrical theme . " Readers expand metaphorically when they encounter metaphor " ; metaphors " add perceptions that were not there before " ; a metaphor " gives us more abundant life " ; metaphors " offer to change the world by changing one 's sense of it " ; the source of metaphor " is the liberty of the mind among such words as there are " . <p> Donoghue 's instances and authorities run from the Latin hymns he sang as a boy in church in Warrenpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ian McEwan ; from Tertullian and Hegel to Rimbaud and Hardy , Proust and Nabokov , and many others . <p> Holding all this together are two central fictions , as Stevens would say . One is about the origins of the distinction between the literal and metaphorical ; the other is about the difference between metaphor and simile . They are fictions not because they are untrue but because they are in the first case untestable and in the second case easily blurred . <p> Did we start with the literal and invent the metaphorical later ? This is Aristotle 's view , and still the standard one . We know the right names for things and we arbitrarily ( or poetically , depending on our view ) choose to employ other ones . Or did we , as Vico and after him Rousseau suggested , start with tropes and imaginings and arrive at the literal when , at some late stage of human development , we became reasonable ? <p> Literal language would be " the economy practiced on metaphor " . Donoghue hopes Vico is right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sequence is a fable . Without the metaphorical the literal would not be the literal ; it would just be . And without the literal the metaphorical ca n't look unusual . So the sequence offers us a magical preference either way . Do we want to feel grounded , free to fly but mostly preferring to stand ? Or do we want to feel we have given too much away , squandered treasures of the imagination through our timid devotion to common sense ? <p> Similes , Donoghue suggests , do n't alter the world the way metaphors do . " No wild intention transpires in a language that says something is like something else . " <p> This is not just a matter of grammar , of the explicit mark of comparison , although that contingency is important . It is a matter of imaginative action . " A simile compares one thing with another , without changing either of the entities compared ; it is a tangent that does n't dislodge the circle it touches . " We note the nifty use of a metaphor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very fine point . In the drafts of his great novel Proust had his narrator compare the activity of remembering to waking up in a strange room . In the final version he just wakes up in a strange room , and tries to remember . What 's more , metaphors do not deal only in resemblance . Metaphors are about creating " new company " for words and things and attributes , and their " essential requirement " is that they be " improper " , a form of bad linguistic behaviour . If two ideas are associated in a writer 's or reader 's mind , they can ( and do ) hang out there for any reason they like -- because they are so different , for example . <p> Still , similes are not to be scorned . They " provide a breathing space in the narrative " of Paradise Lost , for example , and " you can do more than breathe in a breathing space " . <p> And yet for all this bravery and invention Donoghue 's book ends with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The occasion is a remarkable reading of Stevens 's poem The Motive for Metaphor , where the motive is defined as " shrinking from / The weight of primary noon , / The ABC of being . " Elsewhere Stevens writes of some roses that are " too much as they are to be changed by metaphor " . Donoghue rightly says there is not much to be done with Stevens in this mood . If he had stuck with it we would have " taken him for a sturdy realist " . But he 's not , or mostly not , and what he calls shrinking is what Donoghue calls the liberty of the mind . <p> Donoghue is willing to say , as his reading of Stevens prompts him to , that " the cry of metaphor is doomed " -- the cry , that is , " to change the world by giving things their proper names " . But it is doomed only if we wish the change to end on the supposed propriety of these names , or allow ourselves to feel ourselves shamed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move on from Adam 's language even if we had it , and failure here would be a kind of success . If we take this option then " metaphor " , as Donoghue writes in the last words of his book , " will do its transforming work another day " .

I 'm on my third safety order . <p> The girls always had contact with their father , and spent weekends with him . I supported the girls and myself with no assistance from their dad . Despite my ex-husband 's threats to " burn you down , house and all " I got legally separated in May 2010 and , for the sake of peace , I gave everything to him . He had also been having an affair when I left initially , but I never told the girls . The girls moved out a week after the court case in May 2010 and have not answered my phone calls , texts or letters since . I thought we had a good relationship . I spoilt them and was always there for them . They were my life . <p> Since they left I have had bad health . It 's like bereavement . How can I re-establish our relationship ? <p> David replies : In short , if they do n't respond to any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to re-establish any kind of relationship . It sounds like you will just have to keep trying to speak with them and to continue to let them know that you care about them and are interested in them and their lives . <p> But , I also think you need to do some planning about what kinds of conversations you would like to have with them if you do manage to make contact again . <p> It seems from what you describe that you never explained to the girls the reasons why you separated from their dad . You left him because he was unfaithful and abusive . These are very good reasons to leave a marriage . <p> Your ex-husband sounds like a very unpleasant and untrustworthy man , based on what you say . It is surprising that your daughters have never experienced an equivalent unpleasantness , or at least not to the extent that they were afraid to live with him fulltime . <p> I can only assume that they do n't share your view of their dad . It is not unusual for children , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught in the middle , feeling loyalty to their mother and their father . <p> It is not that I necessarily expect them to think and feel negatively about their dad , but I would expect that , in their early twenties , they would be able to see and understand the complexity of their parents ' relationship such that they could see it was " neither ... nor " . <p> In other words , they should , at this point , be able to accept that neither you nor their dad is perfect . I 'd hope that they could see that you must both take responsibility for the dissolution of your marriage . <p> It seems that somewhere along the line the girls have come to blame you , alone , for the break-up of the family . I wonder if they have n't forgiven you or that they have felt some other hurt in their relationship with you ? <p> I know that you say that you have tried to contact the girls over the last four years , but there also seems to be something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lack of response . <p> That passivity is also evident in the way in which you contested nothing in the separation agreement . <p> I could imagine that you had enough of the fighting that occurred in your marriage and were prepared to do anything to try to be free of it . <p> However , this may also have led your daughters to have a na ? ve or incomplete picture of their dad and your relationship with him . <p> So , in any conversations you have with the girls at any stage in the future , I think you will need to be more honest with them about the nature of your relationship . I think you need to contextualise , for them , the decisions you made nine or 10 years ago . <p> They need to realise that you left , with them , because you had been abused and betrayed by their father .

Then he just stopped taking part , and sat on the bench at the sidelines . <p> We ended up not going anymore as he just refused to take part . <p> Today , he started a swim club to get him interested in swimming . Each weekly session is an hour long . <p> My husband went with him and initially my son was interested , but very quickly into the session he did n't want to take part . <p> My husband ended up getting into the pool with him to help him along . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was excited , so I do n't understand why he then does n't want to do it . It 's very hard not to get frustrated with him , especially when I see other boys taking part . <p> I would like your advice about how to help him participate in new things . Is there anything we can do that could make it easier for him ? <p> David replies I notice the two examples of activities that you gave were both formally organised activities : a Little Kickers soccer morning ( presumably organised by the local soccer club ) and a swim club . <p> I can understand that it may be tempting to get him into clubs and mixing with lots of other children , but the social nature of these activities may be so off-putting for him that the fun of the activity itself may be lost . <p> So , for example , he may still really enjoy kicking a soccer ball around with you or his dad . He may , equally , still enjoy going swimming with your family , where he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about or whatever he wants to do . <p> So , rather than front-loading the activities with lots of social pressure ( since you describe him as shy ) , it may be better to start with the activities and do them as part of your own family outings . So , a kick-about in the local park or a family swim may allow him to gain some confidence with the activities themselves . <p> Then , when he is a bit older , it may be easier for him to engage in the busier social environment of more formal training with something like soccer or swimming , confident that he enjoys the activity itself . <p> One of the things that , ironically , may be putting additional pressure on your son is your hope and expectation that he will get involved in different things . <p> He may be intensely aware that both you and his dad are very invested in him being involved in these activities . <p> It has become the norm for parents to try to get children involved in lots of extra-curricular activities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not part of a Little Kickers club or its equivalent . <p> I think it is fair to challenge this assumption . There is no need for children to attend formal training , even in a fun atmosphere , when there are so many opportunities for children to have lots of informal fun just playing , with family or with some well-known friends . <p> Even though it may seem perfectly normal and expected , from your point of view , that he will want to be with lots of other children , playing a range of games or sports , it may just not suit him . <p> Of course , at age five , he probably does feel obliged to go along with what you and his dad propose . It is very hard for a five year old to argue , effectively , against his parents ' desires . <p> So , the easier option is to allow himself to get taken along on the wave of your enthusiasm . In truth , he also probably has no real sense of what it is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been to a swim club , for example , he can have little idea what it entails , save from what you describe to him . <p> If , then , the reality does n't match his perception , or imagined idea , from your description , he may be upset , disappointed or anxious . <p> Of course , the opposite is also possible , that the reality exceeds , positively , his imagination . In this case he will , naturally , be delighted to continue . <p> For the time being , however , I 'd simply suggest to you to bring him out kicking a ball , playing tennis , swimming , hurling or any other activity you can think of that he might enjoy . Let the social aspect of it develop subsequently . <p> There is no need to rush him out of his " shyness " . Caution and reserve are very useful human traits .

@@2466232 <h> Does it make me a bitch to love Cameron Diaz and hate Gwyneth Paltrow ? <h> Both are beautiful , successful and rich -- but if i do n't like one , I 'm seen as ' bitchy ' . If men do n't like one , it has some logical reasoning behind it . why is this double standard across the genders deemed acceptable ? <p> After all , the very term " bitch " is inherently female . But that is one whopper of a non-too-flattering generalisation about half of the world 's population . Is it fair ? Is it true ? Is it that simple ? Is it a rather insidious means to undermine women ? And do women collude ? <p> You hear it bandied about all the time , whether to justify publication of pictures of Sharon Ni Bheolain in her pyjamas ; to box off commentaries about Sheryl Sandberg ; to categorise comments about Playboy-- some version of " You know how women are ! " <p> A generalisation has reached some level of penetration when it can be summed up in a sentence that contains not one single fact . <p> I asked a random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughts on how women are in terms of whether we 're crueller than men and whether we 're crueller to other women . <p> There were quite a few comments ( male and female ) about women as bosses . But for every bad female boss , there had been a bad male boss -- it was just the style of being bad was different and the general , unscientific consensus was the women bosses tended more towards headwreck tactics . <p> One ( male ) view is that men are simpler . If they do n't like someone they do n't need to analyse why . They are perfectly happy to just dislike , or even to be disliked , without having to get to the bottom of why that is . <p> Women on the other hand feel a greater need to justify their feelings . Rather than simply dislike someone and leave it at that they have to explain and in order to do that they lay out exactly why and this becomes a demolition project that seems bitchy . <p> THEORY <p> Another ( female ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and boys are as likely to say to someone 's face what they say behind their backs whilst women feel either less free to be honest , or more compelled to be seen as nice . <p> And perhaps as a result , behind people 's backs or in situations that permit anonymity , women are more lethal than men . <p> Bitchiness is linked to a certain level of sneakiness , being behind people 's backs but again , who is to decide what 's worse ? <p> More than a few unkindnesses have been perpetrated upfront in the name of " I 'm just being honest " . Arguably the voicing of any unkind thought , whether to a face or a behind a back , is cruel . <p> The truth is it is difficult to quantify any of this -- there are only generalisations : plenty of men bitch and plenty of women never do . <p> Some research has been done . Tracy Vaillancourt , Professor of Psychology at McMaster University , did some experiments and the title they gave " bitchiness " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very change in title changes the image . Viewing " bitching " as " aggression " moves it from a dismissable category of misdemeanour to a more serious thing . Something that might be taken more seriously as a behaviour , and studied more seriously . <p> Dominant evolutionary behaviour has mostly been studied from a male perspective , how male creatures mark their territory , maximise their genetic heritage and so forth . <p> But clearly they have no genetic heritage without females so it follows that females have their own evolutionary behaviour . <p> It would be nice if the research had discovered that women are not indirectly aggressive , bitchy or cruel to each other . It would be nice , but it is n't true . <p> Some studies have found that women , especially younger women , would be more likely to have a hypothetical friendship with plainer , fatter and less sexually dressed other women . <p> Prof Vaillancourt 's experiment involved dressing the same young , thin , blonde woman differently and measuring the reactions of her female peers on a college campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sexual provocation , she was greeted with far more hostility -- covert and overt-- than when she wore combats and a t-shirt . <p> Such behaviour is instantly ascribed to jealousy or envy . Which suggests it 's just petty . However , put it down to evolutionary competition , and it seems more serious . <p> Even without a reproductive element , the evolutionary prerogative is ingrained in us all ; just as it is for men , so it is for women -- she who scores wins . <p> That good old evolution stuff is then well and truly complicated by relatively recent and ever-changing societal issues . <p> One factor that has nothing to do with gender is that we also resent people who give themselves permission to do things that we do not give ourselves permission to do . <p> So women who feel , or who have been made to feel , that being " too girly " or dressing provocatively or any number of things are wrong get mad at women who do not feel obliged to play by the same rules . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge our opposites . Men can be cruel to each other too ; it just manifests differently . <p> They 're substantially more likely to express rivalries physically . Despite talk of girl gangs or female aggression , women of any age are much less likely to get into physical disputes . A lot of what happens is just different gender manifestations of the same basic thing . <p> It 's not to say that all bitchy moments , all squabbles , comments , scuffles and fights are major evolutionary moments . <p> Plenty of it is just superficial ; some of it 's nasty , and lots of it stupid . But by making everything seem silly it is easy to dismiss , and as such easier to generalise . <p> It makes it easier for some man to go on the radio and say , " Oh you know how women are " , without having to explain at all . <p> That notion has got so prevalent that it is now all but impossible for a woman to honestly dislike or criticise another woman without the charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annoying , but it 's also quite repressive . When you have people unthinkingly dismissing others ' opinions as being part of a tendency -- women are mean to other women , Irish people do n't like English people , Americans are stupid -- it automatically undermines what they 're saying . <p> It also undermines their very right to offer an opinion at all . An opinion dismissed as almost a syndrome is an opinion completely undermined . And where do these generalisations stop ? Women are mean to other women , women are stupid , you 're a kid what would you know ? Irish people are thick , Catholics/ Protestants/ Jews/Muslims are mean . Do n't listen to him he 's a golfer ? <p> If a man says he does n't like David Beckham , people assume it 's because he dislikes him on some manly grounds -- knowledge-based manly grounds -- like he was a rubbish soccer player , his boxers are n't well made or his interest in fashion unworthy . <p> If a woman says she does n't like Victoria Beckham , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevalent in recent times with Gwyneth Paltrow 's announcement of her " conscious uncoupling " from Chris Martin . There was much all round scoffing at the term , for the dyslexically inclined amongst us all too easily confused with " unconscious coupling " . <p> Then it got personal . Gwyneth has never been a wildly popular figure . Gorgeous yes , but in terms of public image she has not managed to inspire empathy . <p> Moral <p> The conscious uncoupling , on top of the quinoa-flavoured virtue and hemp skin care- based holier-than-thou-ishness that seemed to be the feeling she generated , was much mocked by men and women alike . <p> But men who did n't like Gwynnie , or Chris Martin for that matter , were assumed to feel that way on some kind of reasonable grounds . Moral principles or aversion to quinoa . Something of value . <p> Women who did n't like Gwynnie were just indulging in some interwomen bitching , because they were jealous . <p> I do not warm to Gwyneth . It 's not because she looks better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any comparative reason at all . Cameron Diaz is also gorgeous , successful and rich and I really like her . <p> Clearly I do n't know either woman , I am just going on how they choose to portray themselves . To dismiss my failure to warm to Paltrow as envy-based is to undermine the actual arguments I might make for my case . <p> Incidently they are as follows : setting herself up as a lifestyle guru to me suggests that she believes anyone could live like she does which is annoying because ... a ) she can have no real understanding of how most people live , and b ) it carries with it the implication " if you tried hard enough . " <p> This is hardly a life-alteringly important issue but it is indicative of a viewpoint . If you dismiss an entire gender as being incapable of rational analysis about themselves , it undermines them as sensible beings at all .

' Fans take a picture of a statue for former Manchester United manager David Moyes . Photograph : Clive Brunskill/Getty Images <p> It hardly matters who succeeds David Moyes as manager of Manchester United . It hardly matters even to Manchester United supporters .

What matters is the size of the wage bill . <p> This determined 92 per cent in the variation of the league positions of the Premiership clubs during the period 1991 to 2000 , according to data published in Soccernomics by Simon Kuper and Stefan Szymanski .

" <p> Based on data the authors and others have assembled , Soccernomics claims : " The vast bulk of managers appear to have almost no impact on their teams ' performance and do not last very long in the job . They seem to add so little value that it is tempting to think they could be replaced by their secretaries , or their chairmen , or stuffed teddy bears , without the club 's league position changing .

@@2474237 <h> Ivan Morris Column - Being a scracth golfer is now easier than ever <p> In this week 's Limerick Leader column , Ivan Morris hits out at a system that lets too many golfers play off scratch . <p> It 's easier than ever to become a scratch golfer . Plus golfers are ten-a-penny , which tends to undermine their status . Because there are so many plus players , they no longer receive the respect they deserve . Some may manipulate their handicaps by picking and choosing where and when they play but I would not wish to impugn the honesty of scratch men in general . They are simply ' willing victims ' of a faulty system . <p> Some scratch golfers are demon putters around their home courses and break par regularly in domestic competitions but they can play like duffers ' away ' under more stringent circumstances . The CONGU Handicapping system allows scratch golfers to get away with confining their activities to ' home ground . ' As a result , some get their handicaps down to plus figures far too easily . <p> As well as the usual requirements , a scratch golfer should also have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions annually ( i.e. in scratch cups ) to be eligible to play in a provincial or national championship . If you ca n't perform in a one-day scratch event how can you expect to play well in a championship ? Honest golfers have nothing to fear from being ' incentivized ' to play in scratch cups and alliances more often . If they did , it would be good for them and good for golf . <p> In 1970 , a scratch player was expected to return scores equal to or better than the standard score of the day at a variety of courses in open competitions ; a minimum of six scores , three at one 's home course and three at three different away courses . A player could only be given or retain a handicap of scratch if his performances in general were thought worthy by his provincial branch . That meant figuring in the later stages of championships and Irish Senior Cup as well as representing one 's province . It was very rare that a player who was n't a current inter-pro would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1970s , rarely rising above fifteen or sixteen in number . In a good year there might be five in Munster . Scratch was intended to represent a very high and consistent standard of play . Even if a player met the required standard , it did not follow that a scratch handicap would always be granted . Times have changed ; more ' proper ' athletes are playing golf . The game is easier due to high-tech equipment and there is the once , unheard of phenomenon of FULL-TIME amateurs . <p> That the game was more difficult forty years ago is without doubt . That there was less competition was balanced by the fact that the scratch man enjoyed the clear advantage that if off form for a lengthy period the .1s would not mount up and count against him . The big difference today is that turning in sufficient scores on ' easy ' home courses will automatically entitle one to a scratch handicap . <p> Under the most benign conditions imaginable at this years West of Ireland Championship at Rosses Point only 16 golfers out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratch or better , managed to break par . At the other end of the spectrum there were 15-scores in the 80s returned , which compared with days gone by ( even allowing for the ' perfect ' conditions ) was not , by any means , a poor effort . In many respects the 2014 version ( won by a name to remember , Jack Hume of Naas ) might have been the best ' West ' ever ! The scourge of slow play was controlled and the innovation of pre-qualifying helped to eliminate the ' no hopers ' and kept the standard high while also giving the ' dark horse ' his chance . <p> It 's overdue that the South of Ireland at Lahinch instituted a similar ' pre-qualifier ' approach . It would weed out the no-hopers and boost the quality of the entry . A fixed number of four or five byes into the match play draw for current internationals would be ' The South 's ' saviour and bring it back to its former glory . <p> Every week there are players in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manages to break par on a championship course deserves our respect . But , scores in the mid-to-high 80s that are regularly returned at this level are indefensible for plus-handicap golfers even if the courses are set up to play as tough as any of the professional majors with slick greens , high rough and ' tucked ' pin positions . <p> To avoid further scandal , the GUI should be noting the names of those who never come close to playing to their handicaps in open competitions because it reflects badly on themselves and CONGU . Too many ' uncompetitive ' scratch men highlight a flaw in the system rather than failings in character , if it is allowed to go unchecked . To call somebody a ' bandit ' because he can not automatically match par away from his home course in a championship is unfair .

Photo : James Crombie/Inpho <p> Hurling is the game that just keeps on giving . After last year 's magnificent championship campaign where one great match was followed by another , this final of the National League has only served to whet our appetites for the summer . <p> This was a match of huge physical collisions around the middle of the field , of great intensity -- in the second-half and on into extra-time -- and of some super score-taking . If this is a foretaste of what we are going to get in the championship , let it roll on ! <p> It was a very exciting match and , in truth , it was very hard to say either side deserved to lose after putting in massive efforts . <p> The game ebbed and flowed and both sides had their noses in front at different times . It was a question of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came and Kilkenny got that vital score . <p> That TJ Reid and Richie Hogan were involved in creating that winning point was rather apt , given the contributions both players made to their side 's cause . <p> Tipperary will be bitterly disappointed . They had their chances to win and held the bigger leads at various stages in the game , having led by six points in the first half and by four points in the second . <p> Reid and Hogan always seemed to get the vital scores when required -- Reid 's two penalties were hugely important -- and these two did more than anyone else to bring Kilkenny to victory . <p> In such a tight game , close calls can be critical and there were a couple of refereeing decisions that were curious . The one where Kilkenny got a free ( pointed by the excellent Reid ) where Cathal Barrett beat Henry Shefflin to the sliotar but was penalised by the referee was particularly baffling . <p> Tight marginsBut , then , Kilkenny can point to a harsh free late-on against Jackie Tyrrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game of tight margins and fractions . <p> The critical mistake came with Darren Gleeson 's decision not to hit that last free up the field towards the Kilkenny goal . <p> He tried to pick out someone and unfortunately for him put it over the sideline . <p> The timing of that mistake was critical for Tipperary and losing the match basically came down to that . Gleeson has plenty of range and , although it was a long way out , he could have got the play down to the other end . <p> Instead , he just went to pick someone out and put it over the line . . . . . and that Kilkenny sideline ultimately led to a situation where Reid and Hogan combined to make him pay the price right at the death . There was no time left for Tipperary to get back . <p> In defeat , Tipperary can still take a lot of positives , both from the last few weeks and of their performance here . <p> Okay , they have to suffer yet another defeat to Kilkenny but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team on the way into the championship as defeat did a year ago . They could have won this game and I am not sure what they could have done differently to win it . <p> There were some outstanding performances in the backs from Brendan Maher and P ? draic Maher in the central positions . <p> Up front Bonner Maher was brilliant , and Noel McGrath and Bubbles O'Dwyer got some great scores . <p> Kilkenny will take a lot from this latest win . It is a fantastic achievement to win three league titles in a row and a tribute to their longevity . <p> P ? draig Walsh hurled superbly at right-half back and Michael Fennelly showed his return to form at midfield Tyrrell and JJ Delaney held the centre pretty well and Hogan and Reid were outstanding up front . <p> You have to hand it to Kilkenny .

I have often Googled on the net for Kilcullen but the results were mostly frustrating . Anyway , what a read I had today ! <p> Originally I was just interested in trying to see anybody I knew , but gradually you pulled me back to the heart of the town , not only with the pictures but also with the stories which for an ex-Kilcullenite are pure magic . The urge to write to you came from your article on The Capers . <p> This phase of my childhood is branded on my brain and soul for the rest of my life and only recently I found myself relating this remarkable chapter of my youth to my own three children here in Germany . <p> My wife usually rolls her eyes or goes to fetch more coffee when I start on this subject . I ca n't blame her really . You have had to live it before you know what it 's about . <p> I lived up in Bishop Rogan Park ( BRP ) which made a pretty good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electrical shop and we were fortunate to have Mrs Martin ( Monica ) as our musical producer . At the time she was a dead ringer for Julie Andrews so she HAD to be musical . There were also practices at her house where she played piano . <p> My parents were involved too , as were my two twin brothers who one year ( as 4- or 5-year olds ) raised a lot of aaahs and the roof doing a version of Rolf Harris 's ' Two Little Boys ' . In cowboy suits with a toy horse . <p> I ca n't remember any hardline animosities between BRP and other town sections but there were indeed heavy rumours of spies stealing stories and peeking in on rehearsals . Most people thought John Brady was a double agent for Brannockstown ! . Looking at the pictures now the stage backdrops were pretty weary but the day of the show was an intense experience . <p> We had our make-up in O'Connells Pub ( The White Horse ) upstairs -- I think . And then we assembled at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performers mingled together at the ' stage door ' . The booming voice of the compere coming through the walls out into the street . <p> There was strict silence back stage . Bangs and shouts were picked up severely by the mics . One thing I find remarkable was that the shows were being run on close circuit TV across to the pubs . I ca n't ever remember watching that but I do remember the cables going over the road on the telegraph poles . The town was alive and the pubs were packed . <p> Most years I was in the BRP backing singers but one year I got a solo chance and done a Neil Young song , probably ' Heart of Gold ' , I ca n't exactly remember . I may have been nervous as I do remember Mrs Martin urging me on . Out under the hot lights with my old Ibanez . Wow . <p> I of course as a youngster spent quite a lot of time in the Hide Out . Coke and Space Invaders . Later on dates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capers pictures . I worked with Kevin in Berneys Saddlery . I know the other face too but I ca n't get the name . The guy with the pipe is definitely Boris Becker ( : - ) . Oops , been in Germany too long . The man in the picture with yourself with the trophy is maybe a Mr Mitchell though I 'm not so sure on that . I do remember that the Hide Out won once or twice ( maybe more ? ) . <p> The Capers made way for another musical adventure with a certain Paddy Melia in which I played a minor part too . It was more organised . Maries Wedding . It travelled to Newbridge and then fizzled out . I have a particular anecdote on that too . But that 's another story is n't it ... ? <p> I was always sad when the Capers were over . It sure united the town and it will remain a vivid memory for me . A photo collection would be interesting .

@@2487236 <h> More from Mag <h> Inside the Institute of Education <h> We interview some students of the famous Dublin grind school the Institute of Education on Leeson Street . <p> Charlotte Ryan Staff Writer <p> It is a sad reality that at one point during the Leaving Certificate the average student will consider repeating . Be it because their own school let them down , lack of personal motivation or a simple decline in self-confidence , as that climatic exam approaches we hear too often the defeated refrains of " I 'm just going to repeat " . I first thought it when my hair started to fall out in fistfuls . Repeating was n't necessary for me but while I set up my contingency plan , the Institute of Education came to resemble a pipe dream to me . The annual fees of ? 6,950 did n't matter to me , nor did the reputed high-pressure environment . I just wanted my dream course in my dream college . However , having come out on the other side in one ( perfectly coiffed ) piece , I now wonder whether my Leaving Cert experience would have been made easier or more difficult in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Education was founded in 1969 by Raymond Kearns , an applied mathematics teacher who had studied in the United States and returned to Ireland armed with teaching methods that were at that time revolutionary in Ireland . His advocacy for private tuition for students led him to provide courses in new maths to both teachers and students , and ultimately brought about the establishment of the Institute on Leeson Street . Four decades later and it is one of the leading secondary schools in Ireland with the highest number of students entering third-level education each year . With their annual student population at approximately 5,000 -- 250 in 5th year and 750 in 6th year and the remainder made up of Transition Year students and grinds pupils -- the Institute caters to those aiming for high points in order to study medicine or veterinary , repeating students or those simply aware of their need for a more motivated environment . <p> " I wanted to go to an environment where everyone was new and there was no existing cliques already in the school " <p> Such was the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study communications who entered the Institute in 5th year in anticipation of the highly stressful two years ahead of her , and the work that would be required . " Me and my parents decided I would do better in the Institute because of the great teachers and focus on the Leaving Cert , " she says . " I knew I would have a better chance of doing well in the Leaving Cert than my old school because it was n't very good . " Leaving a school , friends and support network during such a trying time seems a high price to pay for what is so often condescendingly called a piece of paper , particularly if that move bridges counties . However , for many this factor is an immense positive , levelling the playfield and granting students a blank slate with which to start again . <p> " I never exactly felt like I fit into my old school and could n't relate to the people or the teachers in it , " says Christine Slattery , a 6th year student hoping to study Computer Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone was new and there was no existing cliques already in the school " . This sense of equality is admittedly surprising for what is perceived as an upper middle-class establishment . The students interviewed said that the cosmopolitan and eclectic assortment of people completely eradicates bullying since , as Matthew Phelan says , " everyone went in one day on as equals . " He elaborates that " the Institute is a haven for the bullied , the quirky , the nerds , but it does nothing to shield you from the massive pressure that you need to succeed . " For example , there are currently more students aspiring to study medicine in the Institute than there are available medicine seats in the country . Yet there is no competitiveness apparent in the school , no conniving or sabotaging . This is n't Mean Girls . If anything , the highly pressurised atmosphere fosters an even greater sense of unity and solidarity . <p> Above even its reputation for excellent grades is the Institute 's notoriously strict class regime , yet for those of us outside those Leeson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For most students classes begin at 8.30 and continue constantly until 3.30 , with the majority remaining after class to work in one of two study halls . Despite the rigid structure Slattery maintains that it 's " perfect for a Leaving Cert year as it puts a perfect amount of pressure and motivation on you . " I 'm inclined to agree . One of the most challenging aspects of the Leaving Cert is the risk of procrastination . Of course there are the infamous Institute notes , hand-outs that are revised to exam-perfect precision by the teachers and forbidden to be reproduced . One student who would prefer to remain anonymous I spoke to recounted how geography essays were revised for via these hand-outs , complete with specific bullet-points to be made to ensure an A1 . English essays that received A1s were taken to be locked in a vault in the library , accessible only with permission from the office . I had asked some students about whether or not English teachers were advising them to study only two poets out of the listed eight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all interviewees stated these were predictions rather than insider tips . <p> This strident revision system is complimented by teachers who are rarely absent and , as Farrell notes , a policy that " if you did n't want to work , it was your problem " . <p> This strident revision system is complimented by teachers who are rarely absent and , as Farrell notes , a policy that " if you did n't want to work , it was your problem " . However , in contrast is the much more flexible and progressive form of classes and student-pupil relationships . Students wear their own clothes , yet another factor possibly borrowed by Kearns from the United States , and call the teachers by their first names . The most notable difference in the Institute is the flexible timetables in which students choose which subjects they want to study and during which time slots . In this manner , students can dictate when they start and finish their days . This system blurs the lines that exist in other secondary schools and enhances unity among students . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around me were a year or two younger . I know a 16 year old fashionista with a briefcase and a successful fashion blog . When I was 16 I had n't even reached the level cap in World of Warcraft . " <p> That fashionista is Amelia O'Mahony Bradi , a 5th year student and owner of the blog La Femme Eclectique . Despite having one year to go until the exams , Bradi understands the enormous stress placed upon her shoulders and maintains that it 's necessary to " take a step back and remind myself that it 's just one class test or homework essay . " Being in 5th year , Bradi still finds the time to unwind with exercise , friends or blogging yet the same ca n't be said for those in 6th year . " I have heard some stories about sixth-years having breakdowns , crying in class but I feel like if I 'm aware of it I can try to combat it . " <p> when you hear of students buying Adderall from classmates with ADHD in order to better study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what seems borrowed from an American teen show is blurred . <p> Unfortunately breakdowns and crying fits in class are mainstays of many students ' experiences with the Leaving Cert . Most of us have crumbled at some point amid the pressures , expectations and personal disappointment when we do n't meet those expectations . Usually a good vent to your friends or a comforting hug from a family member would ease the panic , maybe a night of slightly more excessive drinking than usual with your friends if it was particularly bad . We accept that sometimes desperate times call for desperate measures , however when you hear of students buying Adderall from classmates with ADHD in order to better study for exams , the line between what is real and what seems borrowed from an American teen show is blurred . Perhaps this is n't specific to the Institute but it should serve as a reminder that such measures are in no way justified when attributed to the pressures of an exam . <p> Exacerbating this is the lack of any other outlet within the school . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cert preparation would have a particular lack of emphasis on extra-curricular activities however , it 's an accepted fact that during such a trying year an outlet would be necessary . As Phelan states " other schools have extra-curricular activities and charity work and other ways students can distinguish themselves " . Perhaps if the Institute established something like this , the pressure would be alleviated . <p> So why study there ? Why put yourself under extreme pressure , heightened expectations and personal and emotional turmoil for an exam you could easily prep for in another school ? Is it just the reputation or is there something more ? I believe it 's as simple as knowing that you 're all in the same boat together . As Phelan states , " The Institute is focused on exams , it lays the system bare . It does n't try to baby you and everyone is united by their motivation to succeed academically . "

But why it should have caused more controversy than say the prolonged torture and castration of one of the characters last season is a bit beyond me . <p> The fact is that ' Game of Thrones ' is incredibly brutal .

We also know that the good characters will rarely be killed off . <p> In ' Lord of the Rings ' , Aragorn is the figure of the perfect knight , like you find in the Arthurian legends . We want him to prevail and we know he will prevail in the end . <p> Likewise in ' Star Wars ' , we know Luke Skywalker will prevail in the end with the help of the more worldly Hans Solo . <p> But both ' Lord of the Rings ' and ' Star Wars ' are mythological stories and do n't pretend to be anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good and evil and this is why they resonate very deeply with us and it 's why stories like this have been told in every major culture right through known history . <p> We like stories with hero/saviour characters and we would n't keep telling ourselves these stories unless they connected with us in a very basic way and arose from human nature itself . <p> We also like stories such as ' Lord of the Rings ' and ' Star Wars ' because we like morally satisfying stories and morally ambiguous stories simply chime with us as much . This is why ' Game of Thrones ' will never be as well loved . <p> So if the next ' Star Wars ' trilogy does its job right and if it 's well made , it will be an antidote to ' Game of Thrones ' . The story will be morally satisfying and the character played by Domnhall Gleeson will hopefully be unambiguously good and have us rooting for him right to the end . @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@2503231 <h> Major questions over Clare minor football disaster <p> THE Clare minor footballers in 2014 . Where do you start ? Maybe by giving the players some credit with the way they died with their boots on last Tuesday and heroically tried to clutch victory from the jaws of a defeat that was staring them in the face after just 13 seconds when Waterford swooped for the first of their six goals . Well done lads , there was honour in defeat . Thing is , Clare minor football was an unmitigated disaster waiting to happen in 2014 and it came to pass on Tuesday night last in Dungarvan with the crushing defeat -- anytime you concede six goals in a championship game is a crushing experience . And it was a disaster waiting to happen from last July , because of the way the whole process of appointing the management for 2014 was carried out under the cloak of secrecy that would have done the Irish Republican Brotherhood justice . In case you 've forgotten , here 's what was in the pages of The Clare People back then : ' Football people should be up in arms because of the way the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( July 9 , 2013 ) . ' By dint of stealth , it had all the hallmarks of a cunning plan to railroad the ratification of the county minor football management for 2014 and beyond . Railroad the ratification at the expense of openness and transparency -- these two things were the big losers in the whole exercise . ' All because , by any stretch of any football imagination out there in Clare , it was wrong and flawed . You could go so far as to say that it was did football no justice at all in the rush at Clare County Board level to anoint Aidan O'Keeffe , Joe Considine and Tony Byrne as the county minor management team for 2014 , 2015 and 2016 . And that 's saying nothing about the coaching and management qualities of the above mentioned . ' It was all to do with the manner of the appointment : ' The Clare People has learned that last Monday night at 10.42pm an email went out to every club in the county summoning them to a special meeting of the Clare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ch ? os ? g , Clareabbey on Tuesday night at 9pm . The email notification , as seen by The Clare People , said the following : ' I wish to advise that a special board meeting has been called for tomorrow evening , July 9 , at GAA headquarters , Clareabbey , Clarecastle at 9pm to deal with borrowing authorisation for Clare GAA ' . That was the agenda for the meeting -- a county board financial matter , with the county minor football management or any other management not down on the agenda . Yet , it was clearly part of the agenda -- in this case the unwritten agenda and one to be sprung on delegates , by stealth and with no warning in the hope that it would be done with , dusted with and rubberstamped with the minimum of fuss . It 's not a way to do business . Clare football deserves better than this -- the appointment of any management team at any grade and in any code deserves much better than to be subject to such blatant subterfuge . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad reflection and a sad indictment that we think so little of the game . And , that 's saying nothing about the fact that the appointment of any management should be put before a full meeting of the Clare County Board , something that the gathering in Clareabbey on Tuesday night last was most definitely not . ' The article concluded by quoting from a Clare Journal report on the state of Clare football in the early 1900s : ' Why do you not rise , one of you , or some of you and switch the search light on the rottenness that is eating the heart out of the game ? If you are sincere men , looking on the national games from a national standpoint , you will get at the root of the evil by allowing your judgment at board meeting to follow the moral laid down by Davis in his immortal couplet , that it requires " righteous men to make our land , a nation once again " .

Suffice to say that serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Clare County Board , when there HAS to be a debate on the state of underage football in the county as a matter or urgency . Why such a small panel of players ? Is it to do with lack of funding or a lack of training facilities ? Why was there only one selector , as Joe Considine , although ratified by the board at that infamous meeting last July was never with the team and had flagged this fact in advance of any real team preparations beginning ? Why was there only one challenge game played between the end of the Leinster League and the first round against Kerry ? The folly of this was exposed by the fact that there were then 11 positional changes between the Kerry game and the Limerick game a week later . What it because of lack of funding ( remember when they played that one challenge up in Mullingar , they were gone for the day and only got a cup of tea , a sandwich and a banana to keep them nourished ) ? Why no dual players ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Is there a secret policy that dual players are not being encouraged at underage level in the county ? After all , the Waterford team that beat Clare last Tuesday had seven dual players . And what about the slew of players many football aficionados around the county consider to be good enough to be part of a Clare minor panel in 2014 ? Killian Brennan from Clondegad , Dara Walsh and Conor O'Halloran from ? ire ? g , ? is ? n Hanrahan and Seamus Collins from Lissycasey , Colm Rice from Corofin , Sean Malone and Colin Hehir from St Joseph 's Miltown , Darragh Leahy and Brian Monaghan from Wolfe Tones , while Ennistymon who have been the strongest underage club in Clare in recent years surely had a few . There are probably more . And the questions do n't end there . Who is going to be charged with reviewing the minor football year activities and what will the terms of reference of that review be ? With the minor championship over , will the under 17 footballers in the county now be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provincial championship ? Are the management teams for the development squads at under 14 and 16 level ? If they have been selected , by whom ? Questions . Questions . Questions .

@@2503234 @ @ O'Sullivan &amp; Biarritz : A Match Made in Heaven or Hell ? <p> The news that Eddie O'Sullivan has taken over as head coach of Biarritz was met with shock in Irish rugby circles . Less than 24 hours before the announcement , O'Sullivan seemed set to finally return to the Irish scene as a backs coach at Munster , but ultimately the offer of the top gig at one of France 's most famous clubs proved too good to turn down for the Cork man . <p> On first viewing , Eddie O'Sullivan and Biarritz have a lot in common , and the move offers both a chance to rebuild a shattered reputation . While O'Sullivan was enjoying his career peak , winning three Triple Crowns with Ireland between 2004 and 2007 , Biarritz were strutting their stuff on the European stage , making the knock-out stages of the Heineken cup four times in a row and winning the French title in 2002 , 2005 and 2006 . Since 2007 , however , both parties have seen their fortunes take a severe turn for the worse . <p> O'Sullivan presided over Ireland 's disastrous 2007 World Cup campaign and was relieved of his duties after a calamitous Six Nations in 2008 , before seeing his reputation take another hammering as Declan Kidney and Brian O'Driscoll lead the team to a Grand Slam to kickstart the post-Eddie era . <p> Biarritz 's peak as a team occurred a year earlier than O'Sullivan 's last triple crown , as they hammered Toulouse 40-13 in the 2006 Top 14 final and were only denied a double by Munster 's famous first European title a week later . They regressed but remained competitive in the years since , finally getting their hands on a first European title with the Amlin Cup in 2012 . This season , however , proved one too far for players such as Dimitri Yachvili , Imanol Harinordoquy and Damien Traille , as a disastrous year saw them finish bottom of the league by a stunning 21 points . <p> As a rugby coach , O'Sullivan certainly has the tools to make this new gig work . His time as Irish manager attracts large amounts of negative analysis , much of it unfairly . At 64% he has easily the best winning percentage of any Irish manager , Joe Schmidt 's fledgling tenure notwithstanding . Moreover , even his most vocal critics will admit that he suffered cruel luck when it came to racking up silverware , missing out on a Six Nations title on points difference in 2005 , and losing out on a 2007 Grand Slam thanks to a Brian O'Driscoll injury and some woeful Geordan Murphy defending against France in Croke Park in 2007 . It seems likely that had he availed of the type of superhuman effort O'Driscoll produced in 2009 , it would have been O'Sullivan who bridged the gap between Irish Grand Slams . <p> That 2007 season gives a good insight into O ' Sullivan the coach , as his team excelled in his specialty area , with some spectacular back play executed to perfection by adventurous and gifted players in the vein of Murphy and O'Driscoll . Lack of consistency up front and a dodgy set piece cost them however , and delegation of this part of the game to a top quality forwards coach at Biarritz will be key to O'Sullivan 's new venture . <p> The team O'Sullivan will take charge of however , is one in disarray . As mentioned above , players like Yachvili , Harinordoquy , Traille , Julien Peyrelongue and Erik Lund , once stars , have been allowed to grow old together and have finally been found out this season . The lack of adequate replacements has led to the horror 2013-2014 season which will see them pitch up in the super-competitive Pro D2 next season . 68 tries and 656 points conceded in 26 games works out at an astonishing average of 25 points and almost 3 tries per game with a 39-0 defeat to Castres and a 53-20 hammering at the hands of Bordeaux in their last game the low points of the season . <p> The one bright spark in a dark season came four weeks ago when they managed to beat Brive in their final home game of the season to give the retiring Yachvili a fitting send off . Serious rebuilding is needed , and their big name signing so far this summer is none other than Scotland 's Nick De Luca , hardly a man to inspire confidence . <p> Pro D2 itself is a nasty , difficult league which can suck a team down to its own level , and escaping back to the top table quickly will be O'Sullivan 's minimum aim . Teams such as Mont-De-Marsan , relegated last year and now wallowing in 7th place , show how difficult it can be to acclimatize to the lower level , while the culture of rich owners has spread to this division as well , with teams like La Rochelle making big financial waves . <p> Key to Biarritz 's season will persuading some of the bigger names to stick around and slug it out in the lower division , with retirement an infinitely more attractive prospect to the likes of Harinordoquy . A clearout of the dead wood is certainly needed , and Eddie could do his old employers in the IRFU a favour by looking at some provincial fringe players and giving them a run at first team rugby in France . <p> Neither party really has anything to lose in this link up , as both have reached a low ebb . An Irish coach will bring a fresh approach to a stale team and France will represent a fresh challenge for Eddie . His treatment at the hands of the IRFU since he returned from his second spell in the USA has been harsh , and the decision to not interview him for the open position of Connacht head coach seemed a needless public humiliation . <p> No matter how his time with the national team ended , it should never have come to the point where such a fine , native rugby mind was lost to this country . What better way to prove the haters wrong than turning Biarritz around ? No doubt it is a mammoth task , but things can not get any worse for either Eddie or Biarritz and the appointment could turn out to be an inspired one . ? <h> About Gary Walsh <p> Gary Walsh is a recent graduate in Arts from NUIG and is currently studying an MA in Literature and Media .

" <p> But it 's also about taking responsibility for your own career choices . <p> Central to Sheryl Sandberg 's recent rallying cry for women to heighten their <p> engagement in the workforce was the message of " leaning-in " and taking a " seat at the table " . It 's something that is echoed in the experiences of the senior women of the Top1000 . <p> " You have to own your own career , to put yourself in the frame , " advises Lennon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're available and that you have the skills to succeed . " <p> She says that when presented with a job opportunity , most women -- even when they might be the best candidate -- can think of eight reasons why they should n't apply . " But women need to take some ownership and push themselves forward , " she says . <p> Before Marie Joyce took on her role as chief financial officer ( CFO ) with publicly listed renewable investment group NTR , she took some time to consider it . Historically , her role had involved quite a lot of travel , and with a child , she had to think carefully about taking it on . " I was initially apprehensive about the role . I could easily have thought , I ca n't be away for long periods of time , but I gave the job a go and it was fine , " she says . And now she has the support of her colleagues to opt for shorter trips . <p> Taking time out to have a family is also a challenge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand how they will feel once they begin -- or <p> increase -- their family , planning can help the time away from work to go more smoothly . " If you want to stay in business , you have to plan around having a <p> family and keep your career progression on track , " says Joyce , adding , " if you plan well for your absence , you can maintain a level of trust . " <p> This turned out to be the case for Sonia Flynn , head of Facebook 's Irish operations . She had her first child last year , and returned to work in October . She took eight months maternity leave , keeping in touch intermittently , not realising at the time , that as head of Facebook in Ireland , people were watching her example . She says that on her return other women in the organisation found her approach " very refreshing " . <p> " It set up a positive message that you can have your family and then come back to work . My husband gave me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've spent all this time talking about how good your team is . Now give them a chance to show you how good they are ' . " <p> But perhaps there is also a message about having realistic expectations . Flynn is now firmly back to grips with her role , but she concedes that there was a period of adjustment . " My confidence was a bit low when I came back . We do n't talk about it enough but it takes time to get back up to speed . It is normal to miss your child and it is normal to feel highly emotional -- but it does come good in the end . " <p> For women hoping to return to work on a part-time basis , they should be aware that this might impact on their career opportunities . " It comes down to choices . Think about your choices and think about what you want , " says Lennon , adding , " There would be no point in me saying I could do my role part-time when I could n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sandberg 's Lean In treatise might be that to allow women to lean in more , and engage further in their careers , men , as partners of such women , need to " lean out " a little more , and take on more responsibility at home .

@@2599239 <h> A Beginners Guide to the UFC in Dublin <p> The Ultimate Fighting Championship ( UFC ) returns to Dublin on July 19 for the first time in 5 years . There are probably quite a few sports fans who are n't entirely sure what happens at a UFC event . So here 's a quick rundown on what all the fuss is about . <p> Mixed Martial Arts ( MMA ) is the name of the sport that fighters contracted to the UFC participate in . Some other names such as Ultimate Fighting or Cage Fighting have been used ( mostly by critics ) but the actual name is of the sport is MMA . <p> There are many active MMA promotions in Ireland such as Clan Wars and BattleZone Fighting Championship . Europe 's largest MMA promotion , Cage Warriors is run by Corkman Graham Boylan , which has a number of Irish fighters on its roster . <p> Maybe it 's because the UFC is the largest MMA organisation in the world or maybe because the name Mixed Martial Arts was n't applied to the sport until the late 1990 's ( after the UFC was created ) but for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and MMA . But , to be clear , on the 19th of July you 'll be watching a Mixed Martial Arts event run by the Ultimate Fighting Championship . <p> Who are the UFC ? <p> The rise in popularity of MMA from vilified freak show to the fast growing sport in the world has everything to do with the rise in popularity of the UFC . Since bordering on extinction back in 2005 , the UFC has undergone an incredible transformation to become a global phenomenon . <p> Today , the UFC is the largest MMA organisation in the world by a considerable margin . Every aspiring fighter competing on a local MMA promotion ( like BattleZone FC ) hopes to get spotted by a bigger organisation ( like Cage Warriors ) with the view to getting noticed and signed up to the UFC . <p> The UFC produces more than 40 live events annually that consistently sell out regardless of the city or venue . UFC TV programming is broadcast in over 145 countries ( including Ireland ) to almost 1 billion TV households worldwide in 28 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of playing in football 's Champions League or rugby 's Heineken Cup . <p> The UFC has approximately 500 fighters signed to its organisation across 9 weight divisions , male and female . The UFC bouts occur inside the Octagon . The Octagon is surrounded by a metal chain-link fence approximately 6ft high . Though the caged area may appear a little crude it 's the safest method of keeping the fighters in the Octagon . The floor of the Octagon is a matted area with a diameter of 32 ft . <p> The sport of Mixed Martial Arts ( MMA ) has a number of different sources , some dating as far back to as the ancient Olympics . The sport of Pankration , a blend of wrestling and boxing , was in the ancient Olympics but banned when the modern Olympics Games began in 1896 . Undeterred by the Olympic snub a number of organisations sprang up during the 20th century that offered those brave enough an arena to try hand-to-hand combat in an attempt to find out who has the most effective martial art . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jitsu ( BJJ ) fighters from the famed Gracie family challenged anyone from a competing martial art to a Vale Tudo ( Portuguese for ' anything goes ' ) match . These fights were often broadcast on TV and always in front of a packed arena . In Japan , the Shooto organisation is believed to have been the first modern MMA organisation founded in 1983 . <p> The UFC was founded in 1993 by the Gracie family , mentioned above . Having struggled to build their BJJ school membership numbers in US , their idea was to use the UFC event is a one-off infomercial to advertise Brazilian Jiu Jitsu . Royce Gracie was selected to represent the Gracie family art of BJJ against experts from other martial arts such as boxing , wrestling , kick boxing , karate and sumo . Royce submitted each of his opponents using techniques they were n't too familiar with . The power of BJJ was unleashed on the world and the UFC was born . <p> So what is MMA really ? <p> MMA is exactly as the name suggests , its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system . In the early UFC years fighters that were really skilled in one martial art enjoyed periods of dominance . For example , Royce Gracie won 3 of the first 4 UFC tournaments using BJJ techniques that wrestlers or kick boxers were unfamiliar with and did n't know how to defend . <p> But as the sport evolved , fighters started to cross train in multiple disciplines . The old practise of relying on one martial art was a set up for failure and probably some pain . For most MMA fighters today the required minimum would be to have a good working knowledge of wrestling ( grappling ) , boxing ( striking with hands ) , Brazilian Jiu Jitsu ( submission holds via joint locks and chokes ) and muay Thai ( striking with hands and feet ) in order to be competitive . <p> How do you win in MMA ? <p> There are quite a number of ways for the fight to finish . Ultimately , both fighters are looking to finish their opponent . This can be done by knockout or by submission . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold or joint lock ( hyper-extension of the knee , elbow , shoulder , ankle etc. ) will ' tap out ' , which is repeatedly tapping his hand on either his opponent or the mat to indicate he submits . It is also possible to verbally submit by telling the referee . <p> Also , the referee may stop the fight if one or other opponent is not intelligently defending himself . There are no standing 8 counts like boxing , so if one fighter is exerting clear dominance to the point where safety becomes an issue , the referee may deem the contest over and intervene . <p> If neither fighter is submitted or KO 'd , 3 judges render a decision using a system similar to boxing - 10 points to the winner of each round , 9 to the loser . <p> Is MMA safe ? <p> It would have been easier to gloss over this question , but it needs to be addressed . Critics of the sport like to peddle the myth that MMA is a barbaric , dangerous sport where fighters are often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious injury or death in sport is tragic . Rather than printing a league table of sports with serious injuries to see which has a better or worse track record than MMA , I 'll offer the Fermi Paradox . <p> The Nobel Prize winning physicist , Enrico Fermi was having lunch at Los Alamos National Laboratory in 1950 with a number of colleagues . Through the course of their lunchtime discussion they agreed the probability of extra-terrestrial life was quite high . As his colleagues offered their probability estimates , Fermi then asked the question , ' So , where is everybody ? ' The greatest minds of the day had convinced themselves that aliens were out there , yet nobody had seen any . <p> There are MMA events every weekend , all around the world . If the sport was indeed as dangerous as the critics would suggest , surely there should be a body count to reflect it .

The return of the UFC to Dublin in July resulted in the fastest selling event anywhere . <p> Unless you 've been hiding under a rock , you 'll no doubt have heard Conor McGregor has taken the UFC by storm since he debuted last year . Conor often said in interviews he would drag the UFC back to Ireland . <p> At the same time , the UFC pinpointed 6 cities in Europe they figured were ideal target markets for the sport of MMA and the UFC brand . Dublin made the cut for 2014 . The success of July 19th will dictate how long we have to wait till the UFC return again .

@@2602239 <h> Gunslinger Contador has redemption in his Tour sights <h> Alberto Contador is preparing to outgun his old nemesis <h> William Fotherington <p> Tuning in to the final stage of this year 's Criterium du Dauphine , the key warm-up event for the Tour de France , you could easily have been deceived as to who was the Tour favourite and who was the outsider . While the yellow-jerseyed Alberto Contador played a full-throttle role in the final showdown against the eventual winner , Andrew Talansky , ending up 27 seconds behind overall , Chris Froome languished well to the rear , dropping from second to 12th . <p> Taking into account the fact that Froome was below par on the final weekend of the Dauphine due to a crash , the 2013 winner will be most followers ' favourite when the Tour starts in Leeds on Saturday , but the Dauphine result is a reminder that Contador is his most doughty challenger . <p> The Spaniard is on a run of fine form . He is the most experienced Grand Tour contender at the moment , and - as the Dauphine showed - has an unmatched nose for an opening . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . <p> Tactically , Contador was on the back foot , well behind an early escape that included Talansky . His team - a far weaker squad than the one he will lead at the Tour - was not up to the mark and he had no option but to attempt a late , lone chase . He failed , but by a tiny margin , underlining that he has no fear when it comes to adopting unconventional tactics that are light years from the controlled way that Froome and Team Sky like to race . <p> This season , Contador has not finished lower than second in any of the five stage races he has contested - he was runner-up in the Tour of Algarve and Catalonia and the Dauphine , and dominated the Tour of the Basque Country , and Tirreno-Adriatico . <p> Froome , meanwhile , has enjoyed a less consistent build-up , winning the Tour of Oman in February , missing Tirreno due to back problems , skipping Liege-Bastogne-Liege with a chest infection , winning the Tour of Romandie , then suffering at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two stages - after his crash . <p> The signs are that the 2014 Tour could be much closer than that of 2013 , when Contador looked like a shadow of the rider who had taken the Vuelta a Espana the previous autumn . Up against Froome he was powerless , but there were mitigating factors for that lack of oomph . <p> Those close to Contador believe he spent too much of the winter of 2012- ' 13 on the road , and that he raced too often in the spring when he tends to suffer in the poor weather . Another obvious factor was that the Spaniard had endured a lengthy legal battle - from September 2010 to February 2012 - as he contested a positive test for the banned steroid clenbuterol , found in a minuscule quantity in his urine during the 2010 Tour . <p> Contador always claimed the substance was present due to eating contaminated meat ; the Court of Arbitration in Sport invoked the rule of strict liability and ruled against him , imposing a retrospective ban and stripping him of his 2010 Tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abeyance , he rode the 2011 Tour , but was greeted with boos when he turned up at the team presentation before the start . He fought his side , lost , had a brief ban , returned to racing and won the 2012 Vuelta , then could hardly be blamed if he flopped mentally . <p> Contador has always seemed one of the less flamboyant members of the peloton , and he has become more closed in on himself since the clenbuterol episode . Like the great Miguel Indurain , he speaks in platitudes , but those close to him point to his passion for his sport . " He 's neither a communicator nor a calculating character , " says one insider . " He looks into things , he snoops around , he examines this bit of kit and that bit , ponders technical developments . He pays attention to every detail . " They also cite his creation of his own under 23 team in his home region near Madrid . <p> Ask El Pistolero ( the Gunslinger ) - through his helpful press officer - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " All I can say is that I hope to be a little better than last year and will try to fight for victory . " And the route of this year 's Tour ? " The parcours is what it is and you have to deal with it . Perhaps the only thing I would change is that the time trial could be a little tougher . As far as the English stages go , I have n't looked over them , but I have been told about them by the team . " As revelations go , ' Big Mig ' Indurain would be proud . <p> One key to Contador 's improvement is a simple house move : from his home in the town of Pinto , near Madrid , he has shifted 1,000 miles away to Lugano , in the Italian-speaking part of Switzerland .

" Moving has done him good - he 's got a more regulated lifestyle , built around rest and training . " <p> Another factor has been a new trainer : the Dutchman Steven de Jongh , recruited by Saxo boss Bjarne Riis at the end of 2012 when he was made to leave Team Sky - where he had been directeur sportif - after the team 's re-examination of personnel in the light of the Lance Armstrong scandal that led to De Jongh confessing to doping in his time as a racer . <p> ' These are the classic stages where you can not win the Tour , but you can lose it ' <p> De Jongh and another ex-Sky recruit , the Australian Mick Rogers , have clearly brought some of the British squad 's methodology to Saxo . Contador has cut his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he has begun altitude training camps similar to the ones that were the most radical element in Sky 's Tour preparation . Contador had never been an advocate of training at altitude but in January he moved in to Sky 's - and before them Armstrong 's - favoured venue : the Parador Hotel at Mount Teide in Tenerife . <p> " Steven came with the knowledge he had acquired at Sky and gradually adapted it to Alberto 's needs , " Mauduit said earlier this year . Before the Dauphine , both Froome and Contador , as well as the third favourite for the Tour , Vincenzo Nibali of Italy , were in residence at Mount Teide , while in the final run-in to the Tour this month , the Spaniard spent a further 10 days at altitude in the Italian ski resort of Livigno . <p> Ask about beating Sky as a team , and Contador prefers to divert the question to his own squad , who looked cohesive in the 2013 race , if not as well-drilled as Froome 's sidekicks .

In 2013 , Contador was lacking a domestique with the climbing ability of Sky 's Richie Porte and Peter Kennaugh , although on the flat , he and his men put Sky on the rack on the flat stage to Saint-Amand-Montrond . <p> This year , on the other hand , at least two Saxo riders look to be stronger than in 2013 : Rogers has won a brace of stages at the Giro while Nicolas Roche took the Route du Sud last week . Sky have been beset by niggles : the questioning about whether Wiggins should ride , the controversy over Froome winning Romandie while having a Therapeutic Use Exemption for a corticosteroid , prescribed to counter breathing troubles after a chest infection , and health issues for key riders such as Ian Stannard - who will not start due to a fractured vertebra - Peter Kennaugh , Porte , and another absentee , Edvald Boasson Hagen . <p> Contador will be favoured to outmanoeuvre Froome on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that feature in the Paris-Roubaix Classic .

" Behind the platitude , there 's a certain amount of truth : Dave Brailsford , for one , believes this will be a difficult Tour de France to keep a grip of . And as the Dauphine showed , let that grip slip one iota , and Contador will pounce .

The parallels run deep : both bands showed early promise with high energy , palate-cleansing debuts , each providing a snapshot of the grimy taste of London life . In the driving seat for each outfit was a charismatic , cerebral , often-misunderstood hellraiser . <p> This weekend , the two acts take to the stage together in Hyde Park . Yet while the future fortunes of Pete Doherty 's band of merry men are largely unwritten , Shane MacGowan has hinted that this weekend 's live outing may well be the Pogues ' last . <p> " I did n't intend it to go on for this long ( the reunion with the Pogues ) , " he told Uncut magazine . " Anyway , this is the last gig . " As is often the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear . Word has it that he is about to record an album with The Cronins ; Mick Jones will reportedly produce , while Shane 's pal Johnny Depp will guest . <p> Others have reported that MacGowan is full of vim and vigour ; drinking tea in the studio , kicking his writer 's ' block into touch and even joining a gym . If MacGowan likes to keep fans guessing , he 's certainly going about it the right way : among his latest musical output is a song for the Disney movie How To Train Your Dragon 2 . <p> And yet , glimmers of the MacGowan of old remain . Of the article that ran in this month 's Uncut , its editor John Mulvey recalls : " The journalist was instructed to meet Shane at a pub in North London that effectively operates as his UK office . We expected to hear from the journalist first thing in the morning , and we finally did at around 11.30 or 12 the following morning . It was n't your typical interview . " <p> ' It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of rock'n'roll 's biggest tenets , though it 's probably safe to say that MacGowan and his Celt-punk compatriots have done a little of both . " Some people just get enticed by that , " says John Mulvey . " ( Fans ) like the ongoing tension that something might happen . They want to be able to see a band like the Pogues , but they also love the possibility that it could all end at any moment . " <p> Certainly , the ongoing musical and personal tensions between the band have also fed into everything they 've done . " In conventional terms , there were far too many of them , " notes Hot Press editor Niall Stokes . " The headaches associated with having seven independent , strong-minded and sometimes cantankerous people in a band would be too much for most managers to even begin to contemplate . And yet they made the model work . " <p> Whatever their musical contribution -- and it is rich and significant -- The Pogues were a band addled with infamy and urban legend from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on The Pogues ' journey to print in his 2012 book Here Comes Everybody . <p> A strong stomach is needed for Fearnley 's visceral descriptions of gastric outbursts and puke-a-thons . Not surprisingly , he sums up the entire decade-long fandango in one fell swoop , likening life on The Pogues ' tour bus to being on the submarine in Das Boot . <p> That MacGowan is a lover of excess surprises nobody . In one interview , he famously said , " I was actually four when I started drinking . I just remember that Ribena turned into stout and I developed an immediate love for it . " <p> And as The Pogues grew in prominence , the band went along for Shane 's ride ; assuming by turns the role of collaborators and babysitters . What kept the rest of the band on board were those occasional flashes of genius . <p> Yet now , McGowan teeters on a gossamer-fine line between credibility and self-parody . He 's in the curious badlands between anarchic outsider and drunk uncle at a wedding . <p> He has proclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jedward are the best thing to come out of Ireland in ages " , yet , on the flipside , he counts Nick Cave among his close peers . So will the real Shane MacGowan please stand up ? <p> Paul Trainer , formerly of The Dubliner and a good friend of MacGowan 's , says that the man himself is keenly aware of his public persona . " He does n't really care what people think of him , " he adds . " Most of the time I 've spent with him , we 've discussed politics , history and obscure 1930s films . He plays up to the character in public , but you 're more likely to find him going to a French restaurant with his partner or watching a Love/Hate DVD box-set . " <p> Adds Mulvey : " Shane is fairly complicit in the mythologising ; in fact , it 's been assiduously cultivated . Underneath it all , he 's an extremely erudite man . There 's this amazing talent there . What The Pogues did for Irish folk music is extraordinary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened a door to trad music and a whole new culture of storytelling that I still love today . " <p> For all the bluster about this weekend 's final show , the smart money says MacGowan and The Pogues may well find the siren call of the festival circuit -- and those all-important Christmas shows -- irresistible in years to come . " They still have a lot to give onstage , " says Trainer . " The festival circuit is some of the best live work that they 've done in the last few years , and it 's very much a different crowd to the Christmas tours one . They appeal to two very different audiences . " <p> Adds Stokes : " It helped enormously that you could jump around to their music and behave like a complete lunatic . They gave fans the opportunity to experience a sense of abandonment , so that their live gigs became cathartic events in which people could exorcise their own demons . And of course there was enormous sadness and emotional depth in there too . " <p> Ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capacity for self-immolation -- is at once their greatest strength and biggest weakness . There 's no doubting MacGowan 's muscle as a songwriter , but can that niggling sense of unachieved greatness ever be put to bed once and for all ? <p> " It would have been a huge boost to the band if Shane could have addressed those issues head-on and got on top of them , years ago , " says Stokes . " But there is no point in trying to unpick history . You can only look forward and hope that Shane can find the songwriting flow again that inspired his greatest work . " <p> ' Shane has weathered many storms , but he does n't feel as though he 's missed any musical opportunities , " adds Trainer . " He 's done all he wants to do and continues to do so . It 's a shame that the tabloid caricature from years ago overshadows the musicianship . " <p> " There 's a real danger with Shane that the reputation can eclipse some amazing music , " says Mulvey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the erosion of talent . What 's critical to The Pogues ' legacy is that the myth of Shane as a great writer is sustained , not as a great rock ' n ' roll character . This story would be a lot more problematic if The Pogues ' did n't have the weight of great songs behind them . " <h> A sense of Shane : MacGowan 's wildest moments <p> 1 In 1976 , the same year Shane formed his first band , The Nips , he was up front at a Clash gig when a girl reportedly cut his head with a broken bottle . The picture of him covered in blood made the newspapers , along with a report that he 'd had his ear bitten off . <p> 2 During the recording of If I Should Fall From Grace With God in 1989 , Shane 's behaviour affected recording so much that the band 's studio time ran over by a month , at a cost of ? 1,000 a day . <p> 3 According to his partner Victoria Mary Clarke 's book , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue while on tour in New Zealand after Maori ghosts had suggested that he redecorate his hotel room . <p> 4 In another body-painting-related episode , Shane painted himself black on a huge magic mushroom/poit ? n binge before throwing himself from a moving vehicle , ending up in hospital in the process . <p> 5 During an ill-fated tour in the Far East in 1991 , Shane was apparently sacked from the band in a Japanese hotel room ( they cited " chronic unconsciousness " , by all accounts ) . On the same trip , he also fractured his skull after falling backwards from a bullet train .

Twice as many parents clucked proudly around their ? progeny . A scene to lift the heart . <p> As a bonus , I learned a little more about life than I would from interrogating the internet about the dull doings of Dail Eireann . Talking to parents , I realised that Irish people do appreciate public service when it comes in the form of figures like Donal Og , who looks after players both on and off the field . <p> Cusack is also a superb columnist , so I added my own words of admiration for his compassionate column on Luis Suarez in the Irish Examiner . Like all great journalism , it prompted me to change my mind .

The first and only time I ever met him was briefly before I joined this paper . As I was part of a long line to be greeted , he said only three words . But two of them mattered to me more than I can say : " Ah , Souper Sullivan .

Then a double tap , the band is off at full blast and suddenly middle-aged women are up and letting it all hang out , dancing as lightly as they did long ago as young girls . <p> From there , Eddie edged the conversation seamlessly around to the story of the alleged deathbed reconciliation of Ernie O'Malley , as told by a comrade of the IRA leader whom we shall call a pious friend . As O'Malley was famously agnostic and anti-clerical , everybody was afraid to call a priest as he lay dying in Talbot Lodge in Dublin . <p> Finally , in desperation , his deeply religious comrade called on a literary-minded Jesuit to do his best . But after a biting response , the priest was forced to exit the room in a hurry .

In particular , he should have taken on Rabbitte , who was cosying up to Phil Hogan and arguing against Labour going into opposition . <p> But of course Labour had other options . It could have had the best of both worlds by agreeing to support a minority Fine Gael government from the Opposition benches - but on the basis that the burden of the recession would be borne fairly by all sections of the working class .

As he heads for a well-pensioned retirement , Quinn should ask himself a hard question : did he challenge the sick system whereby the suffering workers of Bausch &amp; Lomb are taxed to pay increments to some of the highest-paid public sector employees ? in Europe - who also ? enjoy permanent and pensionable employment ? No , he did not . <p> *** <p> Let me finish , however , by paying tribute to Quinn 's measured view of Israel .

The names McCaig and McCaughey are Gaelic . The dead boys were descendants of Ulster Gaels who had moved the 12 miles east to Scotland from North Antrim .

And noisy <p> Cabin is stripped of both weight and distractions <p> Nostalgia is a dangerous thing , especially when it is inherited rather than actual . There is a sort of tribal , genetically transferred nostalgia amongst car nuts when it comes to Alfa Romeo . How else can one explain the continued survival of a car company whose global sales currently register fewer than 6,000 cars a month ? It is undeniable , though : misty , sepia memories of experiences few of us have actually had dominatethe Alfa legend . Nuvolari , Fangio , Farina , Andretti and Vacarella behind the wheel .

How we loved them all . <p> And how much we have fallen out of love with such a fabulous brand . There were solid reasons for this . Rust and unreliability plagued Alfa in the 1970s and early 1980s . Nowadays , it 's no more or less reliable than any other European brand in real terms , but lacklustre models have seen sales plummet , and so Alfa is in dire need of yet another reinvention , yet another regeneration . <p> Low , dramatic and high-tech The 4C is supposed to be the herald of this , and you can not argue that it does that job spectacularly well . Descending on Kildare 's Mondello Park race track like some bright red carbon-fibre seraphim , it seems to bring at last good tidings of Italian joy . It is low , dramatic and high-tech . No need for nostalgia here -- with its carbon-fibre chassis and mid-mounted four-pot turbo engine , the 4C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as good as description of its drive as you 'll find too . Those hoping for a sophisticated Porsche rival will be stumped by the 4C 's raw , race-ready performance . That 240hp engine ( badged in classic Alfa style as a 1750 ) screams and bellows behind your head and feels as if it 's been bolted directly to your spine . The acceleration comes in great turbocharged huffs and puffs and the TCT paddle-shift gearbox is as good as seamless when you 're cracking on . Best of all is the unassisted steering , full of feel even if its weighting feels odd to palms used to slick sophistication . The 4C is what happens when Alfa truly cuts loose , and boy does it feel great to be around when it does so . <p> It 's also , in many ways , something of a bargain . Yes , ? 69,000 is hardly cheap , but to get a Porsche with equivalent performance you 're looking at ? 85,000 for a Cayman S.

McLaren 650S , anyone ? <p> Alfa resurrection <p> Perhaps of greater import , the arrival of the 4C signals the temporary death and resurrection of Alfa Romeo . The small , front-drive Mito ( Mini rival ) and Giulietta ( Golf rival ) have been updated and will be pushed hard by Alfa to keep its sales ticking over . They are , however , merely the tasters for a much fuller menu of all-new rear-drive and all-wheel-drive models , cars to compete head-on with the likes of the BMW 3 Series and Audi A6 , as well as -- whisper it -- Alfa 's first ever SUVs . The first one , a 3 Series rival called the Giulia , is still a year away , though . <p> Will any of this matter ? Will anyone care ?

I think we have to focus and show the customers that they 're getting better value for money . There 's an improvement in CO2 , bringing down the tax bands for the cars , which will help us .

Alongside the 4C 's more dramatic efforts , there are also some significant improvements to the Giulietta hatchback , which is now far quieter , comfier , more tax-efficient and better equipped than before . Should you consider one ? Would we recommend one ? Tough questions , both . Clearly , residual values are going to need support and buyers will be sceptical for a while . For all the sheer joy of the 4C , the meat-and-potatoes Giulietta has the donkey work to do , and it 's going to be tough going against the likes of the Golf .

@@2626235 ago may have been wise move for the GAA <p> The redevelopment of Croke Park required the acquisition of a considerable amount of adjoining land , but the use of the stadium is still restricted by its location as Garth Brooks has learned this week .

He was also loyal , although not slavishly so , to the tradition and ethos of the GAA . <p> Since Croke Park was so embedded in the GAA 's psyche , I recall thinking that he was having me on when suggesting that moving out might be a good idea . But no , he was putting it on the record . <p> There was an important context to his comments . Croke Park needed to be redeveloped , but to facilitate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was required . That was driving up the price and as negotiations dragged on at a tortuously slow pace , the GAA became frustrated . <p> PROPERTY <p> I do n't know whether Mulvihill was really serious about leaving Croke Park , but his comments certainly concentrated minds . After all , the GAA was more likely to pay top dollar for land they so badly needed to redevelop Croke Park than other property buyers who could shop anywhere . <p> Mulvihill explained that the time had come for facing tough choices . <p> " If we can not acquire it ( the adjoining land ) , then we will have to seriously consider moving elsewhere . Obviously , we all have sentimental ties with Croke Park but we have to modernise it and if that means moving , so be it .

Mind you , what constitutes local is comical in the case of Croke Park , since it appears you qualify even if you live as far away as Castleknock . Surely , if your address is n't within a mile of Croke Park , you should have no say in what goes on there . <p> The difference of opinion between residents was highlighted by the march in Ballybough on Sunday when those in favour of the Brooks concerts came out in force .

@@2665240 <p> I am referring to the life altering statement this week by newly appointed Minister of State at the Department of Justice Aodhan O'Riordain that it is a " priority " of the Government under the revised programme to reform the Direct Provision System for asylum seekers in Ireland . <p> As a former Minister of State with responsibility for Human Rights I have long been critical of the treatment of refugees and asylum seekers by successive Irish governments , including that of which I was a part . In the late nineties , faced with a significant " influx " in the numbers seeking asylum in Ireland the Department of Justice was in crisis defence mode . <p> In 1998 there were lines of people waiting in the cold and rain to access services to which they were entitled under international law . Antipathy was high towards refugees then ; most people taking the view that these were economic migrants and not therefore deserving of reception or , indeed , consideration of their case . <p> I remember calling the response a " shambles " and citing Ireland 's obligations under international law . I got short shrift and little or no support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Staff in my constituency office and Party HQ were inundated with hate mail and abusive telephone calls . Racist tirades and threats rained down on my private office in Iveagh House , some so serious as to require garda investigation . <p> Negative media headlines fuelled racism and intolerance . I took every opportunity to counter this as Minister with Special Responsibility for Human Rights . <p> I was a member of the cabinet subcommittee on Asylum Integration and related matters , formed to coordinate the State 's response across relevant government departments and agencies . The lead Department of Justice was singularly unhelpful , unsympathetic and downright obstructive to any proposals sympathetic to refugees . <p> Gradually , even at a time of unprecedented prosperity , attitudes hardened and policy became more regressive with direct provision being introduced to replace a more flexible rent allowance regime . Even then this move was controversial and was purported to be for a finite period of time . <p> But as the Minister of State confirmed this week , thousands of asylum seekers , many of them children , have languished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine years . <p> The story of this regressive policy since 1996 to date is outlined by UCD law school academic Liam Thornton in a recent article titled ' The Myth of the cherished child in Ireland ' . <p> Direct provision has been consistently challenged by activists , politicians and human rights lawyers by advocacy and in the courts . Criticisms centre on the fact that the system deprives people of their autonomy and dignity for long periods , a state of affairs described as an " assault on human dignity and an assault on the rule of law " . <p> Because there is limited choice of food , movement and shared living space , curfews and a restriction on visitors to the centres , it is claimed the system breaches the right to private and family life in Article 8 of the Convention of Human Rights . <p> That asylum seekers in Ireland are uniquely in an EU state , denied the right to work and must live on a weekly allowance of ? 19.10 per adult and ? 9.60 per child has been widely condemned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , refugee support groups and childcare expert Geoffrey Shannon amongst others have claimed that Ireland is in breach of constitutional and European human rights . <p> It is ironic that at this time of national handwringing and long overdue state redress for " legacy " institutional child abuse , that over a thousand refugee children continue to be warehoused in unconscionable conditions for extended periods . <p> When first introduced , direct provision was presented as a policy intended to provide basic needs for asylum seekers and promote " dispersal " so as to counter the tendency of asylum seekers to cluster in cities thereby placing housing in the private rented sector under pressure . The justification for such a harsh regime was to act as a disincentive or counter the " pull factor " of the previous more flexible provision of rent support . When challenged judicially the State argued that " while the system was " not ideal , the State had to be mindful of other calls on resources . <p> Just like the Magdalene laundries and Mother and Baby homes of the past , the regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of mind " .

For the first fifteen minutes or so of the second half Cobh looked to have more purpose in their play with Kenny in particular making some super runs into the box . The Hoops had dropped back but in an effort to keep the pressure up Cobh left themselves open considerably between midfield and defence and the Hoops were to exploit this to devastating effect .

I had to leave out what Finlay would have really said . <p> The full account , which can now be told , is that Fergus Finlay would have described the former Taoiseach as " irredeemably corrupt " . <p> I had to leave out this damning assessment because , at the time , our legal advice was that Albert could have sued us for publishing it - even though he had provided me with Finlay 's statement in the first place . <p> He had form in this regard : in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guts of ? 200,000 from media organisations in various libel actions . <p> That said , for all the misinterpretation of what his eldest daughter said in her prayer of the faithful , Albert never sued the Sunday Independent . <p> And for the record , in all of my time on the beat , I had never come across any evidence that he was corrupt , irredeemable or otherwise ; but there was plenty of evidence he was a dealer , and an able one at that . <p> A few weeks after the trial I met with him again , this time in the company of the businessman , Edward Haughey , subsequently Lord Ballyedmond , the wealthiest man in Northern Ireland , who died in a helicopter accident recently . <p> Eddie Haughey recounted a fantastic tale to us to the effect that the ' establishment ' in the UK had attempted to conspire that Reynolds would not win his case against the Sunday Times - and even provided the identity of an alleged conspirator . <p> This individual , who Eddie Haughey maintained was well connected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Royal Courts of Justice throughout the trial . <p> It all sounded to me peculiarly unlikely . <p> But there and then , Albert decided to have the alleged conspirator checked out , which is what , in turn , ultimately led to that call 18 years ago to attend his office once more - this time on the promise of a sensational story . <p> When I arrived , I sat in an armchair and waited for Albert to finish up the business of oil . <p> When he did , he strolled across , a smile on his face , a file under his arm and explained the ? 500 would be used by him to pay for a private detective 's report . <p> As it turned out , the detective 's findings were incredibly - and predictably - vague . The conspiracy was a mirage . <p> So why publish all of this now ?

@@2745235 : Pouring ice water on the Irish Rail meltdown <p> No wonder they are in trouble : Patricia Feehily claims that Irish Rail need to upgrade their lines , improve their travel time and make their carriages a bit more comfortable in order to attract new customers <p> GOD Almighty , the country is gone bonkers ! Celebrity status is wallowing in having cold water thrown on it , and those of us who are n't celebrities are being left out in the cold . I 'm not sure where the real heroism lies , if it is n't with the Irish rail workers who -- instead of the soaked celebrities -- have become the butt of our latest outpouring of national opprobrium . <p> On Sunday , for instance , thousands of football fans were outraged at having to change their travel plans because ' selfish ' Irish Rail workers went on strike on the day of the All-Ireland football semi-final decider . They plan to do the same on All-Ireland hurling final day , which is the ultimate treachery . We all know where our priorities lie , but do we have to be so uppity about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larkin would think of people whinging over being " inconvenienced " because of a strike by workers who look set to have their pay packets docked by up to six per cent at a time when the rest of the country is lining up for a pay rise . Many of the whingers are young people who studied CSPE at school , but obviously the course did n't include anything about industrial relations or the rights of workers . Others are Travel Pass holders like me , who are absolutely furious whenever our privileges are threatened . I only have the pass for a short time , and the thoughts of Irish Rail going belly up before I 've even managed to make proper use of it would kill me . <p> Now , of course , there are two sides to every story , but if Irish Rail is facing bankruptcy , I do n't think they can put all the blame on the payroll bill . Some of their services - like the intercity Limerick/Dublin express -- are streamlined and utterly efficient , and presumably making money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and badly supported by the public . I took the early morning train from Birdhill to Ballybrophy a few months ago and I thought I was travelling on a chugging ' iron horse ' across the Wild West . At one stage I was convinced that half a dozen injuns had landed on the roof , the train was going so slowly . <p> There were shades of Percy French 's West Clare Railway too -- but unfortunately there was none of the atmosphere . It took us half the day to get to Ballybrophy , and then we had to wait on the platform in the middle of nowhere , hoping that another train would come along and pick us up before the injuns came back . Thankfully , it did . Along came a sleek , streamlined monster - the last word in luxury - travelling at what looked like the speed of sound . Only we could n't find a seat on it when we boarded and some of us had to stand . <p> No great inconvenience , though , because we were in Dublin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Ballybrophy . <p> Now , what I 'm trying to say is that in this day and age , when we 're all in a big hurry , Irish Rail ca n't expect to make money from a two tier transport service , especially the tier that is far from comfortable and takes so long to get you from A to B. <p> There were only a few passengers on the train , and most of them hopped on in Roscrea . I felt so bad about it that I was going to offer to pay for my ticket to help keep the line open . <p> I was one of the first passengers to use the line when it was first revived amid great expectations , a few years ago . I travelled to work on the train every day from Birdhill -- mainly to avoid all the parking tickets I was accumulating every week in the city . Even then , it was a bit weird . Sometimes it did n't turn up at all , and we 'd be told that the train was held up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Actually one time we were traumatised to hear that a cow had been hit . <p> On another occasion , travelling home in the evening , I found that I was the only passenger on the train . I was mortified passing the level crossing at Lisnagry in case anyone driving on the N7 would spot me . But what caused me most concern was the realisation that cash strapped Irish Rail was spending a fortune getting me home . <p> For all that , this line does have a social function -- not to talk of a political one -- and could be a profitable service if it was a bit more attractive . <p> But calling on people to support it is futile until they upgrade the line , improve the travel time and make the carriages a bit more comfortable . At the moment it 's very far from being the ' Dart of the Mid West ' . <p> In the face of such inconsistencies then , maybe we could suffer the inconvenience and be at least a bit more considerate and respectful towards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livelihoods . And if we really feel like venting our rage , those of us who do n't enjoy any kind of celebrity status and feel a bit left out of the ice bucket phenomenon currently sweeping the land , could throw a few buckets of ice over our own heads and make a donation to help save Irish Rail from meltdown . <p> This website and its associated newspaper are full participating members of the Press Council of Ireland and supports the Office of the Press Ombudsman .

@@2745236 <h> Business woman Shauna 's stunning Doire Dress Designs <p> In 2004 Shauna Shiels found herself with three weeks to make her daughter Codie an Irish dancing costume . <p> Eight years later she now owns Doire Dress Designs , a company employing 14 staff making between ten and 15 dresses every week . <p> Explaining how it all started she said , " We had bought two dresses from a Belfast company but when Codie 's dance teacher saw them she did n't like them - and they always have the final say because you take their advice . <p> " I was at home with my kids as my youngest child John-Paul was only one at the time , so I decided to have a go at making Codie a dress myself . My mum made wedding and bridesmaid dresses so she taught me well . I was also making my own clothes from a very young age . But tackling an Irish dancing costume was very new to me . <p> " I was fortunate enough to have been taught some basics from local dressmaker Edna Simpson the year before but they were the old skirt patterns and I was determined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly . That alone took me five or six hours - but it 's still the template we would use to this day ! " <p> This new way of making a one-off designer dress involved cutting out the bodice and skirt individually , rather than working with pre-ordered template designs . <p> Shauna also used unusual fabrics and it was the close-fitting form and pattern that made Codie stand out . <p> " I had used a striped fabric which would have been very modern at the time , and the skirt sat differently than others because it was made specifically for Codie . At the competition there were lots of other mums and teachers asking me where I had bought the dress - and when they discovered it was me , they were asking me to make theirs too . I still love that wee dress . " <p> And so it started . <p> " Soon I was making dresses from home . It was just one here and there but I always knew I could do it on a larger scale . It was just the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get two sewing machines when Desmonds factory closed but I was working long days , getting up at 5am before the children were up , and working on after they went to bed at night . " <p> To start with Shauna 's business was run from a large shed in their back garden , before they expanded to a room above a shop a few doors up from the family home . <p> Now , after moving three years ago the business is based in an industrial estate with a busy workshop employing 14 people . <p> The space is filled to bursting with coloured material , thousands of Swarovski crystals , five sewing machines working constantly , as well as staff hand sewing and applying details and sparkle to individual dresses . <p> Shauna continues , " Each dress can take up to 30hours each to make and we have two product ranges . The gold range starts at anything between ? 600-900 and our premium Platinum range starts between ? 800-1200 . This next few months will be really busy as the qualifiers for the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and November . <p> " At the start it was so confidence boosting when people bought my dresses , nowadays I 'm so delighted to be able to employ staff and keep the business going . <p> " People have said that we 're now regarded as ' one of the biggest dress designers ' and that still takes me by surprise , I 'm just a wee mummy from Derry ! But we are also probably the only company who was n't a judge or adjudicator for the competitions beforehand . <p> " I just love designing and I 'm always getting inspiration from all over the place . If I see a building or a shape I like somewhere I get my phone out , I take pictures everywhere . " <p> Business for Shauna these days also includes a lot of commissions from abroad . <p> " Around 60% of our work is for the overseas market . America is definitely our biggest market but we do ship out to Australia and New Zealand too . <p> " I would travel to America about three times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm just back from North Carolina and Philadelphia and there are trips planned to Florida and California for later this year . My daughter Tomasina comes to a lot of overseas trips with me , she understands the business and she knows how to measure and advise customers too . They 're very much working trips though , we could be working from 7am to 10pm for five days straight . I try and see some of the places we visit but generally we 're working . " <p> Designing is also going in another direction , as Shauna explains , " We 've recently made a few professional boxing outfits for Paul McCloskey and Eamon O'Kane and I love doing them . They 're really loud and bold , especially for big fights . " <p> Shauna 's daughter Codie is also still competing .

Healey believes that it is the type of hands on experience in the legal profession that makes her the only truly qualified candidate for the position of Attorney General . <p> " I come to this as somebody who has been arguing and wining cases for people , those with disabilities , those people who got taken advantage of by mortgage companies , people who were attacked in hate crimes , people who needed somebody to step in and fight for them in court .

I will do everything that I can to advocate for and support immigration reform .

@@2780234 <p> But above all there is no disrespect shown towards each other . McGuinness is adamant about that . It was a core principle back in 2011 , established in year one of his four-year term . <p> " There is never any bad feeling , " he says . " I have a simple strategy from the first year , that if anybody disrespects anyone else in the group we all do 100 press-ups . That only happened five or six times in that year and it was wiped out . " <p> The principle of respect is based on a simple premise , a simple question that he asks . <p> " How can you disrespect a team-mate and expect that team-mate to fight tooth and nail for you in a Championship match ? " <p> " It 's the tone . You can be snappy with someone to push them . You can clap hands and say ' c'm on ' . That 's fine , " says McGuinness . <p> " But talk down to someone , or go over the top - that 's disrespect . There is a boundary . If that line is broken , we all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of it all we all say : ' We do n't disrespect ' . <p> " That simple strategy has created an environment where we never have a situation that someone driving home thinking angrily of a colleague .

There are so many blackguards , but there is no one carrying anything . What comes out is devilment . " <p> McGuinness is seeking to accentuate the " purity " of what they have together . It is a word he revisits on quite a few occasions in the course of a 35-minute interview that concludes at the end of a long day that had begun at 9.30am in MacCumhaill Park in Ballybofey . <p> There have been endless TV , radio and print interviews ahead of a second All-Ireland final appearance in three years and there is still a first birthday party for his twins to return home to later on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generally no short cuts and what the Donegal players have given him needs ventilation . <p> " The fact that they 're so committed to the jersey and so committed to the training , it makes it that pure . <p> " When they 're fully focused they 're a joy to work with .

It does n't happen with our lads . <p> " They work really hard and they push really hard . They try to push themselves to the border , to the edge of their intensity . " <p> Respect and success have created a unique bond , he says . <p> " I do n't think there is a better feeling in the world than just sitting looking across the dressing-room at a team-mate .

You 're living with these fellas and coaching them , " he says . <p> " Some of them have got married , some of them have had kids , some have gone to college and are out of college again . These are all life experiences . When I started out , I had only one child and now I have five . It 's quite a journey we 're on .

There could be no equivocation . <p> " We needed to know what we wanted to do , " he recalls of those critical days . " A half-baked attitude was n't going to win anything . Everybody had to be fully in . <p> " There is no point conning people and saying ' we 'll start training in a couple of weeks and everything will be okay and we 'll pick up pieces and build momentum ' . It is n't about that . The question was ' how do you want to be remembered ? Do you want to be remembered for being beaten by 16 points in a quarter-final ? ' <p> " That was the question that had to be answered . And then it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we prepared to do that ? ' <p> " I wanted that out in the open . I did n't want anybody going into anything blind . I wanted to gauge the room . <p> " If I felt that it was n't genuinely in the room then I probably would n't have gone on . " <p> Committing meant putting pen to paper and signing up to an agreement to commit . Were there any extra clauses that were n't there before ? <p> " I just told them what I felt was required to be successful at this level . They 're aware of that anyway . The key thing is that you need everyone moving in the same direction . It was n't a gun to the head situation . I re-evaluate every single year , " he says . <p> " The first thing I look at is myself . What have I got to offer , can I bring it forward and where are my energy levels ? Then it 's about whether the players are prepared to bring it forward . If there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I wanted to know where I stood with the players . I did n't want the Mayo game to be the one that defined that team because that would n't have been fair on them . <p> " Maybe that was an emotional reaction on my part to think like that at the time , but I was very angry and very frustrated with what had gone on , " he recalls . <p> " On some levels I felt the carpet was pulled from under our feet and we did n't get the chance to prepare properly . <p> " That was n't sitting comfortably with me and I made that very clear at the county board meeting . If you were going rectify that and turn it around you needed to know that your men were with you . <p> " I did n't want an answer at the meeting .

I have been in meetings myself and every man has the hand up , ' we 'll give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the door and that is n't the case . <p> " I wanted them to think about it . What I said was : ' You need to think long , hard and deep about this , you need to look inside yourself . <p> " You need to decide ' if this is the road I 'm going down , I 'm prepared to sacrifice the next 10 or 11 months out of my life ' . <p> " It would be wrong to say : ' are you in ? ' . ' Yeah , I 'm in ' . ' Are you in ? ' and so on . That 's too superficial . <p> " They went away and we met again after a week . " <p> He has pushed them hard , very hard .

There is no other word for it because you have 15 or 16 players working out of the county or in college , " he says . " And if you want to train hard , it is wild hard to do that when you have 16 there and they are thinking ' Jesus Christ , what are the other 16 doing . ' <p> " That is why the Derry game was such a big game . It came on the tail end of the exams . Everyone had their exams finished on the Wednesday . When we got over that , I knew we had everybody home bar the Dublin lads for every training session . That is a big lift . That is the time you crave . " <p> It 's not all toil and grind .

' Anything that can make the thing relaxed and get the work done , I have no problem . " <p> His time spent in Kerry as a student of health and leisure studies in Tralee IT and involvement with a star-studded Sigerson Cup team helped to shape his application to preparation , describing it as " a wake-up call . " <h> Natural <p> " The thing that struck me when I was in Kerry is how professional they were .

@@2800233 <h> EU closes private aid storage for cheese <p> The measure which was created in response to the Russian sanctions imposed at the start of August , the EU Commission opened PSA to provide storage for displaced butter and SMP , with the extension of the scheme to cover certain cheeses . <p> Despite only coming into effect on September 5 , the Commission 's decision to close the scheme for cheese was due to it being ' disproportionally used by producers in cheese from areas traditionally not exporting significant quantities to Russia ' . <p> The Commission stated that the scheme therefore does not seem adequate to react effectively and efficiently against the market disturbances that result from the Russian ban . <p> ICOS is currently investigating the background to the Commission decision .

@@2817234 <h> Pochettino method will take time and possibly new personnel at Tottenham <p> Mauricio Pochettino 's Tottenham Hotspur are very much a work in progress . For fans , patience is key , as the approach favoured by the manager takes time to coach -- time to bed in . Players must be willing not just to learn but also to put themselves through the wringer physically . <p> Pressing with intensity as espoused by Pochettino ( and by his mentor Marcelo Bielsa at Marseilles and the great Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich , amongst others ) demands high levels of fitness , concentration and commitment -- perhaps characteristics some would n't associate with the current denizens of White Hart Lane . <p> This will be no overnight job . <p> With only six games gone , the Argentine is still trying to get a feel for his players , still trying to get their buy in . After all , this is a squad bequeathed him by his predecessors -- not one meticulously assembled with his philosophy in mind . <p> On that basis , there are grounds to wonder whether the players available are suited to his preferred approach or whether he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't something players will just do naturally . It takes time and considerable hours on the training ground to master . <p> It is n't simply a case of getting tight on your man when he has the ball . For the approach to be effective , there are a range of triggers relating to how , when and where to press that players must understand , internalise and eventually perform automatically and coherently with their team mates . <p> And that 's just the part of Pochettino 's philosophy that deals with what to do when you do n't have the ball . Meeting his requirements when in possession will also take time and a little patience . Deploying players in pockets of space behind the opposition 's midfield and moving the ball quickly into these areas is central to how the Spurs manager wants to play . He also likes to break very quickly , often leaving two strikers high up the pitch and hitting them with snappy , long passes into feet . <p> On Saturday , we saw evidence of both sides to his favoured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was classic Pochettino . He loves his sides to " set traps " for opponents when they are in possession , directing them into ever tighter areas , increasing the likelihood of mistakes . <p> For Chadli 's goal , the visitors had engineered a position high up the pitch where they could apply such pressure and had numbers and options available to take advantage . The speed with which Eriksen seized upon Flamini 's loose touch ( a key trigger in the pressing game ) and the incisive and quick way in which the ball was moved onto Lamella and then the goal scorer will have delighted the manager . Some of his messages are clearly hitting home . <p> However , there 's still plenty of work to do , particularly on developing the fitness levels and the game intelligence required of players to manage how the pressing game is applied . Spurs tired noticeably in the last quarter of Saturday 's game at the Emirates and struggled to deal with the overloads Arsenal were generating with their midfield runners and full backs . <p> Leaving Adebayor and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the park to some extent -- and threatened to undermine their efforts . But it was a gamble the manager eventually thought better of , and the introduction of Bentaleb for the Belgian helped stem the tide somewhat . <p> Spurs deservedly held on for an encouraging point .

But perhaps the key question to be answered is whether the players at his disposal have the right mentality to play as he requires . <h> 4 Responses <p> I do n't know why some people want to ignore Europa and League Cup when making an argument about how little time a coach has had .

Therefore , playing the FBs high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play in quality balls is asking too much and explains partly why we struggle at home . The lack of quality from the wide areas focusses the attacks down the centre . This makes it easy for defenses to combat . <p> None of our strikers are suited to playing on their own up front . Spurs should revert to a diamond midfield with 2 up front . One of the strikers can drop off into midfield when we are defending . Spurs should play at least one of our wide players on the side they can play in crosses into the box without coming inside . I would like to see Townsend used as sub but played on the left if only to stop him shooting from stupid positions . His energy and drive late in the game could be useful in opening up the game . <p> Poch also has to be realistic about how high the back 4 play . None of our CB 's are comfortable chasing back . Perhaps if he played the back 4 a few yards deeper it would help the defense against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back .

John Byrne talks to Cillian Murphy , who plays lead character and burgeoning crime boss , Thomas Shelby . <p> After a spectacular first season that was both a critical and ratings success , Steven Knight 's period drama Peaky Blinders returns for a second run this Thursday , October 2 . And this time around everything 's up a notch or twelve as Birmingham crime boss Thomas Shelby ( superbly played by Cillian Murphy ) heads for lucrative-but-perilous opportunities while seeking to expand his empire beyond the English midlands . <p> As the 1920s begin to roar , business is booming for the Peaky Blinders gang and Shelby starts to bring his legal and illegal operations into previously unchartered territory . He has his sights set firmly on wider horizons , and the race tracks of the south of England are calling out for new management . <p> Shelby 's meteoric rise brings him into contact with both the upper echelons of society and astonishing new adversaries from London 's criminal enterprises . All will test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Meanwhile , Shelby 's home turf of Birmingham is facing some new challenges as members of his family react to the upturn in their fortunes , and an enemy from his past returns to the city with plans for a revenge of biblical proportions . <p> Featuring a spectacular cast that includes Helen McCrory ( Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince ) , Noah Taylor ( Game of Thrones ) and Tom Hardy ( The Dark Knight Rises ) , Peaky Blinders is set to deliver an explosive second season with an enthralling tale of ambition , corruption , violence , desire - and family . <p> Cillian Murphy deservedly earned much praise for his portrayal of Thomas Shelby , and we caught up with the 38-year-old Corkman just before the second season opener was premiered a couple of weeks ago in Birmingham . <p> John Byrne : The first season of Peaky Blinders was a great success - were you surprised , because it was quite unlike anything the BBC had done before ? <p> Cillian Murphy : " Yeah , and I think that 's probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of unexpected .

@@2826240 the nature of Coalition <p> On Wednesday night the Seventh Cavalry , in the person of Michael Noonan , came galloping over the hill to rescue the beleaguered pioneers and speed them on their way towards the rich lands of the Golden West , otherwise known as the economic recovery . <p> The Finance Minister was the right man for the job . He is the leading - some disaffected persons would say the only - big hitter in the Government . He radiates calm and confidence , qualities which lately have been so sadly lacking in the wagonmaster , Enda Kenny . <p> All over , then ? The John McNulty fiasco paid for , swept away , forgotten , like the troubles of Edith Piaf ? A new life beginning ? Alas , not really . <p> Yesterday one of Mr Noonan 's Cabinet colleagues , Environment Minister Alan Kelly , made a sensational intervention . He said that he intended to vote for John McNulty in the forthcoming Seanad by-election . <p> Alan Kelly is not an obscure time-server , chosen for one of the top jobs in the Government to fill a gap somehow overlooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tanaiste Joan Burton . <p> He is an acknowledged rising man in Labour . He has made no secret of his ambition to lead the party . His appointment as Environment Minister surprised nobody . When he speaks , people listen . This time , they will not only listen but question . <p> Both parties in the Government , but especially Fine Gael , want to sweep the affair of Mr McNulty , his appointment to the board of the Irish Museum of Modern Art ( IMMA ) and his nomination as a candidate for the by-election , under the carpet . Mr McNulty himself has asked the tiny electorate - composed of deputies and senators - not to vote for him . <p> A breaking of ranks by somebody in Mr Kelly 's position is all but unique in Irish politics . It raises a variety of questions . Presumably it does not breach Cabinet collective responsibility , but at a minimum it suggests a breach between the two coalition parties on an issue which the senior party , Fine Gael , considers a matter of importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role in the Coalition and its relationship with Fine Gael ? What does it say about the issue which set off the imbroglio , standards in public life ? <p> And what does it say about the long-term survival of the Coalition ? <p> Until yesterday , it appeared impossible for the partners , uncomfortable though they might be , to split prematurely . Their relationship has survived many a crisis , and their situation lately has been growing easier , not harder . <p> The economic recovery is real , not something plucked out of the Finance Minister 's imagination . It rests on more solid foundations than Phase Two of the Celtic Tiger boom , itself the froth from a gigantic property bubble . But our public debt is still colossal , and only a tiny loss of market confidence could set off another panic . <p> So the Government has a plan - a plan based on a mixture of caution and daring . <p> It seems that we will not save the ? 2bn demanded by our creditors . That is designed to please the electorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost unanimously , that we should pay the last instalment of austerity . <p> But the argument goes over most of our heads . People are sick of austerity . They want some goodies now , not next year . <p> And when you look at the question from the politicians ' viewpoint , you can see that the events of the last week or so constitute a powerful argument for giving the public some good news and taking their minds off the Government 's betrayal of its supposed commitment to democratic accountability . <p> The last thing Mr Kenny wants is a reminder to the voters of that betrayal and a revelation that the solidarity of the coalition parties can not be taken for granted . Not only has Mr Kelly startled the political world , he has made it impossible for the Government to continue to dodge the issues that arise from the story of Mr McNulty , his appointment to the IMMA board and his nomination for the Seanad . <p> Mr McNulty 's credentials for membership have been called into question , robustly asserted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right people do not need any qualifications . That was true under all previous Irish governments , and it has remained the case during the tenure of the present one . <p> And - notwithstanding the reforms announced by Brendan Howlin - it will continue to be the case as far into the future as anyone can foresee . <p> Allied with this question is that of the Coalition 's pledge to wage war on the quangos . To say that this has not been honoured would be an understatement . Hundreds of quangos continue on their merry way , spending public money and achieving little in return . New quangos and super-quangos have sprung into being . Mr Kelly has ensured the renewal of public debate on this subject . <p> Has he ensured something else , namely a campaign by Labour to force the necessary reforms ?

And internationally our tooth brushing levels are very average . Irish boys brush their teeth less frequently than girls . At the age of 15 , it 's 76% for girls brushing more than once a day versus 55% for boys , " he noted . <p> Currently in Ireland , the public water supply is fluoridated - this means that just over 70% of the population uses it on a daily basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anti-fluoridation campaigners arguing that adding substances to the water supply amounts to mass medication , which they insist is unethical . <p> However , dentists have long insisted that along with fluoride toothpaste , fluoridated water is the most effective way of preventing dental caries ( cavities ) . <p> " A report commissioned by the New Zealand Prime Minister 's Chief Science Advisor and the President of the Royal Society of New Zealand found that fluoridation was the safest and most appropriate public health approach for promoting dental health . A recent study in England found that the prevalence of caries in 12-year-olds was over 20% less in areas with fluoridated water , " Prof O'Mullane said . <p> He pointed out that as the public water supply in Northern Ireland is not fluoridated , it has been possible to compare the level of dental decay among children in the North and the Republic . <p> " The findings show that despite a higher reported level of brushing in Northern Ireland , the levels of tooth decay north of the border were over 40% higher than those in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that some councils around the country have voted against fluoridating the water supply , and a number of TDs and Senators have also stated their opposition to the practice .

What sort of research are these politicians drawing on ? What is the scientific basis for their arguments ? I would urge councillors to take account of the consequences of their actions . A reversal of fluoridation will lead to an increase in dental decay . It is as simple as that , " he said . <p> Prof O'Mullane made his comments at the annual conference for HSE dental surgeons in Carlow . <h> Comments <p> JoeT - 27/11/2014 21:19 <p> Does anyone seriously believe that people in Northern Ireland have 40% more tooth decay than people south of the border ? Of course there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's because of delayed eruption . Delayed eruption of teeth ? Yes , constantly ingesting fluoride causes a delay in the eruption of the teeth ( among many other symptoms of fluoride poisoning ) .

Of course the differences even out in adulthood . <p> By the way , the cause of tooth decay is sugar .

@@2870239 <h> www.irishtimes.com <h> Jim Carroll <h> Music , Life and everything else <h> Lupe Fiasco walks the walk and talks the talk again <p> Lupe Fiasco 's latest problems with Atlantic Records over release dates is not the first time the rapper and the label have clashed <p> Lupe Fiasco <p> Jim Carroll <p> jimcarroll <p> Wed , Oct 22 , 2014 , 10:05 <p> There are some times when a new story reminds you of a great yarn sitting in the archives . This story about the proposed released of a new Lupe Fiasco album " Tetsuo &amp; Youth " in January 2015 , a release date which is attributed by the story to threats from a sub-division of the Anonymous massive to do the dog with Atlantic Records ' servers if they did n't come up trumps , reminds me of a great interview with the rapper in 2011 . <p> When he got on the phone , Fiasco was talking up " Lasers " , an album he 'd delivered to his label two years previously , but which had been hanging around waiting for a release since then . Back then , it took fan power in the shape of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offices of Atlantic Records in October 2010 , to produce some mediation between the rapper and the label and lead to the release of the album . <p> Fiasco was a hugely engaging and entertaining interviewee , someone who knew exactly the targets he wanted to hit and how to go about doing it . In a time when so many artists bitch and moan on social media about their labels and the politics of the release schedule , Fiasco could see exactly where the problem was . He had a traditional kind of record deal , one where the label release and make money from the album . However , Atlantic wanted Fiasco to sign a 360 deal , one where the label get a chunk of money from all of the artist 's activities . Fiasco was n't interested and this is where the problems began . Unlike many of his peers , Fiasco was going to stick to his guns rather than look for an exit . <p> " I signed a traditional record deal with Atlantic just before they went into 360 land , right at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Disney . Someone like Disney is in complete control of their artists like the Jonas Brothers . They 'll have a TV show , a radio station , a tour and merchandise and the record label want that too . <p> " But it 's one thing to want it and it 's another to be like Disney where you have the infrastructure to do that . They own the radio stations and TV stations and the factory which makes the clothes . All the record label does is make records and they send everything else out to individual vendors . <p> " I told the label I 'd sign a 360 deal if they brought the facilities and experts into the building . I 'm not going to sign a deal to do TV shows if you do n't have an accomplished TV producer working for you . The A&amp;R man ca n't do TV shows just because he went to school . Just because you 're a master at moving records does n't mean you 're a master at everything else . They need to spend more time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system and get things on the cheap . Everything got parked . I wanted to come in at the ground floor with fair business practices and do things differently but then , it became this hoopla and everything stalled . " <p> You got the sense from him that the relationship with Atlantic Records had kind of ran its course by that stage , which makes the fact that he has a new album ready to go on the label all the more surprising . " One of the mistakes I made was getting too involved with the record business and Atlantic Records " , he said three years ago . " The revelation I had was that these are just people who are about money at the end of the day . The relationships are fine , but the relationships are maintained because they 're about making money . Once you stop making money , the relationship ends so it 's fake . They do n't give two shits about you , it was always the bottom line . " <p> He was also very forthcoming about the cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $80,000 to $100,000 per track . When you work with certain producers , they charge a premium and some of them will charge up to $100,000 . Some people will charge $50,000 or $60,000 for a hook . You can easily blow through half a million dollars in a few tracks . <p> " So when you see your tracks like " Beaming " , which was a $100,000 record get leaked , you 're like ' oh shit ' . That 's why we did the video real fast and got it on iTunes in an attempt to make some of the money back . When I talk about this , I 'm not whining or complaining for the sake of nothing . That $80,000 gone . Woosh ! And that 's before we work out the cost of the time involved . " <p> Fiasco was also ahead of the curve when it came to criticising Barack Obama 's tenure as US president . Remember this was early 2011 and there was still the glimmer of a post-election glow around the Obama White House . Fiasco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " I 've never been a fan of the American system because of the education I got from my mother , who used to pick cotton when she grew up in Mississippi , and my father , who was very political . Sure , it 's a milestone to have a black man in the White House , but look past that and the precedent has been set in Africa . There 's already been black presidents who 've been corrupt so it does n't strike me that having a black man in office means he 's going to be the messiah . <p> " Obama came in and gave $700 billion to the bankers off the top as opposed to giving $700 billion to the poor . The reason we have a deficit is because of the military spending which is ridiculous but which we have to support dictators across the world to maintain America 's financial and economic interests . Instead of slashing the military budget to fight the deficit , Obama slashed after-school programmes , education budget and the pay for federal workers . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cut the military 's legs off . " <p> " There 's a certain level of hypocrisy when America goes into the world and it always falls back on militarisation rather than fair diplomacy to get its way . The economic policies of the United States and its affiliations with the World Bank and IMF mean it does take over countries . Maybe not overtly , but it does happen with policies on trade and aid . American foreign policy has notoriously been imperialist and racist . " <p> His final words on that occasion were fairly apt then and probably now again given the delays around the release of the new album . He can probably use this quote as his motto if needs be . " I suppose I am outspoken . But when I see things I do n't agree with , I have to speak up and express myself .

Unfortunately , however , scepticism and actual curiosity are in short supply these days . <p> Instead , the two most important gifts we have at our disposal have been supplanted by a knee-jerk rejection of the obvious answers because they are mainstream , while giving credence to kooky theories simply because they 're not . <p> Conspiracy nuts , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't open to the truth .

Well , a phobia , by definition , is an irrational fear of something - a form of anxiety disorder , if you will .

Similarly starved of funding , UCD plummeted out of the top 225 , with the other NUI colleges and the RCSI trailing even further off the pace - veritable fun run finishers in the worldwide Olympiad of higher education . <p> The long and short-term consequences of this are serious indeed : it 's thought the Chinese and other countries may soon stop sending students here . The multinationals , which located here partly based on the notion that they would have access to a cutting-edge workforce , could take note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may opt not to come or stay here . And the damage done to our academic reputation may take a generation to repair . <p> But while the universities slowly limp towards a crisis point , one of the men who saw them through their recent heyday - former UCD president Dr Hugh Brady - sails serenely on to pastures new . <p> He will take up a post as the president and vice chancellor of the University of Bristol , which is ranked in the top 30 universities in the world , leagues above our lot . It 's perhaps just desserts for a man credited with modernising UCD 's campus ( which is now unrecognisable from the windswept compound of the 1990s ) , revitalising its masters and PhD programmes and presiding over a ranking rise of nearly 100 points during his decade-long tenure as president . But , as both the former face of Irish third-level education and the father of triplet boys who are now of college age , he surely must feel a twinge of regret when he looks at the academic atrophy over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like what I see , but you have to put it in context " , he begins . " The universities here have really put their shoulders to the wheel . They 're still up in the top one per cent of institutions in the world , despite having both hands tied behind their back and their ankles shackled as well . But it 's not sustainable . The European universities are really waking up - they are becoming better funded and more empowered . Then you have technology-based institutions in Singapore which are just flying up the table . If you look at some metrics , the universities here have improved but they 've not improved fast enough . For a small , open economy ( which is ) based very much on technology , that 's quite dangerous . We ca n't afford to be mediocre in this game ; second class , quite frankly , is nowhere . " <p> Unsurprisingly , funding is the big issue : Without more money , the decline is inevitable . But where will that cash come from ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state , " Dr Brady says , laying out the conundrum . " The UK has decided a bigger proportion will come from the individual , Germany has decided more will come from the state , but in both cases they 've decided that on the amount that is needed to give them world- class institutions . Our politicians have continually fudged this question . As long as I 've been in education there 's been another report on this coming ( another one is due to report in 2016 ) . The HEA has come out recently and said this is a critical situation now - I agree . " <p> But in an economic climate where everyone is clamouring for more funding , is it the case that the squeakiest wheels get the grease ? Some academics were appalled at the budgetary concessions made to secondary teachers , who seemed to be rewarded for their disobedience , while the considerably less vocal universities again drew the funding short straw . Are our university heads just crap at making their own case ? <p> " Well , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not , " Brady says . " A hospital can close outpatients . A school can point to class sizes . They have hostages . What do we have ? But having said that , if you listen to the political rhetoric , we all agree that we need a world-class university system . We 're underfunded , not compared to the Oxfords and Yales , but as against the relevant comparators - the Nottinghams and Manchesters . What 's needed now is political courage . " <p> But adequate funding without what Brady calls " proper empowerment " will not work . This , he says , relates to universities being able to decide internally matters of performance-related-pay , something they currently can not freely do , in part because their pensions come out of the civil service pot . It also goes to the heart of the matter of funding because it relates to the double identity of a university : a business that provides a social good and a recipient of public funding that demands unfettered autonomy . <p> During his time at UCD , Brady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went before the Dail 's Public Accounts Committee to justify the pay of Des Fitzgerald , UCD 's vice president for research , who in 2008 had an outrage-inducing pay-packet worth over ? 400,000 . " A university is a business that brings in tens of millions of non-exchequer income " , Brady says . " If you look at Des Fitzgerald 's case , he was one of the most brilliant individuals I 've ever worked with . He almost tripled our research income under his leadership . He doubled research output in terms of publications and vastly increased outputs in terms of licences and patents . He was worth every cent of that salary . When I recounted that story to others in the UK or the US they looked at me in disbelief that this was an issue . The requirement should have been : do everything within your budget , but do everything you can to gain non-exchequer income and appropriately remunerate those that drive that additional effort . The rewards that come with that would be normal within the UK system . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get around budgetary difficulties without necessarily affecting performance would be to merge UCD and Trinity . Many academics would be in favour of this but Brady is not amongst them . " Bristol is smaller than UCD and Trinity and yet it 's 29 in the world , so size does n't necessarily dictate where you 're going to be in world rankings , " he says . " If you look at the papers that are published and the collaborative institutions involved , UCD collaborates the most with Trinity and vice versa . What do you get from merging ? I 'm not convinced . " <p> In a sense , Brady is the embodiment of the links between industry and education . Aside from spearheading funding drives while he was at UCD , he also sits on the boards of Kerry Group and ICON , a pharmaceutical company . Both the CEO of ICON , Ciaran Murray , as well as its chairman , Tom Lynch , have received honorary doctorates from UCD - was this purely coincidence ? <p> " There was zero connection , " Brady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the large Irish multinationals to be honoured by the universities . Which they and so many have been . These are companies with turnovers of billions - they are Irish success stories . " <p> Much the same might be said of the University of Bristol 's newest president . The son of a pharmacist and a bank official , he attended Newbridge College before going on to study medicine at UCD . He trained in Dublin and Toronto before moving on to Harvard Medical School , where he led his own research group . After that he returned to Ireland , eventually becoming a Professor of Medicine at UCD before going on to become head of the department . <p> He married Yvonne O'Meara , a consultant nephrologist , and they had triplet boys . During his tenure at UCD he was regarded as being tough , effective and reforming , if sometimes a little insensitive to political niceties . <p> He 'll talk convincingly about the cultural and aesthetic charms of south-west England , but you get the feeling that the real reason he 's leaving is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given freer rein there : " If you can compare the situation in Bristol versus an Irish institution , the differences are glaring , " he says . <p> " In Ireland we have constraints on hiring which they do n't have in the UK , in Ireland there are limits on what promotional options you can offer ( academics ) - there are none in the UK . In Ireland , if you want someone to lead a business school , and want to pay them one euro extra for doing that highly complex and difficult job , you 'll have a problem ; in the UK they 'd look aghast at you if you told them there is a problem . " <p> The name of the game for universities , he says , is " running to stand still . Bristol is concerned about its performance and it 's 29 in the world . When you understand that you understand that alarm bells really need to be ringing for Ireland " . @ @ @ @ @ @

@@2901240 <h> Paul Krugman : business leaders are not economic oracles <h> Success in business does not seem to convey any special insight into economic policy <p> Ben Bernanke had the courage to defy all those tycoons demanding that they stop printing money . Photograph : Reuters/Jim Young <p> The Bank of Japan , the country 's equivalent of the Federal Reserve , has lately been making a big effort to end deflation , which has afflicted Japan 's economy for almost two decades . At first its efforts -- which involve printing a lot of money and , even more important , trying to assure investors that it will keep printing money until inflation reaches 2 per cent -- seemed to be going well . But more recently the economy has lost momentum , and last week the bank announced new , even more aggressive monetary measures . <p> I am , as you might guess , very much in favour of this move , although I worry that the policy might nonetheless fail thanks to fiscal mistakes . ( More about that later . ) While the bank did the right thing , however , it did so amid substantial internal dissent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only five of the bank board 's nine members , with those closest to business voting against . Which brings me to the subject of this column : the economic wisdom , or lack thereof , of business leaders . <p> Some of the people I 've spoken to in Tokyo argue that the opposition of many Japanese business leaders to the Bank of Japan 's actions shows that it 's on the wrong track . In saying this , they 're echoing a common sentiment in many countries , including the United States -- the belief that if you want to fix an ailing economy , you should turn to people who have been successful in business , like leaders of major corporations , entrepreneurs and wealthy investors . After all , does n't their success with money mean that they know how the economy really works ? <p> About that bad advice : think of the hugely wealthy money managers who warned Ben Bernanke that the Federal Reserve 's efforts to boost the economy risked " currency debasement " ; think of the many corporate chieftains who solemnly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that fixing the debt would cause growth to soar . <p> In Japan , business leaders played an important role in the fiscal mistakes that have undermined recent policy success , calling for a tax hike that caused growth to stall earlier this year , and a second tax hike next year that would be an even worse error . <p> And on the other side , the past few years have seen repeated vindication for policymakers who have never met a payroll , but do know a lot about economic theory and history . The Federal Reserve and the Bank of England have navigated their way through a **25;525;TOOLONG economic crisis under the leadership of former college professors -- Ben Bernanke , Janet Yellen and Mervyn King -- who , among other things , had the courage to defy all those tycoons demanding that they stop printing money . <p> The European Central Bank brought the euro back from the brink of collapse under the leadership of Mario Draghi , who spent the bulk of his career in academia and public service . <p> Obviously there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plenty of academics who have gotten it wrong . ( Do n't get me started . ) But success in business does not seem to convey any special insight into economic policy . Why ? <p> The answer , to quote the title of a paper I published many years ago , is that a country is not a company . National economic policy , even in small countries , needs to take into account kinds of feedback that rarely matter in business life . For example , even the biggest corporations sell only a small fraction of what they make to their own workers , whereas even very small countries mostly sell goods and services to themselves . <p> So think of what happens when a successful businessperson looks at a troubled economy and tries to apply the lessons of business experience . He or ( rarely ) she sees the troubled economy as something like a troubled company , which needs to cut costs and become competitive . To create jobs , the businessperson thinks , wages must come down , expenses must be reduced ; in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like deficit spending or printing more money ca n't solve what must be a fundamental problem . <p> In reality , however , cutting wages and spending in a depressed economy just aggravates the real problem , which is inadequate demand . Deficit spending and aggressive money-printing , on the other hand , can help a lot . <p> But how can this kind of logic be sold to business leaders , especially when it comes from pointy-headed academic types ? The fate of the world economy may hinge on the answer . <p> In Japan , the fight against deflation is all too likely to fail if conventional notions of prudence prevail . But can unconventionality triumph over the instincts of business leaders ?

Chamberlin said how he and Billy Corgan were always into that side of things . They figured out early on that you can separate your core base from fan and superfan , and if you actually create " product " for the superfan , you can survive and gain economically and become a successful catalogue band . Kaskie made the point that a lot of bands " go away " due to a lack of business acumen as their careers progresses . <p> In terms of working out social media plans , economy strategies , and businesses models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to write a better song than to spend time thinking how you 're going to market a single to people . <p> Chamberlin also pointed out the well-worn venn diagram that covers musicians and entrepreneurs : two sets of people who have to love what they do to the point that they 'd be doing it anyway no matter what was happening . <p> Surfboard One of the speakers I was looking forward to -- and ended up wanting to hear much more from at the Summit -- was Lauren Wirtzer-Seawood , head of digital at Parkwood Entertainment , a company better known as the entertainment and management company founded by Beyonce . The topic of the panel was Fan Engagement . Nobody controls her image , her brand , her communication as much as Beyonce , so it was very exciting to hear the person in charge of a lot of this stuff online speak about it . <p> So , here are some points Wirtzer-Seawood made : - Fans have access and they are always connected . They also have expectations that content will be fed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 're doing . <p> - For many artists , all social platforms do n't work , they have to be selective . <p> - Beyonce uses Instagram and Facebook mostly and then Beyonce.com to house everything . Wirtzer-Seawood says FB and Instagram work because the content gets to fans quickly and the platforms are familiar . Having a website is n't what everyone has or needs , but considering the size of Beyonce 's fancies , it 's preferable for the . com to house everything . <p> - Beyonce approves every piece of online content that goes everywhere and anywhere from her HQ , no matter how small it is . <p> - The only way for content to be authentic , is for Beyonce to be familiar with ti , so she sees it and approves it daily , or multiple times a day . <p> - Interestingly Wirtzer-Seawood said that music and tech are n't really marrying properly yet . She said that the reality is social platforms are valuable for musicians , but the problem is there are too many . Next year , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Fans wo n't go to 17 different channels or platforms to get content . <p> - Artists wo n't leave FB or Instagram because they are tools they use in their daily lives , and because fans go there and if the content is n't there , they 're not necessarily going to go elsewhere . <p> - In terms of sponsored content , or artists plugging brands , Wirtzer-Seawood said it 's obvious to a fan if an artist is talking about a product online and they 're being paid to do so . It depends what the expectations of fans are of people so their reactions will differ . " Kim Kardashian hawks products all the time , " Wirtzer-Seawood said , and it does n't bother her fanbase because they understand that goes with her territory . <p> Other points that were made is that there are a lot of bad start ups in the music space -- and I 'd agree with that . There are also an incredible amount of " new " apps , startups , ideas and services that do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that does n't offer an innovation ?

@@4859235 <h> After a glorious career spanning 12 seasons , which yielded five All-Irelands and three All Stars , Declan O'Sullivan departs the inter-county game with a magical ending <h> Christy O'Connor <p> Retired Kerry footballer Declan O'Sullivan pictured with his knees heavily strapped when introduced as a sub for his club Dromid Pearses in the Kerry JFC final . Photo : Eamonn KeoghDeclan O'Sullivan , Kerry celebrates with his son Ollie , age 2 , and the Sam Maguire cup , at the end of the All Ireland Senior Championship Final <p> For as long as he can remember , Declan O'Sullivan had been Killian Young 's room-mate on away trips with Kerry . They are friends . They are both from South Kerry . O'Sullivan still often wondered how the dynamic worked so well . <p> He liked to go to bed early and get up early . Young was the polar opposite . Knock off late , get up late . O'Sullivan had his routine . Wake up at 6.30am . Leave the room . Go for a walk . Have breakfast . Lounge around the team area until 9.30 or 10am . Young would be awake by then . <p> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dressed at 6.45am when he noticed two envelopes underneath the door . One had his name on it . He brought it down to the reception , sat down and read the nine lines on the page . It was a message from Eamonn Fitzmaurice , who had written a personal note to each player . <p> O'Sullivan was taken by the humility and deeply affectionate touch of Fitzmaurice . He thanked O'Sullivan for the " unbelievable leadership " he had shown , how he had " set the tone " for everyone else . O'Sullivan smiled when Fitzmaurice asked him to bring all his " thickness to bear " when he got his opportunity later that day . <p> It was a beautiful , cold , fresh morning . O'Sullivan strolled down to a nearby playground in Dunboyne . He ran two laps around the perimeter before sitting down . He spoke to himself . Set out his goals for the day in his head . Then he texted Fitzmaurice . <p> " Serious gesture this morning Eamonn . Totally pumped . The Kerry team today is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbelievable heart and togetherness . And I know we 're going to win this All-Ireland . " <p> Fitzmaurice replied instantly . " I know too Dec . " <p> Before the sun had warmed the ground and rinsed away the dew , the narcotic of emotion and adrenaline was coursing through O'Sullivan 's body . " As a 30-year-old who had already played in eight All-Ireland finals , that 's how I felt , " says O'Sullivan . " You can only imagine how the younger lads were feeling . " <p> Just like him . Pumped . <p> At the start of the season , O'Sullivan met Fitzmaurice . His knees were buckling under the strain . Even if he got fully fit , O'Sullivan was n't sure there were 70 minutes in him anymore . His body was beginning to break down but the physical concerns had begun colonising his mind . Mentally , he was at a crossroads . <p> " I said to Eamonn that I felt I was losing my confidence , " says O'Sullivan . " I 'd always back myself but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't enjoy 2011 , ' 12 and ' 13 because I had lost some of my confidence . That was still in the back of my head but I knew this year could be my last shot so I approached it differently . I was going to be positive , not hold back , cut loose a bit . That gave me a strange sort of freedom . " <p> O'Sullivan would be whatever Kerry needed him to be but refocusing also imbued him with a new sense of liberation . Demons had been stalking his subconscious . He missed a chance to put Kerry ahead late on against Dublin last year . In the 2011 All-Ireland final , he turned over possession for Kevin McManamon 's game-breaking goal . <p> Moments earlier , O'Sullivan had been pole-axed by a high tackle from Ger Brennan . He was dizzy . He could barely see . Yet when he was condemned afterwards , none of that evidence was relevant in the trial . O'Sullivan understands the brutal reality of elite sport . He never made excuses . <p> That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was . His best season was in 2008 but O'Sullivan has scratched that year from his memory . Kerry lost the All-Ireland final to Tyrone . O'Sullivan had a late goal chance saved by Pascal McConnell . " That stays with you , " he says . " I 've been involved in a few of those incidents but I took the 2011 All-Ireland final defeat unbelievably badly . I was completely devastated . I tortured myself . I should have been taken off but at the end of the day , it was my fault . " <p> His status as one of Kerry 's greatest footballers is even more impressive given how beaten up his body had been . Between 2007 and 2008 , he was the game 's most consistent footballer . And yet , O'Sullivan still was n't able to fully press the pedal in both of those seasons . " I have n't played at 100pc in eight years , " he says . " The most I could often hope for was 80 . Physically , by 2009 , I was slipping . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always had to carry a heavier load than most . Coming from a small club in South Kerry , every game was a battle . After Kerry won All-Irelands , his season was often only starting . On his 21st birthday in late December 2004 , O'Sullivan drove Dromid Pearses to their first South Kerry title . He took merciless punishment . Deep into every winter , he continued to carry Dromid while shipping the same hardship . <p> He first tore the cartilage in his left knee that winter in 2004 , which required two operations within six months . He had a third operation in 2007 . By this season , he had no cartilage left in that knee . He took the league off and in the Munster semi-final against Clare , he tore the cartilage in his right knee . <p> Over the summer , he had six injections in both knees . Fluid was constantly being drained from both joints . O'Sullivan did n't train before the Munster final but he was fresh and had such a bank of training behind him that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making 29 plays . <p> He hardly trained before the All-Ireland quarter-final . His knees were so sore that he had to fly to Dublin , when everyone else went by bus . He trained just three times between the All-Ireland semi-final replay and final . His body was screaming but O'Sullivan was still delivering , teaching the new generation how Kerry win All-Irelands . <p> " There are loads of ways you can contribute , " he says . " I captained Kerry when we won All-Irelands but this was the most enjoyable year I ever spent with Kerry . It did n't matter to me that I was n't starting or kicking points . I enjoyed my personal contribution and my role within the squad . " <p> " Declan O'Sullivan had a radical , rebellious mind . The more you try to dominate him , the more dominant he becomes . ( He ) is the most stubborn of all " - Paul Galvin , In My Own Words . <p> Deep in the heart of the Iveragh Peninsula , the MacGillycuddy Reeks Mountains lie to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west . Close to the Bealach Oisin Pass , nestled in the middle of rolling hills and endless mountain glens , Declan O'Sullivan 's mother Mary was born in a house in Coombaha where the only clear view of anything is the sky . <p> The terrain is rugged and hard . Desolate . Isolated . It was a 5km walk to the nearest school . The house is boarded up now but O'Sullivan always took inspiration from the living and surviving that was done there . " I 've always been very proud of my mother and where she came from , " he says . " She gets on with it . She never made an excuse . I definitely think that 's where my toughness came from . " <p> The stubbornness which Galvin speaks about is just an extension of his personality . " There is a bit of thickness in me , like , " says O'Sullivan . " I just ca n't let it go . I never see a lost cause . Even if we are going to lose , I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cranky . Myself , Galvin and Marc ( O S ? ) were always fighting over who was the most stubborn . <p> " Sometimes I might have gone overboard but I came from a dressin groom of Darragh O S ? , Seamus Moynihan , Liam Hassett , Johnny Crowley . Those guys were animals when it came to competing . It was a great education . Eamonn said to me before that I should be proud of that side of my character . And I am . " <p> Hailing from a small club with no pedigree or status imbued him with a restless ambition . That craving for acceptance always went to the core of O'Sullivan 's being . Maybe it was insecurity or a South Kerry trench mentality but one of O'Sullivan 's greatest strengths was that ability to nurture self-doubt , yet never let it consume him . It gave him his edge . <p> " Right up until the day I got the call from P ? id ? ( O S ? ) , I did n't think I 'd be a Kerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition of doing it in my club , or in my family . At underage , I felt there were question marks . I always played the underdog . I always felt I had a point to prove . It 's part of my character anyway , using that chip on my shoulder to get by . In the early days , I nearly wanted to take on the world . " <p> There were often times when he felt he had to . In the 2006 Munster final replay , he was booed by his own people . " On the Tuesday afterwards , I was driving when I had to stop the car , " he says . " I put my hands over my head and said to myself , ' Did that really happen to me ? That incident had a huge effect on me . It definitely changed me as a person . Mentally , it made me much tougher . I knew if I came through it that there would be very few things that would be tougher again . " <p> The following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to captain their county to successive All-Irelands . He was still only 23 but he had already joined the lineage of great South Kerry players . He became Kerry 's greatest ever centre-forward but in Kerry , football never ends . Neither do the demands and the pressures that accompany it . <p> In that footballing-obsessed environment , where the greats were hewn from different backgrounds to his , O'Sullivan often wondered about his true place in Kerry football . " I was always wondering what they thought of me , " says O'Sullivan . " Then I went to Kieran Donaghy 's wedding and spent two days in their company ; Ogie ( Moran ) , Se ? n Walsh , Bomber ( Liston ) . When I got to know them , I felt I was part of the Kerry family . I was automatically accepted and respected . That 's what being a Kerry footballer is really all about . It 's not so much about medals ; it 's about being part of this great family we 're all involved in . We 're just lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pantheon , his place is firmly secure . <p> O'Sullivan 's days are done now . He met with the surgeon Ray Moran in October . Medical options were discussed . He sat down with Fitzmaurice but O'Sullivan knew his body could n't give anymore for Kerry . He has two young sons now , Ollie and Robbie . His work with Liebherr requires extensive travelling . It was time to move on . <p> " I 'm happy and comfortable with my decision , " he says . " My body had been giving up but I did n't want to spoil the great memories I had with Kerry this year . I had nothing more to give . The reaction afterwards was very humbling . I was very grateful . You talk about legacy ; the texts I got from team-mates , from players I played against , that 's all you really want . " <p> The ending was perfect . Kerry All-Ireland champions . Basking in the warm afterglow on the field with Ollie afterwards . The birth of Robbie only days away . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a video message of Ollie in his Kerry jersey . " Best of luck Dad . See you afterwards on the steps of the Hogan Stand . " <p> Even more pumped now . " I was nearly crying , " he says . " I went straight back into game mode but as soon as the final whistle went , that was all I wanted . With the job I have , there could often be weeks where I might not see him . When he was younger , it was easier . Now Ollie is two and is on the phone looking for you . Sometimes you 'd ask yourself if it 's worth it . Then to have that moment - my son in my arms in Croke Park with Sam Maguire , in my last game - it was magic . " <p> Before he made his announcement , O'Sullivan emailed all his team-mates . He thanked them for all the great days . He spoke of how proud he was that they never broke , how they always came back . That bond and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's journey instilled in him an innate sense of Kerry . Of how the endless cycle and pursuit for excellence just continues . How the journey still goes on . O'Sullivan told his team-mates how he is looking forward to taking his two boys to watch this team develop over the next few years . That part of the journey will be just as special . <p> Because they are all family . <h> Declan O'Sullivan on ... <h> Retirement <p> " I 've had my time . I wanted to get the most out of it but I always knew the end would come and that I was only passing through . My body could n't give anymore anyway but I 'm looking forward to watching this new Kerry team develop over the next few years . " <h> His knee injuries <p> " If I wanted to stay playing , I knew it would n't be as straight forward as just a cartilage operation . It would have taken huge management . I could n't go through that again . I might have got away with it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Losing the 2011 All-Ireland final <p> " I was absolutely devastated . I was very low for months . You throw yourself into club football and try and forget about it but it was always there . " <h> Kerry 's new team <p> " There are some excellent young players on this team but the most enjoyable thing about winning the All-Ireland was the special bond we had all year . It was brilliant but the key now is to try and maintain that spirit , that something special . " <h> Eamonn Fitzmaurice 's influence <p> " He was unbelievable . He was that father-figure . The young fellas would have done anything for him . We all would . Even as a player , he was a brilliant leader . When I was going through a sticky patch in 2006 , he rang me after training one night . He always had that natural ability . "
