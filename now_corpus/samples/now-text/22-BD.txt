@@53525236 <h> Bangladesh : your next outsourcing destination <p> When Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina declared the vision of Digital Bangladesh on December 12 , 2008 , the ICT industry experienced its rebirth . Later , the government declared December 12 as Digital Bangladesh Day . <p> The industry has seen an exponential growth in the last decade , especially in the last four to five years . <p> While the export revenue from this sector was only $26 million back in 2008 , it crossed $1.4 billion in 2021 . Only 300 software companies and 50,000 people worked in this industry in 2008 . Now , one million people are working . <p> Under the umbrella of the Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services ( BASIS ) , there are 1,700 plus companies and the number has been almost doubled in the last five years . Besides , there are so many startups , call centre companies , e-commerce platforms , and emerging digital device manufacturing and assembling companies . All these are making Bangladesh a proper hub for ICT ecosystem . <p> Rashad Kabir <p> The government has also ensured numerous support for the sector . It has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IT-enabled service ( ITES ) companies until 2024 . A proposal has already been given by the BASIS to extend it up to 2030 . <p> The government has also kept the provision of 100 per cent profit repatriation and on top of that , the companies are enjoying a 10 per cent cash incentive for IT/ITES export . <p> Besides , we have seen an introduction of a lot of training programmes countrywide by the government to develop beginner , mid-level and high skilled IT professionals . Every year , 20,000 computer science and engineering graduates are produced from the public and private universities . <p> For the first time , we have also seen a bold step in order to develop resources as part of preparation for the Fourth Industrial Revolution ( 4IR ) . The government has planned to launch Sheikh Hasina Institute of Frontier Technology to develop resources in the field of artificial intelligence , blockchain , internet of things ( IOT ) , cybersecurity and other 4IR technologies . <p> Development of market ecosystem , policy support and the capability of the ICT companies have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the question is : how much of the attractive market can Bangladesh grab ? <p> The global ICT market was valued approximately at $556 billion in 2020 and is expected to reach $937 billion by 2027 . Still , the software development , web development , application support and management , mobile application development , technical support , help desk , graphics design , and image processing are the dominant areas for ICT outsourcing . <p> The ICT industry is taking steps to grab this attractive market . One of the potential markets is Japan . <p> According to the Japan International Cooperation Agency , there will be a shortage of 500,000 qualified engineers in Japan by 2025 . If Bangladesh can supply one fifth of the total requirements through ICT outsourcing model , it will be a game-changer for the economy of Bangladesh . <p> The BASIS , the apex trade body for the ICT sector , has established the Japan Desk to promote ICT services in the Japanese market . Within one and a half years of the launch of the desk , it has already received good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of the Japan Desk , the BASIS is now planning to establish four more desks in four continents . One will be in the US , one in Europe ( either the UK or the Netherlands ) , one in the United Arab Emirates , and one in Africa . The introduction of the desks will certainly lift Bangladesh to the next level . <p> But in order to achieve the $5-billion export target by 2025 , setting up ICT desks will not be enough . The government and the ICT industry should take a holistic approach to achieve the target . <p> Country branding is still a crucial factor and the government must focus on it . Bangladesh needs to arrange regular seminars , fairs and roadshows to promote the ICT industry and its capability . <p> Apart from offline media , it 's high time to use online and social media as well . We need to make promotional videos and video clips highlighting the success stories of our ICT companies . <p> Another key brand promoter of our industry might be our non-resident Bangladeshi community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bangladeshis are now working in many top companies in the US and Europe . Our ICT industry can utilise them to penetrate the market . <p> The example of India can be cited here . Many Indians are working in C-level positions in global companies , and whenever there is any requirement for software , they are straightway giving this opportunity to Indian IT companies . Bangladeshi NRB community can also follow the strategy of India and can help the country . <p> Another key market that Bangladesh should target is Africa and the countries that have just started their digitalisation mission like Bhutan , the Maldives , Uzbekistan , and Fiji . <p> It 's a great advantage for Bangladesh that it has started the journey of implementing the e-governance service in 2009 . Right now , there are 100 plus companies specialised in offering e-governance services . <p> Countries like Nigeria , Cameroon , Ghana , Rwanda and Kenya have begun their digitalisation process . If Bangladesh can take a government-to-government approach and promote the solutions that are already running in various ministries and departments in Bangladesh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the market of the countries . <p> Another important step that the ICT industry should not forget is to prepare for the 4IR . It 's true that the outsourcing projects that we are getting are still related to conventional technologies . But in the near future , there will be a time when we will get most of the projects in the areas of artificial intelligence , blockchain , IOT , or Big Data . If we ca n't make our companies competent for those technologies or ca n't develop skilled human resources , we may lose the market . <p> The recent efforts of the government and the industry have already made Bangladesh an attractive ICT outsourcing destination . We have already walked a long path . Still , there is a long way to go .

On the one hand , you need to consider making the room feel cosy , welcoming and of course , comfortable .

You want your guests to feel welcome , and appreciate the look , but not be overwhelmed by everything , and leave a sliver of space for individual expression . Here are some of the basic tips to consider while decorating your guest room . <p> The essentials <p> When it comes to designing a beautiful bedroom for guests , comfort is key . A guest room should be a welcoming space that combines the amenities of a hotel , with the intimacy and charm of a home .

Scented candles besides the bedside table look serene , while perfumed potpourri helps uplift the spirit . Diffusers can also be used in various scents helping to create a soothing and relaxing atmosphere . If you do not know what your guests favourite scents are , opt for something neutral in earthy and woody fragrance . Avoid floral and fruity scents which are stronger and might come off as irritating to certain people . <p> Towels for all <p> Just like fresh linens , fresh towels are also appreciated and expected in a guest room . If you have more than one person staying over , provide a towel per head , instead of one to share . White towels look best , but you can also opt for soft pastels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them with a ribbon for a more welcoming effect . Guests love it when they know the hosts have put-in extra effort for their stay . <p> The Bathroom <p> Guest room d ? cor does not end at the door ; it stretches far beyond -- into the bathroom as well .

If you want guests to leave with a smile and some good memories , these little tricks should come in handy .

President Joe Biden has diverted more gas to Europe , but that will still not be enough to replace what Russia supplies . ( Clara Vannucci/The New York Times ) <h> In the five weeks since Russia invaded Ukraine , the United States , the European Union and their allies began an economic counteroffensive that has cut off Russia 's access to hundreds of billions of dollars of its own money and halted a large chunk of its international commerce . More than 1,000 companies , organizations and individuals , including members of President Vladimir Putin 's inner circle , have been sanctioned and relegated to a financial limbo . <p> But Putin reminded the world this past week that he has economic weapons of his own that he could use to inflict some pain or fend off attacks . <p> Through a series of aggressive measures taken by the Russian government and its central bank , the ruble , which had lost nearly half of its value , clawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invasion . <p> And then there was the threat to stop the flow of gas from Russia to Europe -- which was set off by Putin 's demand that 48 " unfriendly countries " violate their own sanctions and pay for natural gas in rubles . It sent leaders in the capitals of Germany , Italy and other allied nations scrambling and showcased in the most visible way since the war began how much they need Russian energy to power their economies . <p> It was that dependency that caused the United States and Europe to exempt fuel purchases from the stringent sanctions they imposed on Russia at the start of the war . The EU gets 40 percent of its gas and one-quarter of its oil from Russia . A cutoff from one day to the next , Chancellor Olaf Scholz of Germany warned this past week , would plunge " our country and the whole of Europe into a recession . " <p> For the time being , it appears that the prospect of an imminent stoppage of gas has been averted . But Putin 's sudden demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ citizens for what might come . They took the first official steps toward rationing , with Berlin starting the " early warning " phase of planning for a natural gas emergency . <p> Although President Joe Biden has announced plans to release 180 million barrels of oil from the US reserve supply over the next six months and diverted more liquefied natural gas to Europe , that still would not be enough to replace all of what Russia supplies . Russian oil exports normally represent more than 1 of every 10 barrels the world consumes . <p> Europe 's ongoing energy purchases send as much as $850 million each day into Russia 's coffers , according to Bruegel , an economics institute in Brussels . That money helps Russia to fund its war efforts and blunts the effect of sanctions . Because of soaring energy prices , gas export revenues from Gazprom , the Russian energy giant , injected $9.3 billion into the country 's economy in March alone , according to an estimate by Oxford Economics , a global advisory firm . <p> " The lesson for the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far absent trade sanctions , " the firm said in a research briefing . <p> Putin 's feints and jabs -- at one point this past week he promised to stop and continue gas deliveries in the same statement -- have also kept European leaders off-balance as they try to divine his strategy and motivations . <p> The war has prompted democracies to move away from relying on Russian exports . They 've proposed cutting natural gas deliveries by two-thirds before this winter and to end them altogether by 2027 . Those goals may be overly ambitious , experts say . <p> In any case , the transition to other suppliers and eventually to more renewable energy sources will be expensive and painful . On the whole , Europeans may be poorer and colder at least for a few years because of spiraling prices and dampened economic activity caused by energy shortages . <p> And unlike in Russia , governments in these countries have to answer to voters . <p> " Putin has already demonstrated he 's willing to sacrifice civilians -- his and Ukrainians --to score a win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University .

It will not be an easy transition for Russia , either . Most analysts believe that Europe 's aggressive moves to reduce its reliance on Russian energy will have far-reaching consequences , however . <p> " They are done with Russian gas , " David L Goldwyn , who was a State Department special envoy on energy in the Obama administration , said of Europe . " I think even if this war would end , and even if you had a new government in Russia , I think there 's no going back .

What seemed surprising to economists , lawyers and policymakers about Putin 's demand to be paid in rubles was that it would have violated sacrosanct negotiated contracts and revealed Russia 's willingness to be an unreliable business partner . <p> As he has tried to wield his energy clout externally , Putin has taken steps to insulate Russia 's economy from the effect of sanctions and to prop up the ruble . Few things can undermine a country as systemically as an abruptly weakened currency . <p> When the allies froze the assets of the Russian central bank and sent the ruble into a downward spiral , the bank increased the interest rate to 20 percent , while the government mandated that companies convert 80 percent of the dollars , euros and other foreign currencies they earn into rubles to increase demand and drive up the price . <p> That has revived the value of the ruble , but as several analysts have pointed out , the currency 's newfound stability has come not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because of the extraordinary government interventions . <p> Putin 's demand that gas purchases be paid in rubles looked like another one of those interventions . Still , the insistence was puzzling . Russia could just as easily take the ongoing influx of euros and dollars paid by foreign governments and convert them to rubles . <p> Putin , of course , may revel in putting European governments in an uncomfortable position or flexing his power , but his demands may also reflect difficulties at home . <p> For example , he may not be able to ensure compliance with his mandate that companies , including natural gas producer Gazprom , repatriate 80 percent of the dollars and euros they earn and sell them to Russian banks . <p> The problem is that " the government can not enforce this rule , " said Michael S.

" <p> Smith said he had concocted this people-pleasing demeanor as a means of deflection during his turbulent childhood . " As an adult , he became my armor and my shield , " he wrote .

Soon afterward , Smith won the Oscar for best actor and wept through his polarising acceptance speech . Then he was off to the Vanity Fair party , dancing to " Gettin ' Jiggy Wit It , " his chart-topping hit from the last century , as if nothing had happened . <p> Now Smith has resigned from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences that just honored him with an Oscar and that has condemned his actions and opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility that a night that should have been the crowning moment of his professional career could wind up damaging a family brand rooted in his seemingly authentic congeniality . <p> For several years , a growing branch of Smith family enterprises has adeptly delivered reality-style revelation and emotional intimacy across an expanding number of platforms . Beyond Smith 's acting career and his introspective , bestselling memoir , there is the popular " Red Table Talk " show on Facebook Watch , in which Pinkett Smith , their daughter , Willow , and Pinkett Smith 's mother , Adrienne Banfield Norris , hold forth on everything from racial identity to workout routines to the Smiths ' unconventional marriage . <p> Smith 's upcoming projects include " Emancipation , " a $100 million , high-prestige drama for Apple ; an action thriller at Netflix ; a remake of " Planes , Trains and Automobiles " in which he would star opposite Kevin Hart for Paramount ; and the second installment of a travel series for National Geographic on Disney+ . They are all under the banner of Westbrook Studios , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith family started in 2019 . It was valued at $600 million earlier this year when an investment firm bought a 10 percent stake . <p> Could the slap derail all that ? <p> Now that Smith may not be welcome at the Oscars and his public reputation has been tarnished , studios may be wary of hiring him at the moment for lead roles in their biggest films . The companies behind Smith 's upcoming projects declined to comment on whether they were altering their plans in light of recent events . But three talent agents , who were granted anonymity to describe private negotiations , said there had been indications that at least some of his upcoming projects could be hanging in the balance . <p> Several public relations specialists who focus on crisis management warned that the incident could erode the goodwill that the Smiths have built up , while others suggested the fallout could be contained . " His brand is currently damaged goods worldwide , " said Mike Paul , a public relations expert . <p> Veteran television producer Jonathan Murray , who has dealt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like " Keeping Up with the Kardashians , " said that the outcome for the Smiths depends on what steps they , and particularly Smith , take now . <p> " I think most people would give him the benefit of the doubt , " said Murray , a co-founder of production company Bunim Murray , which pioneered reality TV . " But it really will rest on whether we believe that he is authentically dealing with this . " <p> Several friends and colleagues of Smith described the Oscars altercation as a puzzling aberration for a man who has spent his career almost fanatically hewing to professional standards . <p> " What happened was inconsistent with any behavior I 've seen working with Will Smith , " said Elizabeth Cantillon , a producer of " Concussion , " the 2015 film in which he played a doctor battling the NFL . " He was always exquisite . I think he 's part of the collective breakdown we are all having . " <p> The incident came as Smith has appeared to be in a period of transition : seeking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empire beyond film and television ; openly discussing the abuse he witnessed his father inflict on his mother ; and working on what he has described as self-understanding , through therapy , meditation and even hallucinogens . <p> " Strategizing about being the biggest movie star in the world -- that is all completely over , " Smith said in an interview with The New York Times Magazine in December . " I want to take roles where I get to look at myself , where I get to look at my family , I get to look at ideas that are important to me . Everything in my life is more centered on spiritual growth and elevation . " <p> Smith , a Philadelphia native , started performing as a teenager in the ' 80s , in the rap duo DJ Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince , and quickly earned a Grammy -- the first for best rap performance -- for " Parents Just Do n't Understand .

It was perhaps the last bit of his career that happened by accident . ( Smith 's company recently developed " Bel-Air , " a dramatic reboot that just finished its first of two seasons on Peacock as the nascent streamer 's most-watched original series . ) <p> Smith then set out to make himself the biggest movie star in the world -- and by many measures succeeded . With a business partner , James Lassiter , Smith plotted out , with actuarial zeal , the commonalities among hit movies : special effects , aliens , a love story . He became the face of summer blockbusters , with films including " Men in Black " and " Independence Day . " In his memoir , written with Mark Manson , he provides a handy , if boastful , chart of his prowess : from 2002-08 , he had eight consecutive films gross more than $100 million domestically . <p> For the fans , he was always accommodating . But the mantle was heavy . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sustain my position , I ca n't get caught slipping , not even once , " Smith wrote in his book . " I had to be perfect at all times . " <p> Part of the image that Smith sought to project had to do with his seemingly enviable family life : his creatively inclined children -- Willow , 21 ; his son Jaden , 23 ; and Trey , 29 , a son from his first marriage -- and his union with Pinkett Smith , 50 , an actor and musician . That portrait of stability cracked in recent years , especially when Pinkett Smith acknowledged , in a 2020 episode of " Red Table Talk , " that the couple had gone through a separation , during which she had been involved in what she called an " entanglement " with an R&amp;B singer , August Alsina . <p> Leveraging " Red Table Talk " as a sort of public therapy session , the Smiths have laid bare the details of some of their fiercest disputes , sometimes in the presence of Willow Smith and Banfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ viewers as Gammy . In one episode in 2018 , the Smiths sought to dispel rumors , noting that they are neither swingers nor Scientologists , after reports over the years that they had donated money to causes affiliated with Scientology . <p> " We have devoted ourselves to each other in a spiritual sense -- spiritual , emotional . It 's like whatever she needs , she can count on me for the rest of her life , " Will Smith said in the episode . " We do n't have any deal breakers . " <p> The revelations about their marriage were met with public derision , including on the awards circuit . In mid-March , at the BAFTAs , Britain 's equivalent of the Oscars , the host , comedian Rebel Wilson , joked about it when she mentioned Smith 's win for " King Richard . " <p> " Personally , " she said , " I thought his best performance in the past year has been being OK with all of his wife 's boyfriends .

" He laughed and stayed seated . <p> What did bring Smith to his feet , striding purposefully across the room to strike Rock , was an ad-libbed line about Pinkett Smith 's shaved head . It stung , Smith explained later , because Pinkett Smith has alopecia , which leads to hair loss . " A joke about Jada 's medical condition was too much for me to bear , and I reacted emotionally , " Smith explained in the apology to Rock and others he posted on Instagram on Monday evening . For his part , Rock said at a comedy show Wednesday that he was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comment .

" It 's a really complicated moment because of all the ways that it resonates with gender and race and power and brand , " said Miriam Petty , a film historian and professor at Northwestern University who studies Black stardom . <p> Some commentators criticised Rock for what they deemed a low-blow joke . Others , like actor Tiffany Haddish , who co-starred with Pinkett Smith in the comedy " Girls Trip , " applauded Smith for seeming to defend his wife 's honor , which Petty characterized as understandable in a world in which Black women and other women of color are not afforded the same social protections as their white counterparts .

@@90922237 <h> Pursuing double majors : important factors to consider <p> A double major means pursuing two distinct degrees simultaneously for one complete bachelor 's degree . Currently , only a few reputed private universities allow their undergraduate students to pursue a double major in Bangladesh . The decision to pursue or not to pursue a double major impacts their university experience and plays a major role in shaping their future . Therefore , it is essential to consider vital factors in order to make the best possible decision that aligns with their long-term aspirations . If you 're considering pursuing double majors , here are some important pointers to keep in mind . <h> Are you determined ? <p> University can be challenging , even if you are studying for one major . The stress nearly doubles when you have to do twice the coursework , making it incredibly challenging to balance life and studies . According to Obydullah Al Marjuk , a senior lecturer at a country-leading university , the rigorous determination required to complete a double major is not everyone 's cup of tea . Students often do not think about whether their determination is strong enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps to get a sense of their true determination is to consider the worst-case scenario and then simulate whether the student can still make it through the hurdles . " Your priority should be to build yourself rigorously . Only when you have that true commitment should you sign up for a double major , " says Mr Obydullah . <h> What are you trading off ? <p> While some students will have to spend more money on their tuition fees , many others will need more than their estimated graduation time . For some , it may also mean giving up a year of professional experience or just generally cutting down on other external activities . The value of all these trade-offs differs among individuals . Thus , students should carefully consider everything they need to give up before confirming whether they will be content in the long run . If students are clear about what they will have to lose when they sign up for a double major , this will also make the navigation easier . That way , their losses will not come as a shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Does this help you get jobs ? <p> A double major would equip you with more knowledge and skills in most instances . More often than not , employers appreciate individuals with more than one specific set of knowledge , and in today 's work culture , cross-team collaboration is more critical than ever . For instance , Munzeleen Sarwar , a student , is pursuing a double major in Finance and Accounting because according to her , many finance-related job openings prefer accounting skills . Munzeleen believes her pursuit of the Finance-Accounting double major will help her stand out from the applicant crowd . It is worth noting that a double major does not guarantee a job - it just increases the possibility of a well-rounded individual . <h> Is a master 's degree better ? <p> When it comes to the dilemma of choosing to pursue your second major in a subject that you could potentially pursue a master 's degree in instead , it is necessary to understand the functions of these degrees . An undergraduate degree offers an intensive , comprehensive and insightful scope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although in most instances covers the core concerns from basics to advanced level , does not necessitate the required time to build up a solid foundation as much as an undergraduate degree can . This is inherent because a student spends , on average , at least four years in their undergraduate studies compared to an average of one year in master 's studies . <h> Are you in doubt ? <p> It is perfectly normal and often very common for students to be in doubt about such a crucial decision in their lives . Raian Hossain , a lecturer at a country-leading university , says , " You need to garner more information , such as course descriptions , to develop clarity in your thinking . " The students may take help from their assigned advisor , concerned department facilitator , practitioners and seniors in the university to understand the description . They can find contacts and information on their university website or at the relevant department 's office . " If you like two majors , you may certainly consider pursuing them to save yourself from future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncommon for graduate students to complain about what they would have done differently . If they pursued both of their desired options , they would at least know they had tried and , therefore , would be less harsh on themselves . Ultimately , you need to weigh in on your choices before making the shift .

@@92225230 <h> What should be Bangladesh 's food security strategy ? <p> The rapid increase in global food prices in recent months have put many countries including Bangladesh in a crisis , especially affecting low and middle-income families as they spend a large share of their income on food . The Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) Food Price Index has reached 158.5 points , higher than the previous peaks of 132.5 and 137.6 , reached during the 2007-2008 and 2011 food crises , respectively . The Russia-Ukraine war , dry weather in several countries , and high prices of agricultural inputs such as fertiliser are responsible for lower food production and higher prices . <p> Across the world , rising food prices and reduced purchasing power due to inflationary pressure are worsening food security in many countries . Globally , according to FAO , as many as 46 countries including Bangladesh require external assistance to meet their food import needs . As per the Global Report on Food Crises 2022 , 193 million people in 53 countries and territories are facing food insecurity . <p> According to FAO 's July 2022 forecast , total global cereal production in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 0.6 percent lower than that of 2021 . Ukraine 's maize production is forecasted to be 30 percent less than the average output of the last five years . Wheat production will be lower in the European Union , Argentina , and Iraq this year due to drier-than-normal weather , although improved harvest is expected in Canada , Australia , and the Russian Federation . Global rice production is forecasted to be 520.5 million tonnes , 0.4 percent lower in 2022 than in 2021 . However , for Bangladesh , as per FAO 's forecast , the total cereal production is expected to increase by 1.7 percent -- from 62.6 million tonnes in 2021 to 63.6 million tonnes in 2022 . Bangladesh imported 4.86 million tonnes of rice and wheat till June 16 in the 2021-22 fiscal year . <p> Along with the requirement of additional foreign exchange to import food grain , the import of fertiliser and fuel will also put pressure on Bangladesh 's foreign exchange situation . Russia and Belarus are the two major fertiliser-exporting countries , and fertiliser prices surged by nearly 20 percent between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot up three times since January 2021 , causing agricultural product prices to rise . <p> The world trade in cereals is expected to contract by 2.4 percent in 2022-23 from the previous year . Globally , cereal prices have increased by 27.6 percent since June 2021 . Wheat price has increased by 48.5 percent . The price of rice has , however , increased by only seven percent during this period . Bangladesh imported four times more wheat than rice in the 2021-22 fiscal year . <p> Climatic factors such as reduced rainfall and flooding have affected food production in several countries this year . Supply chain related disruptions caused by the Russia-Ukraine war -- reducing exports from the Russian Federation and Ukraine and leading to higher global prices of agricultural inputs -- are difficult to deal with . Moreover , the tight monetary policy pursued by developed economies to address inflationary trends has reduced the availability of credit to deal with falling foreign exchange reserves that are crucial for the import of food , fuel , and fertiliser . The depletion of foreign exchange reserves due to payment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ currency depreciation . This is forcing countries to adopt austerity measures , including restrictions on imports that are having adverse impact on household income . <p> The solution to the food crisis lies in the revival of the global economy , which contracted by 3.1 percent due to the Covid pandemic in 2020 . Although the global economy grew by 6.1 percent in 2021 , with the growth continuing into the first quarter of 2022 , the growth rate came down even before the start of the Ukraine war due to global supply chain disruptions and record public debt . The International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) has reduced the global growth forecast for 2022 by 0.8 percentage points to 3.6 percent . The lower growth rate will affect the income levels of the poor and vulnerable people and their effective demand for food will go down which will exacerbate poverty and malnutrition . <p> Bangladesh has been trying to tackle the sharp rise in food and fuel prices in a number of ways . Foremost among them is a deficit financing policy in both the last year 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6.2 percent and 5.4 percent of GDP , respectively . Bangladesh had to devalue the taka against the US dollar this year . This is expected to have a positive effect on export in due course . However , the tight monetary policies in the developed West and contraction of the global economy are challenges , against which the government has focused its attention to raising domestic resource mobilisation and employment generation to keep economic growth at a reasonably high level . The total public expenditure is earmarked to increase by 14.2 percent in FY2022-23 from the previous budget . Public services , education and technology , and transport and communication are three top sectors where budgetary expenditure will increase by 21 percent , 14 percent , and 24 percent , respectively , from the revised budget of last year . <p> To encourage the export sector and ensure stable foreign exchange inflow , the government has created a special fund of Tk 5,000 crore for salaries and wages of export-oriented industries . The export development fund has been nearly doubled to Tk 55,200 crore in FY2022-23 . Also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affected industries and service sector enterprises , and Tk 40,000 crore for lending against working capital for cottage , micro , small and medium enterprises ( CMSMEs ) .

@@92225231 <h> Metrophilia : How to Love Dhaka <p> The street is a public landscape . IMAGE : KAZI FARZANA ZEBA , BENGAL INSTITUTE <p> If you want to fall in love with the city , walk . This simple aphorism opens up a full discourse on how we can make our cities liveable and civic , and how we might live together as a collective . One needs to love a city to plan it -- this perhaps could be a second aphorism . A better philosophy for urban development -- what The Daily Star asked me to write on -- should be based on an ambulatory life , in living and experiencing the city by walking . In walking , we are with others and we participate in what can be described as the public realm . <p> The city has become unbelievably complex and impenetrable , but it is also a beautiful thing , as the former mayor of the model Brazilian city Curitiba always reminds me . As the " most beautiful collective dream , " Lerner implores , the city is not a problem , but the solution to collective existence . <p> French writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the form of the flaneur . A difficult word to translate from French , as it might mean a loafer as we say in Dhaka , but in Baudelaire 's sense , a flaneur is " a connoisseur of the street , " an alert investigator who in wandering the streets takes in the sights , sounds and spirit of the place . Inspired by city life , Baudelaire 's flaneur can become a productive person . Architect Louis Kahn imagined the street as a place of infinite wonderment , where a child while walking one day decides what she wants to do with her life . <p> In the 1960s , the Situationists , the avant-garde group based in Paris , proposed the practice of d ? rive that involved journeying the terrain of a city to randomly discover situations in which to enact unprecedented work of political art . Psychogeography , the practice of walking and mapping the city , developed from there . In a moving essay called the " Dictionary of Streets , " published in his book Beginning with My Streets , Polish writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lay of the city streets in his hometown Wilno ( Vilnius ) , so that the " aura of the place " may be recorded . <p> In our cultural schema , we prioritise the movement of motorised vehicles , and place the pedestrian at the lowest level of all policymaking and infrastructure planning . PHOTO : AHNAF TAHSIN RAFI <p> Writing in his book The New York Nobody Knows , sociology professor William Helmreich mentions walking almost every street in New York City , which would be about 6,000 miles . " I love to read about the city , to live in the city , to walk the city . " Helmreich confesses in a New Yorker article . " I did it in the morning . I did it in the evening . I did it on the weekends . I did it in the rain , in the snow , in the summer . It came to about thirty-five , forty miles a week , a hundred twenty a month , fifteen hundred a year . " I know architect Salauddin Ahmed , who takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dhaka and document its life-world . <p> A good city is , above all , a walkable city -- this is an axiomatic truth propagated by ardent lovers of the city , from Baudelaire to biologist-planner Patrick Geddes , and urban activist Jane Jacobs to sociologist Henre Lefebvre . Our most intimate engagement with the city is in walking . I describe this phenomenon as " metrophilia . " As a notion , this is not found in the training of planners and architects in the country , and certainly not enshrined in the thick policy books produced for planning cities . <p> A walking environment should be the number one priority in any transport or urban planning . In our cultural schema , we prioritise the movement of motorised vehicles , and place the pedestrian at the lowest level of all policymaking and infrastructure planning . We overlook the fact that , of the people on the move in the city , 40 percent walk . Where once the pedestrian ruled , and the city was a place for walking and meandering , and enjoying its footpaths , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term of organising the city . We make roads for cars , and direct all major investments -- elevated roads , flyovers , ever wider roads , and U-loops -- to the promise of an uninterrupted vehicular movement , while we corner the pedestrian to the ever-shrinking edge of the road . <p> A good city is above all a walkable city . PHOTO : ARIF HOSSAIN <p> And that is why the footpaths of Dhaka remain the saddest configuration ever suggested for human adaptation . Primarily constructed as cover for drains , most footpaths are ironically unwalkable : they are broken into segments , they are obscenely high ( sometimes requiring steps to climb up ! ) , and when they do exist , they are often taken over by electric transformers , bus ticket vendors and police boxes . There , the walkers topple over one another , and hopscotch and jump on a ragtag space not more than four feet wide . No wonder people walk on vehicular roads even at the risk of being run over . With the book Designing Dhaka , published in 2012 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the poor and shabby footpaths in the city . We even joked : a footpath is exactly that -- a-foot-wide path ! <p> Despite heavy investments on the road , we have not been able to give a civic form and norm to it . Dhaka still has a rudimentary road and transportation system . Clogged , cluttered and chaotic , the roads of Dhaka are like scenes from a disaster movie . If after thousands of years of human civilisation , we crawl on our roads in our vehicles at seven kilometres per hour -- the average speed of a motorised vehicle on Dhaka roads -- and some of us who are walking meet untimely deaths by being run over , there is something wrong with the image of development . <p> If we wish for this megacity of 20 million residents to be a shining capital of a developed nation , marching forward with its flag of ever higher GDP , we should start from city roads . Economic advancement should match the quality of urban and physical spaces in our cities . <p> I have emphasised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public landscape , a space shared by both motor vehicles and humans -- one is a mechanised contraption moving with a speed , and the other a vulnerable living , breathing being . The road is not merely a conduit for movement of motorised vehicles ; it includes passage , movement and crossing for pedestrians . In Dhaka , we forget that the pedestrian is a vulnerable human being , whose five-foot-three-inch stature provides the fundamental scale and reference for all spaces . <p> The real problem is that Dhaka city -- as is -- resists walking , and hence our ambivalence about the city itself . The middle , upper-middle and upper classes ( MUMU ) in Dhaka do not walk ! Finding walking and thus becoming the public a discomfort , they are happily ensconced in their houses/flats . Removed from the public domain , they move in their car capsules to go from one space capsule ( home ) to another ( home or work ) . With the MUMU class calling the shots on the lay of the city ( they influence most policy decisions one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " public , " we will not expect any improvement of the public realm and public spaces any time soon . <p> Once Dhaka was a city of ' mosques and bazaars ' , now it is a city of walls and boundaries . PHOTO : SHAFIQUL ISLAM <p> One major public-oriented enterprise that is late in coming , but certainly crucial in improving the liveability of the city , is the Mass Rapid Transit ( MRT ) . We all look forward to that . With all the construction going on around the MRT , we have not yet seen much thought on walkability as it is critically linked to the success of any rapid transit . All major cities with successful MRTs -- Tokyo , Moscow , NYC , Hong Kong -- are supremely walkable . What is needed along with the transit infrastructure plan is a " walkability plan " for Dhaka ; the transit-oriented metropolitan scale must match up with the walkable local scale . <p> In times of Covid , the importance of open , public spaces and recognition of the local have become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the world focused their attention on the significance of public spaces , and the importance of walkable city hubs . Many cities in the US have adopted what is known as " open , slow or shared " streets in which the presence of the automobile has been curtailed or controlled to provide open-air mini public spaces . A new call for action for European cities is the " Fifteen Minutes City , " being popularised by the mayor of Paris , Anne Hidalgo , in which most needs of the people will be catered to in a fifteen-minute walkable neighbourhood . In advancing the idea of the hyper-local , and allowing citizens to use the streets in their own way , Stockholm is testing the idea of a " one-minute city . " <p> Dhaka is yet to present convincing initiatives for such public spaces . Urban or settlement design and landscape design -- two critical areas for making our environments better -- are sadly missing in the training of our environmental professionals , and starkly absent in the official discourse on urban planning . In the meantime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quasi-artistic effects and gestures , are conducting urban planning with no grounding in the theory of cities or the methods of urban design . <p> I have also argued that , in improving the public and civic life of a city , it is more important to think in terms of " urbanism , " that is , the dynamic and positive turns of a city with its multi-scalar realities , and not urbanisation , which has come to mean only the dire and uncontrollable side . Urbanism can be approached only by urban design . In his new book , The Largest Art : A Measured Manifesto for a Plural Urbanism , Brent Ryan , a professor at MIT , describes urban design as the " largest art " in human culture that addresses the plurality and multiple scalarity of our cities . Such approaches require a distinctive understanding and knowledge of cities , something that can not be equated by the limiting methods of architectural design or the dry policy orientation of planning . <p> Despite being a city of disparities and chaos , and choked by urbanisation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formal and informal , and the structured and spontaneous coexist in a kind of quiet truce . That truce is maintained literally at the walls of plots and properties of Dhaka ! <p> The public realm of Dhaka is a paradox , in which the wall as a structural , spatial and signifying element remains decisive and divisive in basic social transactions . Once Dhaka was a city of " mosques and bazaars , " now it is a city of walls and boundaries . In 2016 , Bengal Institute associates investigated a 410-acre planned residential area in Dhaka , and calculated that if all walls around the plots are lined up , it would be more than 300 miles long . From Dhaka , it would reach Chattogram . Bengal Institute also studied what would materialise if walls along institutional and commercial plots were dematerialised or reduced -- it would bring about an amazing new quality to the public realm , and allow for a more inclusive experience of the collective . <p> The city has become unbelievably complex and impenetrable , but it is also a beautiful thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city constitute a " meta-site " against which the " unregistered " collectivity is practised . A short walk through any of the streets of the city reveals the resiliency of its citizens -- in how one meets ends and perhaps brings about meaningful and joyous elements .

Such operations may be subversive to city ordinances , but for many tea stands , shoe repair spots and nursery-wallas -- I once saw a young woman with a sewing machine carrying on the trade of a tailor at a footpath intersection -- are ways of inhabiting and negotiating life in the city at the smallest and invisible scale . These operations may be described as micro-urbanism . <p> While such tactics may mark a contestation between legal and illegal operations in the conventional terms , one also discovers conditions of ingenuity , craft ( craftiness ! ) , and skill that are conducted spatially as acts of design .

@@93147234 <h> Purpose of yoga as explained by the Sutras of Patanjali <p> There are many wisdom traditions and spiritual maps to help you journey inwards . Yoga is one of these . Vedic scholars in ancient India spent many years in meditation to intuit this knowledge . Buddha studied with many of these teachers before his awakening . The knowledge was passed down orally till they were most accurately transcribed in The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali . For this article , I am drawing from a fabulously accessible version translated by Alistair Shearer . <p> Suffering is a fact of life . The fundamental dissatisfaction of human beings has been the central concern of all religious and philosophical systems . Buddha explained this by saying all things are impermanent , our lives are short , restricted , and ultimately , unsatisfying . The cure he prescribed was called ' the path to Enlightenment . ' It was a perennial teaching that he had verified by his own experience . This teaching is called yoga . <p> According to yoga , we suffer because we live in ignorance of our true nature . Our true nature lies beyond the restrictions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering . <p> Deep within the mind , beyond the faintest flicker of thought , it is experienced as an undying and omnipresent vastness . It is absolute consciousness . Animating everything in creation , this is the source and goal of all life . Yoga calls it the Self . <p> The nature of life is to grow toward an ever more perfect and joyous expression of itself . Each living being has a nervous system , no matter how rudimentary . This acts as a localised reflector of all-pervading consciousness , just as a mirror reflects light . The more developed the nervous system , the more it will express the pure qualities of pure consciousness -- intelligence , creativity , and bliss . Only when we realise our true nature , and the individual mind becomes infinite , shall we be satisfied . <p> Enlightenment is said to be complete knowledge of the Self . This Enlightenment is the first and last freedom ; it is the state of effortless Being . Yoga is the transformation into this Divine , and of this Divine into everything . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oneself is embedded in every culture and myth , with the metaphorical prize of the plant of immortality , the Golden Fleece , the Holy Grail , the Emerald Tablet .

If the hero has the courage to accept the challenge , with all its awesome metamorphic implications , he embarks on the crossing of a threshold that marks the beginning of the journey . This death and rebirth have to be accomplished many times , and every transformation suffered is a dying of the old and a resurrection into the new . <p> As a practical , non-ritualistic way to expand awareness , yoga is a vital means of ensuring individual evolution . It is for any individual no matter what his role in society , to purify his consciousness and live the full depth of life .

You can hear testimonials from students and read my articles , but you will never know how it feels till you try it . After over 20 years of practicing yoga , I can not say I have achieved Enlightenment , but I certainly feel calmer , more grounded , more compassionate and occasionally , I have moments when I can glimpse the divinity within me , and those around me . Those moments of clarity are my motivating force , they are why I do what I do : spreading ancient wisdom techniques in service of love . <p> Yoga is not a religion . It is undenominational , relying not on faith but on a number of purifying techniques that gradually lead the individual to the direct experience of Divinity . <p> Yoga means to join . Yoga is a way to restore our lost wholeness , our integrity as complete human beings , by unifying the personality around a centre that is silent and unbounded . <p> Yoga is a path to samadhi , a state of unclouded truth , a state of effortless Being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a map for this inner journey . <p> Sutras are threads . Each of the sutras is so succinct , on average only six words , almost like mnemonics to help us remember the message . Their purpose is to describe the stages of the inner journey . The sutras explain the mechanics of consciousness . <p> The first four sutras contain Patanjali 's entire message in a nutshell : Citta Vritti Nirodha : Yoga is the settling of the mind into silence . <p> Only when the mind is silent can we realise our true nature , the effortless Being of the Self . The Sutras define the fluctuations of the mind and the stabilising effects of yoga . <p> The next ten sutras explain the prerequisites of samadhi , the obstacles that will be encountered and the way to overcome these . The next part starts with the practical steps ( sadhana ) which can help an aspirant settle the mind and explains the five causes of suffering . These are balanced by the remedy of the eight limbs of yoga . <p> Patanjali 's examination of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yoga , ' the delicate techniques of sanyama .

To destroy this bondage requires one to come out of the prison of time , causation and space , allowing it to become unrestricted and universal . <p> The more universal the individual mind becomes , the less it will retain impressions of past actions . Therefore it will be less ruled by desires . As the practice of yoga matures , desires cease to be the expression of need and become instead the spontaneous unfolding of love .

@@93147236 <h> Nas Daily 's move to the UAE receives criticism <p> Nuseir Yassin , better known as Nas Daily , has found himself in controversy yet again . The influencer/content creator who previously lived in Singapore has recently moved to the United Arab Emirates amidst its new diplomatic relations with Israel . The new relationship allows Israeli citizens to live and work in Dubai , and Nuseir Yassin was among the first and most prominent Israeli passport holders to make the most of the opportunities . His move has had an immediate impact as it has garnered new funding for his tech and production companies and helped his social media following to increase . However , it has come at a cost : the rift between Nuseir Yassin and Palestinians , his own people , is now farther than ever before . <p> Nuseir Yassin , Nas Daily , has always had a somewhat neutral stance in the Israel-Palestine conflict .

On the other hand , he makes content condemning the antisemitism of Palestinians , calls for the Arab society to educate themselves and points out the positive aspects of Israel . His controversial stance has seen him lose hundreds of thousands of followers in the past . <p> Given the sensitive nature of the conflict , his most recent actions do not sit well with a lot of people , especially Palestinians . His move to the UAE certainly did not help the cause as the relationship between Israel and the UAE has been perceived as betrayal by Palestinians as this meant that the Emirates denounced Palestinian sovereignty . <p> Yassin 's decision is also being considered as an act of abandoning his own . Ramzi Abbasi , another prominent Palestinian influencer has labelled his actions as " beyond betrayal " and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . <p> Nuseir Yassin identifies himself as Israeli-Palestinian and considers his mixed identity as a " middle finger " to anyone who does not like the other country .

The reality is that a conflict of this magnitude and with so much history will always be in black and white so Nas Daily 's position on the matter will never be fully accepted by all .

@@93371230 <h> What future do our youth face ? <p> Our youth are being exploited by those with power . VISUAL : SALMAN SAKIB SHAHRYAR <p> The majority of Bangladeshi people are young . If we consider people aged between 14 and 29 years , they make up around 30 percent of the population , according to government estimates . People aged between 1 and 14 years make up above 25 percent of the population . People who are capable of working -- those aged between 15 and 59 years -- make up the largest segment of the population : more than 65 percent . The number of people who fall under the 14-29 age bracket currently stands at 50 million , and this number is increasing . <p> In my opinion , this population segment of children and young people faces the biggest danger among all in Bangladesh today . This danger materialises in different ways . Firstly , a healthy and safe environment that is devoid of fear , which is necessary for them to grow in , is non-existent . Their educational environment is hostile to healthy growth in many ways ; privatisation and commercialisation of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to play in , ponds to swim in , and trees and greenery are disappearing around them . Playgrounds are gradually being turned into large construction projects , and now children are basically growing up and spending their formative years on the streets or within closed doors . <p> Secondly , the rate of unemployment is the highest among the educated . Meanwhile , those who are in the process of getting an education suffer from a lack of security as well . If we consider the gono rooms of public universities ( common space shared by large numbers of students ) , a first-year student faces immense mental pressure as soon as they arrive there . Student organisations backed by the ruling party control everything about their lives -- how they stand , where they go , what they do -- they force the freshers to attend political gatherings . If a student faces all these obstacles in their very first year , their academic performance takes a nosedive as a direct result of this . A fraction of these students , often just to survive or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of young people who are being used as muscle power . <p> This brings me to my third point . A select group of powerful people in Bangladesh are taking ill-advantage of unemployment and the dearth of quality education ; they are taking advantage of this environment that is hostile to free thinking and creativity , that breeds fear and greed , to use young people as a weapon . <p> If we look at recent developments , the prices of fuel have increased along with that of other necessities , and people are protesting this price hike . When injustice takes place at universities or elsewhere , people try to protest that . In many of these situations , we have seen government-backed student organisations or youth organisations ready to stand against the cause , armed with machetes and sticks . We saw when teenagers revolted demanding road safety , the ones who attacked them were young as well . People refer to them as " helmet bahini , " and this bahini or force is gradually growing . <p> The female students who find themselves in this predicament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sexual harassment and rape almost on a daily basis , where young women are the victims . In many of these cases , the allegations are against Bangladesh Chhatra League or other government-backed organisations . They have created this reign of terror by connecting themselves to the powers that be . <p> A major concern at the moment is the fact that in 50 years , none of the services that our youth need to flourish throughout their lives -- education , creativity , sports , cultural activities , libraries -- have seen substantial growth in Bangladesh . As a result , they are growing up in a dry , uncreative , and cruel environment . Furthermore , those in power are using a segment of these young people for profit , to make money , to extend their power , and they are often using them against other young people . <p> A culture of fear exists in our universities and society in general . When we look at our youth today , we can see what danger and uncertainty they are being hurled into in the name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What are the government 's plans with this huge population segment who are supposed to take the reins of this country in the future ? Does it want them to turn into machines ? Does it want them to turn into a group of people devoid of thought , conscience , and sympathy ? Is that the government 's intention ? To exploit them in any way they want ? <p> One beacon of hope is that even from within this mess , the youth is making its voice heard , be that with road safety protests , protests for the Sundarbans , demands of national interest or for democracy . The touch of creativity we see in these protests give us some reassurance , but it 's time we started asking questions as to where our government is leading our youth .

PHOTO : REUTERS <p> On February 22 , 1946 , George Kennan , American charg ? d'affaires in Moscow , sent an 8,000-word-long telegram to his State Department bosses . Later known as the " Long Telegram " , it became the most influential foreign policy paper for dealing with the communist state . It helped articulate the US government 's increasingly hard line against the Soviets and became the basis of the US Cold War policy toward the Soviet Union . In 1947 , Kennan wrote an article titled , " The Sources of Soviet Conduct " , arguing that its regime was inherently expansionist and that its influence had to be " contained " . It deeply influenced President Truman who adopted a " containment policy " to stop Soviet communism 's expansion . Kennan argued for isolating the Soviet Union and waiting for it to fall under its own weight , which it eventually did in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its economic reforms under Deng Xiaoping . Riding on its economic success , Beijing bolstered its military muscle as well . Xi Jinping , after becoming China 's president in 2012 , undertook renewed measures to build an army to " fight and win " global wars . In 2013 , he launched the ambitious Belt and Road Initiative ( BRI ) to build large infrastructures in Asia , Africa , Europe , and other regions . <p> The rise of an assertive Beijing alarmed Washington . In 2015 , President Barack Obama undertook a rebalancing of power toward Asia . Containing China became America 's major policy issue . In December 2017 , the US declared China 's rise a military threat and launched the China containment policy by borrowing a page from Kennan 's playbook . <p> The policy extended to the tech sector as well . In 2012 , an American congressional investigation concluded that the equipment of Huawei , a Chinese tech giant , could pose a threat to US interests . Accordingly , President Obama banned companies from using Huawei 's products .

Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act in August to increase American hold on the semiconductor industry . He also launched the Chip 4 initiative involving Taiwan , Japan , and South Korea , with an express aim of keeping China out of this crucial technology . <p> The China containment policy has thus taken deep roots following Kennan 's anti-Soviet postulations . But will what worked against the Soviets also apply to China ? On the surface , there are some similarities between the two ; both are under authoritarian regimes , and both are founded on the same communist idea . But there are some striking dissimilarities too . <p> Kennan aptly noted that the Soviet leadership perceived itself at perpetual war with capitalism . The Soviets did not see the possibility of any peaceful coexistence with the capitalist world , and they persistently aimed at advancing the socialist cause . There was nothing in capitalism they could adopt . China , in sharp contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used it to its benefit . It opened up international trade and foreign investment and did everything required to take advantage of capitalism 's strengths . <p> Second , China has a long tradition of doing business with adversaries which its rich silk road history shows . As the ancient traders embarked on perilous journeys through the tribal territories in Central Asia , Chinese emperors did n't attempt to bring those territories under their total control . Instead , they made trade more attractive to the tribes than looting or war . The same game is being played today , as Beijing aggressively pushes ahead with its BRI projects . The 11,000 km long train route linking China 's Chongqing with Germany 's Duisburg , which opened in August 2012 , is carrying tens of thousands of containers each year ( currently , an alternative route is used bypassing Russia due to the Ukraine war ) . <p> Third , China is intricately connected to the international trade and economic system , making it almost impossible to isolate it without harming the global economy .

He asked for an apology from the school authorities and said he would go on a strike at the school otherwise . He further threatened the teacher by dragging him round the street with shoes around his neck -- an unimaginable insult for a teacher . <p> A Congress leader from the Hindu community at the time , Monoranjan Chowdhury , wrote a letter to Gandhi regarding this communal propaganda spread by Sarwar , and requested him to take immediate steps . He was angry that Hindus in Noakhali were switching from Congress to Hindu Mahasabha . What was n't mentioned in the letter was that the Congress leader had also made references and an allegation of Bengal Muslim leaders failing to check the communal tensions , which was featured in the local newspaper . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where , for 12 years , an agreement was in place between the two communities . This agreement stated that Hindu processions could pass in front of mosques , playing music , except during prayer hours . In 1939 , on the Bijaya Dashami Day , the local Hindus employed the agreement . But the sub-deputy collector and circle officer-in-charge wrote to Babu Rajendralal Nag , BL on October 21 , 1939 , " I consider it my duty to let you know and you are probably aware that a civil tumult may arise if music is played near the mosque at any hour on the Dashera Day . " <p> " There was a time when Indian Musselman used to listen to me , but now ( they ) regard me as their enemy number one . I worked with the Ali brothers , Azmal Khan , and many others for years . I tell you ; I am not an enemy of anybody on Earth . I am a servant of God , i.e. truth . " <p> There was an allegation about Krishak Samitis as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of inquiry to look into the cases of communal tensions and violence . In response , the then Home Minister Sir Nazimuddin insinuated that there was no precedent condition to such inquiry . He said all the issues they lamented about were false , baseless , and malicious -- an attempt was made to malign this government without any reason whatsoever . He claimed that it was a ploy of Hindu zamindars and mahajans , whose illegal exactions had been checked by the Krishak Samitis of the district . No immediate response from Gandhi was found in 1939 concerning the problem , making it more difficult to assume whether he took time to go over the letters sent from Noakhali . However , he responded by visiting the district in 1946 , indicating that he was aware of the situation and the growing differences between the two groups . To bring the community together during the riots and before partition , Gandhi travelled to Noakhali with his " peace mission , " an idea that can be used interchangeably with non-violence . <p> Noni Bala Bonik , Ramganj , Lakshimipur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Memories endure only within the social context that they were created in , with communities largely defining the conceptual structures that individuals use to recall information . The socially acquired understanding of the past is a patchwork of personal reminiscences constructed and pieced together within this social dimension ( Hayden White : 1987 ) . Thus , the relationship between memory and an understanding of history through social context is one of mutual influence , both parts greatly effecting and relying upon the other . Regarding the individual memories of Gandhi , I took oral interviews in the places Gandhi visited in 1946 . The attempt was to retrieve individual perspectives on Gandhi , which coalesced into an image . One of the people that I interviewed , Motalleb Patwary , who is now 88 years old with a round wrinkled face and a goatee , shared , " There were no places left untouched by the rioters in Chandpur . While the whole place was aflame , there were no human casualties . Immediately after the riots , the Gurkha Army first came to our area . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was calming and noble . Gandhi spoke to the mass people in a comforting tone . Nothing was out of order . He tried to make the communities understand that we , Hindus and Muslims , were brothers . There was no point of fighting each other . We were trying to drive out the British rulers ; while they were leaving , they made us fight one another . " Patwary and his maternal cousin joined Gandhi 's prayer meetings . He also added that there was no one in the village who did not attend the meetings ; everyone , young and old , was there . <p> Motalleb Patwary , Ramganj , Lakshmipur . Photo credit : Author <p> As the interview went on , Patwary also mentioned , " Everyone was waiting for him to come . There was a whole sea of people . " Despite the issue of riots which was what Gandhi was trying to address , Gandhi the individual became a hot topic in the community . Because of the poor communication system back then , the roads Gandhi travelled were renovated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An air of festivity had settled in the area . The news of his visit led to the resolution of a lot of issues . People who were forcefully converted to Islam became Hindu again . More importantly , the perpetrators of the riots went into hiding , while many of them went to apologise to the Hindus . Patwary 's experience resonates with Tofael Ahamad , who was , then , a student at Chatkhil Panchgaon Government High School . He wrote in his book , " ' Let 's go see Gandhi , ' saying this , we ran " Mahatma Gandhi in Bangladesh ( East Bengal ) , Dhaka : Panchgaon Prokashoni , 1992 , P. 1-5 . He further described that it was not more than a quarter of a mile from his house where Gandhi came -- a 10-minute walking distance . His aura was powerful , and it seemed like Ahmad needed to see him and attend his meeting . Even though he did n't like who Gandhi was and why he came , he still felt an urge to see him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opinions , alleging him of downplaying the cause of the Muslims , who were victimised by the communal riots in Bihar that erupted immediately after the violence in Noakhali . However , Gandhi intended to heal the communal scars in the Muslim society in Noakhali . <p> Noni Bala Bonik was protected by her Muslim neighbours . She was 90 at the time of the interview , but had sharp and detailed memories on Gandhi . She recalled , " Gandhi came like a messenger and set up some temporary camps . I attended his prayer meetings twice and received chocolates . " For Noni Bala and other Hindus , Gandhi appeared like a saviour after the riots , as everyone assumed that since he was around , nobody would have the courage to unleash violence again . After Gandhi 's assassination , Noni Bala and her family members lived in anxiety for days fearing that riots may break out again . But nothing happened . <p> Whatever the Hindu or Muslim positions were in Noakhali seven decades ago , Gandhi was able to bring the community together . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The principal of Chaumani College , Tafazzal Husain , equated Gandhi with a prophet . Gandhi wrote a letter to Husain and shared his emotion .

I tell you ; I am not an enemy of anybody on Earth . I am a servant of God , i.e. truth . I shall stick to this job till I die , or someone kills me ( Smritikana ( Bits of Memory ) ( Dhaka : 1978 ) , P. 83 ) " His statement revealed the internal conflict he had been going through before the partition . He wanted to return to Noakhali after the partition and spend the rest of his life with the Muslim community . More importantly , he compared riots with cancer , which needed to heal before it spread to the whole body of Indian polity . He said prevention was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set an example of communal harmony for the entire Indian subcontinent . <p> Gandhi Monument at Joyag , Noakhali . <p> Gandhi 's monument <p> The Gandhi Ashram Trust , a philanthropic organisation in Noakhali , built a monument to convey Mahatma Gandhi 's legacy and memories to the next generation . One can see the 20-foot , white stone sculpture of Gandhi standing upon a plinth and welcoming visitors . He is shown holding a walking stick in one hand , his other hand gently at his side . The statue is surrounded by a gorgeous garden of all sorts of trees and foliage . The image is simple and inviting , while still conveying the power of Gandhi 's presence . It was built to commemorate Gandhi and the history of riots in Noakhali . This monument connects us to the history and power of resistance to violence as well as a willingness to reject riots . It always sparks a conversation among people and a broader public image which unites the community . <p> A monument is the embodiment of memories , a place bridging different generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , it is a constant dialogue between past and present , based upon which we can make decisions for the future . Gandhi 's monument in Noakhali reveals the past to which we belong and how to learn from it . It also speaks to the community 's crisis , trauma , and grief . Gandhi 's legacy will continue in Noakhali through his monument , and let people understand the flag of peace he sailed with on his journey throughout Noakhali . <p> Parvez Rahaman is a PhD candidate at Middle Tennessee State University in the US .

But then the forest department removed those flags since no prior clearance was taken from them . This is where things get tricky . Forest officials say the land is part of a protected forest . Prison officials , however , say it is khas land . It can be both and yet retain its distinct character .

The latter , despite being granted a " living entity " status by the High Court and having the National River Protection Commission assigned as their " legal guardian , " continue to be in dire straits . With protectors like these , who needs predators ? <p> The forest department may appear to be on the right side of things for once , but its history is equally tainted . Note its line of argument in case of the Ukhiya incident .

" That 's a BIG minimum , as revealed by an internal estimate , which said that 30,000 trees will have to be felled for the construction of the centre . Last year , the land ministry , a frequent violator of forest conservation rules and directives , also allotted 700 acres of a forest adjacent to the Cox 's Bazar-Teknaf Marine Drive to the public administration ministry to build a civil service academy there . <p> Could these projects be taken elsewhere ?

What we are witnessing here is an environmental free-fall with forests being encroached by the very people/agencies whose responsibility it is to prevent it . This is being done mostly through what we can call illegally legal means , such as " de-reserving " part of a reserved forest , keeping the option for decriminalising a takeover through " proper procedure , " leasing out forestland , etc . And it 's happening at a time when the reserved forests in Cox 's Bazar have been facing a great onslaught , with more than 7,000 acres of forestland already razed to the ground by refugees in Ukhiya and Teknaf . Not to be outdone by their official counterparts , illegal encroachers also sliced away more than 50,000 acres of a total of 186,457 acres of reserved forests across the coastal region . <p> There are precious few forests left in Bangladesh .

This amounts to over 8 percent of the city 's annual labour output , and unless measures are taken to reduce global warming , this number could rise to 10 percent by 2050 . <p> While there are other cities that are more exposed to heat stress , Dhaka is especially vulnerable due to its labour-intensive economy and low rate of active cooling . <p> Out of the 12 cities compared in the study , the situation in Dhaka is the worst .

The study found that in sectors such as garment manufacturing , transport , and retail trade , where wages can be lower than average , losses from heat stress already amount to around 10 percent of income .

Losing it is Russia 's largest battlefield loss since Ukraine 's lightning counteroffensive in the northeastern Kharkiv region last month . <p> Serhiy Gaidai , governor of the Luhansk region that neighbours Donetsk , said control over Lyman could prove a " key factor " in helping Ukraine reclaim lost territory in his region , whose full capture Moscow announced in early July after weeks of grinding advances . <p> Britain 's Ministry of Defence described Lyman as operationally important as it commanded a key road crossing over the Siverskyi Donets River @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defences . <p> Russia likely experienced heavy casualties during the withdrawal , the ministry said in a statement . Russia had 5,000 to 5,500 troops in the city before the Ukrainian attack , a spokesperson for Ukraine 's eastern forces said on Saturday . <p> The areas Putin claimed as annexed - the Donbas regions of Donetsk and Luhansk plus Kherson and Zaporizhzhia in the south - form a swath of territory equal to about 18 percent of Ukraine 's total surface land area . <p> " Over the past week , the number of Ukrainian flags in Donbas has increased . There will be even more a week 's time , " Zelensky said on Saturday in an evening address . <p> The battlefield setbacks have triggered a fresh wave of criticism within Russia of how its military operation is being handled . Britain 's defence ministry said that was likely to intensify with further setbacks , reports Reuters . <p> The United States , whose military aid is widely seen as crucial to the counteroffensive successes , hailed the latest Ukrainian gain . <p> " We 're very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said on Saturday , telling a news conference that Lyman 's capture would create new problems for Russia 's military . <p> Austin noted that Lyman was positioned across supply lines that Russia has used to push its troops and material down to the south and to the west , as the Kremlin presses its more than seven-month-long invasion of Ukraine . <p> " Without those routes , it will be more difficult . So it presents a sort of a dilemma for the Russians going forward . " <p> Pope Francis yesterday made an impassioned appeal to Putin to stop " this spiral of violence and death " in Ukraine , saying the crisis there was risking a nuclear escalation with uncontrollable global consequences .

Photo : Carlo Allegri/Reuters <p> Making the United Nations Security Council ( UNSC ) more representative , inclusive , and transparent is a hot topic that is being discussed all around the world . The Atlantic Charter was established in 1941 by the United States and Great Britain in response to Nazi Germany 's invasion of Europe during World War II . In a sense , this document was essentially a step forward in the establishment of the United Nations . Representatives from 50 nations gathered in San Francisco in 1945 and decided to draft the UN Charter which was formally adopted on June 26 , 1945 , with a resolute determination to avert war and uphold international peace , stability , and security . However , in practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> A significant barrier in that regard has been the veto power of the UNSC 's permanent members . Any resolution criticising Israel 's misdeeds are blocked by the United States . On the other hand , China is applying its veto power to protect Myanmar from taking effective measures in resolving the Rohingya crisis . Given the circumstances , many countries are discussing the need to restructure the UN , particularly through the expansion of its Security Council . <p> The " Security Council " consists of five permanent and 10 non-permanent members from among the 193 member countries of the UN . The winners of WW2 -- the US , UK , Russia , China , and France -- were granted veto power in the UNSC . A UN bill or resolution is void if any of these five nations exercise their veto power . The power can also be used to send military forces or impose sanctions on nations . The primary duty of the council is to safeguard global peace and security . But the veto power of its permanent members has gotten in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-permanent members are chosen every two years , the decisions of the permanent members are regarded as final -- since permanent member countries have the veto power , which the non-permanent members do n't . <p> It is undeniable that the Security Council has failed to act timely in regards to various global crises , while carrying out the mandate given to it to settle disputes through peaceful means . Moreover , the veto-wielding nations have been abusing the UN to further their own agendas . <p> The Security Council recently failed to come up with an effective solution to the Rohingya crisis , despite widespread global support for the Rohingyas . China and Russia , the two UN permanent members , supported Myanmar for their own political and economic interests . As of yet , no legal action has been taken against Myanmar for committing genocide against the Rohingya . The Council 's unwillingness to act has emboldened the Myanmar military to commit even more crimes . Again , in spite of Israel 's aggression in the Palestinian territories and the continuous violation of human rights in the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agree to take effective action . <p> Article 39 of the UN Charter expressly forbids aggressive war . However , the US invaded Iraq in 2003 without the UN 's approval and overthrew Saddam 's regime , which was a violation of the UN Charter . Additionally , the US and UK launched airstrikes in Libya in 2011 under the pretext of " interference in the protection of human rights . " Gaddafi was overthrown after the attack , and Libya is now essentially a failed state . In Syria , similar grievances have been raised . And Russia has recently invaded Ukraine , which the UN failed to prevent . These instances only show that a country 's violation of UN policy increases with its power . <p> The continent of Europe only makes up 6.6 percent of the world 's total land area . Nevertheless , they are represented by 60 percent of the Security Council ( three countries are permanent members ) . Twenty percent and 12 percent of the world 's land respectively are in Africa and South America , yet neither continent has a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a representation rate of under 20 percent , while having more than 60 percent of the world 's population . Despite the fact that geographic and regional participation is crucial in many UN forums , it is missing in the UNSC . <p> Since two-thirds of the General Assembly and all Security Council members would need to agree to any reform , increasing the number of permanent members would be challenging . However , given the current state of the world , it is now necessary to either reform the UNSC or increase the number of its permanent members . <p> On September 17 , 1974 , Bangladesh became the 136th member of the United Nations . Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina said during the 77th session of the UN General Assembly that other institutional structures , including the UN , needed to undergo practical and essential reforms . Bangladesh , however , has not yet expressed a clear position on what those reforms should be . <p> In that regard , Bangladesh must consider the fact that the Rohingya crisis has repeatedly stumbled due to the veto power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Rohingya issue . But they have not been put into practice . So , Bangladesh needs to find out how reforming the UN may lead to a mechanism that allows for the demands of the UN General Assembly to be met . <p> Seven and a half decades after the establishment of the UN , reforming the UNSC would be a sensible and necessary move to balance the geopolitics of the modern era . How can the UN talk about democracy and equal rights in every country , if there is no representation of global public opinion or equal rights in the UN itself ?

The sudden increase of " gym bros " on social media , coupled with the abundance of free time during the COVID-19 pandemic , have inadvertently contributed to the rising popularity of gym culture . <p> While that is n't necessarily a bad thing , it also begs the question -- are these people joining the gym for the right reasons ? <p> For a comparative , fair analysis of this argument , the criteria for the " right " reasons need to be defined first .

" I used to be constantly worried about how other people perceived me . Naturally , I thought that working out would help me climb out of that cycle of self-hatred . " <p> Furthermore , chasing an ideal body type in order to meet the requirements of conventional attractiveness is an extremely common phenomenon , especially among teenagers and young adults . Subconsciously , even the supposed educated subset of the population has a hardwired image of what the ideal body should look like . This sentiment has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major media fitting the tall , lean , and muscular ideal . <p> Prathom Mitra , a 17-year-old student , shared , " A big chunk of my newsfeed consists of reels and videos from muscular influencers and bodybuilders who set unrealistic body standards . Not only did this make me more insecure about my appearance and posture , but it also essentially cemented the idea that our outward appearance reflects our self-worth . " <p> Besides being pushed by influencers on social media , for many , peer pressure played a large role in their decision to join the gym . Their acquaintances and friends , not for malicious reasons but to encourage their friend to share the experience , propelled them into the act . Having also recognised going to the gym to be a bonding experience of sorts , many felt the need to join the gym to avoid feeling alienated . <p> Abdullah Bin Hashem , 23 , reflected , " Most of my friends started working out before me and consistently insisted that I join them as well . Although it was n't particularly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communal experiences swayed my decision in that direction . " <p> Now , one could argue that , although these intentions do not fit in an entirely white area , if the desired results are ultimately attained , there is n't any harm done . However , a perfect outcome like this is rarely achieved . <p> Working out is an arduous process that warrants discipline , hard work , and a lot of time . This is why taking the social media craze or your peers ' words at face value is n't the wisest decision . Influencers usually highlight the end result as desirable without a detailed outline of the demanding routine that is associated with creating a healthy gym plan . This causes many people to believe that they can achieve results over a very short course of time or without pouring in much effort . <p> When inevitably faced with the inaccuracy of this belief , one of two things is likely to happen . On one hand , they might lose their patience and give up on their endeavours completely . Or , even worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they feel they lost by doubling their efforts and pushing their body to their absolute limits . <p> The first option leaves you feeling even worse about yourself than when you started out . Since you now feel that no matter what you do , you can never reach the bar that you or others have set for you . The second path is incredibly harmful and destructive to one 's physical well-being , as over-exerting yourself could lead to muscle fatigue , cramps , aches and tiredness . <p> There also exist those individuals who work towards their ideal goal and once they are satisfied with their body , they eventually lose the spark and trail off . This loss of their resolve to work as hard as they once did will inevitably lead to all their effort going down in vain . Once they realise that they are reverting back to the body that they had before , these people are likely to feel even more demotivated . <p> Khalid Ahmed* , third-year undergraduate student at BRAC University , shares a similar fate , as he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

What started out as a tale of two geniuses with an interesting hook eventually grew into one of the most popular and emotional character-driven stories in the industry . <p> Written and drawn by veteran author Aka Akasaka , Kaguya-sama : Love is War is a romantic-comedy manga series . The titular character , Kaguya Shinomiya , is a rich , sheltered , and prodigious young girl whose most formidable opponent is Miyuki Shirogane , an academic powerhouse . After working in the student council together , the two proud and naive teenagers engage in an all-out battle of wits to make the other confess their love before they graduate high school . <p> This wacky premise works brilliantly in favour of the author because it is essentially one big comedic progression .

Characters like Fujiwara , Ishigami , Iino , etc. have clashing personalities , hobbies , and ideals , but their dynamic feels organic because they are all fundamentally the same -- hormonal high school teenagers . <p> They experience love , growth , and the chaos around them in different ways , but contemplate their interpersonal relationships critically .

Throughout the series , their values are confronted , their past is brought up , and they are pushed to take the initiative to spark change . Through this process , the audience can fully invest themselves in the story and characters . <p> On the flip side , the series ' romance is somewhat of a slow burner .
