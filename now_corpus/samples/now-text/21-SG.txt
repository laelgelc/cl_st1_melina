The discussion today is still on safe-to-dispose , not even on circularity yet . We had been in this state for the last 15 to 30 years .

In comparison , I think the food packaging industry is really not trying . <p> If you picture the whole value chain from material manufacturing , distribution to disposal , it is one with a fixed amount of profits . TRIA has taken it forward with extended producer responsibility ( EPR ) , where the waste is collected back . Many businesses are strongly resisting EPR due to the additional cost for collection .

There is business resistance to do so simply because this will mean a structural change to the value chain , along with costs and hassle , and change is not always welcomed by everyone . <h> How will you convince other innovators to take up the circular economy challenge ? <p> We need the best of minds to solve this problem . There are a lot of talented people out there but sustainability may not be the most attractive industry to get into . I 'm comparing it to consumer electronics , where there is the adrenaline rush of new gadgets coming out and the tech world is able to attract amazing talent . <p> We really need to create that appeal in sustainability .

I have not seen a Singapore company accused of bribery through third parties confirm that it audits the third parties it uses . <p> Having a code of conduct is only the first step to any effective anti-bribery and compliance programme . Even the existence of a robust compliance function can not guarantee that bribery will not occur , especially if the company has aggressive sales targets and incentive compensation closely linked to individual sales targets , and operates in industries or countries with high levels of corruption . <p> We have weak enforcement of our anti-corruption laws overseas , unlike some developed countries , which have strengthened their anti-bribery laws and enforcement in overseas jurisdictions . <p> Further , there is no concept of corporate liability when employees or third parties pay bribes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oversee a corporate environment that is weak in curbing corruption . <p> Singapore is also not one of the 41 signatories to the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention aimed at combating bribery of foreign public officials in international business transactions .

Given these factors , when bribery allegations about Singapore companies surface , I tend not to dismiss them outright . <p> In a recent case , overseas media reports said a leaked confidential memo from an overseas company accused of being a middleman in a massive bribery scandal commented that the Singapore company that was allegedly involved was an " ideal client " because it had lax anti-corruption controls , relative to other multinational clients . <p> However , it has become evident that even if our regulators do not take enforcement actions overseas , Singapore companies may be exposed indirectly through investigations by overseas regulators of foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if no enforcement actions against Singapore companies result from such investigations because of jurisdictional issues or because the Singapore companies are not the main targets of investigation , their involvement causes reputational harm and potential loss of future business opportunities , which are likely to affect their long-term profitability .

Perhaps not . <p> Telegram has largely marketed itself as a more secure messaging service that would stay away from monetising private chats . <p> Founder and CEO of Telegram Pavel Durov delivers a keynote speech during the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona , Spain February 23 , 2016 . REUTERS/Albert Gea <p> Pavel Durov , one of the co-founders of the app recently stated : <p> We will never force you to view 30-second ads on Telegram . If we ever introduce ads , the ads will be shown only in large one-to-many channels which are expensive to run due to server and traffic costs ... and not targeted based on any private data ( unlike Facebook ) . So , no collecting private data , no user profiling etc .

As server and traffic costs go up , Telegram and other platforms might need to consider measures to keep their business intact . <p> Would Telegram or Signal really never monetise users ' chats ? Perhaps that wo n't happen tomorrow , but who knows what the technological landscape looks like in five years ? <p> We forget a 2012 WhatsApp blog post laid out why the creators Jan Kaoum &amp; Brian Acton do n't sell ads on the platform . But it seems all promises were broken when they were bought by Facebook for US$19 billion in 2014 and subsequently rolled out terms of services that legitimised the use of private data for ads . <p> On this business front , WhatsApp 's ability to monetise business account chats may largely be driven by its user base . <p> It is currently the largest messaging service with over 2 billion monthly active users . Telegram in contrast has approximately only one-fifth of the user base ( of about 400 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active users . <p> The large user base of WhatsApp makes it a feasible ground for advertising . <p> The other thing to keep in mind is that question of security : Are Telegram and Signal really safer for your private data than WhatsApp ? You may be surprised . <p> Unlike WhatsApp , Telegram 's chats are not end-to-end encrypted by default . To enable that function , users must start a " secret chat " . Your chats will be stored on Telegram 's local servers otherwise . <p> FILE PHOTO : The Signal messaging app logo is seen on a smartphone , in front of the same displayed same logo , in this illustration taken , January 13 , 2021 .

The location tracking could work even if the call is not answered . <p> Telegram and Signal may have fixed these specific bugs , but the breaches suggest that new apps can be vulnerable , especially at the onset . <p> Even if such flaws are exposed and resolved , more transparent information is needed so that users can compare different platforms and find the one best suited for their needs . <p> MINDING THE DIGITAL LITERACY GAP <p> In summary , corporates are accountable to their stakeholders to show profits based on the free services they provide to billions of their users worldwide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This online ecosystem is bought and paid for with our personal data .

@@42671231 <p> These arrests have caused public outrage no less because those arrested were students who have not otherwise run afoul of the law and who were peacefully standing up for an issue that is close to their hearts . They were shining a spotlight on inequality and had ( as video footage would show ) not caused any violence , trouble or disturbance . In fact , no one was even paying much attention apart from the plainclothes policemen and members of the press . <p> To the casual observer , it may therefore seem ridiculous that the police even bothered to intervene ( with more than ten police officers on the scene within minutes ) especially when Minister for Law and Home Affairs , K Shanmugam ( Shanmugam ) had said that the police were so overstretched in Parliament . <p> However , in accordance with the Public Order Act ( the Act ) enacted in 2009 and propounded by Shanmugam himself , as ridiculous as it seems , the students have prima facie broken the law and the police do have a right to intervene ( see below ) . <p> The question , however , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not it intended to penalise upstanding and harmless students in this case ? <p> WHAT IS A PUBLIC ASSEMBLY WITHOUT A PERMIT ? <p> Public assemblies in Singapore are regulated under the Act , and organising or participating in a public assembly without a Police permit is illegal . The Act defines " Assembly " as a gathering or meeting of persons for any of the following purposes : <p> to demonstrate support for or opposition to the views or actions of any **25;3274;TOOLONG ; <p> to publicise a cause or campaign ; or <p> to make or commemorate any event . <p> The Act also states that a demonstration by a single person can also constitute an Assembly or Procession ( a march , parade , or other procession gathered at a place of assembly to move from that place substantially as a body of persons for any of the abovementioned purposes . What makes a Procession different from an Assembly is the movement from the place of assembly " by a common route " by those participating in the Procession . ) A marked difference from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persons or more . <p> According to the Act , " Public " is very widely defined to mean any place to which members of the public have access to by right or virtue , regardless of payment or time restrictions ; or a place that the occupier has allowed members of the public to enter . <p> The Act requires any person wanting to Assemble Publicly to apply for a Permit , this applies to even an assembly by one person . <p> Permits for Assemblies and Processions will not be granted if the police believe that the event may : <p> cause public disorder or damage to public/private property ; <p> create a public nuisance ; <p> give rise to an obstruction in any public road ; <p> place the safety of any person in jeopardy ; <p> cause feelings of enmity , hatred , ill-will or hostility between different groups in Singapore ; <p> induce others to commit acts of terrorism ; <p> be held within or enter a prohibited area ; or <p> be directed towards a political end with involvement from non-Singaporean persons/entities . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are permitted to arrest participants of an illegal assembly or procession ( public assembly or procession without a valid permit ) even without a warrant . However , they also have the alternative of issuing participant(s) with a direction to move on ( Move On Order ) if the officer is above the rank of a sergeant . <p> THE HISTORY BEHIND THE ACT <p> When the Act was first mooted by Shanmugam , he had said that he wanted to ensure that adequate space for an individual 's right to expression is balanced against society 's need for order and stability . <p> Theoretically , this makes complete sense . But if one takes a deeper look at the political landscape of the time , one could surmise that the Act was less about balance but more about Government control . <p> Notably , a number of Members of Parliament stood to voice their concern and objection to how the law was tabled during the second reading of the bill . <p> Ms Sylvia Lim who was a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament back in 2009 said then , <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ procession " is more disturbing . As the Explanatory Statement to the Bill says , these words are no longer restricted to gatherings of five persons or more . This means even one person alone can constitute illegal assembly , thus giving the State complete control over an individual citizen 's freedoms . <p> First , to say that one person constitutes an assembly is certainly an abuse of the word . Secondly , is the Government making the change because there had been incidents involving less than five persons which had disrupted public life ? Unless there is compelling evidence to prove to us that expanding the definition of assembly and procession is needed , this expansion does not deserve our support . <p> In response , Shanmugam said , " Having a threshold creates an artificial numerical criterion which can lead to a cat-and-mouse game with the Police . This distracts the Police from their responsibility to secure the safety and security of the event . We debate in this House with the often implicit assumption that people behave reasonably . But the unfortunate truth is that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farcical antics outside there and the law has to deal with that . If one is too low a number , what number should be chosen ? Five ? Four ? Three ? Different countries have different regulatory regimes for outdoor activities . There are countries which have regimes similar to ours and with a threshold of three persons but it is better for us simply to focus on the effect of the activities . " <p> He used an incident which involved then 23-year-old artist Seelan Palay who staged a hunger strike outside the Malaysian Embassy in the well-heeled Tanglin district of Singapore from 31 December 2007 for five days . He was protesting against the detention of five Hindraf organisers who were arrested under the ISA in Malaysia . <p> In 2007 , a couple of activists had attempted to enter the vicinity of the Shangri-La Hotel to draw awareness to democratic rights in Myanmar at the 2007 ASEAN Summit which was held there . A group of Myanmese students had also put up a banner along Orchard Road for a few minutes before police officers told them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious that the police may not easily arrest these protesters even it wanted to as the Minister pointed out that they were gathered in groups of four . <p> Former Nominated Member of Parliament , Prof Thio Lee Ann said then : " We are not hermits but citizens who share a common space . Rights carry responsibilities . Article 29(2) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states that rights such as peaceful assembly are subject to legal limitations designed to secure " recognition of the rights of others " and to meet " the just requirements of morality , public order and the general welfare in a democratic society . " and questioned , " Has the Public Order Bill managed to strike a happy equilibrium where rights are meaningfully enjoyed rather than illusory ? " <p> Pointing out that the Bill confers broad discretionary powers on the Minister , Commissioner and Police which curtail rights of expression , assembly and personal liberty , through arrest and move-on powers and asked if the Bill provide clear guidance on how to exercise discretion so as to avoid arbitrariness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how widely the Act is drafted against the above said examples and how it has been used over the past years , it is not unreasonable to surmise that the Act was enacted to give the police the power to take swift action against anything that it may deem undesirable . <p> In what way have the three students in this case affected stability or order ? <p> It is clear that no public property was destroyed , no noise was generated and there was absolutely no threat of violence whatsoever . There was no incitement of violence and no signs of escalation . They were merely holding placards that stated their opinions on the matter . <p> If we went back to basics , the right balance of individual expression and society 's right to stability and order is to leave the students be , unmolested because the fact of the matter is that society was completely unaffected by the students . <p> By contrast , in arresting the students , you are penalising the students for the potentially unfounded speculation that society 's stability would be disturbed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfairly shifted to favour the speculative value of society over the individual 's right to expression and without basis too . <p> The students have claimed their right to express themselves and society has not been harmed . Going back to Shanmugam 's ethos behind the Act , surely the students have not upset the balance at all ! <p> Is the Act intended to catch incidences like this ? Or has the Government placed its need for speculative control over the individual 's right to expression ( and especially on incidences of inequality such as this ? ) . <p> Furthermore , as Terry Xu has shown in his recent application to obtain a legal permit to protest , the Police Commissioner does not seem to exercise any discretion in denying application for an assembly for cause . Making it impossible for the students to obtain a permit to have done what they did in the first place . <p> What these arrests have shown is that the said original intent of the Act may have been lost as a result of it being drafted far too widely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original intentions , surely the Government ought to revisit the issue ? <p> After all , it bears remembering that before the Act was passed , it is enshrined in the Constitution under article 14 that the individual 's right to expression is sacrosanct . <h> Share this : <p> When you login first time using a Social Login button , we collect your account public profile information shared by Social Login provider , based on your privacy settings .

@@42671235 <p> During the Watch Art Grand Exhibition held in 2019 in Singapore , visitors from across the region bore witness to the brand 's precious museum pieces and extraordinary creations . 2020 was a year Patek Philippe reasserted its authority yet again with a slew of high complications . The Ref. 5303R-001 Minute Repeater , Ref. 5370P-011 Split-Seconds Chronograph and Ref. 5270J-001 Perpetual Calendar Chronograph were all exceptional watches in their respective domain . <p> Saving the best for last , Patek Philippe unveiled the Ref. 6301P Grande Sonnerie separately in November . The significance of which is that the grand complication is the manufacture 's first grande sonnerie wristwatch in its purest form -- focusing solely on acoustics . And while a grande sonnerie strikes the full hours and quarter hours automatically , the Ref. 6301P Grande Sonnerie is further complemented with a petite sonnerie ( no striking of the quarter hours ) and a minute repeater ( striking on demand ) . All these mechanisms culminate in a watch that is exceedingly complex . <p> " For the case , this new Ref. 6301 in platinum adopts the design vocabulary of the Ref. 5370 with countersunk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement of this Ref. 6301 is a modification of the calibre for the Grandmaster Chime with dials on both sides . Therefore , the calibre can also be seen from the bridge side , " says head of watch development Philip Barat . <p> The foundation of the Ref. 6301 was laid in 2014 . The momentous year saw Patek Philippe unveil the Grandmaster Chime Ref. 5175 composed of five distinctive strike works : grande sonnerie , petite sonnerie , minute repeater , alarm and date repeater . It was one of the most intricate wristwatches ever assembled by Patek Philippe , as well as the brand 's first-ever grande sonnerie wristwatch . <p> According to Barat , they wanted to perpetuate the complications of the Grandmaster Chime by proposing a grande sonnerie . <p> Apart from the customary hour and minute hands , the Ref. 6301 features patented jumping seconds -- meaning the seconds hand does n't glide like that of a common mechanical watch but ticks once every second . " This is a special feature , " Barat continues , " the mechanism was derived from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2014 , to celebrate the 175th anniversary ( of Patek Philippe ) . " <p> Due to the nature of the watch , two power reserve indicators are fitted onto the Ref. 6301 -- one at 9 o'clock for the going train with 72 hours , the other at 3 o'clock for the strike work with 24 hours . To simplify the experience of wearing the watch , the Ref. 6301 is equipped with a two-position crown . In position zero , turning clockwise the crown winds the going train barrel , while the anti-clockwise motion winds the strike work . Pulling the crown into position one helps adjust the hands . <p> " As in the Grandmaster Chime , the pusher that triggers the minute repeater is integrated in the crown . We see the selector switch for the strike work at 6 o'clock . On the left , it selects the petite sonnerie mode . In the middle , the petite sonnerie ; and on the right , the silence mode , " explains Barat . <p> " For this functionality , we use the two patented selection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch that allows the selection of the three strike work modes , and in the silence mode , uncouples the strike work from the going train , which totally eliminates unnecessary power consumption . " <p> At the heart of the watch is the manual-wound GS 36-750 PS IRM calibre derived from the calibre 300 used in the Grandmaster Chime . Convoluted is an understatement when describing the movement . Counting 703 parts , the movement somehow remains relatively thin at 7.5mm and only 37mm in width . Faithful to tradition , the movement is finished superbly . Each part however miniscule is artfully conceived . <p> " Particular attention was paid to the design of the bridges , as evidenced by the balance curvatures , the many acute re-entrantangles , and the balance bridge for technical and aesthetic reasons has two attachment points . The bridge in the form of a Calatrava Cross , which ordinarily protects the centrifugal governor of the minute repeater now holds the fusee -- the motor of the grande sonnerie , so to speak . The engravings on the wheels are gold plated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Barat . <p> " A sapphire crystal reveals the entire movement , including the ballet of the three striking hammers and the centrifugal governor . Now we can appreciate the acceleration and deceleration of the centrifugal governor , which regulates the speed of the strike work . " <p> As a bonus , the watch is also delivered with an interchangeable solid caseback . Although the uniqueness of the watch lies with its range of strike work , the dial leverages Patek Philippe 's expertise in artisanship and rare handcrafts . In grand feu black enamel with glazed finish , the dial is decorated with applied Breguet numerals and white gold leaf- shaped hands in white gold , with luminescent coating . <p> " Like all platinum models by Patek Philippe , a diamond adorns the case band . This Ref. 6301 has one at 12 o'clock as an exception , " says Barat , pointing out that the usual position for the diamond at 6 o'clock has been to be moved to accommodate the strike mode selector . <p> Now comes the all-important question : Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , but that tells only half the story . <p> " The grande sonnerie mechanism is the most difficult to master , " insists Barat . " The watchmaker assembles the entire movement , regulates it and chooses the sound . Finally , the watchmaker controls the movement and encases it . " <p> Leading up to the launch , a special workshop had to be created to prepare watchmakers for the production . Before they are deemed qualified , they must have had several years of production experience , as well as in the minute repeater workshop . <p> " We are talking about five years minimum . This is followed by about six months of training to master the assembly of the movement and the casing process . It takes several years for the watchmaker to be able to work independently on this movement , " says Barat . <p> " This is not enough to be a good watchmaker ; total immersion is needed to understand its entire finesse and complexity , and toassure its optimum dependability .

However , the removal of any system will require Parliament 's approval . <p> Advertisement <p> Eighteen Members of Parliament ( MPs ) from the People 's Action Party ( PAP ) and the opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PAP MPs , who spoke in support of the Bill , stressed the need for the police to have all tools at its disposal , especially when investigating serious crimes . Some also asked if the police 's use of contact tracing data could be expanded to more categories of crimes . <p> MP Christopher de Souza ( PAP-Holland-Bukit Timah ) , who sits on the Government Parliamentary Committee for Home Affairs and Law , said Singapore faces " real " threats and the Bill should be supported to achieve the greater aim of containing a pandemic and the " ancillary consequence " of fighting crimes . <p> He described the use of TraceTogether data for only drug offences that carry a death sentence as " overly restrictive " , adding that he would have preferred it to be extended to all types of drug trafficking offences <p> Mr Vikram Nair ( PAP-Sembawang ) , who described the Bill as a " compromise " , noted his reservations about crimes that currently do not fall under the list of serious offences , such as violence not amounting to grievous bodily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Punggol ) asked if the minister would consider including crimes or offences against children under the age 14 or vulnerable persons under the categories of serious offences . <p> " Information that may assist in investigations , even if it 's remotely helpful , should be made available to the police , " he said . " Let this be the only time where we limit access to information for our police force in the pursuit of justice . " <p> In response , Minister of State for Home Affairs Desmond Tan said that while he agreed the data would be useful , the Government had to " make a judgment call " between public health and public safety . <p> He added that outrage of modesty and other crimes committed against vulnerable persons are of grave concern to the police , but they rank below the seven specified categories in seriousness . <p> " This was a very tough balancing act for the Ministry of Home Affairs , " he said . " Nonetheless , I would like to assure members that the police will continue to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven categories of serious offences . " <p> Addressing questions on safeguards in place when it comes to the police 's access to the data , Mr Tan said requests for data can only be made by senior police officers with the rank of inspector and above . <p> He noted that this is the same standard of requirement when the police request for bank data from financial institutions . <p> Other safeguards include how requests for any contact tracing data by the police will have to be approved by the Criminal Investigation Department , Mr Tan told the House . <p> TRADE OFF IN PUBLIC TRUST <p> The issue of whether the Government 's handling of this matter had eroded public trust was raised by some MPs , such as PSP 's Mr Leong . <p> Noting how the police already has " broad powers " under the CPC to access documents , computers and decryption data for investigations , Mr Leong questioned " how much is the incremental benefit for a set of data that exist only for 25 days " . <p> " The PSP is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " But to trade off public trust in public health measures , which must be of utmost priority in a pandemic crisis , for public safety in which we are already strong ... calls into question the judgment to make such a trade-off . " <p> Mr Xie Yao Quan ( PAP-Jurong ) said trust was the " lynchpin " in every layer of the country 's fight against the pandemic and exempting TraceTogether data from police investigations was " the surest way " to maintain this trust . <p> " This is why personally , I would much prefer - much prefer - that the Government maintains what it had communicated at the outset , and completely exempts TraceTogether data from Criminal Procedure Code provisions . " <p> Mr Xie added that he was initially concerned about how Singaporeans would take to the recent turn in events , but was " relieved to observe " the desire and level of participation in TraceTogether remained high . <p> Residents in his constituency have also told him that they recognised the Government 's " practical and calibrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain crimes , he said . <p> Mr Gerald Giam ( WP-Aljunied ) said that the recent events may " make many Singaporeans more wary of taking Government statements at face value " . <p> " Some may now adopt Ronald Reagan 's adage - trust but verify " , " he said . <p> On public trust and its impact on public participation in TraceTogether , Dr Balakrishnan said at least 350 individuals had written in to request their TraceTogether data be deleted over the past one month . <p> " Every one of the 350 who has requested us to delete is a source of regret for me , " he said in his wrap-up speech for the debate . <p> But on the other hand , more than 390,000 people have come on board the TraceTogether programme . <p> " I do n't want to belabor this but my simple conclusion or inference is that Singaporeans know that I misspoke but they also trust the TraceTogether system is safe , " said the minister . <p> " It does what it is supposed to do . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always behave lawfully . " <p> " BLINDSIDED " <p> Dr Balakrishnan , in the same speech , also provided a timeline of when he realised that Section 20 of the CPC applied to TraceTogether data . <p> The minister had said in June last year that TraceTogether data would only be used for contact tracing . <p> Dr Balakrishnan noted that his statement in June last year could be attributed to the design of the TraceTogether app , which prioritised privacy and was not a " surveillance tool " . <p> " But what I said in June was wrong , because , in a sense , my own enthusiasm for the technology blindsided me , " he said , adding that he did not read Section 20 of the CPC and took " full responsibility " for the error . <p> The minister went on to say he started to realise what he said was wrong near the end of October , when he was asked by a member of the public if the CPC would not apply to TraceTogether data " even for a murder case " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked my staff , ' Please go and double check ' , " he said . <p> Then in November amid " sleepless nights " , Dr Balakrishnan said he engaged in several rounds of discussion with senior Cabinet colleagues on whether and how contact tracing data should be carved out from being used under the CPC . <p> This was followed by Mr de Souza filing a Parliamentary question in December regarding the use of TraceTogether data under the CPC . This question was answered at the next sitting in January , leading to the initial spate of privacy concerns . <p> " I 'm sharing this with you so that you understand that there is nothing to hide . The CPC is written law , " Dr Balakrishnan said . " But I should have been aware , and I should have made it clear right from the onset . " <p> Giving his take on how trust can be maintained when a mistake has been made , the minister said : " Acknowledge the error , take full responsibility , and I have done so . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choosing the politically expedient option , " he added . " I believe in transparency , even if transparency is awkward and politically costly . But it is better to be transparent than to double down on a mistake . " <p> Dr Balakrishnan also said that the Government will accept a suggestion from Ms Nadia Ahmad Samdin ( PAP-Ang Mo Kio ) to publish a disclosure report on how personal contact tracing data has been used . <p> " My team will work out the details on how often and the content of these reports , but it should broadly encompass the types of data , how the data was used , as well as the number of occasions that the data has been used for purposes other from contact tracing from the day that this Act comes into force , " the minister told the House . <p> Addressing questions from Ms Nadia and Mr Giam on when digital contact tracing systems will be deactivated and what the criteria for determining this is , Dr Balakrishnan said this relates to the wider question of determining changing points in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be guided by science and public health " . <p> " We will monitor the overall situation closely - consider all relevant factors before adjusting our measures as we have in the last one year , with our three phases of reopening since the circuit breaker . " <p> Adding that " there is no standard playbook " for Singapore to rely on , the Government will have to respond to the situation as it evolves . <p> " This approach has served us well and we should continue to abide by this considered approach in determining the end of the pandemic , " he said . <p> Editor 's note : This story has been updated to correct an error in transcription of a quote from Dr Balakrishnan.

I got my first dose this week , and I feel great . Thank you to all of the scientists , trial participants , regulators , and frontline healthcare workers who got us to this point . " <p> He did n't mention in the Tweet that the Gates Foundation has been one of the biggest single donors to finding a Covid vaccine , having invested some US$1.75 billion ( S$2.3 billion ) into the cause , predominantly backing researchers developing new Covid-19 treatments including monoclonal antibodies , and working with partners to ensure that these drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and use in the poorest parts of the world so they benefit people everywhere . <p> You could argue that as well as his age , Gates ' major role in finding a vaccine - including the Moderna and Oxford AstraZeneca vaccines - has earned him the right to be one of the first in line for the shot in the arm . But he is still worried about " prioritising equity " . <p> In their annual letter published on the Gates Notes blog , Bill and Melinda Gates describe how disease outbreaks tend to follow a grim pattern ; as they infect societies , they exploit pre-existing inequalities , and the same is true of Covid-19 . <p> The major concern now is " immunity equality " . In addition to shining a light on so many old injustices , the Gates are concerned that the pandemic will unleash a future where the wealthiest people have access to a Covid-19 vaccine , while the rest of the world does n't . <p> Over the last few weeks there have been several stories of UHNW individuals ' skipping the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Already , wealthy nations have spent months prepurchasing doses of vaccine to start immunizing their people the moment those vaccines are approved . But as things stand now , low- and middle-income countries will only be able to cover about one out of five people who live there over the next year . In a world where global health is local , that should concern all of us . " <p> " From the beginning of the pandemic , we have urged wealthy nations to remember that Covid-19 anywhere is a threat everywhere . Until vaccines reach everyone , new clusters of disease will keep popping up ... Everything depends on whether the world comes together to ensure that the lifesaving science developed in 2020 saves as many lives as possible in 2021 . " <p> nid:508772 <p> Gates says that his other major concern going into this year is preparing for the next pandemic to hit . Gates was famously accurate when predicting the pandemic of 2020 back in his 2015 TED Talk ; now , he says , is the time to prepare for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this last year from happening again , pandemic preparedness must be taken as seriously as we take the threat of war , " he says on his blog . " The world needs to double down on investments in R&amp;D and organisations like CEPI the Gates-funded platform which financed the vaccines have proven invaluable with Covid-19 . We also need to build brand-new capabilities that do n't exist yet . " <p> " Stopping the next pandemic will require spending tens of billions of dollars per year -- a big investment , but remember that the Covid-19 pandemic is estimated to cost the world US$28 trillion . The world needs to spend billions to save trillions ( and prevent millions of deaths ) . I think of this as the best and most cost-efficient insurance policy the world could buy . " <p> He adds that the bulk of this investment needs to come from rich countries who need to continue investing in the scientific tools that are getting us through this current pandemic -- even after Covid-19 is behind us . <p> He outlines three things governments need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Firstly , by the next pandemic , the US should have mega-diagnostic platforms in place which could test every week . <p> nid:501991 <p> Secondly , there should be a group of around 3,000 infectious disease first responders , all over the world who spring into action at the first sign of a new pathogen . <p> And thirdly , the world needs to regularly run germ games -- simulations that let us practice , analyse , and improve how we respond to disease outbreaks , just as war games let the military prepare for real-life warfare . " Speed matters in a pandemic . The faster you act , the faster you cut off exponential growth of the virus .

@@42704236 <p> The Singapore Red Cross has recently given its blood donation mascot , Blood Buddy ( BB ) , a makeover . With a more modern and adorable image , BB aims to reach and appeal to a younger generation of blood donors . The rebranding comes off the back of the growing need to engage and advocate blood donation among today 's youth with a consistent brand voice , Red Cross said . <p> In an interview with MARKETING-INTERACTIVE , a spokesperson from Red Cross said the rebrand was done in collaboration with creative agency AKIN , who first took the time to understand BB 's history and significance to Red Cross 's national blood programme . The agency then developed BB 's new personality , characteristics , visual presentation and voice , creating a fresh new look while retaining its role as the iconic mascot of the programme . The revamped brand assets were then applied across all collaterals to ensure brand consistency and recognition <p> Besides giving BB a new look , Singapore Red Cross also further personified its mascot , sharing its age , profession , character traits , hobbies , and some of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and #FriendsofBloodBuddy ( donors of Singapore Red Cross ' blood programme ) . <p> BB has been the mascot of the Red Cross ' national blood programme since 2005 . While it was known to many regular donors as its official mascot , BB mainly connected with the community through physical appearances at mobile blood donation drives and outreach activities run by Red Cross . <p> With this revamp , Red Cross ' spokesperson said BB has been given deeper characterisation and personality , which will be fully explored through online content with its own narrative storyline . <p> Audiences will get to better connect with BB and understand its fears , motivations and quirky personality . The revamp is also in line with Red Cross ' newly-launched " One More Step " campaign , which aims to encourage potential donors to take small , incremental steps towards the eventual goal of being a regular blood donor who donates at least twice in a year . As the face of the campaign , the new BB serves to empathise with the physical and emotional concerns all potential blood donors have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take to give blood and help save lives . <p> According to Red Cross , the role of BB has now evolved from just being a mascot to becoming a voice of encouragement for people to join the blood programme and become a donor . Its spokesperson explained that BB will continue to be a mainstay in its marketing plans , functioning as the bridge between the organisation and its wider donor community . BB will also continue to front all " One More Step " campaign messaging , and Red Cross will be creating content and developing fuller storylines to introduce BB and its universe . More offline collectibles based on BB 's character will be unveiled as well . <p> Running from now until March 2022 , the " One More Step " campaign will include a series of activations including videos and comic strips will be introduced to engage potential donors on social media . Red Cross will also be holding a giveaway of its memorabilia from 8 February to 7 March . <p> " One More Step " looks to attract more potential donors to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community that every step counts towards making a difference . These steps may come in the form of doing an eligibility test , booking an appointment , sharing a social media post , or even holding a blood drive . <p> According to Red Cross ' spokesperson , the campaign also aims to dispel misconceptions about blood donation that deters potential donors from donating blood . Additionally , the organisation hopes to reach out to donors who have just completed their first donation , and remind them that taking the next step could be as simple as setting their next appointment or encouraging their friends to join the donor community . This comes as Red Cross noticed that many donors lapse on donating after their first time . <p> " We want to send the message that anyone and everyone has the potential to contribute to the blood donation cause , in whichever way they are best able to , " the spokesperson said . <p> Although Red Cross usually targets all eligible donors aged 16 to 60 for its blood programme , it is hoping to utilise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their blood donation journey and encourage them to adopt a long-term commitment to blood donation from a young age . <p> The campaign will run primarily on Facebook and Instagram , and Red Cross may look into extending its reach at a later stage . Additionally , the organisation will be leveraging a combination of both social media and out-of-home ( OOH ) advertising such as introducing the new BB on buses all around Singapore . Other OOH displays will be rolled out across the next few months , Red Cross ' spokesperson said . Red Cross worked with agencies AKIN for creative , RICE Communications for PR , and SCREAME for media . <p> Besides attracting new donors with the campaign , Red Cross said it will also be developing targeted initiatives and micro-campaigns to acknowledge its regular donors and encourage them to step forward as advocates to build a strong blood donor community . <p> To measure the success of the " One More Step " campaign , Red Cross ' spokesperson told MARKETING-INTERACTIVE it is " consciously shifting away from vanity metrics " , and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the success of the campaign should lead to community growth and an increase in youth blood donors . " One of the key actions we are tracking is whether individuals take one more step in their blood donation journey , be it donating blood , sharing information with loved ones or even encouraging their employers to adopt blood donation as a charity of choice , " the spokesperson added . <p> Since it started the national blood programme in 2001 , Red Cross ' marketing and outreach strategy has always been centre around the same goal : to recruit and engage blood donors in order to maintain a safe and sufficient supply of blood for all transfusion needs in Singapore at all times . <p> Its spokesperson revealed that currently , only about 1.8% of Singapore 's residential population are blood donors , and only one third of them donate more than twice a year .

@@42704240 <h> Scientists disagree on a new study suggesting that climate change is creating global hotspots for bat species in parts of Southern China and Southeast Asia . <h> ? ? <p> A new study suggests that climate change is enabling the evolution of new coronaviruses by creating " hotspots " for multiple bat species . <p> The study , published in the journal Science of the Total Environment , finds that Yunnan province in southern China , as well as neighbouring regions of Myanmar and Laos , have become global hotspots of bat species " richness " over the past century . <p> Around 40 species of bat have moved into the region , the authors say , bringing roughly 100 additional types of coronaviruses with them . <p> This is due to climate change-induced changes in vegetation , they argue , adding that the " bat-borne ancestors " of SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2 -- the latter being the virus that causes Covid-19 -- are thought to have originated there . <p> However , many scientists not involved in the study say they have concerns about the data used in the study and the conclusions it draws . One tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... to conclude that climate change could have increased the likelihood of the pandemic occurring in this way " . <h> Impact of climate change on bat hotspots <p> The past century has seen changes in bat species richness -- the number of bat species in a given region -- across the world . The new study points to shifting vegetation types as a key factor behind these changes . <p> The map below shows changes in bat species richness between the two periods 1901-1930 and 1990-2019 that -- the study says -- have been driven by climate change-induced vegetation changes . The orange and red shading indicates a greater increase in bat species richness . <p> Estimated increase in the local number of bat species due to shifts in their geographical ranges driven by climate change between the 1901-1930 and 1990-2019 periods .

Climate change has made many of these habitats more suitable for bats , allowing them to expand their ranges into new areas . " <p> Focusing specifically on Yunnan , the plot below shows how habitats have shifted over the 20th century . The left side shows the 1901-1930 distribution of vegetation over the province , and the right side shows the 1990-2019 distribution . <p> The plot indicates that over the 20th century , there was a significant shift from tropical shrublands to tropical savannahs and deciduous woodland .

These include land-use change from human activity , hunting , invasive species and pollution . <h> Bat-borne diseases <p> More than 60 per cent of emerging infectious diseases in humans are " zoonotic " -- meaning that they originate in animals . <p> Last year , Carbon Brief published an explainer that unpacks how climate change and biodiversity disturbance could raise the risk of diseases being transmitted from animals to humans . <p> Bats carry the highest proportion of zoonotic viruses out of all mammals . The world 's bat population carries roughly 3,000 different types of coronavirus , and each individual species harbours an average of 2.7 different coronaviruses alone . <p> The paper notes that Middle East Respiratory Syndrome ( MERS ) , SARS CoV-1 -- which is typically known as " SARS " ( Severe Acute Respiratory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes Covid19 -- are all thought to have originated in bats . <p> The paper estimates that climate change-driven changes in vegetation drew an extra 40 species of bats into the hotspot highlighted in the map , leading to roughly 100 more coronaviruses in the area . <p> Beyers tells Carbon Brief that this allows more opportunities for the virus to be transmitted or evolve , and may have been how SARS-CoV-2 shifted species : <p> " We estimate that the number of bat species , and of bat-borne coronaviruses , in the likely origin of SARS-CoV-2 has substantially increased due to climate-driven changes in the natural vegetation . This process has likely created significant new opportunities for the virus to be transmitted or evolve . " <p> The piece notes that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is thought to have originated in bats in Yunnan , and that civets and pangolins carrying these viruses were then taken to wildlife markets in Guangdong and Wuhan , where the virus first began to infect people . <h> Sceptical reaction <p> They then used information about the vegetation requirements of the world 's bat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> However , many scientists are sceptical of the methods used and the conclusions drawn . <p> Dr Dann Mitchell -- joint Met Office chair in climate hazards at the University of Bristol , who was not involved in the study -- tells Carbon Brief about issues with the climate data used : <p> " Using some of our best climate observations , the authors identify a strong climate-driven signal over Myanmar and Laos , but there will be large uncertainties associated with variables such as cloud cover in that region , especially 100 years ago in South Asia -- there is a lot of missing data there . " <p> Prof Paul Valdes , a professor of physical geography at the University of Bristol , notes that although the paper is " interesting " , there are still " many untested aspects of their conclusions -- especially since we are still debating the origins of Covid " . <p> " Many species are not fully assessed , and too many are so poorly known they are only documented as a few dots on a map . Very little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the region highlighted in this study . <p> The study estimates the bat fauna of southern China and neighbouring countries increased by a whopping 40+ species in around 120 years . To put that into perspective , that would mean the number of bat species in Myanmar doubled in little over a century . Simply looking back at old species accounts and ecological studies from the region shows this simply did not happen . " <p> He adds that he is " sceptical of the link " between climate change and bat distribution change , and that the study makes " too many assumptions for me to conclude that climate change could have increased the likelihood of the pandemic occurring in this way " .

Tracing the life of the martial arts legend <p> Wong Fei-hung is the most famous of all the exponents of southern-style Chinese martial arts , and his exploits have passed into legend . There have been around 100 films about him , 77 of which feature actor Kwan Tak-hing , who became synonymous with Wong during the 1950s and 1960s . <p> Radio plays , pulp novels , newspaper story serialisations , and television series have been devoted to his life . At one point , no less than seven newspapers were running serialised novels about Wong at the same time . <p> The martial arts master became known to international audiences in the 1990s when he was played by Jet Li Lianjie in Tsui Hark 's supremely successful Once Upon a Time in China film series . <p> In spite of his status as a folk hero , very little is known about Wong and his life . Indeed , much of Wong 's history has been coloured by the fictional exploits attributed to him . As a line in American director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " When the legend becomes the fact , print the legend , " and this has certainly occurred in Wong 's case . <p> " Wong Fei-hung was much revered in his lifetime , but little is actually known about him , " said Woshi Shanren , who wrote novels about the martial artist in the 1940s and 1950s . Even the sole photograph purported to be of him turned out to be a picture of one of his sons . <p> In-depth research by Yu Mo-wan , published in a 1981 essay , The Prodigious Cinema of Wong Fei Hung , did establish some basic facts about his life . Since then , other facts have come to light . <p> Wong was born around 1847 in or near Foshan in China 's Guangdong province . His father , Wong Kei-ying , was one of the famed Ten Tigers of Canton , a collective name given to the best martial artists in Guangdong in the mid-19th century . <p> The Ten Tigers were all said to trace their lineage back to the Buddhist fighters of the Southern Shaolin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to have been in Fujian province , southeast China , and was a counterpart to the original Shaolin Monastery in northern Henan province . <p> Wong Kei-ying is said to have studied under the legendary Luk Ah-choi , a former abbot of the Southern Shaolin monastery and an expert in northern-style " flower " kung fu. and the southern hung ga style . Luk saw Kei-ying performing martial arts and acrobatics on the street as a child and offered to teach him . ( Wong Fei-hung himself later became one of the Ten Tigers , possibly when he was in his twenties , but he was not one of the original members , as is sometimes said . ) <p> Wong Kei-ying became known for his prowess in hung ga kung fu , and taught martial arts to the military . Notably , as his wages were low , he also worked as a physician -- a herbalist and possibly an expert in bone-setting ( dit da ) -- and founded the Po Chi Lam apothecary in Guangdong . <p> Wong Fei-hung inherited his father 's medical skills as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Po Chi Lam apothecary later in his life . <p> Wong Fei-hung was taught kung fu -- mainly hung ga style -- by his father from around the age of five , and would travel to different villages in Guangdong with him to perform kung fu in the streets and sell medicine to make a living . The tale of how Wong initially became famous during one of these sales expeditions with Kei-ying is narrated in an article by hung ga grandmaster Frank Yee . <p> When he was around 13 years old , Wong angered another martial artist , Hung Gwan-dai , who was also giving a demonstration in the street , because his exhibition was drawing a bigger crowd . Hung Gwan-dai challenged Kei-ying to a fight , but Kei-ying instructed his young son to take up the challenge instead . <p> A pole fight ensued , and the young Wong quickly beat the challenger by using the eight-diagram pole technique , a long-pole system that is a favourite of hung ga exponents . This match made Wong Fei-hung famous all over Guangdong . <p> Wong also became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the films about him . " Wong Fei-hung , who was one of the province 's best lion dancers , was known around Guangzhou as the ' King of the Lions ' , " writes Yu Mo-wan . <p> Wong went on to distil and formalise the hung ga system , which had been invented by Hong Xiguan , another Shaolin hero . " He was an expert in the Hung school of Shaolin martial arts , and an expert in the Iron Wire Fist , the Five Forms Fist , the Tiger Vanquishing Fist , and the Shadowless Kick , " writes Yu . The Shadowless Kick is a side kick , popularised but probably not invented by Wong , in which a fighter kicks his opponent three times in succession while in the air . <p> Wong was married four times , and had four known children , but there is only information about his fourth wife , Mok Kwai-lan . Mok , who married the ageing Wong in 1915 when she was 23 , was a renowned martial artist in her own right . She practised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ techniques , and Wong incorporated some elements of that into hung ga after they met . <p> Mok outlived Wong by many years , dying at the age of 90 in 1982 . She moved to Hong Kong in 1936 , where she ran an apothecary and a bone-setting operation , and taught hung ga . She had married Wong so late in his life that she could not provide much information about his personal history , researchers have said . The TVB television series Grace Under Fire was loosely based on her life . <p> There is a famous , but possibly apocryphal , story about how the two met . In 1911 , Wong was giving a kung fu demonstration when his shoe flew off and hit the watching Mok in the face .

He worked as the martial arts instructor for the 5th Regiment of the Guangdong army , and later the Guangzhou Civilian Militia . Towards the end of his life , he taught martial arts , and ran a Po Chi Lam apothecary in Guangzhou , and another in Foshan . <p> According to Yee , Wong became impoverished when his house and apothecary burned down during anti-government riots in Guangzhou in 1924 . Wong became ill and died in either 1924 or 1925 or perhaps even 1933 . He is reputed not to have lost a single fight in his life .

Recentexperiments performed on multiple D-Wave processors represent by far the largest quantum simulations carried out by existing quantum computers to date . <p> The paper , entitled " Scaling advantage over path-integral Monte Carlo in quantum simulation of geometrically frustrated magnets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ **26;1275;TOOLONG , February 18 , 2021 ) . D-Wave researchers programmed the D-Wave 2000Q ? system to model a two-dimensional frustrated quantum magnet using artificial spins . The behavior of the magnet was described by the Nobel-prize winning work of theoretical physicists Vadim Berezinskii , J. Michael Kosterlitz and David Thouless . They predicted a new state of matter in the 1970s characterized by nontrivial topological properties .

In this latest paper , researchers from D-Wave , alongside contributors from Google , utilize D-Wave 's lower noise processor to achieve superior performance and glean insights into the dynamics of the processor never observed before . <p> " This work is the clearest evidence yet that quantum effects provide a computational advantage in D-Wave processors , " said Dr. Andrew King , principal investigator for this work at D-Wave . " Tying the magnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given us the first detailed look at dynamics that are normally too fast to observe .

This would n't have been possible today without D-Wave 's lower noise processor . " <p> " The search for quantum advantage in computations is becoming increasingly lively because there are special problems where genuine progress is being made . These problems may appear somewhat contrived even to physicists , but in this paper from a collaboration between D-Wave Systems , Google , and Simon Fraser University , it appears that there is an advantage for quantum annealing using a special purpose processor over classical simulations for the more ' practical ' problem of finding the equilibrium state of a particular quantum magnet , " said Prof. Dr. Gabriel Aeppli , professor of physics at ETH Z ? rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division of the Paul Scherrer Institute .

The artist 's responses come through with another request : to use them as they are and , where needed , to reconfigure or adjust the questions to fit them . <p> Wait a minute ... is this to ensure that his responses are not subjected to any form of editing ? In journalism , text is edited not to change the content but to give structure to a story and enhance the focus and flow of writing , even more so with the finite space in print . <p> When in fact , Chong himself exercises this right in his monumental new work , Call for the Dead ( 2020 ) , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallery . He redacts text from the late author John le Carre ' ' s first spy novel of the same name by blacking out with ink all but the verbs of the story , highlighting the secrets Le Carre ' could have revealed in the fictional work published in 1961 when he was still working for British intelligence . From there , Chong produces 86 silkscreen prints on linen -- enough to fill an entire room -- which will be showcased as part of his latest solo exhibition , his first at the STPI Gallery , opening February 20 . <p> Titled Peace , Prosperity and Friendship with All Nations -- after the controversial Brexit 50-pence coin unveiled by the Royal Mint last January to ironically mark the UK 's departure from the European Union -- the exhibition offers a critical , albeit deadpan , look at the current global political and cultural landscape through a series of conceptual gestures based on everyday encounters and objects . From the spy novel and Brexit coin to a series of photographs of embassy backdoors in repeat patterns , Chong offers contemporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The current pandemic has also inspired the series of 56 paintings in The Circuit Breaker Paintings ( 2020 ) to mark every day of Singapore 's circuit breaker period from April 7 to June 1 last year . Chong , who has been working from home since 2003 ( " I do n't feel like I need to keep a studio I go to in order to be an artist . " ) , paints over the works from his painting practice dating back to 2009 with an " X " , in reference to the safe distancing measures of cordoning off public spaces . <p> He also reimagines the ubiquitous QR code , a feature of Singapore 's Covid-19 SafeEntry system , enlarged to epic proportions in Safe Entry Version 2.0 -- 2.7 ( 2020 ) . This iteration of the public art commission by the Singapore Art Museum ( SAM ) for its Walking in the City series offers access to a video posted on Chong 's YouTube channel , Ambient Walking , of a recorded walk around Changi Airport Terminal 2 before it was closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues below <p> Books and literary works remain central to Chong 's practice . He is best known as the co-director and founder ( with Rene'e Staal ) of The Library of Unread Books , a mobile reference library of donated books that have not been read by its previous owners , which has been installed in various institutions around the world , most recently at ISLANDS , an experimental platform in Excelsior Shopping Centre . <p> " I am interested in how ideas are distributed via these objects we know as books . I started working with books back in 1994 , when I was studying at Temasek Polytechnic to become a graphic designer , but accidentally became an artist because I could n't stand the idea of anyone telling me what I can or can not do , " the artist explains . <p> As an artist in Singapore , why did you feel inclined to address the impact of Brexit in Peace , Prosperity and Friendship with All Nations ? Heman Chong We live in a time where people have extremely polarised points of view about things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realise that everyone is only interested in their own voices , and how loud their voices can be in order to shut the other person up . It seems impossible to even have a conversation about anything without someone getting angry . If you look back , history will tell us that human beings have disagreed with each other for a very long time . The very idea of nations came about because someone said , " These are my people and these other people are not my people . " There 's a lot to think about , and I think Brexit is one of the many situations where we can locate these societal fractures brought about by disinformation . <p> What is the significance of John le Carre ' ' s Call for the Dead in your work ? HC I love the fact that John le Carr ? was working for British intelligence when he wrote his first three novels and that MI6 had gone through his novels before they got published . I love the fact that he hates James Bond and had such a deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolutely unsexy . If you think about it , most stuff that gets redacted is written by civil servants . Stuff that state institutions would deem sensitive or confidential , or if they are just downright paranoid . What I 've done with Call for the Dead is to redact everything in the novel except for verbs ; leaving behind only words that represent actions : jump , run , skip , kill , spy , observe . And because you ca n't read the novel anymore , I have banished this novel into the realm of secrets . <p> Why the fascination with embassy backdoors ? HC I have been searching for the backdoors of embassies since 2018 when I was on holiday in Tokyo . As with every single piece of my work , the starting point is always accidental . I was walking past a certain embassy in Roppongi ( I ca n't tell you which one ) and I thought it would be interesting to look at the architecture of the embassy from all sides , and before I knew it , I found the backdoor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wife very kindly told me that " it 's my front door " ) and photographed it . I went to the embassy next to it and photographed its backdoor , and the next and the next . And before I knew it , I have now a collection of more than 300 backdoors of embassies in more than 10 different cities around the world . <p> The pandemic has inspired a number of your works , from public art to YouTube videos , which engage especially with an audience who typically might not participate in traditional galleries or museums . Is it important to you that your work and message reach more people ? HC I do n't see the walking videos I post on my YouTube channel , Ambient Walking , as art . It is certainly a tool to encourage me to walk more ( as 4,086 km in a year is not enough ) , but at the same time , I can share a representation of this experience with whoever is interested in watching these videos . What I like about YouTube is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only makes sense when you search for something specifically . <p> My genre in YouTube is called WalkTubing and it 's basically just a bunch of people who record life via a camera and a gimbal and it 's sort of part of the ASMR genre . My most popular video on Ambient Walking is a walk I made on Telok Blangah Hill Park in a very , very scary thunderstorm and right now , about 250,000 views have been generated from this one video . <p> I do n't see these videos as art simply because the audience does n't see ( or does n't want to see them ) as art . Most of the time , it 's more like visual and aural therapy for them . It 's very hypnotic and soothing to watch something as boring as a guy filming his walks . I like that I am able to relate to people on different levels and that art-making is not the only way that one can produce meaning in this world . <p> Foreign Affairs ( 2018 ) is part of Chong 's photography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the artist and STPI ) <p> What are you working on next ? HC I 've always loved this story told by Benjamin Moser concerning the naming of the first novel written by Clarice Lispector . Apparently , Near to the Wild Heart was suggested by her first ( and doomed ) love , L ? cio Cardoso . It was lifted from a line from James Joyce , " He was alone . He was unheeded , happy , and near to the wild heart of life . " I 've always loved this line from Lispector in this first novel : " The dense , dark night was cut down the middle , split into two black blocks of sleep " , and thought I should literally " cut down " the words in the middle of this sentence and use it as a title for a group exhibition in Lisbon that I 've been invited to , and this will become a work in the exhibition .

@@42783235 <h> Behavioural shifts marketers should bank on this Ramadan <p> Details <p> Janice Tan <p> 09 March 2021 <p> Brands and consumers alike will once again be celebrating Ramadan in the midst of a pandemic , but this time , they are more prepared having experienced the challenges of last year . At the same time , purpose-driven marketing has also become a trend among advertisers . <p> For Twitter in particular , MD , Southeast Asia Arvinder Gujral told A+M that a Twitter report found that 59% of brands want to connect to a purpose and the cultural moments of users . With Ramadan coming up in April , it is yet again another time for brands to touch consumers ' hearts via purpose-driven marketing . While Gujral was unable to share specific statistics on how much ad spend clients have allocated for this year 's Ramadan , he expects media spend to increase across the board . <p> " The year 2020 for us , from a Ramadan perspective , was much bigger in terms of marketing spend in spite of the pandemic. 2021 is shaping up to be much better than 2020 because brands have figured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Now , they know beforehand what to optimise . The overall spend should increase and we might be seeing some interesting campaigns too , " he explained . Twitter 's international ad revenue grew 35% YoY to US$508.56 million , according to its financial report . <p> Twitter is also a popular platform for festive discussions . For Ramadan in particular , the number of conversations around balik kampung increased 55% last year , while entertainment increased 38% . Meanwhile , mentions of food jumped 20% during last year 's Ramadan . During the fourth quarter of 2020 , Twitter reported an international monetisable daily active usage of 155 million , marking a 28% year-on-year growth . According to Gujral , the number of Malaysian users has grown exponentially last year but he declined to reveal the exact figures . <p> With the pandemic not abating this year , consumer behaviour shift during the pandemic is here to stay . As such , here are four trends brands should take note of going into Ramadan . <p> 1 . Rise of social commerce and consumers seeking brands in online @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pandemic . Majority of Malaysians ( 70% ) plan to retain online shopping for future Ramadans . Ordering food online ( 48% ) will also become a trend moving forward , as well as donating zakat online ( 47% ) . This trend spills over from 2020 , which saw Malaysians shift much of their offline activities to online . Reinforcing the growth of this trend last year , Malaysians also tweeted about shopping and gifting 19% more than they did in 2019 . <p> Twitter users in Malaysia also seek brands to be part of the conversation , with 81% of them saying they want to hear more from brands , and 68% welcoming expert opinions before making purchases . Meanwhile , Twitter also found that 61% of its users are influential and 47% are affluent . At the same time , close to half of Malaysians on Twitter ( 46% ) are also brand conscious . " People love talking to brands and this means brands have the opportunity to interact with them , " he said . <p> However , this also means that brands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be it a K-pop or an English Premier League fan , or someone who is interested in gardening . <p> Break them into segments of interest and not age . Age is a very old way of doing marketing . <p> " When you think of it , topics such as Ramadan , sports and K-pop cut across ages so how can you do demographic marketing ? Interest is the only thing that aligns and connects people . So find buckets of interests that audiences follow and figure out what buckets of interests you want to reach , " Gujral explained . <p> 2 . Social media a key role in Ramadan celebrations <p> With the social distancing restrictions imposed as a result of the pandemic , more consumers have focused on connecting with family and friends online . As a result , 66% of Twitter users say that using social media will be their most anticipated activity during Ramadan , with 87% saying that they will use social media apps more than usual as they stay connected . This was followed by streaming movies and TV series ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching TV ( 38% ) . <p> At the same time , online app adoption is still on the rise , with 87% of Twitter users indicating that they will be using social media apps . The next most popular app segment was video streaming apps ( 77% ) , followed by online shopping apps ( 63% ) and food delivery apps ( 46% ) . <p> 3 . Consumers seek food and comedic content <p> Users not only use Twitter to connect with one another but also find content and entertainment . Last year , food and cooking content saw an increase from 69% to 74% compared to 2019 , while interest in comedic content jumped 2% to 46% from 2019 to 2020 . That said , religious content was still in high demand during Ramadan last year , with 66% of Malaysians on Twitter seeking similar content . <p> 4 . Malaysians prepare earlier for Ramadan and still care about the same topics <p> Ramadan conversations for 2020 started one month before , with a 25% year-on-year growth . More specifically , there was a 60% spike in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than half of these conversations revolved around balik kampung ( 55% ) , followed by entertainment ( 38% ) and food ( 20% ) . <p> " Topics such as entertainment and food , these are perennial topics that should and will always come on Twitter . And the base increase of 55% and 38% for balik kampung and entertainment conversations respectively is significant when you talk about hundreds of millions of conversations on the platform , " Gujral said . <p> Also , Twitter found that Malaysians are positive about this year 's Ramadan , with 66% of conversations on Twitter having a positive tone . Meanwhile , 20% of it were negative while the remaining 14% was neutral . At the same time , 40% believe that the pandemic situation in Malaysia will improve . <p> " The pandemic is pretty new to us and all of us were entering into an uncertain environment last year . You would assume people come online and vent . But we have a 60% increase in positive conversations and that is significant . It shows you that the fabric of humans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he added . Moving forward , Gujral expects Twitter to see more positive content and conversations on its platform post-Ramadan , as well as constant traction for live on Twitter . <p> Cutting through the online clutter <p> There has been more emphasis on digital ever since the pandemic hit , with more brands pushing out content online to capture eyeballs as consumers retreat to their homes , and small businesses jumping on the eCommerce trend . According to the dentsu ad spend report , digital will account for 50% of global media ad spend this year , with social ( 18.3% ) , search ( 11.0% ) and video ( 10.8% ) expected to benefit the most . This is definitely an increase from 2019 ( 42.8% ) and 2020 ( 48% ) and dentsu predicts the number to grow to 51.2% next year . <p> To cut through the clutter , brands need to ensure their content is tailored to each and every platform . Gujral explained that companies need to tweak some assets and messaging to get more in return , instead of taking one single thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , the opportunity cost lost " is very high " , he added . On the other hand , brands might spend 5% more effort on tailoring their content but Gujral said they " will definitely get more than 50% of that investment in effort " in return . <p> Brands have to stop being lazy and think of social media as homogenous . The Internet is not a homogenous place , the audiences are different across platforms . <p> " The first mistake that brands do is this lazy marketing . Now that digital has become so significant in size and hence the importance of digital and social , brands need to put in more first efforts in digital and not secondary efforts , " he said . <p> Besides tailoring content to various platforms , brands also need to understand their target audience on the platform and connect to moments or conversations happening . This includes the type of audience on the platform , why they are on there and what they are talking about . " The minute you connect to moments , to the conversations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . <p> At the same time , brands that are popular online are also those that create their unique identity . Regardless of whether the engagement is organic or paid , Gujral explained that behind every handle is a human powering the tweets . Hence , it is important for brands to find their own voice on the platform that is unique . <p> " A lot of brands make the mistake of making Twitter part of their PR machinery . People do n't come to Twitter to read press releases , they come here to connect so brands need to have a personality , " he said . <p> A+M 's Content 360 Week is back from 6 to 8 April this year !

@@42783236 <p> We celebrate International Women 's Day today . At Marketing , we conduct interviews with marketers or creative agency practitioners over the years , inviting them to talk about a number of topics , including gender equality practices in their companies , and their views towards gender-related issues in Hong Kong . <p> In this piece , we talk to Marlot van der Stoel , regional director of Wavemaker Hong Kong over her views towards gender equality and opportunities for women . <p> 1 . Can you tell gender equality practices in your company and what the company has done to provide employees with a better workplace ? At Wavemaker , we have a Global Diversity &amp; Inclusion Vision and Action Plan in place that is implemented at a global , regional and local level , with a D&amp;I champion at an APAC level to oversee the progress -- Rose Huskey , Wavemaker Southeast Asia . The plan consists of five pillars , including gender . The plan is widely available and is presented , together with the past year 's review , to everyone . Since every pillar ( in addition to gender , we focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important , the overall focus lies in inclusion . It is essential for a company to have such a plan in place , but it does not stop there : It is up to the employees to ensure it lives and breathes . We should not only rely on a top-down approach when it comes to inclusion . Every individual needs to take his or her own responsibility and contribute in their own way . Do you see inappropriate behaviours or do you disagree with something ? Speak up and act and do not wait until your management brings it up . <p> In addition to focusing on our own workplace , we contribute by taking our responsibility in relation to our clients ' advertisements . For instance , in case there are sexist elements and gender stereotyping ( for example , women in the kitchen or men drinking beer ) , we should challenge this as their media agency as on top of workplace policies , we believe in driving positive change and balance in our work as well . <p> 2 . If there is something that has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workplace , what are the major problems ? I think people in general still like to hire people who are like them . And this probably happens unconsciously . This behaviour seems harmless but it slows down our progress to achieve full gender equality . We all know that , on average within the corporate space , men disproportionally take up management positions . This trend will continue if people only hire employees whose capabilities and characteristics are similar to theirs . We need to challenge and train people to think ( and hire ) differently . When diversity is the norm , everything else will follow naturally -- both gender equality as well as better results for the company . <p> 3 . In the marketing industry , can you name some obstacles that prevent women from achieving a higher role ? <p> I do not believe that the marketing industry still has the " Mad Man " image . It is definitely not the case that men run the show , while women only sit behind the reception desks . It is not anymore about men in suits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now also have many women ( in suits and/or sneakers ) that are confident and can tell great stories . This actually shows the underlying problem : the industry 's focus on great stories and people with the biggest mouth is still very important , while people who can tell their meaningful stories with innovative thoughts , smart data , surprising insights and real solutions should instead be put in the spotlight . <p> In Wavemaker Hong Kong , 76% of our workforce are females , with 79% in management positions . <p> 4 . Can you name a female leader ( or some female leaders ) who inspires you most ? <p> There are too many examples of female leaders that immediately come to mind . The one that jumps out is Malala Yousafzai . For me , she truly embodies female empowerment . I have had the honour to attend the ceremony when she received the Children 's Peace Price in The Hague in 2013 and she has left an everlasting impression to me . Not only is her life mission to ensure girls worldwide have access to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her beliefs . And she has never stopped fighting and sharing , inspiring countless activists and policy makers around the world . Through her tremendous offer she has made the world realize how important gender equality is . <p> 5 . What advice would you give to a company hoping to create an office with gender equality and adopt a diverse hiring strategy ? <p> Make sure everyone in the company is part of the team ! Gender equality , along with the other inclusion topics , needs to be integrated in the heart and soul of the company . A company and its employees need to truly believe that a diverse group of people is key for success . <h> Masterclass Series <h> Social <h> Other Links <p> We use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experiences on our website , to show you personalised content and targeted ads , to analyze our website traffic and to understand where our visitors are coming from .

@@42783238 <p> In Parliament on Friday ( 5 Mar ) , Health Minister Gan Kim Yong assured the House that primary healthcare will be strengthened in Singapore , with 12 new polyclinics to be built , bringing the total number of polyclinics to 32 by 2030 . <p> To make healthcare more accessible to seniors , community nursing teams have been expanded to cover 29 regions across the island since September 2020 , with a total of 185 community nursing posts , Mr Gan said . <p> The Government has also been spending more on healthcare in Singapore , he added . The share of national health expenditure has been increased from 40 per cent in 2013 to 46 per cent in 2018 . This works out to be about an increase of 1.2 per cent per year , on the average , from 2013 to 2018 . <p> Indeed , after People 's Action Party ( PAP ) garnered a historical low of 60.1 per cent of valid votes in 2011 , there were a lot of soul searching within the party . PAP decided that they needed to listen to the people more and launched the National Conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Among the grievances surfaced was the high cost of healthcare in Singapore putting considerable strain on the people . <p> So in 2013 , Gan started a review of Singapore 's healthcare financing system . Speaking to Parliament in Mar 2013 , Gan said the first major shift was to increase the government 's share of national spending so as to provide Singaporeans with greater assurance that care would remain affordable . The government would thus take on a greater share of national spending from the then one-third to about 40 per cent and possibly even further , depending on various factors such as demographics , and the ability to manage healthcare costs and target the subsidies , he said at the time . <p> And as revealed by Gan yesterday , the share of national health expenditure has increased to 46 per cent in 2018 . <p> Singapore 's share of national health expenditure below average of OECD 's and the world 's <p> Gan did not reveal the current percentage share of national health expenditure . However , even if the figure is at 50 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the OECD 's average . <p> According to the OECD website , on average , more than 70% of health spending is funded out of public resources among OECD countries -- from government revenues and social insurance contributions . <p> Even compared to the rest of the world , Singapore 's share of national health expenditure is also below the world 's average . According to data from World Bank , the average government health expenditure in the world as a percentage of health expenditure was 59.5% in 2018 , ahead of Singapore 's . <p> And in terms of out-of-pocket health expenditure as percentage share of total health expenditure , Singaporeans spent more than the rest of the world do . Singaporeans spent more out of their own pockets in terms of total health expenditure at 31% in 2018 compared to 18.1% for the rest of the world . <p> So , while Gan said that the share of national health expenditure has been increased to 46 per cent in 2018 , it still pale compared to those of OECD countries and the rest of the world , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the increase spending on healthcare since 2009 seems to stem from the increased spending on development of healthcare facilities by the Ministry such as building of hospitals , clinics such as Ng Teng Fong which cost S$800 million and not on treatment expenses . <h> Share this : <p> When you login first time using a Social Login button , we collect your account public profile information shared by Social Login provider , based on your privacy settings .

Digital corporate giants are now deeply embedded in our lives and most have all-male founders , who have amassed incredible fortunes and influence .

The 100 largest companies listed in Singapore have only 16 per cent female board representation and the US @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 59 years for women to achieve income equality . <p> We need to move much faster to close the gender gap and one of the best ways to do this is for women to start and lead the next wave of Fortune 500 companies . <p> The business case for more women entrepreneurs is clear . Women founders generate more revenue per dollar invested and exit 1 year earlier than their male counterparts . Yet , last year only 2 per cent of VC funding went to women-led startups . The stereotypical bravado , over confidence and unnecessary risk taking and competitiveness that characterises the startup world can make entrepreneurship unattractive to women . On top of that , most VC firms do not have a single female partner . There is a real risk that women will be left behind in this essential driver of innovation , value creation and economic growth . <p> When it comes to climate tech , one of the biggest misconceptions that can discourage women entrepreneurs is that you need to be a researcher or scientist to make a difference . Climate tech is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development play , for example more efficient solar panels , better battery tech . While this type of climate innovation is essential , most of these technologies are 5-10 years away from being commercially viable at scale at best . <p> Based on the work we have done at Engie Factory , we know there are a multitude of high growth , VC investable ventures that can be built today , using available technology . For example , all the technology needed to reduce the energy consumption of buildings by 10-30 per cent exists already and is quite affordable -- what is needed is the right business models that create incentives for building owners and occupiers to adopt energy efficiency technology . It is this type of venture building that is needed now to enable corporates , governments and individuals to meet their immediate sustainability and decarbonisation targets that will put us on the trajectory to half global emissions by 2030 and meet net-zero emissions by 2050 . <p> Women are already leading the way when it comes to sustainability and impact-driven business model innovation .

Raena shared that sustainability had always been at the heart of StyleTheory business model and is a great example of how innovation can change consumer behaviour . And we 're already seeing early entrants in the climate tech starting to make an impact .

Silicon solar is suitable for providing large-scale solar power , while OSCs have other unique strengths that guide its real-world applications . <p> Two unique features of OSCs are their thinness and flexibility . While a typical silicon solar cell is about as thick as the average width of a human hair , most OSCs are roughly a thousand times thinner . Because of their thinness and flexibility , OSCs can be fabricated on curved surfaces and flexible backings . <p> For example , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , backpacks and even clothing . Most of these products are still under development and occupy a niche market , but they demonstrate the innovative creativity that OSCs provide . With OSC technology , the possibilities for where solar cells can be used has been greatly expanded beyond just rooftops and solar farms . <p> OSCs also can be made transparent , semitransparent or in various colors . As a result , there are many potential applications for architectural use . For example , transparent OSCs could be integrated into windows to generate energy from sunlight that might otherwise warm a room and contribute to higher air conditioning costs . <p> Franky So , a materials science and engineering professor at North Carolina State University , offers yet another application : OSCs could be used in sunroofs to help power electric and hybrid vehicles . <p> Additionally , low up-front investment and potentially low product shipping costs make OSC technology accessible to communities in developing countries that lack access to an electrical grid and the financial means to build one . <p> OSCs have a unique ability to " bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffries-EL , an associate professor of chemistry at Boston University . In these instances , OSC technology could provide essential electricity in the smaller quantities needed for tasks such as lighting , charging cell phones , and refrigerating medications and vaccines . <p> Another selling point of OSCs is that they are less energy intensive to manufacture than are silicon solar cells . Extremely hot furnaces -- upwards of 1,500 ? C ( 2,700 ? F ) -- are needed to generate high purity silicon for silicon solar cells . By comparison , large-scale OSCs can be manufactured by simply printing the layers of the cell onto a backing in a process similar to that used to print newspapers . <p> Because this process consumes less energy , OSCs have a significantly shorter energy payback time than silicon cells . In other words , OSCs require a shorter amount of time to generate the amount of energy it took to manufacture them . <h> How it works <p> The first organic solar cell was developed in 1958 , but it was n't until the 2000s that OSCs saw a significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field of organic light-emitting diodes , commonly known as OLEDs . OLED technology is used for many television and phone screens on the market today . <p> In an OLED screen , a layer of organic molecules ( molecules composed primarily of carbon and hydrogen atoms ) emits light when an electric current is applied . OSCs work in essentially the opposite way -- the layer of organic molecules generates an electric current when exposed to light . <p> An organic solar cell is made up of multiple layers of materials , one of which is the acceptor layer . When sunlight hits the cell , an electron is released from the layer of organic molecules , and the job of the acceptor is to pass that electron on to the electrode . This process causes a build-up of charge , which is what generates electricity . <p> Traditionally , the most commonly used acceptors in OSCs were materials based on fullerene -- a molecule composed of 60 carbon atoms joined together in a structure that resembles a soccer ball . However , with fullerene acceptors the efficiency of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In other words , only 10 per cent of the sunlight hitting the solar cell was converted into electricity . Researchers therefore set out to explore new types of acceptor layers as a means to increase OSC efficiency . <p> This uptick in efficiency has exceeded the expectations of many experts , some of whom began working in the field when the efficiency of OSCs hovered around just 3 per cent . " If 10 years ago you had told me we would have organic solar cells of 18 per cent efficiency , I would have laughed , " Marder says . <h> Barriers to overcome <p> There is still much work to be done before OSCs can be widely marketed . One of the biggest challenges is the solvents used in the manufacturing process . Most of the top-performing OSCs are made using chlorinated solvents , which present both health and environmental hazards . <p> " When scaling up OSC manufacturing , you have to consider the exposure of people who will be working in the manufacturing plants , " says Bernard Kippelen , a professor of electrical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has focused largely on obtaining increasingly higher efficiencies , but as Kippelen says , " we need an approach that goes well beyond just one number . " To make OSCs a viable technology , the manufacturing process must be optimised to make it safer and more cost-effective . <p> Another barrier to the mass production of OSCs is the difference between the efficiencies of individual cells tested under ideal lab conditions , and the efficiencies that have been demonstrated for larger modules . Individual cells can have high efficiencies , but assembling multiple cells into modules , panels or arrays requires additional electrical connections that will decrease the efficiency . <p> However , as Kippelen points out , these sorts of disparities are expected . " It takes some time before the increases in cell efficiency are reflected in the efficiencies of modules coming off the manufacturing lines , " he says . " The same was true of silicon solar cells . " <p> Funding for OSC research is another concern . In the United States , much of the funding for solar cell research comes from government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , according to Kippelen " a lot of funding sources kind of dried up to do research on OSC , " due to the emergence of a rapidly expanding class of solar cells called perovskites . <p> " There has been a lot of excitement around the use of perovskites because their efficiency is even higher than silicon in some cases , " says Kippelen . However , even as funding for OSCs has decreased in the U.S. , China continues to spearhead OSC research and development . " The amount of work on OSC research in the United States is a tiny fraction of the amount of work in China , " Marder says . " People in China are going full blast on this . " <h> Reasons for optimism <p> Future world energy consumption will continue to rise , especially as developing countries aspire to the same benefits of on-demand energy production that developed countries enjoy . Researchers like Marder , Kippelen , Jeffries-EL and So say OSC technology has the potential to play a unique and important role in the global transition toward renewable energy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent has many researchers working to advance this technology , and scientists are now looking into tandem OSCs ( which use two different materials that absorb distinct wavelengths of sunlight ) to capture even more energy . Some are hopeful that this development could increase OSC efficiency even further -- up to 20 per cent . <p> Kippelen calls for a long-term view of OSC technology . " Solar technology is going to be around for a long time , " he says , " and I truly believe OSC , with time , will establish itself as a really important technology .

According to the Associated Press ( AP ) , Instagram will allow " a small group of random users " to hide the number of likes on their posts and decide if they wish to see likes that others receive . The tech giant is also doing the same for its Facebook app , but comments will still be visible for individuals who choose to like their hides . <p> Instagram trialled this initiative two years ago , explaining previously that it wanted Instagram followers to focus on the photos and videos that people are sharing instead of the number of likes they get . However , Facebook eventually shifted focus to dealing with the pandemic when COVID-19 hit , AP said . <p> Facebook 's spokesperson told MARKETING-INTERACTIVE that in 2019 , it began hiding like counts for a small group of people on Instagram to understand if it lessens some pressure when posting to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this beneficial but some still wanted to see like counts so they could track what is popular . <p> " We are testing a new option that lets you decide which experience is best for you - whether that is choosing not to see like counts on anyone else 's posts , turning them off for your own posts , or keeping the original experience , and seeing like counts , " the spokesperson explained . <p> Separately , the tech giant is currently in the midst of a global media and creative review . Mindshare and dentsu are reported to be defending the account . On the creative front , Facebook is currently working with Wieden + Kennedy , BBDO , Ogilvy , Leo Burnett , and Droga5 for each of its apps and corporate brand .

To download the full guide , click here . <p> Medical insurance is traditionally catered to large organisations by established players . While at the other end of the spectrum is personal medical insurance . This has recently been boosted by the voluntary Health Insurance Scheme ( VHIS ) for individuals , launched by the Hong Kong Government in April 2019 . <p> Sandwiched between these two are SMEs and start-ups . This article looks at medical insurance options for these more nimble and smaller companies -- at least at the outset . This present a unique challenge for medical insurers and providing viable health options for these workers requires a different approach . <p> For a look at how the once niche , or even non-existent , medical insurance market for SMEs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Bl ? ? m , shares his insights . Bl ? ? m offers technology-driven general health services and mental health services to employees in these entities , so they can manage their health better through its technology platform . <p> " There are a lot of red ocean ( highly competitive ) players targeting MNCs and they are in a very established market , " says Wu . <p> " But for SMEs there is a very strong need for flexibility , a strong need for health management . They want to be focused on the wellbeing of their employees because they are under high pressure -- especially for a lot of these start-ups , " he adds . <p> " We want to customise an insurance solution for these Lalamove drivers . And protect their health , especially the risks that arise out of their exposure to Covid . " <p> " These are the sectors we focus on . We realise that in order to manage their conditions , and ultimately manage the insurance plan , one of the best way is to offer a scenario-based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is happening to the employees . " <p> Tailored approach for nimble companies One of Bl ? ? m 's highest-profile clients is Lalamove . The on-demand delivery start-up has become one of Hong Kong 's most successful , with over 20,000 employees . The vast majority of workers are delivery drivers . <p> " During the Covid pandemic there is a strong need for deliveries , so deliveries are actually surging in the Hong Kong market . This actually exposes these Lalamove delivery drivers to a much higher level of risk , because they are the ones in contact with the people , " says Wu . <p> " It 's essential customise an insurance solution for these drivers . And protect their health , especially the risks that arise out of their exposure to Covid . For example , if they have to be hospitalised in an ICU ( due to infection ) we have great coverage for them . " <p> Wu adds that a tailored approach to cover these drivers as they are not part of the traditional office approach . Drivers are out there in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with them . This is achieved via social media , making the drivers more motivated to use the company 's health services . <p> Medical insurance trends Technology is clearly the biggest trend in health insurance . Both large corporations and smaller companies are increasingly using technology to help manage the conditions of their employees and also to be able to prevent rather than just protect . <p> " I would like to emphasize the difference between these two concepts , " says Wu . " Protection means that the condition has already happened so this is managed with a large amount of medical expense -- through the traditional approach of insurance and claim . <p> " But now , more and more employers are using preventative health services . And using the technology to manage employee claims is not only going to help employees have better overall health over time but also to manage the costs of the company . <p> " Because it 's only when you can manage the costs sustainably , that there can be a balance between employee health and the overall cost paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also trending towards greater personalisation and the healthcare component of this is no exception . Smart use of data makes it possible to switch from a rigid model of medical services to one that is customisable and fluid . <p> " Before , we have seen modulised insurance products based on the risk profile of particular populations . This is because there is not enough data collected . But when we actually have a data platform we are able to collect people 's personalised data to enable them to use a self-service system and use the digital claim services . This gives us a better understanding of their health profile and their behaviour patterns , " explains Wu . <p> " In turn , this gives us a better understanding of employees ' risks on a personal level and enables us to more precisely underwrite these insurance products with the insurers that we work with . This not only offers a better service to employees but also helps us manage costs more effectively . " <p> Then there 's the specific role of HR . Compensation specialists are becoming more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of the employee benefits , leading to a more comprehensive rather than scattered approach . <p> So HR needs medical insurance solutions that enable it to manage the overall cost and manage the high-level claims proactively communicate with their employees to create a more personalised service . <p> Simplifying the process for HRHealth insurance is a complicated business that can be daunting for HR and employees alike . Given that it 's traditionally been an admin nightmare -- involving an unwieldy claims procedure and mountains of paperwork to wade through . Mercifully , this is changing . <p> It 's worth shopping around for a medical insurer with a good HR management portal . This provides a better connection between HR and employees . <p> " A lot of the time when the company buys health insurance for their employees , employees are not necessarily aware of all the service offerings that the company 's providing . And often HR needs training session to make them aware of the offerings and how they can pass them on to the employees , " says Wu . <p> It is essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page that allows these employees to access a range of services on one platform , such as e-claims , mental and general health services , medical trial services and hospital recommendations -- all of these services should be in one place . <p> As things become increasingly digitalised , it becomes easier to get this employee data back to HR to enable them to get a high-level understanding of what they are buying . And get a better understanding of how these services and insurance plans are helping their employees . <p> " This has the advantage of enabling HR to see the data on an ongoing basis , rather than once a year , which has been the traditional method , " explains Wu . <p> " This helps to serve the needs of HR as to how these employee benefits are being used and it also gives a stronger connection between the company and the employees .

Good . <p> Advertisement ? <p> Most fans would know of the original game 's indirect but highly-acclaimed sequel , NieR : Automata , which was released back in 2017 . Oh , and the entire NieR franchise is basically a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternate ending of its first game . <p> Now that you have a near history of NieR Replicant , NieR Gestalt , or NieR ... let 's talk about the remake , NieR Replicant ver.1.22474487139 ... , which for all of our sakes , we 'll use Replicant Remake from here on . <p> Replicant Remake puts the player in an unusually serene post-apocalyptic world where there are little to no modern buildings left , and where ethereal monsters called Shades roam and antagonize the people left . While you can make out remnants of train tracks and machinery throughout the game , the world is basically rid of any modern technology and everyone 's back using medieval tools . <p> The universe in this game is hauntingly beautiful and looks identical to the original game , except it 's fully enhanced with modern-day graphics . While the entire map is n't exceptionally vast , the world is a charming landscape that reminds us of the classic Shadow Of The Colossus . <p> In Replicant Remake , you play as a teenage boy ( whom you name ) , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as the Black Scrawl . The game 's main objective follows this entire story and slowly unravels as you progress to look for a cure for your sister . <p> Advertisement ? <p> Yonah &amp; the player <p> Besides the main story , the game also includes plenty of side quests where you can complete to collect more gold which you can spend on consumable items ( for health and temporary stat boosts ) and weapons . These side quests include moving around places , collecting items and killing Shades . <p> Unfortunately , some of the main quests in this game at the start feel slightly pointless and repetitive , as they are mainly fetching quests where you 're required to run between locations that do n't necessarily progress the main narrative . However , the tempo picks up and becomes more enthralling once you 're through the early stages . <p> Along the way , you 'll meet a few characters that play a prominent role in the game 's storytelling , and one such figure is Grimoire Weiss , except he 's an ancient floating book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a peculiar and quirky personality . The relationship explored between you and Grimoire Weiss is a huge part of the immersive narrative that you 'll be able to witness as they go through different stages of bicker , care and concern . <p> Of course , other than Grimoire Weiss , there 'll be several other characters such as Kaine and Emil who have their own part to play in your crusade to save your sister . Throughout the game , these distinctive characters offer really intriguing interactions ( especially for Kaine ) which are a joy to watch . <p> Even if you 've played the original Gestalt game , the refreshing character exploration and development of the game stands out with its impassioned characters and their personalities . <p> Kaine <p> What 's also special about Replicant , even in the original , is the way it mixes its gameplay presentation as you progress throughout the game . While the majority of the game is played in third person , you 'll find your perspective change into a side-scrolling or overhead view whenever you 're exploring other areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combines the essence of an open-world concept and roguelike vibes together to offer a mixed and unique experience of puzzle-solving , dungeon crawling and hack-and-slash , unlike other action RPGs which usually revolve around the same gameplay . <p> Although a given since it has been 11 years since it was released , the combat in the remake has vastly improved in smoothness , and gets remarkably fun . With Grimoire Weiss , you find and collect " Sealed Verses " that are spells you use to defeat your enemies , and they range from attacking to defensive spells which you can equip . Other than spells , you 're typically dodging and combo-hack-and-slashing your way through your enemies . <p> Along with the game 's environment and characters , the combat shines spectacularly well because of modern enhancements to the graphics and the entire remaster really augments the entire gameplay of the original game . Whether it 's exploring your village or the grasslands , the world comes alive with its details and improved visual effects . <p> And one of the key standouts , if not the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much like its indirect sequel NieR Automata . Replicant Remake features rearranged music from the original composer Keiichi Okabe , which perfectly captures its poignant narrative and manages to put us through an immersive experience , regardless if you 're in an intense battle , solving puzzles or at home -- the game has the right tunes for every moment . <p> For fans , NieR Replicant is a great remake of the old game but it also offers a captivating narrative and entertaining gameplay for new players who want to give the franchise a shot at its slightly convoluted history . <p> So what if you want the original Gestalt version that you played with instead ? This game is set to receive the 15 NightmaresDLC that 'll offer fans the opportunity to play the Gestalt version of NieR , challenge dungeons and even pick new costumes from the NieR : Automata sequel . <h> We 're geeks , &amp; proud of it ! <p> We are a collective bunch of geeks who love to share our passion with the rest of the world .

@@42934235 <p> It has been a year since the Circuit Breaker was implemented and workplaces have now been reopened to accommodate up to 75% of the workforce and split team arrangements are no longer necessary . Against the backdrop of workplace reopening , Singaporeans might start to experience varying degrees of anxiety known as ' re-entry anxiety ' -- a new trend where individuals experience higher levels of stress in response to the fear of changes that will happen when we can socialise , shop and travel again . <h> Recognising signs and symptoms of re-entry anxiety <p> As re-entry anxiety kicks in , we will tend to experience a rollercoaster of emotions when we begin to step back into society . The brain will create negative scenarios as a protective mechanism . These anxious thoughts tend to affect our ability to maintain healthy routines and engagement with others . If this goes into overdrive it can manifest as symptoms of anxiety . These can include irregular eating and sleeping habits , inability to engage in activities that were once enjoyed , feelings of heightened physiological anxiety , such as heart racing and a decrease in work productivity . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once we find ourselves a regular routine and ingrain a new set of habits , we will start to feel calmer .

@@42962239 <h> Search <h> Technology is needed to reduce the trade finance gap <p> BY TAT YEEN YAP <p> Trade finance is generally seen as sound finance , underwritten by long-standing practices and procedures . The World Trade Organization ( " WTO " ) estimates that some 80 to 90 per cent of world trade relies on trade finance . These estimates are made with the acknowledgement of the absence of comprehensive and reliable data on trade finance flows . <p> World merchandise trade as published by the WTO was US$19.05 trillion in 2019 . We are told that the trade numbers contracted by 5.3% in 2020 , generally ascribed to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic , but that they are expected to grow 8% in 2021 and 4% in 2022 . With the projected growth and a base of some US$18 trillion to grow from , trade finance represents a very sizeable addressable market for financiers . <p> Having said this , there is a reported shortfall in trade finance availability -- known as the " trade finance gap " -- of some US$ 1.5 trillion , estimated by the Asian Development Bank ( " ADB " ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ADB first published the trade finance gap in 2013 ; therein , the " trade finance gap " was defined as a financial institution 's inability to meet the demand for any form of trade finance , and represents the amount of trade finance that is not available to support imports and exports resulting in less trade than would be if there was no gap . <p> The trade finance gap should probably be considered with a pinch of salt , for a number of reasons . The results are based on survey responses and not on precise statistical data . It can not be assumed that all rejected applications for trade finance should have been capable of being approved . An application may be for a limit larger than the actual amount needed : utilisation levels of approved credit limits in banks tend to not be maximised . Having said this , a trade finance gap most surely exists , and the work of the ADB has been invaluable to bring this to attention . <p> Key reasons for the trade finance gap , identified as ' barriers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> AML/KYC requirements <p> High transactions cost or low fee income <p> Low credit ratings of the obligor 's countries and obligors <p> Regulatory capital requirements for banks <p> Closing the gap Addressing the key reasons identified for the trade finance gap , it is noted in the latest ADB report that more than ? of surveyed banks highlighted the requirements on Anti-Money Laundering ( " AML " ) and Know-Your-Customer ( " KYC " ) as the largest barrier to expanding trade finance . <p> Trade-based Money Laundering ( " TBML " ) is defined as the process of disguising the proceeds of crime and moving value through the use of trade transactions in an attempt to legitimise their illicit origins . Key to solving this is the need for information sharing ( and overcoming the barriers to information sharing ) with the use of emerging technology . <p> Rejection rates of business entities that fail the KYC process is not the primary impediment to trade finance ( such entities should indeed not be financed ) . Rather , it is the high costs that financial institutions incur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Identifiers can be part of the solution for improvement in efficiency , data reliability and cost . <p> Creation of regulated exchanges for trade finance that would allow financial institutions to finance any exchange-enrolled business entities can be a way to overcome the KYC challenge . A prime example is the Trade Receivables e-Discounting System ( " TReDS " ) in India , on which financiers provide invoice finance to micro , small and medium enterprise ( " MSME " ) suppliers onboarded and KYCed by the TReDS exchanges . These MSMEs may otherwise be underserved by financiers due to the high cost of KYC . <p> Recent reported trade finance fraud events have the unfortunate consequence of reducing trade financing availability to legitimate financing applicants . There is a need to prevent fraud , and this need should focus not on large value transactions only but also small value transactions to meet financial inclusion objectives . A prime example of the use of technology for this is the deployment by India 's TReDS exchanges of a solution that prevents duplicate financing of the same transactions , which provides more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Successive ADB reports highlight that unmet demand for trade finance is highest amongst SMEs and women-owned firms . That SMEs face greater difficulty in obtaining trade finance compared to large corporates is unsurprising . World trade is vital to economic development and prosperity , and financial inclusion of underserved sectors is needed . Technology is expected to play an important role to close the trade finance gap . <p> The views expressed in this column are the author 's own and do not necessarily reflect this publication 's view , and this article is not edited by Singapore Business Review .

So you do n't recognise that there 's a problem until it becomes too big a problem to contain . And I really am in two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say that when there is a " very difficult to control problem " , you do what you can to buy time to track and trace close contacts and mitigate the spread of the virus , similar to how they do in Australia .

" <p> " So it 's a very , sort of a blunt tool to use , " Prof Tambyah commented , stressing the need instead for more resources and collaboration within and outside of Singapore on testing the different strains in the region . <p> He went on to note in the interview that it is difficult for a globally connected city like Singapore to sustain a strict , long-term border closure like Australia or New Zealand who are less dependent on foreign labour . <p> Though he spoke throughout the interview mostly as an infectious diseases specialist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to comment on Singapore 's over-reliance on foreign investment and labour . <p> When asked if this was related to the current outbreak of community cases of COVID-19 , Prof Tambyah responded : " Yes , and I think there 's no running away from it . SDP is not against foreigners coming into Singapore , but we think it needs to be calibrated . " <p> He pointed to the talent track system as used in Australia , which is a point system that evaluates a foreigners chance of entering the country as a possible option in recalibrating Singapore 's approach to importing foreign labour . <p> He noted that this could allow for borders to stay open while not exploiting foreigners . Additionally , he pointed out how the low wages paid to migrant workers and the huge levies imposed by the government tends to drive down the wages of these jobs , making them less attractive to Singaporeans . <p> He explained , " So I think it 's not that Singaporeans do n't want to do these jobs . It 's just that the conditions have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a policy which allowed migrant workers to come in and underpays them . " <p> Prof Tambyah added that if the minimum wage is equalised across the board for Singaporeans and foreigners , there would be no incentive for companies to hire migrant workers . <p> He also noted that there is the issue of National Service being a reason why some companies may prefer hiring migrant workers . However , he explained that for National Service to make a different , then " MINDEF ( Ministry of Defense ) should make it worthwhile for the employer and the employee .

@@43029234 <h> Share <p> The corporate world has unleashed a torrent of sustainability claims in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic , as brands have scrambled to be part of the conversation about tackling the problems that the outbreak has laid bare , from inequality and racial injustice to global heating and plastic pollution . <p> Communicating sustainability has shifted from being a " nice to do " to a " must do " for businesses , said Suzy Goulding , director of marketing agency MullenLowe salt Singapore . " Unfortunately , that does n't always translate into doing it properly , " she said on a panel discussion on greenwashing held by the British Chamber of Commerce Singapore on Wednesday . <p> Greenwashing is defined as the act of giving a false impression or providing misleading information about the environmental credentials of a product or brand . <p> You do not necessarily have an account even if you already receive our newsletters . Please sign up for an account to continue accessing our content . <p> A recent case of greenwashing was a Korean cosmetics brand with " Hello , I 'm Paper Bottle " written on the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plastic lining . The steady stream of companies claiming to be " net-zero " some time in the future has also raised eyebrows this year . <p> So how do companies communicate their green credentials without appearing to greenwash ? The first principle , said Darian McBain , global director of corporate affairs and sustainability of the world 's largest seafood company , Thai Union , is to " do it before you communicate it . " <p> " If you do n't have the evidence behind it a claim , you should n't be communicating it . " Credible , recent data is needed to set targets , which can take months or even years to plan properly , she said . <h> " <p> The CEOs who sign off sustainability targets are not going to be the CEO when the deadline rolls around . <p> She noted that there has been pressure on companies to make bold sustainability claims since the pandemic outbreak , and that is playing out with a slew of net-zero declarations . One-fifth of the world 's biggest companies have set net-zero targets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experts say . <h> How to spot greenwash <p> Is the claim way outside of the company 's field of expertise ? <p> Is there no credible data to support the claim ? <p> Has the firm spent lavishly on marketing but less on sustainability ? <p> Does the sustainability function sit in the marketing or communications department ? <p> Is the only time you hear from a company on a sustainability-themed occasion like Earth Day ? <p> Is the company only promoting its sustainability programme to win an award ? <p> If the answer to any of the above is yes , be wary . <p> There has also been an " onslaught " of companies talking about plastic waste , noted Tom Peacock-Nazil , founder of ocean clean-up and plastic offsetting firm , Seven Clean Seas . Among the most recent claims was Michelin 's pledge to use 100 per cent renewable materials by 2050 , by using recycled PET plastic in its tyresPeacock-Nazil believes this is a " completely unachievable target " because of a shortage of PET , which is a highly in-demand type of plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long timeframe on sustainability targets , it 's passing the buck , Peacock-Nazil added . " I 'm pretty sure the CEOs that sign off these targets are not going to be CEO when the deadline rolls around . " <h> Using the right language <p> Companies should focus on sustainability initiatives that are material to their business to help build credibility and authenticity into their programmes , said Goulding , who quizzes clients extensively about their commitments and progress relative to their competitors to evaluate how to tell their story . <p> " We need to identify where there might be gaps in what they 're saying compared to what they 're doing , " she said , adding that she has turned clients away that she felt had n't got their houses in order . " We 've said , we 're not going to help you launch campaigns around something you 're asking consumers to do , but have n't done yourself . " <p> Though the approach to sustainability communications may vary according to the audience , the essential ingredients are the same -- honesty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustainability savvy , particularly the young , and are more aware of companies that are not serious about their sustainability efforts and trying to cover up weaknesses and gaps , " she said . " The potential to be caught out and accused of greenwashing is growing . " <p> Language is key . A study of company websites across a range of sectors , published in January , found that 40 per cent used vague or unsubstantiated claims such as " eco " or " green " to denote sustainable products or services that could potentially be misleading . <p> Goulding said that companies have to find the right balance between telling an interesting story that engages audiences but which does n't stray from the truth . " If you ca n't inspire people , then nothing will change . But you have to start with the facts , and craft a story from that point of truth . " <p> Companies should try to avoid using sweeping statements and clich ? s that have crept into the way corporates talk about sustainability . One example is " sustainability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Google search . " Purpose " is another . Goulding also advised against using made-up words , such as " skinclusivity " , a word the beauty industry has started using that means including people of all skin types . <h> Setting the record straight <p> Companies accused of greenwashing should be willing to share evidence , and clearly explain why they 've communicated their sustainability credentials , said McBain . Accusations give companies the chance to tell a more nuanced story in their response . " Rather than see it as a threat , look at it as an opportunity to delve into a subject more deeply and share more detail about what else you intend to do , " she added . <p> Companies should be prepared to admit to their mistakes , Goulding said . Brands gain credibility and trust from consumers by being honest . " Companies make mistakes , and people accept that . What they do n't accept is when they try to cover up where they went wrong , " she said . <h> Green hush <p> Fear of accusations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known as " green hush " . A lack of experience in setting a sustainability strategy and nervousness over using the correct terminology also puts companies off talking about their sustainability credentials , Goulding said . <p> " A company is never going to be perfect , because sustainability factors are always changing . But there 's no reason why you ca n't communicate any point of your sustainability journey -- as long as you 're honest and transparent about where you are at that point in time , " she said .

A Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020spearheaded by the Convention on Biological Diversity expired last year and theprinciples and methods around biodiversity offsets are still being devised . <p> Financial institutions can leverage their position to influence how frameworks are formed around offsets , according to Steve Edwards , senior programme manager at IUCN . " The International Finance Corporation 's ( IFC ) performance standards , for instance , have been replicated and absorbed by other multilaterals , " he told Eco-Business . <p> Operational guidelines are also dependent on context . " Biodiversity will always be local . Fresh water , for example , is localised . You ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it matters to you , andmakes no difference for someone else , " Prakash-Mani told Eco-Business . <p> An international marketplace for trading biodiversity offsets is unrealistic in the current context , Edwards believes . Guaranteeing the quality and the permanence of offsets are aspects that can scupper both carbon and biodiversity mitigation efforts . " The complexity of biodiversity is far greater than the way we have been able to describe and conceptualise carbon offsets , " Edwards explained . <h> Shifting , not offsetting <p> Damage to biodiversity caused by development can , in some cases , be compensated by restoring or protecting habitats elsewhere , but first there has to be greater disclosure about the damage that is being done . <p> While biodiversity offsets are increasingly being used by governments and companies , an IUCN study found current efforts to mitigate impacts were proving insufficient to reduce biodiversity decline . <p> Moody 's also found a disconnect between most companies ' commitments and tangible measures to reduce their impact on biodiversity in its recent study . For example , 61 per cent of assessed companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yet less than 10 per cent of the sector receives a ' robust ' or ' advanced ' score for implementation . <p> Cost shifting -- the diversion of offset funds to existing conservation programmes -- is also a risk . A biodiversity offset must provide a new contribution to conservation - so it must be additional to prevention and mitigation measures already in place . <p> Examples of global declines in nature , emphasising declines in biodiversity , that have been and are being caused by direct and indirect drivers of change . Source : The global assessment report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services , Intergovernmental Panel on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services ( IPBES ) , 2019 . <h> Limits to offsets <p> Some things can not be offset . Some developments might endanger previously non-threatened species to a higher threat level -- such as vulnerable or critically endangered species . In other cases , the values that are lost are specific to a particular place and can not be replicatedor found elsewhere.If this is the case , this would probably mean that a project should not proceed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of biodiversity offsets has beencriticised , because offsets may not be effective if they are not strictly regulated and because their use may provide a ' licence ' to degrade the environment , notes The Dasgupta Review , a global review on the Economics of Biodiversity published in February . <p> " Biodiversity offsets can help reconcile development with conservation - but if they allow governments to renege on their existing commitments by stealth , biodiversity offsets could cause more harm than good , " James Watson , professor of conservation science at the University of Queenslandsaid following the publication of his 2015 paper , ' Stop misuse of biodiversity offsets . ' <p> In theory , biodiversity offsets should deliver conservation outcomes for at least as long as the biodiversity loss persists at a development site , according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ( OECD ) . It is a difficult aspect to secure as land tenure , financial viability and incentives for land management are all needed to ensure there is permanence to a biodiversity offset . <h> Putting the brakes on destruction <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human drivers of biodiversity loss , " there will be a further acceleration in the global rate of species extinction , " says the IPBES Global Assessment . <p> Issues around offsetting - both carbon and biodiversity - are likely to become more difficult with a greater scarcity of land and an erosion of species . <p> " Where we can really offset the damage done to biodiversity is by driving behavioural change . This means trying to enhance conservation , not just by simply buying land and protecting it in some way , but changing the way people interact with biodiversity and introducing mechanims that protect species that are threatened , " Edwards said .

Swapping out a comfortable office chair , stable income , and the yearly bonus for a life in F&amp;B would be distant when you consider the alternative is long hours , perpetual grease , extreme heat , and pressure .

The special ingredients in each dish are the heart of the chef . <h> What are some of the most challenging aspects to master ? <p> We cook dishes that fills the soul , not just the stomach but being a chef and an entrepreneur in the Singapore market where overheads such as rental , food costs and manpower are ever rising is a major challenge . <p> I do not want to compromise with my ingredients and flavour .

@@43065230 <h> Unboxing &amp; Playing The Monopoly : Transformers Edition ( 2021 ) <p> After setting aside the exciting Jurassic Park Monopoly set we unboxed , and packing away our traumatic experience with the destructive T-rex on the loose , it looks like Hasbro is n't quite ready to retire their classic fast-dealing property trading game just yet . <p> This time around , the toy company has merged Monopoly with one of the biggest toy franchises ever developed , to form one game that will bring the fight of good vs. evil from across the universe , into their living rooms . Loosely based on the characters from the Transformers Universe , the Transformers Monopoly Set brings six iconic robots as they battle for Energon , and the rights of the land they walk on . <p> Unlike the Jurassic Park edition , this Transformers inspired set is not at all as complicated nor frustrating , as this edition mimics the majority of the original board game 's rules and objectives which is to buy , sell or swap property until only one man is left standing , just with a different theme . <p> Starting with the iconic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-configuring robotic lifeforms from the planet Cybertron , and not just any kind at that , but the option to either side with the benevolent Autobots or the deceptive Decepticons . This further enhances the game as participants get to really battle it out with one another as they take on the forms of giant robots at war . <p> On the Autobot side , players may choose from Optimus Prime , Bumblebee and Grimlock , whereas the Decepticons consist of Megatron , Starscream and Soundwave . Although it might be hard to identify who 's who at first glance , after scrutinizing each token , the weapons that they hold and wear are great indicators of their identities . <p> While each one has a metallic silver sheen , these are n't die-cast though each one- inch tall token is relatively heavy compared to the Jurassic Park tokens that we played with before . One thing we find ironic is that each of these tokens are better designed and crafted than the accompanying miniature figures packed with Hasbro 's recent Unicron toy , which looked like blobs of plastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also been designed to showcase the intricate details of their respective body parts , from Optimus Prime 's energy axe , or the insignia on Megatron and Soundwave . <p> Looking at the board itself , it does get overwhelming not seeing the familiar property names , but we assure you that each space is similar to the classic Monopoly , just that the aesthetic and names are changed to better fit the theme . Instead of Boardwalk and New York Avenue , we get iconic Transformers location , including Iacon City and Preatorus Wharf . <p> There are three types of properties found on the board spaces -- locations that come in colour sets , Space Bridges and Titans . These properties can be bought if unowned , and if a player falls on any owned property by another participant , they would need to pay with their Transformers-themed Monopoly money its owner according to what 's written on the Title Deed card . <p> Owners of each Location in a colour set may double the energy fee for those locations and add Energon Cubes and Energon Bunkers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hotels . The same rules apply , players would need to first own four Energon Cubes to be able to purchase an Energon Bunker and each location is limited to only one bunker each . Those who have added cubes and bunkers will be able to collect even more fees from players who land on it . <p> In conjunction with the Transformers theme , the Chance and Community Chest cards have been transformed as well for consistency and relevancy . These cards have been changed to Autobot and Decepticon cards . Each card from these decks have two sections , and those playing as an Autobot would read the red " Autobot " section , while those playing as Decepticons would read the " Decepticon " section in purple . Although the situations for each section are different , the action that the player would need to take remains the same . Just remember which side of the Cybertron war you 're playing as and you 'll be good to go . <p> The other components of the board remain the same from here on out . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from to get out , either pay Monopoly $50 , use a get out of jail free card or be able to roll doubles on your next turn . Additionally , deals and trades still do apply where players may buy , sell , or swap their properties at any time during the game especially for those who are on the brink of going bankrupt . <p> Overall , the experience of playing the Transformers edition of Monopoly is similar to the original . If you 're looking for a rather tame Monopoly board or just a big fan of the Transformers franchise , this is one to get . With all the different versions that Hasbro released of the Monopoly board game , it has certainly become a collection to look out for . <p> Hasbro 's Monopoly : Transformers Edition is now available at all Singapore major toy speciality and departmental stores and e-tailers including , Amazon , Lazada , and Shopee . <h> We 're geeks , &amp; proud of it ! <p> We are a collective bunch of geeks who love to share our passion with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have adopted as our mascot , we have both depth and width of geeky topics we cover . <p> By visiting this page , you declare yourself one of us !

While simple sounding in theory , it takes more than just one campaign around the point of sale to achieve that goal . <p> Despite the huge shopping culture in Asia , most businesses do n't focus on a shopper marketing specialist to support the function -- often leaving the decisions to marketing managers . <p> While brands are increasingly seeing the need for good shopper marketing strategies , the opinion across the board is that many remain clueless on what that looks like . Areas such as location-based marketing and mobile , while on the purview of marketers , have yet to take off in a huge way . <p> A study by PwC in 2013 showed several trends in Asia . First , there is a high emphasis on brands for developing nations in Asia . Consumers said they were four times more willing to pay for access to branded apparel than shoppers in developed nations . Second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in influencing shopping decisions . Finally , most shoppers from developing markets in Asia were more likely to shop online , said the study . <p> Retailers going online <p> In April and May of 2014 , Shop.org and Forrester partnered to collect marketing benchmark data from online retailers . In this latest version of the study , 81 retailers responded to the survey . The majority were multichannel retailers with sales across stores , catalogues , the internet and other channels . <p> About 45% of the respondents were " large " web retailers ( that is , generating more than US$100 million in web revenues ) , and half of the respondents have had a live e-commerce site for at least 10 years . <p> About 32% of the respondents had interactive marketing budgets totalling more than US$10 million . Of those budgets , the single biggest allocation is to paid search programmes , which Google AdWords largely dominates . <p> 1 . Paid search continues to be the top acquisition channel for online retailers . <p> In recent years , paid search has dominated interactive marketing budgets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the most effective . This year is no exception . Online retailers are also spending heavily on display ad programmes such as remarketing and behavioural ads , which they see as increasingly effective in acquiring customers . <p> Google dominates online retailers ' customer acquisition tactics <p> When looking at customer acquisition , retailers focus on opportunities to gain consumer awareness via search engines . In fact , retailers across the board say that search engine marketing ( including both paid and natural search ) was the single most effective customer acquisition tactic in the past year . This means retailers need to focus on one partner more than others -- Google . <p> The 2014 survey revealed : <p> ? Paid search programmes are the dominant marketing tactic . <p> More retailers say they plan to spend more of their budget on paid search programmes than on any other tactic in their marketing arsenal . <p> ?

Mobile marketing spend is growing , but focuses primarily on tactics such as email . <p> Online retailers reported they were increasing their marketing spend on smartphones and tablets in 2014 . However , they use most of that spend to optimise traditional interactive marketing messages for mobile devices , such as mobile emails , mobile paid search campaigns and mobile display ads . <p> As mobile traffic grows , it 's not surprising merchants are allocating more to mobile marketing initiatives .

Attribution models today have a number of shortcomings , including the fact they rarely measure behaviour across devices and stores .

Next to it is one from Coca-Cola or Pepsi , retailing at a dollar more . Which do you buy ? <p> Atul Chandna , ASEAN consumer goods and services lead at Accenture , suggests a strong brand will have consumers willing to pay premium prices . <p> BrandZ , a study done globally by Millward Brown , showed the combined brand value of the world 's most important brands as being worth US$2.9 trillion as of last year . <p> However , much to the chagrin of marketers and brand leads , many firms consider brands intangible assets . According to an Economist article , the value of a brand , usually " invisible " when internally generated , is revealed when it is bought by another company . This is due to the different rule that applies to acquisitions . <p> For example , in 2005 Procter &amp; Gamble , a consumer-goods company , paid US$57 billion for the Gillette razor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worth US$24 billion . BrandZ now ranks the brand as being worth at least US$19 billion . <p> Roger Sinclair , who advises MASB , an American body that sets marketing standards , opined in the article that investors have a right to know how much brands are worth because so much of a firm 's future depends on them . <p> In the tech space , which is doing remarkably well in terms of making it to the top of brand valuation lists , also saw several high-profile acquisitions . One of them was Facebook 's stunning US$19 billion acquisition of messenger service WhatsApp , a move that surprised many . What made it so valuable ? <p> Accenture 's Chandna says building brands is like growing the market share value of a company , " though the face value of the share is much lower , but with strong brand development the worth of the company is much higher " . <p> " The brand is part of the product 's social stature .

Brands help people to navigate the choices they have to fulfil these needs . They help provide a guarantee of quality . <p> " Successful brands are those which provide both emotional and functional gratification consistently . They need to be sharply defined and positioned towards a specific target audience . " <p> Brand : An intangible asset ? <p> However , there has always been a struggle for marketers in trying to convince management of the importance of brands . Unless the firm is a consumer goods firm , the contribution brands make is less clear . <p> Millward Brown 's BrandZ study makes an attempt to quantify the strength of a brand , that is , without financial or other elements . <p> " Brands that score high in brand contribution have distinguished themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the brand in the mind of the consumer that creates predisposition to buy and , most importantly , validates a positive correlation with better sales performance , " said a note in the study . <p> Luxury brands were the most represented in the list unsurprisingly , with brands such as Gucci , Hermes , Audi , Rolex and Chanel in the ranks . However , according to researchers , regardless of product category or place of origin , brands can achieve high brand contribution . <p> Most importantly , what was noticed about the brands on the list was that most of them ( nine out of the 15 ) also appeared on the same list the year before , denoting staying power . <p> Brand building versus brand advertising <p> While brand building is a vital business strategy , marketing experts say it 's important to outline the difference between building a brand , and mere brand advertising . <p> Damien Cummings , previous regional vice-president and chief marketing officer for Philips ASEAN and Pacific , says that both are often confused , with many marketers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the way to build customer engagement . <p> " It can , but only if it 's done really well . Too often , brand advertising is simply a feel-good exercise that builds brand awareness , but not much else , " he said . <p> Brand building , on the other hand , is not about advertising , but about understanding and engaging customers -- what Cummings terms brand advocacy . <p> " It 's fundamentally about building advocacy -- either by being great at customer service , having products that delight customers and most importantly , delivering on promises . There are many fantastic examples of companies , such as ASOS , Starbucks and Xiaomi , that deliver great experiences , build loyal customers and create tangible value without doing a lot of advertising . <p> " There are many ways of looking at the impact and value of a brand . The most tangible effect is on a company 's valuation and/or share price . Well-known , trusted , cool or high potential brands add a premium to a company 's valuation ( if they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies ) . " <p> The age of digital has changed the playing field for brands significantly as well . <p> It has levelled the playing field for building brands or brand advocacy . This means some of the biggest and most valuable brands may not be the most established , with many relatively young brands in the top brand rankings . For example , the likes of Facebook and Twitter are about a decade old . <p> " All ( of the above ) now feature heavily in almost all top 100 brands lists . This is because amazing or appalling experiences are easily shareable ( viral ) -- and they are incredibly easy to find via search or product review or friend/peer social recommendation , " said Cummings , referring back to the idea that successful brand-building is really about advocacy . <p> What does a strong brand have ? <p> Ambrish Jain , vice-president of marketing for Asia at Lenovo , says that while across brand categories , branding has a differing amount of significance on a company 's bottom line , a strong brand should drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulting in lower cost of acquisition or higher " lifetime customer value " ; and advocacy -- resulting in trials among other consumers with low marketing spending ( hence , higher margins ) . According to the BrandZ researchers , there are several things brands do right when it came to brand-building : <p> TrustThe study details how strongly consumers expect brands to keep their promises . However , this is tough to keep , with several sectors disappointing in this area . It highlighted several brands that were in violation of this . " Lost trust damages brands , " says a note in the study . It outlined the examples of apparel maker Lululemon -- when the stretch fabric of some of its products performed poorly and the company initially blamed customers for the fault ; and GM and Toyota earning public rebuke when they failed to maintain safety standards -- as instances of what could happen when this was violated . " Strong brands are better able to sustain fluctuations in trust , " it said . <p> Share of lifeWhile the goal of brands is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes from making a consumer 's life better or simpler . The study cited Apple , Google and Amazon as models for surrounding consumers with product , services and content . Brands such as Chinese internet brand leaders , Tencent , Baidu and Alibaba , who built online banking centres and mobile payment systems , were cited under this example . " Share of life helps broaden and deepen the bond between customer and brand . This relationship potentially benefits the customer with improved service and the brand with additional sales . " <p> SeamlessnessA seamless experience for the consumer is vital , said the study . " But by definition , seamlessness means that the brand makes the transitions between physical and virtual invisible to the consumer who 's interested in the results not the process . And seamlessness centres on the customer , " said a note in the study . <p> Personalisation Mere designer logos will no longer appeal to the consumer , says the study . " Self-expression is in . In the luxury category , popularity increased for interesting jewellery , not simply the traditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumers chose for their uniqueness . The celebration of uniqueness was evident in the extensive personal care product ranges for hair and skin types serving a more inclusive ideal of beauty , " it said . <p> Customisation Customisation was another tack these brands got right , with the likes of Starbucks and McDonald 's cited . Other brands that allow this include Nike and adidas , which allow consumers to personalise their shoes . Coca-Cola was another example from the study , where it has moved beyond its Freestyle vending machine that enables customers to mix ingredients and make about 100 varieties of soft drink . <p> Convenience European hypermarkets and other retailers have evolved to allow consumers to order online and to pick up in-store , boosting sales by allowing their consumers convenience . In Asia , examples of this include Zalora , which allows consumers to buy online and pick them up via partners such as 7-Eleven in Singapore . <p> Authenticity " Sometimes the most compelling aspect of a brand is the product itself . To accrue economies of scale the major brewers generally produce beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originated . But sometimes the brewers balance this business imperative with the need for brand authenticity , " said a note in the study . This allows the likes of major global brewer SABMiller , which makes Peroni , its Italian brand in Italy itself , to charge a premium to cover the additional cost . This also includes how Heineken , sold in the US , is brewed in Denmark . This also applies

Thus making it ideal for those who live an active lifestyle , the masks are built to deliver comfort , maximum protection and extreme breathability even during high-intensity activities . <p> OURA 's masks are constructed from three layers of tightly woven , medical-grade fabric permanently embedded with antimicrobial silver oxide and titanium dioxide . Most masks use antimicrobial coatings which wash off after just a few uses . Instead of these coatings , OURA infuses the compounds directly into every fibre so they kill pathogens , inactivate viral particles , break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mask even after being washed over and over again . <p> Both the Active Mask and Air Mask 2.0 come with a replaceable , NIOSH-approved N95 filter for an even more powerful safeguard against pathogens . These masks have been independently tested by third-party laboratories and verified to filter =99.9 percent of bacteria , viruses , and 0.1 ? m particles . They 're also made with skin-friendly hypoallergenic fabrics to eliminate any potential ' maskne ' issues . <p> Available in different sizes suitable for all face shapes , the Active Mask ( priced at RM230 with N95 filter ) and Air Mask ( priced at RM195 with N95 filter ) come with an adjustable nose clip for a personalised seal as well as a travel pouch , making it convenient for travel use and easy storage . The Active Mask also comes bundled with OURA 's Active Tape , a pack of 30 double-sided medical-grade strips , to secure the mask for increased filtration . <h> The faces behind the mask <p> Although based in Los Angeles , California , co-founders Keane and Shaun were Malaysian-born . OURA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was diagnosed with leukaemia at 10 years old . Then in 2011 , Keanne had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity of meeting President Obama through Make-A-Wish which is what inspired him to create OURA . Together with his brother , Shaun , they want to help other patients find hope and empower their recovery experience -- and aim to grant wishes to patients out there through the foundation . <p> We get to know more about them below : <p> Shaun Veran , co-founder and COO <p> Keane Veran , co-founder and CEO <p> Shaun Veran , co-founder and COO <p> Keane Veran , co-founder and CEO <p> 12 <p> 1 . How did the idea to establish OURA come about ? <p> Keane : The idea for OURA started with my cancer diagnosis . While undergoing chemotherapy , I started losing my hair so I started wearing hats to cover up . I had a compromised immune system which meant I was much more susceptible to all kinds of infections which really made our entire family reanalyse the way we think about germs . We quickly realised that hats were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash them every couple of days . <p> It was this realisation of how easily microbes can grow on your everyday items ( like hats ) that led to the start of OURA . We played around with the idea of creating products that would help you to live a cleaner , safer life by infusing technology into your wardrobe . Once I was declared a cancer survivor in 2017 , It felt like the perfect opportunity to run with this idea and fully commit ourselves to running a business . <p> 2 . As the older brother , when did you realise that you would want to partner with your younger brother to start up a business together ? <p> Shaun : It was actually while Keane was undergoing his cancer treatment that we realised there was a problem with the items that people use on a daily basis . So , while we were still kids , we dreamed about how we could maybe one day solve this problem . It 's crazy to think that we were actually able to turn it into a reality ! <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to OURA 's products and the brand story behind it ? <p> Shaun : OURA is a scientific company at heart . Everything that we do is informed by science and everything that we make is rigorously tested with the scientific method . In starting OURA , Keane and I knew that this was central to the brand . As we have developed new products over time , the science and testing behind it has always been constant . <p> Keane : The main differentiators of our products fall on two different factors -- our technology and laboratory testing . <p> All our products use a proprietary antimicrobial technology that dramatically improves its durability . Rather than using antimicrobial coatings that chip off after a few washes , our technology is permanently embedded within every thread so it lasts much longer . <p> Everything that we make undergoes rigorous testing and validation through various independent laboratories to ensure our products will provide the ultimate protection . Our masks are tested for filtration efficiency , viral filtration , bacterial filtration , and antimicrobial efficiency . <p> 5 . What has OURA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Shaun : We never imagined our company growing to the caliber it is at today . When we first started with our very first product , Identity , our first goal was to generate enough money to expand our product offerings to have 3 different hats . <p> As our company slowly grew in size , we started to get more aggressive and introduce new product lines throughout the years ; manufacturing aprons , an entire skincare line , and now masks followed by international expansion stores opening up . <p> 6 . What are some of the future plans in store for OURA ? <p> Keane : We have some really exciting products we will be introducing within the coming months . We ca n't say too much about it right now but we 're very excited to launch them !

With latest updates from @PHEuk and **36;848;TOOLONG <p> British Health Secretary Matt Hancock also said in a press conference that Delta is around 40% more transmissible than SARS-CoV-2 , meaning it can spread faster and easier than the original strain of COVID-19 . <p> It 's a lot to take in , especially as you 're starting to get used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to know about Delta based on the data so far . <h> Where did the Delta variant originate ? <p> The Delta variant , aka B.1.617.2 , was originally detected in India in December 2020 , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) . It 's actually a mutation or sub-variant of B.1.617 , the so-called " double mutant " strain that got plenty of attention in April . <p> " As these viruses mutate and develop , they look like your family tree , " John Sellick , DO , an infectious disease expert and professor of medicine at the University at Buffalo/SUNY , tells Health . " This particular sub-variant has wreaked havoc in India . " And now , it seems , it 's spreading across the globe . <p> Credit : Unsplash/Matteo Jorjoson <h> Is the Delta variant in the US ? <p> Yes . Currently , the Delta variant makes up about 6% of all COVID-19 cases in the US , Dr Fauci said . It 's not entirely clear when it first arrived in America . <h> Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variant has several mutations on the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 , which can help it spread more easily than other forms of the virus . The CDC specifically says that this variant has a " potential reduction " in the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine , and a " potential reduction " in the ability of some monoclonal antibody treatments to work against the virus . <p> " A variant like this can rapidly take over and become the primary strain circulating in that region , " Stanley Weiss , MD , professor of medicine at the Rutgers New Jersey Medical School and professor of biostatistics and epidemiology at the Rutgers School of Public Health , tells Health . " That indicates that a variant has survival advantages . In places such as India where we 've seen so many people infected and so much disease , there 's evidence that this can spread quickly . " <p> Experts are also concerned because " the variant has the potential to at least partially evade the protection of the vaccine , " William Schaffner , MD , an infectious disease specialist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells Health . He compares Delta to B.1.351 ( now called Beta ) , which was originally detected in South Africa . " There is a chance that this can make you sick , even if you 're been vaccinated , " Dr Schaffner says . <p> Delta is also potentially problematic because " it 's clear that young people are at risk , " including those who are n't yet eligible for the COVID-19 vaccine , Dr Weiss says . <h> What are the symptoms of the Delta variant ? <p> The Times of Indiasays that Delta has been linked with more GI issues , including diarrhoea , stomach pain , loss of appetite , and nausea , but that 's mostly anecdotal at this point . <p> There 's not a lot of data on this just yet , Dr Sellick says . He recommends keeping an eye out for the usual COVID-19 symptoms , including : <p> -- Fever or chills <p> -- Cough <p> -- Shortness of breath or difficulty breathing <p> -- Fatigue <p> -- Muscle or body aches <p> -- Headache <p> -- New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Congestion or runny nose <p> -- Nausea or vomiting <p> -- Diarrhoea <p> Credit : Unsplash/National Cancer Institute <h> Are vaccines effective against the Delta variant ? <p> Yes-ish . The CDC cites data from a study of COVID-19 cases in 44 counties in California , which found that COVID-19 variants with an L452R mutation , which Delta has , can cause a two-fold reduction in neutralising titers in people who have been fully vaccinated against COVID-19 . ( Neutralising titers help target and take out a virus , and they tend to correlate with the level of protection offered by a vaccine . ) <p> How much less protective the COVID-19 vaccines are against Delta in the real world is n't clear at this point , Dr Schaffner says . " Even if this variant can partially evade protection of the vaccine , the more people who are vaccinated , the less apt this is to spread , " he says . <p> The information in this story is accurate as of press time .

The result is a plethora of mining projects springing up across Europe . <h> ' Horrific ' ecological footprint <p> The plan has angered environmentalists because of what one , who did not want to be named , described as the " horrific " ecological footprint of lithium mining on soil , water and air , as well as increased carbon emissions , which , ironically , is what the EU wants to curb . <p> The rush for lithium , said environmentalists , is difficult to square with the EU 's desire to be a world leader in climate change and environmental legislation . <p> " It is not only a dichotomy , I would even go as far as saying it 's an hypocrisy , because right now we 're dealing with an issue of over-consumption that is driving the ecological and climate crisis , " said Diego Francesco Marin , environmental justice specialist at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of civil society organisations . <h> " <p> This project is being sold from an environmental perspective as getting us towards the green transition and towards net zero , but at a huge cost . <p> He pointed to plans in the Jadar valley in Serbia by Rio Tinto to open an underground lithium mine which the company said could produce enough to meet the EU 's needs for decades . But this is a region where the main economic activity is farming , people typically live low-impact lives and are very attached to the land . <p> " This project is being sold from an environmental perspective as getting us towards the green transition and towards net zero , but at a huge cost , " he said . Rio Tinto declined to comment . <p> In response , an EU official told China Dialogue that the economic importance and supply risk for lithium -- the factors used to determine criticality -- have increased " significantly " since the last analysis in 2017 . " Given the economic and technological relevance of this resource , as well as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensure that the European economy can benefit from a sustainable and resilient supply of lithium , " said the official . <h> Lithium , the new critical raw material <p> Last September 's strategy plan was crucial for miners , as for the first time it put lithium on its list of critical raw materials , which benefit from special treatment in the EU 's industrial strategy . For example , they may be subsidised beyond levels normally allowed under EU state aid law . <p> This extension of its list was prompted by the huge disruptions to global supply chains as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic . Added to that are rising geopolitical tensions , notably with China , stoking further fears about supply chains . <p> Johanna Lehne , policy officer at sustainability think-tank E3G , said : " There 's a sense that there 's a potential here for China in the future to use the fact that other countries are dependent on these particular materials in the political context . " <p> These raw materials also form an important part of the EU 's twin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green transition and the digital transition ( for which lithium is also crucial ) and create more jobs and growth within Europe . <h> Higher standards <p> The mining industry says lithium extraction is cleaner than it once was and that thanks to superior environmental legislation in the EU , producing in Europe would be a more responsible way to secure supply . <p> " Mining in Europe is to the highest standards and respecting all of the legislation . And we all know that we have a lot of legislation , and we rightly have good legislation , which is steering and balancing the societal ambition from pure exploitation to a society which is in balance and sustainable , " said Rolf Kuby , director of Euromines , an industry association . <p> Much depends though on the implementation . Sara Matthieu , member of the European Parliament 's Greens , said : " We think that in comparison with most other places in the world , standards in the EU are higher . This does n't mean there are no problems with mining operations at all . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The EuGeLi project in Alsace , led by French mining Group Eramet , would extract lithium from subterranean brines used to produce geothermal energy . <p> Eramet chief executive Christel Boies said : " The critical issue for lithium mining is the consumption of water in areas that are already overstretched . We have 12 patents on a technology that significantly reduces the impact of the water usage . There are technologies , as with our technology , that are really environmentally friendly . " <p> According to the European Geothermal Energy Council , such methods of production are also cleaner because extraction is done underground , no fluids or gases are released and , by using the geothermal renewable energy , they are zero-emission . <p> The council 's policy chief Sanjeev Kumar said this method would mean Europe could " avoid what we see in Chile " where huge land masses are devoted to lithium extraction . He also said the potential is huge , citing the Vulcan Energy Resources plant in Germany 's Rhine Valley which could produce enough lithium for 400 million electric vehicles . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the EEB said : " But it still does n't answer a larger question . Who are the people on the ground that are going to be severely affected by these projects ? Because all mining projects have an ecological footprint . " <h> " <p> Hydrogen vehicles might compete for a share of the market but given the costs , technological and infrastructural constraints , it is much more likely that the electric vehicle will dominate the mix . <p> Maria Pastukhova , policy analyst , E3G <h> Demand in question <p> Whether or not lithium may be extracted using clean processes , it 's not clear to many analysts that Europe needs to produce any lithium on its own territory or whether it needs to have as much lithium as it has projected . <p> The demand projections reflect current policies and ambitions . " Based on different technologies , for example , the use of lithium could be severely decreased , or based on increased public transportation , or just heavily rethinking how we do our cities , " said Marin at EEB , adding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these technologies because there 's no need for an alternative . " <p> He pointed to a recent OECD report which forecast that total transport CO2 emissions given today 's policies will still increase by 16 per cent by 2050 , compared to 2015 levels . " The expected emissions reductions from these policies will be more than offset by increased transport demand , " said the report . More ambitious policies ( including shared mobility and better urban planning ) in cities , for example , could bring about a decrease of 22 per cent in urban transport activity compared to current projections , and a consequent reduction in CO2 emissions in such areas of as much as 80 per cent . <p> There are also lithium alternatives for electric vehicles , including-'vehicles powered by sustainably produced hydrogen . However , analysts said there needs to be more research and development in this area . <p> " Hydrogen vehicles might compete for a share of the market but given the costs , technological and infrastructural constraints , it is much more likely that the electric vehicle will dominate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E3G . <p> Sodium batteries are an attractive alternative to lithium batteries as the chemical properties are similar . Sodium is much more widely available and its ecological footprint is much lower , though Pastukhova said that so far , the batteries are generally heavier and less powerful . " But in recent years , we 've seen some development . Still , this technology is not yet mature and needs much more investment in research and development before it can compete with lithium-ion on the market . " <p> She said that what the EU needs to do is to " take a more holistic approach " to the transport sector . " Cars , whether internal combustion engine drive or electric , remain cars . They take space and have a heavy carbon footprint from the whole production process . Smart city planning , pushing for more cycling , shorter walking distances , remote office etc are just as needed . " <p> Aside from alternatives for individual vehicles , environmentalists argue there is not enough attention paid in the European Commission 's strategy to recycling of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it seeks to rid itself of its dependency on oil but looks in danger of replacing it with a dependency on lithium . <p> Matthieu at the European Parliament said : " We should work on ambitious circular economy policies such as ambitious product design requirements . We also want to drastically increase collection rates of waste products . " <p> A proposal for a new batteries regulation was published last December , which should prompt more recycling . Rio Tinto , for example , announced in May a deal with battery technology group InoBat to create a " cradle-to-cradle " manufacturing and recycling value chain . This means producing components that can be truly recycled at the end of their life , imitating nature 's cycle where everything can either be reused in some form or returned to the environment without causing damage . <p> What is clear is that Europeans are very attached to their personal vehicles . A report published in June by the European Environment Agency showed that average emissions for new passenger cars increased in 2019 , led by an appetite for sport utility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out more electric vehicles more urgent , despite the need for so much lithium . <p> Henrike Hahn , member of the European Parliament for the Greens , said : " What should be kept in mind is that often the increased input of critical raw materials in green technologies can lead to net beneficial effects for the environment . By using lithium and cobalt in batteries to build electric vehicles ... huge volumes of fossil fuels needed to fuel internal combustion engine vehicles are saved . " <p> For the local residents in the many areas where Europe is pushing for mines , these arguments do not change the fact they will lose land and a way of life established for millennia to ensure the comfort of those in the cities , explained Marin . <p> " The reason why I call it an hypocrisy is because we say yes , we are going to lead to net zero , but we are recreating these issues that are colonial in a sense where people in the peripheries are meant to provide for the consumption of the core which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Thanks for reading to the end of this story ! <p> We would be grateful if you would consider joining as a member of The EB Circle .

She 's also a wife , a mother , a daughter and , as Crystal Lee observes , someone who knows how to love . <p> Dana Cheong is standing between two giant strobe lights with her hands on her head . She 's wearing an Alexander McQueen dress and high jewellery pieces from Bvlgari 's Serpenti Collection . Holding the pose , she breaks into a little dance as the photographer pauses to look at his shots on the computer screen . As soon as he returns , she snaps back to business . <p> That insouciant bop is a glimpse of her dynamic personality : vivacious , friendly , playful , elegant and at ease with herself . She radiates warmth and light from every ounce of her being . " I believe in positivity , " she says , when we met at her studio a week before the cover shoot . " For the people I love , be it my family or friends close to my heart , I feel like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy . But you know what ? At the end of the day , the light bounces back . So I try to start a fire . If you catch it , you light up , and it will shine on me . It 's a chain reaction . " <h> Deep familial bonds <p> Therein lies Dana 's single , most important goal in life : to be a source of light for the people around her . Growing up in a tight-knit kampung community in Kuala Lumpur with three generations under one roof offered a young Dana a model of love , warmth and kinship . " Because my grandparents lived with us , our house was constantly full of people , " she recalls . " My uncles , aunties and cousins often visited . Neighbours came around with food they cooked . I was the happiest in the house , always running out to see who rang the doorbell . " <p> But like Ariel in The Little Mermaid , she was captivated by the world outside of her bubble . " I think reading Enid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little bit , " she says with a chuckle . " I wanted to go on adventures . So when I was 12 , I told my dad that I did n't want to stay home any more . I wanted to study abroad . " <p> Her father , a businessman and an agent for Ford Motor , caved after a year of persuasion . At 13 , she left her motherland for a secondary school education in Singapore . Then , when it was time for college , she headed to Melbourne for university . " I was n't quite ready to enter the workforce when I got my degree at 20 years old , so I kept on studying , " Dana adds . She was great at it too , having obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree in Logic , Philosophy ; a Graduate Diploma in Operations Research ; and a Master 's in Economics . <p> Dana was all set to start a banking career in Sydney when she met her husband , Darren , on a graduation trip with her cousin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had common friends . Then from there , there was no turning back . I packed my bags , came home and got married . It was a very drastic change , but I felt like it was time to settle down . " <p> So she did what her mother and grandmother had done : give her life to the family . " I was brought up in an old value system , which , I feel , influenced me , " explains the mother of a school psychologist and a Cambridge undergraduate . Does she harbour any regrets ? " Not at all . I 'm doing what I really , really like to do -- which is to always be there for my family . Beatrice and Brandon both thanked me for the way I brought them up . Surely I must have done something right . " <p> Does she feel estranged from the outside world ? " Just because I did n't go out to work does n't mean I 'm out of touch with what 's happening .

" <h> Love is a many-splendoured thing <p> There 's this saying that goes , " To love others you must first love yourself " , and it seems like Dana 's got that all figured out . Amid providing for her family , she makes it a point to carve out time for personal indulgences and growth -- most of which revolves around moving the body . Not long after the birth of her second child , she started learning pilates under Italian instructor Ivana Danielli , who introduced her to the wonders of Gyrotonic and Gyrokinesis . <p> At first , the mobility and strength practice was a supplement to her dance routines , which began with hip-hop and ended with competitive Latin ballroom . It was only after she hung up her dancing shoes ( " the shoes , not the dancing " , she clarifies ) that she took Gyrotonic and Gyrokinesis more seriously . " Competition takes a lot out of your body , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I could n't go any further . So I went all-in with Gyrotonic and Gyrokinesis , taking up teacher training programmes because that 's how you 'll learn everything . " <p> Today , she runs hour-long , one-on-one sessions out of her studio , which she calls her " sanctuary " . Even when classes are suspended in Phase 2 ( Heightened Alert ) , Dana still pops in every day to train . " I was in my late 20s when I first picked up Gyrotonic . And you would have thought that you know your body well after coexisting with it for decades , right ? Well , no ; I realised I did n't know mine , " she adds . " See , I 'm a bubbly person . I move fast and want to do many things . Gyrotonic keeps me grounded and centred . It helped me understand my body . I became more aware of my movements , positions , posture and everything else . You know , we all only have one body to carry us through life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without hurting it too much . " <p> As to what she puts on her body , Dana is , unsurprisingly , big on comfort and connection . " I do n't like to look like a princess or be wearing something overly elegant . Ultimately , I think one should be free , not to be constrained and bothered by what people think . " To wit , one of her favourite pieces in her jewellery collection is a chunky gold link chain necklace by Bvlgari , with an ancient coin depicting the profile of Roman Emperor Nero , bezel-set within a gold hexagon-shaped plaque . " I was a hip-hop girl , right ? I fell in love with it . I also have this joke about how I went to Rome and brought back a boyfriend called Nero , and my husband was okay with it .

@@43211234 <p> With an impressive string of record-setting timepieces under its belt -- seven in seven years to be exact , Bvlgari has shifted the paradigm of modern-day haute horlogerie . Highlighting its watchmaking prowess in a deft balance of savoir faire and innovative aesthetics , the maison has undoubtedly established itself as a Master of Estetica della Meccanica -- Italian for Aesthetic of Mechanics . <p> The unique fusion of cutting-edge design and unparalleled technical expertise of Swiss watchmaking is evident in Bvlgari 's mastery of hyper-complicated watches , which includes an exquisite range of chiming timepieces . <p> From left : The Bvlgari two-hammer Octo Finissimo Minute Repeater Carbon , the Octo Roma Carillon Tourbillon with three hammers and the ultra-complicated Octo Roma Grande Sonnerie Perpetual Calendar with four hammers <p> Further cementing its leadership in this field , the house presents another Sinfonia della Meccanica ( Symphony of Mechanics ) with the Octo Roma Carillon Tourbillon . The creation is a beautiful combination of two of its predecessors -- the minimalist and austere two-hammer Octo Finissimo Minute Repeater Carbon , and the opulent yet complex Octo Roma Grande Sonnerie Perpetual Calendar that is equipped with four hammers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch Division , explains the reason behind creating the new timepiece , " We wanted to develop a very modern look , a look that does n't reflect the past like most of the current chiming watches do . Instead , we want to project the watch into the 21st century because we see our chiming collections as an extraordinary platform for future modern product developments . " <h> Music , the Bvlgari way <p> A tremendous undertaking requiring utmost precision and technique , a symphony is a large-scale orchestral interlude in which a maestro coordinates every instrument . Expressing the emotion of music with the tiniest complex mechanics is something that can exist only in the watchmaking universe . <p> In creating the Octo Roma Carillon Tourbillon , the Bvlgari master watchmaker assumes the maestro 's position as he selects , finishes and assembles hundreds of micro components to produce the perfect mechanism . A challenging technical and engineering feat that only the best in the field can execute , Bvlgari chiming watches can require up to 1,200 parts , as in the case of the Grande Sonnerie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the construction of the calibre BVL428 . Manufactured entirely in-house , the all-new manually wound movement is 8.35mm thick and comprises a total of 432 components . As power and clarity of the sound are imperative in a striking watch , the generous proportions of the 44mm watch case are designed to maximise sound reproduction . This allows for increased torque of the three-hammer construction as well as increased power of sound generation . <p> " While developing this piece , we concentrated our efforts on the magnification of the sound . We started from a white sheet of paper , and we identified some fields to address to optimise sound propagation . We fixed the hammers onto the case of the watch in order to facilitate the transmission of sound waves , we used titanium for the case ( a very good transmitter of waves ) and we emptied the case itself as much as possible . We also designed the bridges of the calibre to make the propagation of the sound wave easy inside the case as well . You can see this very special grid delivers a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Loud and proud <p> The openworked titanium middle or caseband was specially conceived for maximum sound resonance . Resembling ventilation slats , the case sides are hollowed out to reduce the amount of metal . Additionally , three openings that correspond with the three chimes allow more sound to exit the chamber . The caseback is also hollowed out and revamped with a meticulously crafted titanium grid that protects this resonance zone and allows sound to be carried to the outside . Meanwhile , the function of the sound mechanism is ensured by a spring contained in a barrel-shaped container drilled directly into the bridge . <p> While showcasing traditional complications in an ultra-modern setting is something Bvlgari excels in , the maison kicks things up a notch here by reversing the conventional arrangement of a chiming watch movement in the Octo Roma Carillon Tourbillon . This means that the three hammers and three gongs that are usually hidden on the side of the wrist are now on the dial side , so that they can be seen in action without the wearer removing the watch . The movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reserve of 75 hours for the movement at full charge . This can be tracked via the exhibition caseback where the rack and snails are displayed as well . <p> It takes time to create a complex movement for a timepiece as special as this , as Pin points out , " We speak here of a few years to develop such a movement . This time , we 're lucky to be able to base our development work on a historical calibre from the Daniel Roth portfolio . However , it still took us three years to modernise the structure and add our own developments to it . In this case , high technologies are central , but the traditional manual work is mandatory to fine-tune the performance . Thanks to our watchmakers , we can adjust components individually , especially for the chiming system . " <h> Beauty in complexity <p> The gongs of the watch are created in multiple stages . First , they are folded and formed by hand before being annealed , or hardened , at a temperature of 900 deg C. Next , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oven at 500 deg C to impart crystalline resonance to the metal . Like certain components of the striking mechanism , they are lengthened with a file to refine the ringing chords . The melodic sequence of this three-hammer carillon sounding three tones plays the note C for the hours , followed by the mid-re-C notes for the quarters , and the mid-note for the minutes . <p> The black DLC-coated titanium case with its matte finish , architecture of the movement and slatted bridges come together like a well-orchestrated symphony to reveal the true beauty of the mechanism . Hammers , gongs , tourbillon cage at 6 o'clock and perforated surfaces are crafted in alternating polished steel , while the finely wrought mainplate and bridges have been treated with PVD . The high-tech carbon-based vacuum deposition is elegant in a sleek deep black . Its construction is protected by a titanium case fitted with a push-button on the left side for the carillon . <p> While Pin agrees that the timepiece is one for collectors and connoisseurs , he hopes to pique the interest of more enthusiasts , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the interest of watch amateurs , who wo n't usually consider this product category . This was why we went for a very modern design with the titanium with a black DLC treatment . " <p> Available in a limited edition of only 15 pieces , each Octo Roma Carillon Tourbillon is engraved with a number from 1 to 15 on the crown to indicate its singularity within the edition .

Instead of The Void being a means to an end , it 's more of a strange place of endless opportunity which also coincidentally encapsulates disturbing echoes from the characters ' lives . <h> WHO HE BECOMES <p> For both Sylvie ( Sophie Di Martino ) and Hiddleston , they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ betrayal and revenge , which ultimately lead to loneliness and unfulfilled ' glorious purpose ' . With Hiddleston finding a connection with Sylvie as they ponder over their purpose on Lamentis 1 , it pushes him to question if there could be a possibility , he was destined for more than just a throne . <p> Enter the Loki Variants . As humorous as they are , they make up Hiddleston in all aspects of his life . It places him in a retrospective position as they talk about their own journey : Kid Loki ( Jack Veal ) killing Thor , Boastful Loki ( DeObia Oparei ) lying his way through his own story as a Loki should , and of course Classic Loki whose main goal is to just survive . Honorary mention goes to Alligator Loki who adds the touch of mischief to the mix . Of course , a Loki episode would n't be complete without an overexaggerated egoistic version of Hiddleston , hence President Loki . <p> Ultimately , it is Classic Loki ( Richard E. Grant ) who puts Hiddleston in a retrospective position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story takes us straight to the beginning of Avengers : Infinity War , when Thanos intercepts the Asgardian ship . <p> Richard E. Grant as Classic Loki <p> It answers a question Marvel fans have been asking : Was Loki truly dead ? The answer ? Not at that moment . Apparently , Classic Loki cast a projection of himself so real , even the Mad Titan believed it . He spent his life hiding as inanimate debris on a remote planet until he got lonely . <p> Albeit being the oldest and wisest among the Variants , Classic Loki in his sixties Jack Kirby costume has embraced his lack of will and endless self-deprecation . It is a nod to Hiddleston 's potential future . Could it be that not only will he end up alone , but he 'd also lose all the fight left in him ? <h> WHO HE IS <p> Hiddleston seems exhausted by their presence . Who would n't be drained by constant negativity ? Feel free to disagree , but the turning point of this episode was him standing up and attempting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they all sit and cower in fear underground , Alioth-the giant cloud trans-temporal being- looms over The Void , growing hungrier . <p> There seems to be a new type of fire ignited in Hiddleston 's heart , not born out of spite or revenge . It is true that the right circumstance brings out the best in people , and for our Loki , it was only a matter of time . As much as he has denied it throughout the MCU , Hiddleston and Thor have more in common than he realises . <p> This newfound fire is what ties Hiddleston and Sylvie together . Sylvie 's journey has always been a need . It is that very desire that put her and Hiddleston in the same Variant circle . Lokis ' are known to have no fight , and yet both do . So much so that Sylvie self-prunes into The Void to look for answers despite the unknown fight ahead of her . <p> As Mobius-who also found himself in the void after proclaiming his love for jet-skis- saves Sylvie from Alioth , they both reunite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hiddleston -- sincerity . <p> President Loki <p> Mobius uses the TemPad to transport himself back to the TVA to " burn the place down " , but not before Hiddleston embraces him as an old friend , finishing off with a sincere ' thank you ' ; unspeakable of someone who 's been labelled a self-centred liar . <p> Hiddleston and Sylvie trudge off to defeat Alioth , with Sylvie 's plans to enchant it . The plan almost seems futile until Classic Loki makes his dramatic appearance . Contrary to popular Loki belief , he does n't fight with knives or believe in them . Instead , he conjures up a life-sized Asgard illusion that is bigger and more potent than any power we 've seen Hiddleston emit , as a distraction for Alioth . <p> Seeing someone engulfed in defeat give off such stunning power and magic was the push both Hiddleston and Sylvie needed to clear their cloud of doubt . Aside from its ravenous hunger pangs , the enchanting of Alioth also symbolises a clearer vision for both Hiddleston and Sylvie . <p> Loki is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloud monster -- their self-doubt- revealed a new discovery and finally a new adventure-potentially a bigger insight into a misunderstood Loki-that we are all looking forward to in the upcoming finale . <p> On the whole , Loki has been a cohesive teaser of the multiverse and a reminder to us long-term fans that the MCU is never what it seems . With theories being thrown around as to the castle that looms in the distance behind Alioth , introduction of Nexus events and the new spotlight on time , we 're all on the edge of our seats .

" I am a strong believer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also means not only adopting best practices , but also evaluating the best fit . It 's not about the number of initiatives , but more on their impact to the people , company and society .

Safinas says : " We prepare our people beyond surviving in the VUCA world , but to thrive , continue to deliver value in a positive and progressive work environment , as our DNA of #LifeAtAAGI . " <p> Such a strong talent strategy is certainly needed , given that the pandemic has accelerated certain desired changes which may have taken a longer time to achieve under normal circumstances . For AAGI , this has resulted in the potential to reimagine the way the company works in managing employees and customers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunities and accelerated digital transformation . Ultimately , all of this requires new skills , processes , technology , and culture . <p> Safinas explains : " The first priority for the company is to have adaptive leaders who can survive significant unforeseen and foreseen changes in the VUCA world , this includes both the top management and people managers who have a direct impact on employees ' performance and company 's success . " <p> " We need innovators to reinvent the core of the insurance business , automation , data insights , and intelligence to transform and switch from surviving to thriving mode for the future . " <p> To deliver upon these business needs of nurturing adaptive leaders and innovators , Safinas and her HR team are focusing on 3 main pillars - workforce , workplace and marketplace , all in a bid to answer one fundamental question : " Do we have the right skillsets and mindset to bring AAGI to the next level ? " <p> Under the first pillar , workforce , AAGI focuses on building capability and capacity of people , beyond technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the latter is the development of a ' growth mindset ' . <p> At AAGI , the first step to building a ' growth mindset ' is leaning . " When there 's a will , there 's a way ... the pandemic poses opportunities where employees realise the importance of building their own competitive advantage to stay relevant and be resilient . " <p> To support this endeavour , learning offerings have been completely democratised , through various interventions such as e-learning , workshops , celebrating success stories of AAGI employees , sharing of flagship best practices with other AXA entities outside Malaysia , mentoring sessions , experiential learning via competitions , lunch &amp; learn sessions , focus groups , partnerships with industry experts such as 30% Club , Leadwomen , CADs , Uipath &amp; many more . <p> Another key initiative is the introduction of AXA Academy , formed in-house and supported by collaborations with industry experts .

" Sustaining this is of the utmost importance , especially when most employees are working from home , " affirms Safinas . <p> Technology : A prime catalyst , with an impact on employee satisfaction , motivation , and engagement . <p> Marketplace , the third pillar , focuses on strengthening brand presence by promoting AXA as the preferred employer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Forward outlook : The role of CPO and EXCOs <p> Safinas ' action plan for HR is inspiring indeed , and one of the reasons behind that is she firmly believes the role of CPO is undergoing a radical transformation , given how the pandemic has taught HR to be more creative and innovative by curating new ' best practices ' . <p> Other than aligning towards key trends , she calls upon her peers in HR leadership to learn beyond just one 's own industry and competitors to fully evaluate opportunities in shaping a sustainable and future-focused people agenda . <p> She voices : " Let 's be courageous to play a major role in influencing the direction of organsational change by challenging the status quo through divergent thinking and disruptive ideas . The CPO will play an instrumental role in embedding the culture of new norms , with key focus on empowerment , collaboration , trust , empathy and inclusion . " <p> Beyond HR , we nudge Safinas to share a wish for her management peers as well - if she could get them to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they be ? <p> " If I could get my EXCOs to start one action , it will always be growth mindset -- where it talks about continuous learning , agility , lead new ways and disrupt the insurance industry .

@@43241239 <p> Formaldehyde is what crime shows tell us is used to preserve dead bodies , but it is also a colourless pungent gas that is used in building materials and furniture , and prolonged exposure can cause watery eyes , burning sensations in the nose , and throat , coughing , wheezing , nausea and skin irritation , among other things . It lingers in the air and can be found in furniture , wooden products , paint , wallpaper and varnishes . <p> With the world shifting to a state where we spend more time at home , the air quality matters more than ever , especially for those who have little kids at home and now you have a tool to protect against it . <p> Much like its predecessors , the product itself is of pretty standard design , and this specific model comes in two colours -- white gold and nickel gold , and both provide an elegant touch to their surroundings . Weighing 4.85kg , at a height of 1050mm and a width of 220mm , the Purifier Cool retains the compactness compared to other fans and air purifiers , making it a unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , thereby allowing for a more unobtrusive placement at home . The bonus is a 1.8m power cord , which allows it to be moved a distance away from a power point . <p> Although the box that it comes in may look huge in comparison , it 's due to the fact that the unit itself comes with filters that have yet to be attached . However , just like Lego , it is a quick snap-on that makes the set-up a breeze , in our case , approximately three minutes or less . Simply snap the filters onto the base with the cylindrical grill covers on top of it and you are done . <p> The primary purifier here is the HEPA+ Carbon Filter , which captures air pollutants and 99.95% of particles , and regurgitates clean air that is safe to breathe in . According to Dyson , the filter is not the only section that 's sealed to HEPA standard , as the whole unit itself is built to prevent pollutants from leaking back into the air in the process . What goes inside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how do you know if it 's turned on and working ? Well , it 's actually not easy to tell . The fan and the filter work as one unit and there 's the Dyson Purifier Cool Formaldehyde mobile app that gives homeowners the ability to track the air quality around the fan conveniently . Whilst the fan does have a built-in screen that states the levels of air quality , it is rather small and hard to monitor at a far distance so the Dyson Link , available on both iOS and Android devices , is much more efficient and effective . <p> We put the purifier to the test and almost triggered the smoke alarm in the office with our massive cookout . The Dyson Purifier Cool Formaldehyde was able to detect the impurities found in the air after some extensive frying and according to the air quality scale , the room was filled with an extremely high level of microscopic particles and VOCs . Using the auto mode , it took about an hour and a half for the air quality to return back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole area roughly the size of a living and dining room in a 4-room HDB flat . If you are looking to speed the process by a couple of minutes , you can always run your purifier at a high speed . <p> Air cleaning aside , there 's also the fan and since it 's app-controlled , you can use it as how you would with the remote it comes with -- make it oscillate , adjust fan speed and level , and even turn the fan-out or schedule night mode which automatically turns off the fan at a certain time . Yet , having an old-fashioned remote that can power the unit on and off is still unbeatable at the end of the day , but to unlock the full features of the fan the app is the way to go . <p> There 's also the IoT option of linking the fan to the app , which allows users to activate voice control , making it compatible with voice services such as Amazon Alexa , Google Assistant and even Apple 's Siri . <p> As for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its bladeless feature . A quick wipe down of the unit with a cloth would do the trick . The filters are also a breeze to disassemble -- just push down the latches on the side of the grills and it will pop out automatically giving access to the filters . Once retrieved , just wash them with cold water and dry them thoroughly before placing them back into the unit . The current state of the filters and whether they need cleaning or replacing , are available through the app , or you can also monitor it from the product 's built-in screen . <p> One prominent complaint of early Dyson bladeless fan models was its noise , but with this new range , it seems like it is not an issue any longer . It 's not entirely silent , but the churn of the motor is tolerable up to a speed level of 6 . However , running it a 7 or higher does produce an obvious hum that can get quite distracting in the long run . <p> The Dyson Purifier Cool Formaldehyde is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't have the equipment needed to test the cleaning of formaldehyde in the air -- we 'll just have to take Dyson 's word for it . If you 're home in your study , working or studying for extended periods , this specific model offers ventilation and purification , and while it works well in the living room , the smaller size of a bedroom will allow the device to run its purification more efficiently . <p> The Dyson Air Purifier is available for purchase on Dyson 's official store for S$999 , and it comes with a two-year warranty and a free 14-day return in case of any issues with the product .

@@43241240 <h> Geek Review -- Masters of the Universe : Revelation ( Netflix ) <p> They say you can never go back again , and sometimes , it 's better not to . <p> Masters of the Universe : Revelation , the latest cartoon revisitation from streamer Netflix has landed and what 's not to love about it ? Unlike the recent She-Ra and the Princesses of Power , which uses the name and concept , but not the legacy of the franchise , Revelation is intended to be a sequel of the hugely popular 1980s cartoon and toyline . This means a return to Eternia , where we find out what happens to the characters many of us grew up with , from Prince Adam , Teela , Man-At-Arms , Sorceress , and Cringer , to Skeletor and Evil Lynn . <p> Masterminded by comic book fanboy and cult filmmaker Kevin Smith , expectations have been running high , especially with the recent well-received trailer that evoked nostalgia alongside a high-octane compilation of new footage from the series . But while sentiment is a powerful tool , few remember that the original series , He-Man and the Master of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a great representation of good vs evil , where hulking alpha men fought against monstrous creatures , with both sides filled with characters possessing one unique power or ability , aside from their muscular form , but the villain-of-the-week approach got tired really fast . <p> Each episode ended with a lesson of the day , and while there were fights galore , much of the combat was done via wrestling movies of tossing and throwing , and as menacing as Skeletor looked , he was more of a bumbling oaf who longed to enter Castle Greyskull to claim the source of great power as his own . <p> From the very first moments of Revelation , it is obvious that Smith has great love for the source material , even if he is also open to revisiting some of the more obscure elements of the franchise in this short , five-episode Season 1 . With the dozens of characters at his disposal , Smith mainly makes use of the classics and adds an impressive voice cast to the project , including Man-At-Arms ( Liam Cunningham ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michelle Gellar ) , King Randor ( Diedrich Bader ) , Queen Marlena ( Alicia Silverstone ) , Roboto ( Justin Long ) , Beastman ( Kevin Michael Richardson ) , Tri-Klops ( Henry Rollins ) , Trap Jaw ( Diedrich Bader ) , Faker , Evil Lynn ( Lena Headey ) and Mer-Man ( Kevin Conroy ) . <p> But while Revelation sells itself as a sequel to the original , a lot of what we 're getting are throwaway references that yes , this show follows the original , but nothing else . Characters have gone through a redesign , even if they retain the same outlook and colour scheme , but the music is something new altogether that does n't pay homage to the original , or even lift elements that evoke a throwback . That famous tune that accompanies Adam 's transformation to He-Man ? It 's gone . <p> It would be unfair to note that the voice acting is all different , since some of the original voice actors might have since retired , but there 's not even an attempt to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Prince Adam and Skeletor . Instead of having Adam and his alter-ego He-Man be physically similar , Adam , voiced by Chris Wood , now looks like a scrawny ( when compared to his muscular compatriots ) teenager , and while there is nothing wrong with Wood , John Erwin is sorely issued . Meanwhile , Skeletor has ditched his more clumsy approach , and Mark Hamil , of Star Wars fame , is channelling more Joker menace here . Alan Oppenheimer , who voiced Skeletor in the original is present , this time as Moss Man . <p> Which audiences barely have time to care about these two changes but wo n't have time to because ( SPOILERS AHEAD ) both Prince Adam/He-Man and Skeletor disappear at the end of the first episode , making Revelations more of a , Where 's Waldo ? <p> Now we know that He-Man is not in the show 's title cards as the rest of the season follows Teela on her journey to find Prince Adam 's Power Sword , to return magic back to Eternia . But with He-Man gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have gained a greater foothold on parts of the planet , as the good guys fight for what remains of the planet . <p> If these elements sound vaguely familiar , that 's because this particular story has been told in the comics , in issues 12 and 13 of the Masters of the Universe comic published by Marvel/Star Comics in 1988 . In that story , Lifetime , the Power Sword gets lost in time and a young Prince Adam finds himself in the future where , without the sword , He-Man never reappears , and evil has taken over Eternia . This leaves the heroes on a quest to find the sword , to overthrow the forces of evil . <p> This is not to say Smith lifted his sequel from the old comics , but the story beats are similar , and audiences would expect more from one of geekdom 's fan favourite writers . This is the guy whose Guardian Devil storyline from the Daredevil comics remains one of the high points of the long-running series , and whose resurrection of Green Arrow inthe DC Comics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe if Netflix would have just allowed Smith to call this series what it really is -- Teela and Her Sisters Look For the Masters of the Universe . <p> In a world where magic is almost gone , the daughter of the Sorceress ( yes , Smith references this long-running secret in Revelations but never spells it out for the Woman-At-Arms ) cobbles together a rag-tag team of warriors , including one from the side of evil , as they attempt to locate both halves of the Power Sword , in Eternia 's heaven and in hell . As this is a Kevin Smith project , there are multiple references to the old show that would make fans go , I know what he 's referring to , as well as some changes that seem more cosmetic than necessary . Oh , there 's also a notable character death ( or two , depending on how you look at it ) that seems rather unnecessary and like an Orko spell gone wrong , one hopes that this gets corrected in subsequent seasons . <p> Is it necessary to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but there 's little value in it . The group also introduces Andra to the cartoon for the first time , but when she was first introduced in the Marvel/Star comics back in the 80s , she served as a supporting white character . Changing her race does little here , as does her character , in the grand scheme of things in this series . <p> That said , Revelations does tap into some of the lore of the franchise , such as who Teela 's mother is , if Queen Marlena knew if her son was the most powerful man in the universe , what secrets lie in Castle Greyskull , and who forged the Power Sword . After countless reboots and reimaginations over the last three decades , it 's nice to know what is regarded as canon . Still , these are the easy elements to incorporate , and with Evil Lynn 's augmented role in this series , Smith could have taken an additional step and addressed a lesser known story point , that Queen Marlena was originally an astronaut from Earth , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beastman , and Dr. Scope , who ultimately became Evil Lynn , Beastman and Tri-Klops in the series . <p> On the surface , five episodes for this seems short , but like the new Transformers : War for Cybertron trilogy , also on Netflix , there is just something missing in the entire presentation . Something familiar is new again , but there are many notable things missing and fans will wonder what happened . <p> Maybe we 've all grown up , and we should learn to accept that what we knew and loved as a child can never measure up under the scrutiny of modern lenses . And in this case , the powers of Netflix have given us a sequel , but it does n't quite have the power to retain the magic . <h> GEEK REVIEW SCORE <p> Summary <p> A twist in the final episode sets up a new season , but to be honest , let 's just bring back Hordak and Etheria , and the real She-Ra is the hero we 're all holding out for . <h> Overall <p> Hsals needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bank account to pay for all the toys , collectibles and other geek related items that companies are churning out .

Currently , regulators in China are considering a range of potential punishments , including a fine , which is likely bigger than Alibaba 's record of US$2.8 billion earlier this year , suspension of certain operations , introduction of a state-owned investor for Didi Chuxing , and even delisting or withdrawal of Didi 's US shares . <p> The news caused it 's stock price to drop significantly .

Each tracker cost between S$10.38 and S$24.90 , depending on the model . <p> It also found that some of the trackers had mouldy straps and watch faces , adding that the two-year warranty for the remaining 35 per cent will expire by December 2021 . <p> " Excess trackers not put to use by HPB had resulted in a significant sum of public funds wasted over the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deteriorate over time due to the expiry of warranty and technology obsolescence , " it asserted . <p> Following AGO 's observation , HPB carried out a full stock account in January this year and uncovered the full stock showed that the number of excess trackers was 341,208 , which amounted to S$5.39 million in total . <p> AGO also said HPB 's processes were " inadequate " in ensuring that the movement of fitness trackers was properly monitored and the trackers properly accounted for . <p> The receipt and distribution of the devices involved manual processes and multiple external parties such as suppliers and event organisers . <p> " However , there was no proper process to centrally monitor and account for the movement and stock of trackers . The records maintained were fragmented and incomplete , and there was no periodic reconciliation of the records with the stock on hand , " it noted . <p> There was also no documentary evidence on the scope or results of the annual stock checks carried out by HPB at an outsourced vendor 's warehouse . <p> AGO said that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trackers compared to records maintained by HPB and the vendor . <p> Following AGO 's checks , HPB consolidated its records and found that there was an estimated shortfall of 17,909 fitness trackers worth S$720,000 in total . <p> " However , given the fragmented and incomplete records , there was inadequate assurance that this represented the actual shortfall , " AGO stated . <h> Lapses in HPB 's loyalty programme <p> Meanwhile , AGO also found lapses in the management of HPB 's loyalty programme between April 2018 to June 2020 . <p> The loyalty programme launched by HPB in 2017 allows members to earn and accumulate health points through the Healthy 365 app which can then be used to redeem rewards issued by HPB or merchants . HPB will reimburse the merchants the value of e-vouchers used by members . <p> The lapses included control weaknesses in the creation and maintenance of loyalty programme member accounts , manual adjustments of health points and rewards , and monitoring of suspension of accounts . <p> " These weaknesses could expose HPB to the risk of individuals gaming the system by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points/redeem rewards , or making unauthorised adjustments of health points/rewards , " said AGO . <p> AGO found the use of 594 loyalty programme accounts belonging to deceased people , which were used to earn health points and redeem rewards , with 139 of the accounts created after the date of death . <p> A total of S$14,900 worth of health points were accumulated by these accounts , of which S$6,300 had been redeemed and paid for by HPB . <p> " This happened because HPB did not have guidelines on the monitoring and deactivation of LP accounts belonging to deceased persons . There were also no system checks in place to prevent the creation of LP accounts using NRIC numbers of deceased persons , " it added . <p> HPB said it has since blocked the use of 594 accounts belonging to deceased persons and had lodged a police report . <h> HPB 's response to AGO 's findings <p> In response to AGO , HPB explained that the excess trackers were due to over-procurement , given the over-estimation of demand at the onset or during the initial distribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trackers not given out for the season would be utilised for exchanges on an ongoing basis , it was challenging to achieve zero wastage as the trackers would have reached the end of useful life after two years and could not be utilised thereafter , " it said . <p> HPB also informed AGO that it had since begun to dispose of the excess trackers from NSC seasons 1 to 3 as these were " obsolete " . <p> CNA reported that HPB has issued a statement on Thursday noting that it has taken steps to remediate the lapses and strengthen its processes . <p> It noted that the number of sign-ups in the National Steps Challenge programme grew more than five-fold from 156,000 sign-ups in Season 1 to 900,000 in Season 5 . <p> HPB claimed that of the 341,208 excess trackers , 120,000 were still functional . <p> It added that close to 48,000 have been used for replacements and exchanges of faulty trackers and those with expired warranties . <p> " The remainder will continue to be allocated to replacements and exchanges as well as to support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and wellness initiatives , " the agency asserted . <p> HPB said it would be " more conservative " in its projections for future instalments of the programme , adding that additional purchases of trackers will be done only when excess bookings are received from participants . <p> The agency noted that user account suspensions will be automated by September this year , with regular reports generated for reviews . " Clean-up exercise " will also be conducted to block the use of unauthorised accounts , such as those registered using the NRICs of deceased people . <p> " HPB is in the process of ascertaining the amount of overpayments for such unauthorised accounts and will take action to claw back the rewards from those who had made improper redemptions , " said HPB . <h> Netizens say the fitness trackers " waste of taxpayers ' money " due to " poor quality " <p> Penning their thoughts under the comment section of CNA 's Facebook post , many netizens claimed to have problems with the fitness trackers , noting that the " poor quality " fitness trackers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ netizen wrote : " Waste of Taxpayers ' $ ...

" Our objective is still to become unconditionally associated with FSC and we will continue to make progress on the defined roadmap . " <h> No more hiding <p> Despite Korindo 's claim that it 's upholding environmental and human rights standards , the termination of its FSC membership indicates otherwise , according to US-based campaign organisation Mighty Earth , which first highlighted Korindo 's practices in Papua and reported the company to the FSC in 2017 . <p> " The FSC 's expulsion of Korindo provides more evidence that despite all its grandiose claims that it is embracing sustainability , the company still can not rouse itself to meet basic standards for environmentally responsible business in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocate at Mighty Earth . <p> And with Korindo 's disassociation from the FSC , the company can no longer use the certification council 's tree logo , which is meant to tell consumers that the product is sustainably sourced and produced . <p> " Although the FSC found that Korindo had violated its policy through vast deforestation and abuse of Indigenous people 's rights , Korindo has continued to spread false information about the severity of its actions and has used its continued association with FSC to greenwash its bad practices , " Rahmawati said . " With today 's announcement , Korindo ca n't hide behind the FSC anymore . " <p> Korindo 's disassociation is also a lesson for other companies that are engaging in unsustainable practices , she added . <p> " The FSC 's decision should serve as a warning to any company that thinks they can use greenwashing and legal intimidation to destroy forests and trample on Indigenous communities ' rights with impunity , " Rahmawati said . <p> Besides allegations of human rights violations and deforestation , Korindo was also at the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " payment made by the company and which played a role in its rapid expansion in Papua . <p> The investigation , a collaboration between Mongabay , The Gecko Project , the Korean Center for Investigative Journalism-Newstapa and Al Jazeera , found that the payment was made to a shadowy figure as Korindo secured the rights to large swaths of land in the province . <p> Mighty Earth said another indication that Korindo is not serious in meeting its sustainability commitments is a 2020 defamation suit filed by a Korindo supplier in Germany against civil society organisations that had been campaigning against the company . <p> Mighty Earth said the lawsuit is an example of what 's known as a strategic lawsuit against public participation , or SLAPP . This is a form of litigation that typically has little to no merit and is brought with the main aim of harassing and draining substantial resources from critics speaking out against those in power or on issues of the public interest . <p> " Korindo is clearly not acting in good faith , " said Hye Lyn Kim , a campaigner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Korindo is serious about improving its environmental and human rights performance to address its violations of FSC 's standards , it needs to restore the forest habitat it destroyed , pay restitution to affected Papuan Indigenous communities and stop its legal harassment of civil society groups who have tried to stand up to its abuses .

So the morning cleansing is really , really important to set your face for the whole entire day , " she says in Monday 's Instagram video . <p> Lopez then lathers up with the gel-creme cleanser and gently rinses with lukewarm water before patting her complexion dry with a white towel . Lopez says she 's such a fan of the cleanser , she has spare bottles in all corners of her ( um , gorgeous ) bathroom .

" It was designed to be able to use every single day under your makeup as a moisturiser , " she says . " Every . Single . Day .

@@43294238 <h> How Likely Will You Get Breast Cancer ? <p> Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women in Singapore and in many Western countries . Dr Tan Yah Yuen , breast surgeon at Mount Elizabeth Hospital , explains how risk assessment tools calculate your risk of breast cancer , and how doctors then determine preventive options based on your assessed risk . <p> There has been greater awareness of breast cancer in recent years because of the disease 's prevalence and partly due to the publicity created by an American actress , Angelina Jolie . Jolie was diagnosed with an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancers because she inherited a BRCA gene mutation , which is a defect in the BRCA gene that suppresses tumours . The actress made headlines when she chose to remove her breasts and ovaries to lower her risk of cancer . <p> However , in reality , Dr Tan says , " Less than 10% of breast cancers are due to genetic predisposition . " As more women develop breast cancer , it is important to ask the following 3 questions . <h> Do I need genetic testing for breast cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for the majority of genetic breast cancers . BRCA 1 and 2 are genes that suppress tumours . When these genes are mutated , cells multiply uncontrollably , which increases the risk of both breast and ovarian cancers . <p> However , Dr Tan cautions that genetic testing can be complicated , thus pre and post-test counselling are required to ensure that women fully understand the benefits and limitations of genetic testing . For instance , a positive genetic test does not mean that the woman will definitely develop cancer , while a negative test does not mean that it is impossible to develop cancer . <h> How can my doctor calculate my risk of breast cancer ? <p> Several statistical models may be also used to calculate the risk of breast cancer by taking into account age , menstrual history , age of live births , previous breast biopsy results and family history . However , Dr Tan qualifies that these models are based on databases of patients in the West . There is currently no statistical model based on Asian populations in Asian countries . <p> Nonetheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk of breast cancer , each with its pros and cons : <p> The International Breast Intervention Study ( IBIS ) risk tool or Tyrer-Cuzick model is a validated tool based on data from the United Kingdom . <p> The National Cancer Institute breast cancer risk assessment tool is derived from an American database . <h> If I am found to have increased risk of breast cancer , what preventive measures should I take ? <p> Depending on the risk each individual has , doctors may employ different strategies . <p> Enhanced surveillance screening <p> Women with increased risk of breast cancer should undergo an annual mammography , which is an x-ray of the breast . Mammograms should start 10 years earlier than the youngest breast cancer case in the family but not before 30 years old , in order to minimise radiation exposure at a young age . <p> As young women have dense breasts , they may also undergo tomosynthesis , which is a form of multi-slice mammogram imaging that is more sensitive and improves cancer detection rates . However , radiation exposure in tomosynthesis is significantly greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the benefits of screening outweigh the radiation exposure . <p> On the contrary , according to Dr Tan , magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) does not use x-ray radiation and is the most sensitive in detecting invasive cancer in young women . MRI is particularly beneficial for the following women : <p> BRCA gene mutation carriers ( MRI screening should begin as early as 25 years old for them ) <p> 1st degree relatives of a BRCA gene mutation carrier <p> History of radiation therapy at the chest wall between the ages of 10 -- 30 years , eg. during a previous cancer treatment <p> As breast enhancement can be affected by hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle , the MRI should ideally be done on day 7 -- 15 of the menstrual cycle , which will reduce diagnostic error .

" Women with significantly higher risk of breast cancer should , however , undergo MRI screening in addition to annual mammography . <p> Chemoprevention <p> Chemoprevention is the use of natural chemicals that prevent the development of invasive breast cancer , either by blocking the DNA damage that initiated the cancer formation or by stopping the progression of premalignant cells from becoming malignant . <p> According to Dr Tan , drugs such as Tamoxifen , Anastrazole and Exemstane have been shown to reduce breast cancer rates by about 50% in women with increased 5-year risk of more than 1.66% , as assessed by the National Cancer Institute breast cancer risk assessment tool . However , for women with average risk , Dr Tan notes that there is no evidence that chemoprevention reduces breast cancer incidence . <p> Dr Tan also cautions that these drugs might have adverse side effects , such as weight gain , venous thromboembolism ( blood clot in veins ) , pulmonary embolism ( blood clot in lung artery ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bones ) . That is why most women decline chemoprevention despite having an increased risk of breast cancer . Women who are keen in chemoprevention should consult an oncologist to discuss its benefits , limitations and risks . <p> Risk-reducing surgery <p> Bilateral risk-reducing mastectomy is the surgical removal of both breasts . It has been found to reduce the risk of breast cancer by at least 90% in women with increased risk of breast cancer , such as BRCA gene mutation carriers . In recent years , advances in breast reconstruction techniques have made mastectomy a more attractive option . <p> However , there has been concern about the overzealous uptake of the removal of the healthy breast in addition to the breast with cancer . According to Dr Tan , removal of the healthy breast is not necessary in the majority of women with newly diagnosed breast cancer . This is because they do not have a cancer gene or significant family history , thus the estimated risk of a 2nd breast cancer in the healthy breast is 0.5% per annum .

A BMI above 31 is associated with a doubled risk of postmenopausal breast cancer . A weight gain of more than 25kg after 18 years old is also associated with a 50% increased risk of invasive breast cancer .

@@43294240 <h> Can sustainable fashion be more affordable ? Experts weigh in <p> AsiaOne has launched EarthOne , a new section dedicated to environmental issues -- because we love the planet and we believe science . Find articles like this there . <p> Fashion brands left and right - from luxury powerhouses like Gucci to high-street labels like H&amp;M - have made sustainability a key element of their corporate strategies . It almost feels that not a day goes by without a brand announcing an eco-conscious collection or a socially responsible initiative aimed at reducing waste or making supply chains more transparent . <p> A key issue when it comes to sustainable fashion , however , is affordability . Can clothes and accessories made with responsibly sourced materials and by workers who are paid a fair wage in factories where conditions meet global standards actually be affordable ? And should they be ? <p> After all , overconsumption is another problem : by making clothes so affordable that they 're often as cheap as a cup of coffee , the industry only incentivises unnecessary consumption and waste . Besides , most consumers around the world - those living on minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing ones - are likely to leave ethical concerns aside when given the choice of buying a low-price item made in a sweatshop or a pricier responsibly made product . <p> Let 's say you 're a single mother living in London and working a full-time job to support your two children . Would you rather buy a pair of eco-friendly jeans from Everlane or a mass-manufactured one from Primark that costs a fraction of the price ? <p> Making responsible choices as an educated consumer is a luxury not everyone can afford . <p> Besides , making sustainable fashion available to the masses is no easy task . We asked five industry insiders to shed some light on this very important , and often overlooked , issue that is at the heart of sustainability . <p> " Eco-conscious and responsibly made clothing and accessories can absolutely be affordable . They were for decades throughout the 20th century before fashion raised its profit margins , meaning the difference in price to produce and the retail price , exponentially to meet shareholder expectations and to become wildly rich . <p> nid:532411 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amancio Ortega of Inditex , which owns Zara , are among the wealthiest people in the world . When I wrote my first book , Deluxe , the average mark-up of a luxury brand handbag was 12 times the production cost . Today , it 's around 25 times , if not more . The reason much of fashion is unaffordable for so many is corporate greed . <p> " And the fashion that is affordable - fast fashion - complicates the situation , because its prices are too low . <p> " The reason these clothes are so cheap is because the workers who make them - most offshore , in developing countries such as Bangladesh - are not paid a living wage , which economists calculate is what one needs to earn to house , clothe and feed themselves and their families . Indeed , 98 per cent of garment workers do not earn a living wage , and most earn half a living wage . <p> " As I explain in my book , Fashionopolis , the entire fashion industry squeezes producers to such embarrassingly inhuman low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super low retail prices . In general , if a fast fashion garment costs US$10 ( S$13 ) to make , the worker was paid 10 cents . Clothes have never been cheaper than they are today . <p> " Therefore , we buy more than we have in the history of mankind . Consumers have been conditioned to believe it is normal to pay so little for clothes . It 's not . <p> " A generation ago , we spent a far greater percentage of our incomes on clothes than we do today . We can afford to pay more , we should pay more - not luxury 's overinflated prices , but more than what fast fashion brands ask . And if we did , we would have more eco-conscious brands out there . <p> " That said , there are plenty of lovely , small , eco-conscious brands making clothes at affordable prices . Their prices are not wildly higher than fast fashion clothes - maybe 20 per cent more - but the quality is far , far superior , and the impact on the planet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is a tricky one because of course we want good clothes to be affordable for as many people as possible . However , I think we need to rewind here and examine our ideas about what that means . <p> " First of all : ' good clothes ' - I do n't think we want bad clothes for as many people as possible , do we ? To me , good fashion is fair fashion . Good clothes are responsibly made . Maybe they cost a bit more , so you have fewer of them . <p> " Next : affordable ... for whom ? The current fast fashion system might be affordable for the shopper who wants to buy trend-driven clothes at rock-bottom prices , and replace them often with new styles . But there actually is a cost to that - a cost that gets passed on . Someone else is paying . Often , it 's the garment worker . <p> " The fast fashion system drives prices down , putting pressure on suppliers to cut costs and increase speed . Garment workers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> nid:523186 <p> " The planet pays too . As we 've just seen with this recent UK study published last month that looked at 10,000 items sold by fast fashion retailers Boohoo , Prettylittlething , Missguided and Asos . Half of them were made from plastic ( polyester , nylon , acrylic ... ) <p> " These fabrics are not biodegradable . Consider the volumes in which we are throwing these fabrics away . We are in the era of landfill fashion . We can change this story if we decide to . Fast fashion is a relatively recent invention . <p> " The alternative is a slower proposition , a little like what went before - where you had to save up for good clothes and plan to keep wearing them longer - but modern too . Tomorrow 's fashion does n't have to be like yesterday 's just because it 's slower than what we have today . <p> " The good news is that we are seeing a shift in the culture of shopping for clothes . Sustainability is becoming more popular and consumer awareness is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is cool again . Sewing is cool again . Vintage is cooler than ever . Gen Z 's obsession with second-hand is playing a part . <p> " All this is being embraced not just by fashion activists but by forward-thinking brands too - because it 's a business opportunity . And a much cooler one than the US$5 T-shirt was . " <h> Christina Dean , founder of Redress <p> " We should be seeing the gap close between conventionally made and responsibly made clothing , which essentially can come in many forms , from environmental to social improvements , so it is itself relatively hard to quantify . <p> " This closing of the price gap is in part because of the greater developments of more sustainable raw materials , including recycled materials , particularly recycled polyester . <p> " We 've also seen a decade or so of industry slogging on R&amp;D on everything from fibre development , technology to supply chain efficiency , and this work is now coming home to roost to bring wider-spread sustainability improvements across larger swathes of fashion businesses . <p> nid:528116 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing consumer sentiment around responsible production , and this wave of consumer concern is certainly a driver of businesses ' attempts to scale up and mainstream better design , sourcing and production and more . <p> " Put simply , the cost of continuing to churn out purposeless and polluting products , and the risk of growing consumer backlash against such bad practices , is one factor driving businesses to attempt to look further into mainstreaming their more sustainable initiatives . <p> " The reality is that most consumers are price sensitive and price , alongside style and fit , remains a key purchasing driver . So maintaining affordability whilst also injecting greater sustainability is obviously very important . <p> " That said , the real elephant in the room is that we clearly have to reduce production and consumption , while working towards a system redesign - rather than just replacing conventional garments with ' more sustainable ' alternatives , we need fewer items sold , these need to be lasting longer , such that fewer items are disposed of ... and we need to work to achieve circularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activist <p> " Yes , sustainable clothes of course can be affordable . And they are in fact already affordable . But consumers the world over fall prey to an ill-imagined definition of affordability . Our dictionaries have taught us that cost , value and price mean the same thing , when in fact they do not . <p> " For instance , price can fluctuate in an ever volatile market but value is , at a fundamental level , unchangeable , no matter how economies swell or swallow dive . The price of a sustainably made jacket , say , may vary when more of it floods a market , which leads to the lowering in pricing . But the value of that product , despite the fluctuating price market , is immutable . <p> nid:526777 <p> " The value of a sustainable product will always be associated with the ethics of ahimsa ( an ancient Indian principle of non-violence ) and sustainable creation , no matter which way the price goes . <p> " My advice is buy less , but buy things of value . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of thrifty pricing . ' I am buying a product of value ' is very different from saying ' I am buying something that costs less , and hence is affordable ' . <p> " This way of thinking is precisely the reason we do n't look at ourselves in the mirror and hold ourselves accountable for the cost our environment bears for our greed individually and collectively . " <h> Maxine Bedat , director of the New Standard Institute and author of Unraveled : The Life and Death of a Garment <p> " Yes , eco-conscious and responsibly made clothing and accessories can be affordable . In fact , they must be if we are to have an industry that operates within planetary bounds . If sustainability is just for the well-to-do , then we 're not really doing sustainability , are we ? <p> " We do , however , also have to unpack what ' affordable ' means . Should a T-shirt ever cost the same price as a single cup of coffee ? Probably not , as it 's impossible to conceive that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a price . Clothing has become a smaller portion of household spending while the number of garments bought has increased dramatically . <p> " So , yes , we need to have sustainable options at many different price points , but we should consider these goods durable goods , and they should be priced accordingly . " <h> Marilyn Martinez , project manager of the Make Fashion Circular team at the Ellen MacArthur Foundation <p> " It is true that today , more clothes are being made but we use them less . And creating fashion that is made to be used more , and made to never become waste , is only a solution if that fashion is accessible to everyone . <p> nid:512007 <p> " To make this possible , innovation is required towards creating new circular business models and rethinking how products can be designed to eliminate waste . Most clothing today is not designed to be remade , or recycled or reused . As a consequence , it quickly ends up being burnt or sent to landfill which impacts negatively on climate change , pollution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways for customers to access fashion at different price points , or for short amounts of time , whilst keeping clothes in circulation at their highest value . <p> " We are already seeing businesses taking action , but to really see circular business models scale , we must address pre-competitive challenges and ensure new infrastructures that provide efficient collection , sorting , and recycling . To achieve this , new technologies and skills , cross-collaboration and further investment are needed . <p> " In our vision of a circular economy for fashion - created with input from over 100 industry experts - we strive for an industry where clothing is used more , made to be made again , and made from safe and recycled or renewable inputs .

@@43337234 <h> Secrets to attracting talent in property - an often-overlooked industry <p> How many recent graduates will think of property when looking for an exciting first career ? Not many . Yet , attracting new talent into the property industry - especially proptech - is more important now than ever before , with sustainability a key focus of the future . And this is where Deb Noller , Co-Founder and CEO , Switch Automation , is playing her part . <p> In this interview with Jerene Ang , she shares the following : <p> Why the property industry is frequently overlooked , and how companies can increase visibility to talent . <p> How the industry can tap on robots so talents can focus on higher-value and more rewarding tasks . <p> How HR can facilitate mentoring between the young and veterans in the industry . <p> To read the full article , simply create a log-in at the link below . Your first 5 articles are complimentary ! Thank you for supporting our newsroom : ) <p> Q What led you to co-founding Switch Automation in 2012 ? Why focus on the property industry ? <p> My background is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing freight management solutions . I came across building automation out of a pure coincidence . Back when I was first starting out , the systems used were cheap and disparate , teams were disconnected and assets were n't linking up with data . Building occupants then were dissatisfied with the air quality and temperature of buildings , which were , at the same time , contributing 40% to carbon emissions globally . There was an evident need for transformation . <p> What I wanted to do was to bridge the gap and transform the industry , all while positively impacting the environment . <p> Switch was built on a vision of a future driven by sustainable digitally managed buildings . We are now working to strengthen this vision here in Singapore . <p> Q When it comes to dream jobs , we seldom hear people mentioning the property industry , despite the diverse range of roles - from architecture to real estate brokerage to proptech . Why do you think today 's youths are overlooking this industry ? <p> The property sector is a highly male-driven industry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This could be a reason why we continue to see fewer females in the industry , and this is something Switch is aiming to change . The industry is also known to be old fashioned , with many leading businesses hesitating to invest in the right technologies and new ways of working . <p> We have , however , seen a change since the pandemic 's push towards digitalisation . We 're pleased to share that this has led to an uprising of a new generation of managers who are well-equipped to lead the industry forward . <p> Q What can companies in the industry do to increase visibility ? And , what is Switch Automation doing in this regard ? <p> As an age-old industry , companies must firstly invest in innovation and innovative methods of working to gain visibility , especially today where the future of work is undefined . It 's important for companies in the industry to replace traditional methods of working by implementing digital strategies that will future-proof conventional methods . By adopting new ways of working , companies will also be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive the business forward . Highlighting the business ' impact on the wider industry and society can also attract younger talent who often have a desire to do work that makes a difference . <p> At Switch , we 're looking to reshape the property industry . <p> We acknowledge the gender gap in the industry and are actively working to bridge this by inviting women with the right skills and experience to apply for specific jobs at Switch . This has helped us form a leadership team predominantly made up of more women than men - a rarity in this industry . <p> We also have had success in attracting millennials who are looking to create a breakthrough in the tech industry by sharing our environmental mission and tech-focused approach . By attracting young and diverse talents , we benefit from more creativity and innovation from our teams , taking us one step further in reaching our goal to reshape the industry . <p> Robots are among us , but instead of viewing these negatively , we can use robots to our advantage . By employing these to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher-value and more rewarding tasks that will require their creativity and knowledge . Through automation tech such as artificial intelligence and machine learning , property practitioners can also streamline projects to optimise profitability . <p> Q What roles do you foresee being lost to automation , and which roles ca n't be automated ? Why ? <p> Project management and cash flow might be one of the first roles to be automated , allowing teams to focus on other areas of the business . Software development can also be automated to accelerate staff and contractor connections . Lastly , we believe that automating the management of buildings or developments can come in handy and may be the way to go , especially during a pandemic . <p> That said , there are just some roles that simply can not be replaced by automation . We will always need human employees to carry out roles that require the human touch such as engineering . <p> Creating an emotional connection with clients is also part and parcel of a booming business , as is maintaining effective communication with stakeholders within the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replicate . <p> Q Will there also be an emergence of new jobs due to automation ? What are some roles where an increase in demand is expected ? <p> We 've seen new jobs rise out of the automation boom , such as digital transformation specialists , Internet of Things ( IoT ) specialists , and information security analysts . In the coming months , we 're expecting a rise in demand for data scientists &amp; analysts , digital building engineers , smart building engineers , and heads of innovation . These roles will prepare the property industry for the future , where the role of smart technologies and data will be key . <p> Q How can workers in the industry pivot to the more in-demand roles ? And , what can companies do to help ? Among all these , where does HR sit ? <p> To pivot to in-demand roles effectively , workers must actively upskill to meet the needs of these roles . Companies can support employees by rolling out training programmes , or providing financial or educational assistance to those who are keen on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support employees by devising a proper training and upskilling plan for all employees . <p> Q Within the industry , what are some particular areas ( proptech , urban planning , etc. ) where new ideas and talent are most acutely needed for us to move towards environmental sustainability ? Why ? <p> Right now , there is a great need in proptech for fresh ideas and talent to spur innovation . This will lead to the creation of more quality platforms and integrations that support green certifications and energy monitoring . On a broader scale , there is also a greater need for more stakeholders within built environment organisations who can affect change across the company . By having changemakers onboard , only then can we successfully move towards our end goal of environmental sustainability . <p> Q How can companies attract talent to these roles ? And , what is Switch Automation doing ? <p> Companies can firstly tap on local universities with mechanical engineering , environmental engineering , sustainability and other related programmes to recruit fresh talent . They may also reach out to existing employees ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do these and more . We also promote our open positions on LinkedIn and target relevant LinkedIn groups to get our positions in front of the right talent . <p> Q While younger workers may bring fresh ideas , older ones are able to give better insight through a wealth of experience . Given this , how can HR leaders in the industry ensure a balance of both ? <p> The data-hungry younger generation brings with them a multitude of fresh , creative ideas and curiosity . On the flipside , veterans in the industry generally have spent more time in the industry and can offer a wealth of experience and advice on the do 's and don'ts of the industry . <p> HR teams in every company must ensure a well-balanced system of hiring the two generations to create a culture that is inclusive , yet forward-thinking . <p> To do so , it 's important for HR practitioners to put together recruitment practices that will best help them identify talents who are well-suited for the vacant roles and will bring value to the company . Mentoring programmes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be paired with new joiners to create a nurturing culture , and to promote knowledge sharing . <p> Sufficient training and retraining must also be rolled out to ensure employees of either generations achieve similar levels of competency . <p> We use cookies and other tracking technologies to improve your browsing experiences on our website , to show you personalised content and targeted ads , to analyze our website traffic and to understand where our visitors are coming from .

In this case , why will Mr Glynn and his ' friend ' think it will be acceptable to the Singapore courts if he is represented by someone wearing a polo shirt in court ? Are they not mocking our legal system ? <p> He had his group of supporters , who constantly belittled the court , and one who later called the court a ' kangaroo court ' .

@@43371231 <h> Satellite data from the University of Maryland show a surge in forest clearing in northern parts of the Tanintharyi region in southern Myanmar , including within a protected area . <h> Share <p> Carved out of the of the narrow isthmus that connects the Malay Peninsula to the rest of mainland Southeast Asia , Myanmar 's southern Tanintharyi region rises from the Andaman Sea in the west to the forested Tenasserim Hills that border Thailand in the east . <p> Now , amid the political turmoil following the Feb. 1 military coup , it appears that deforestation is ramping up in Tanintharyi , echoing wider patterns across Myanmar . New satellite data from the University of Maryland , visualised on Global Forest Watch ( GFW ) , show a wave of forest loss in northern Dawei district , where a large portion of the land is designated as Tanintharyi Nature Reserve . <h> " <p> There are a lot of community protected areas in Tanintharyi region , but after the coup , everything stopped and everybody needs to be careful about their security . <p> Esther Wah , Indigenous Karen activist <h> Forest clearing escalates <p> According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Research , most of the remaining intact natural forest in Dawei district is within the nature reserve . However , GFW data indicate that 2020 saw the second-highest level of primary forest loss within the reserve since measurements began in 2002 . <p> Over those 18 years , 60 square kilometers ( 23 square miles ) of forest was leveled , representing a loss of 4.5 per cent of its primary forest cover . While preliminary data for 2021 indicate deforestation in the reserve is down overall so far this year , forest loss is still expanding along existing fronts as well as in areas that were previously undisturbed . <p> Most of the recent deforestation is taking place just inside the southern boundary of the reserve , where forest loss patterns are consistent with the expansion of clearings that were burned during the first quarter of 2021 . <p> Satellite imagery also shows new incursions into primary forest along a road that connects Tanintharyi Nature Reserve to the township of Kameik . Furthermore , deeper within the reserve , satellite imagery shows earthworks proliferating along a pipeline access road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of primary forest . <h> Tanintharyi Nature Reserve <p> Tanintharyi Nature Reserve spans 1,700 km2 ( 660 mi2 ) in Dawei district . It was established by the Myanmar government , but funded by oil and gas companies Total , PTT and Petronas as part of a corporate social responsibility program to offset impacts of the controversial Yadana gas pipeline that bisects Tanintharyi from the Andaman Sea coast to the Thai border . <p> A large portion of the reserve overlaps with land under the management of the Karen National Union ( KNU ) , the main political body for the Karen ethnic group , and encompasses multiple Indigenous Karen and Mon villages . Although the reserve was founded in 2005 , it could not be officially implemented until the signing of a cease-fire agreement between the KNU and the central government in 2012 . <p> The nature reserve has been criticised by local groups for failing to respect the rights of Indigenous peoples to their land , resources and livelihoods . According to a report by community-based Karen organisations in Tanintharyi region , the reserve 's protections also hinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ancestral lands . <p> Experts suggest that the nature reserve was promoted by the prevailing government more to secure territorial control of the wider pipeline area from ethnic groups than to conserve biodiversity . " Basically , large-scale conservation rezoning is a crucial territorial strategy to create state administered and patrolled territory in opposition to ethnic armed organisation-controlled jurisdictions , " Kevin Woods , a senior policy analyst for US-based nonprofit Forest Trends , told Mongabay . <h> Plantation boom <p> The establishment of Tanintharyi Nature Reserve was part of a region-wide shift away from subsistence agriculture toward a landscape dominated by protected areas and commercial oil palm and rubber plantations . <p> Myanmar 's transition to a quasi-civilian government in 2011 and the cease-fire agreement of 2012 created an amenable business environment , further aided by eased international economic sanctions and a slew of business-friendly land reforms . In Tanintharyi , former war zones in borderland forests with weak land tenure were suddenly opened up for business , and a glut of forest clearing ensued , mainly to establish commercial plantations . <p> A study published in Applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2002 and 2016 was driven by the expansion of commercial oil palm , rubber and betel nut plantations alongside smallholder cultivation . <p> The study suggests that the expansion of smallholder agriculture could be due to new commercial oil palm plantations in Tanintharyi encroaching on villagers ' agricultural land . As a result of losing access to their land , many farmers are displaced and left with little choice but to reestablish their crops in the forest . <p> Such knock-on deforestation is often unnecessary because plantation concessions are rarely fully planted in Tanintharyi . Concessions may not even be intended to grow crops at all , according to researchers and activists who say that companies are clearing forest under the guise of agriculture in order to legally extract commercially valuable timber for trade . A 2015 Forest Trends report found less than one-fifth of the total area demarcated as oil palm concessions in Tanintharyi had actually been planted . <h> Critical wildlife habitat <p> Sources say infrastructure development for the Dawei Special Economic Zone ( SEZ ) , a central government plan to link up a new deepwater port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost trade and investment , is also exacerbating land scarcity and consequential pressures on the region 's remaining intact forests . <p> As part of the SEZ , a 138-km ( 86-mi ) highway is under construction between Dawei and southwest Thailand . Conservationists say they 're concerned that the road severs the forested wildlife corridor that links well-protected reserves in Thailand to intact forests in Tanintharyi . Construction firms are also upgrading old logging roads throughout the region to facilitate better trade with neighboring Thailand . <p> The spate of road construction is driving habitat destruction , according to Saw Soe Aung , who works for Fauna &amp; Flora International in cooperation with local communities to survey forests in southern Tanintharyi for tigers . He said he has witnessed an increase in deforestation along newly constructed roads during 2021 , affecting the forest 's capacity to support tigers . " We only recorded one individual of tiger in our survey area this year , " he said . " Before road construction , we recorded four or five individuals . " <p> Critical habitat for other rare species is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gurney 's pitta , a diminutive but colorful bird that depends on mature forest understory , is found only in the lowland forests of Kawthaung , Tanintharyi 's southernmost district , where more than one-tenth of primary forest has been razed , ostensibly for oil palm . <p> A recent study led by researchers at King Mongkut 's University of Technology Thonburi , Thailand , found that 8 per cent of suitable habitat for the Gurney 's pitta was lost between 2017 and 2020 . Of the remaining habitat , more than 10 per cent is fragmented into patches that are too small to guarantee long-term survival . The study , published in Oryx , estimates that all remaining habitat for the bird will disappear by 2080 unless conservation action is taken . <p> " Because there is no legal protection , only government forest reserves , there are a lot of land encroachment and land grabbing issues in the southern part of Tanintharyi , " study co-author Nay Myo Shwe told Mongabay . <p> Forests are particularly vulnerable along newly upgraded roads , which create a " fishbone effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ existing threats " by facilitating cross-border trade in illicit forest products , including the Gurney 's pittas themselves for the pet market , according to the study . <h> Progress in peril <p> While the period of peace and economic liberalization was accompanied by rapid development in Myanmar , the resurgence of conflict following the ousting of the civilian government in February 2021 has cast uncertainty across the country . Experts are warning of new bouts of deforestation facilitated by weakened governance systems , reduced surveillance , and a lack of accountability . <p> Meanwhile , villagers , local leaders and civil society organisations say they fear violence and arrests over their environmental activism . As a result , grassroots activism and long-running community-led conservation programmes have shut down , said Esther Wah , an Indigenous Karen activist whose fight for customary land rights predates the current regime . The situation threatens to undo much of the progress made in land rights and environmental conservation over the past decade , she said . <p> " There are a lot of community protected areas in Tanintharyi region , but after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their security , " Wah said . " If something happened on the ground before , like a development project , we could notice right away which company it was and how many acres were affected -- we knew it . But now , we do n't know anything . " <p> Indigenous activists were working with civil society organisations to have their own approach to conservation recognized in national law . Community conserved areas and Indigenous community conserved areas that focus on both biodiversity and human rights present an alternative to top-down approaches , such as the Tanintharyi Nature Reserve . However , the coup and military crackdowns have brought policy-level negotiations to an abrupt halt . <p> The turmoil since the coup has so far internally displaced 40,000 people in southeastern Myanmar , according to a UN Refugee Agency report . In March and April 2021 , 5,000 refugees fled to northern Thailand to escape violent clashes in border regions , most of whom have since been able to return . <p> Over the short-term , at least , there is a risk that displaced people will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Myanmar 's forests . Although fighting has not yet escalated in Tanintharyi and large-scale displacements have not been reported , there is no guarantee that tensions will not rise , Wah said . <p> " Anything can happen , anything at any time , " she said . " We do n't want any fighting , because if that happens then everything becomes worse . We lose our land , we lose our territory , we lose our livelihoods and our lives will be very difficult .

" In particular , those who have spent much of the year , adhering to the rules . The reaction , he adds , " also simultaneously expressed a deep-seated frustration at the steep escalation of Covid-19 cases and the public perception of how the country has handled it recently . " <p> The photos were intended to present a different view of KL , an " unnatural stillness .

@@43378238 <p> Firms hiring foreign workers will be required to pay all their local employees a monthly salary of at least S$1,400 , said Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong at the National Day Rally ( NDR ) on Sunday ( 29 Aug ) . <p> In his English speech , PM Lee noted that the government has accepted a tripartite workgroup 's recommendations to help lower-wage workers more , which include mandating companies that hire foreign workers to pay all their local employees a local qualifying salary ( LQS ) of S$1,400 . <p> It was said that companies were previously required to pay a local qualifying salary to some local employees , depending on the number of foreign workers they hire . <p> PM Lee said that the LQS will be adjusted from time to time , adding that the Progressive Wage Model ( PWM ) will be extended to cover more sectors , starting with retail from next year and food services and waste management to follow . <p> It will also cover specific occupations that cut across sectors , starting with administrative assistants and drivers , he asserted , adding that the government will also increase its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in two years . <p> " This allows us to raise payouts for all Workfare recipients , and to help younger lower-wage workers , by starting Workfare younger , from the age ( of ) 30 rather than 35 .

" The public sector is a major buyer of goods and services , and it will take the lead and purchase only from such businesses .

@@43397230 <h> Startup Life : Joyce Lau on How She Started NakedLab for her Daughter <p> Having a child is a life-changing moment , dictating the start of a whole new chapter in life where your priorities get reshuffled and suddenly nothing matters apart from the sleeping ( or crying ) baby in your arms . This was the predicament Joyce Lau found herself in , who changed the entire course of her career in 2018 to start a new company , NakedLab , to bring quality bedding for her then two-month-old daughter , who was battling serious eczema . <p> A former architect and now a full-time mother and entrepreneur , Lau tells us about her frustrations with the bedding industry , her belief in the health benefits of bamboo textiles , and how she hopes NakedLab can ultimately bring a family better sleep , health , and mindset overall . <h> While You 're Here ... <h> When did you launch your company and why ? <p> NakedLab ? ? was founded in 2018 when I became a mother . When Pia was 2 months old , she was battling a serious eczema situation . With this sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health , I struggled as a new mother shopping for quality bedding that did n't break the bank . So many options were overwhelming and unreliable in terms of quality . That sparked my curiosity to find out that the bedding industry was very ambiguous and antiquated . This frustration initiated the beginning of my journey and the birth of NakedLab ? ? . <p> Retailers were selling high-end bedding at up to ten times markup , inflating thread counts , and operating on bloated supply chains that added to cost but not quality . I had no background in textiles or manufacturing , but I soon realised just how savvy one can become after spending one year educating myself on the industry , visiting factories , and sampling fabrics . <p> I discovered bamboo sheets , which have a lot of health benefits . It 's not only scientifically backed to make you sleep better because of its thermoregulating properties , but it is also naturally anti-dust mite , anti-bacterial and hypoallergenic . It also feels so silky soft and feels extremely luxurious . <p> Joyce Lau 's daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is free from harmful chemicals although because I insist on the Oeko-Tex certification , it means that the bedding is more easily creased than cotton ( which is dipped in chemicals ) and has to be carefully handled ( cold or low-temperature wash , and no bleach and tumble dry ) . We started out with one product , which is a pink baby cot sheet for Pia , but have since added kids ' bedding , adult bedding , and duvets , which are coming soon . <p> To me , NakedLab is more than just a shop that sells bedding . Bedding is such an overlooked item at home -- it 's a household item where we spend most of our hours ( the average person spends almost 230,000 hours of their life in bed , that 's approximately 26 years ! ) and it is also the one item our skin has the closest contact with . I believe a good set of bedding gives you not just good sleep , but also the foundation to good health and most importantly for me , a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and a happy life . This is what kept me going , it just makes me so happy knowing that I can help make a little difference to somebody 's sleep and happiness because they had a good rest . <h> Was sustainability a factor for you when you created your line ? <p> I think sustainability is an essential factor in any business nowadays , that 's fundamental . I 'm not even going to dive into the manufacturing process , for one simple fact is that bamboo is one of the fastest-growing plants in the world , with some species growing up to three feet a day . It does n't require the use of pesticides , or any other agrochemicals , nor fertilizer or irrigation , both of which are common in cotton farming -- cotton sheets are still the traditional choice of bedding while so many of us still know anything about bamboo bedding . <p> Joyce Lau brings her architectural eye to the designs for NakedLab <h> Did you always want to be an entrepreneur ? <p> Not in a million years ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I have not strayed from that path until now . I was trained in the UK and came back to Hong Kong for a China development project eight years ago . <h> Your husband is also an entrepreneur . Has he helped you in any way along your own start-up journey ? <p> He is my mentor when it comes to business . He has so much more experience in terms of this entrepreneur journey . I have seen all the downs and I see how he overcomes them and becomes better and better every day . I always say I understand what he is going through , but honestly , I only truly understand now when I became an entrepreneur myself . Your business is like your own baby , it 's so close to heart . Because you build it yourself , sweat and tears . He always says " running a business is all about self-improvement and self-challenge every day " , there 's many more other good quotes from him because he reads so much , he 's the most disciplined person I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need advice . <h> What are some do 's and don'ts of starting your own company ? <p> If I can give one piece of advice to the aspiring business owner , I will say : do n't try to do everything at once . When you have an idea , you often get overly excited and try to get everything done at once . I think the key is to really do it step-by-step and to try to balance the inside and outside of the business . Prioritizing is super important ; try to focus and tackle one hurdle at a time . <h> You started your business at a time when you still had a full-time job and caring for a newborn . Thinking back now , would you have done it any other way ? <p> I think that was the perfect timing . When I started , it was really just a passion project , I did n't think it would go far . I had a full-time job and a daughter , and a side business was taking a lot of time , especially at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hyper-focus , delegate and prioritize . That was something I was pushed to learn when I had so many hats on , and now I think these are the keys to success ! <h> Has the pandemic impacted your business in any way -- good or bad ? <p> In a good way for sure . People are now very curious and focus on wellbeing and self-love . People are also staying at home more often , they are more aware of and yearn for good quality products so business is taking off . <h> What 's in the works currently ? <p> Loads of exciting things . In October , we 're finally launching our very own 100 percent bamboo duvet -- say bye to allergies ! In December , we 're launching a donation/ repurpose programme with Hong Kong Dog Rescue where we 'll be setting up recycling stations at major offices and donating old bedsheets to rescued dogs at their shelter for the winter season . <p> We 're also planning for more colours , mattresses ... and in February we 're launching an exciting new product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very exciting things are coming up . <p> A print and multimedia journalist , Stephanie has written for several of Hong Kong 's most prominent luxury lifestyle publications on topics spanning watches and jewellery , travel , beauty , and fashion .

@@43449239 <p> After buying your first pack of Magic cards , the big question is how do you protect the ones of value ? 2021 is n't the late 1990s , where good card sleeves were hard to come by . Today , plenty of brands provide a whole laundry list of sleeve products for players . One of them is Dragon Shield , who is lauded among the community for producing sleeves that are " tough as scales , " while being cheaper than actual mythical objects . <p> But which of their own products rules the roost ? We analyse these sleeves through the eyes ( and hands ) of actual Magic players , so there 's no guesswork involved . To start , here are the basic features : <p> Dragon Shield 's Matte sleeves are workhorses that refuse to buckle . Incredibly strong , the seams do n't tear even after a hundred games . The textured backs will prevent cards sticking together , even when packed tightly in a box . Shuffling gets easier because of that , though some players have commented it can even be too smooth . <p> One downside to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back side , that same colour will also show up on the front side . And because standard size sleeves have plenty of wiggle room for Magic cards , they will show up with an additional colour surrounding the card 's black border . This does n't bother everyone , but some do like the front face to be clear of distractions , and that means having either a black front or a colour that pairs well with black . <p> The easiest solution to this is to just get Black or Jet coloured sleeves , but that also makes your decks pretty much indistinguishable from each other . Imagine your carrying case with six decks all made out of black sleeves -- it 's tedious to find the deck you want , plus the chance of misplacing cards across decks will make sorting even more difficult . <p> However no one can argue against the steadfast quality and competitive price of Dragon Shield 's Matte sleeves . The range of available colours is also extensive , and there 's one for every player . <p> If you 're a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , your best sidekick would be the Non-Glare Matte Sleeves . True to its name , the non-glare sleeves specialise in cutting out reflective light from direct room lights . For people playing face-to-face , glare is n't a problem because anyone can simply pick up a card to cut the glare . In online gameplay or filming , that just is n't feasible <p> Because the non-glare sleeves essentially diffuse the light being reflected , that means foil effects on cards will also appear more muddled and less glitzy . There 's a small segment of players who like to foil out their entire decks , so do bear that in mind that these sleeves will somewhat hamper the ability to dazzle your opponents into submission . <p> Another drawback of non-glare sleeves are the limited colours offered by Dragon Shield . There are classic black , silver and clear sleeves , but they are supplemented by only one more colour -- purple . It might only be a matter of time before the entire range of colours are offered in non-glare options , but if colours are important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the regular matte sleeves . <p> Finding out about these Dual Matte sleeves was a godsend , as though Dragon Shield knew players were disgruntled about their coloured matte sleeves being aesthetically jarring on the front side . Although they 've been around since 2016 , Dual Matte sleeves only became available in Asia in 2021 . These Dual sleeves check almost every box you might have . They are coloured and opaque on the back , but are always black on the front , ensuring a nice blend with Magic cards . <p> Although it 's titled " matte , " the back is actually different from their Standard Matte sleeves and leans closer toward a more refined texture .

You wo n't be able to get these art sleeves anywhere else .

It could be that brushed material allows for better quality of printing the art , but we wo n't make a comparison without seeing the classic and matte art sleeves . <p> The biggest gripe about the art sleeves is they all have a white front , so all black-border cards will have an additional white border .

However , in the month of May this year , we were instead faced with the devastating reality of seeing the number of cases climb up steadily at an alarming rate that broke our total records , resulting in another full lockdown . <p> Working from home , stocking up on face masks and living virtually became the new norms . Though we resisted the change , we adapted as humans do . <h> More like this <p> And while you may be far from enjoying the lockdown , a strange sensation is creeping up for many as restrictions are easing up for more social allowances , which includes going back to work or meeting up with people .

These changes can bring about a level of stress and anxiety , with no certainty of how our lives could look in the short and long term . <p> The pandemic and subsequent roller coaster of SOPs in Malaysia has also taught us to recognise the unpredictability of Covid-19 . As such , we might find ourselves in a tangle of emotions ; do we rejoice or remain doubtful ? And while some are taking the opportunity to catch up on the lack of social interactions and freedom to travel out over the past months , some remain vigilant to stay homebound . <p> If the latter is you , you could feel like hiding under the sheets to avoid expectations and responsibilities .

The only true certainty we have in life is that change happens in different points of our lives . <p> From a psychological perspective , we know that it 's normal for some extent of stress and anxiety to accompany the transition of major life changes . Biologically speaking , stress is an inbuilt survival mechanism that triggers the ' fight or flight ' response in the face of a perceived threat or danger . <p> We 're wired to react to threats against our survival , think of running away from a lion or any kind of life-threatening situation early humans would have faced .

It takes a lot of mental energy to adapt , manage and cope with changes , however , the uncomfortable feelings you may be experiencing are n't necessarily negative by nature , as they indicate we are both surviving and sustaining in the changing environment . <p> On top of that , we have become unsure of whom we can trust in many aspects , from decision-making authorities to potentially Covid-19 asymptomatic individuals .

@@43562236 <h> PRHK Viewpoints : How ESG communications can make or break a brand <p> The conversation at the recent ReThink Hong Kong 2021 conference confirmed how much the focus on environment , social and governance ( ESG ) has increased since the start of the pandemic . <p> Today , 90% of central banks recognise climate change as a financial risk and society has been fundamentally altered in immeasurable ways by a pandemic that has highlighted inequalities , widened the poverty gap , and put a spotlight on climate change . The Sixth Assessment Report by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) gave a damning confirmation when it released a code red saying " Climate change is widespread , rapid and intensifying , and some trends are now irreversible , at least during the present time frame . " <p> As communication professionals , we have seen a surge in demand from clients wanting advice on how to position themselves and engage around ESG . However , the understanding of what ESG is varies greatly between almost every company and industry sector . While many are comfortable to follow the lead of their head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to begin to make it locally relevant , what to implement or how to integrate ESG considerations into their business , culture and communications . <p> Do n't confuse ESG with CSR <p> The most common confusion results from looking at ESG through the lens of a company 's corporate socially responsible ( CSR ) activities . While still popular , the world has moved on from the days of thinking a good CSR programme constituted a company 's social commitment . CSR is like the training wheels on a child 's first bike ; they were great when you were eight , but we are a little bit more grown up now . And just like life we grow up and move on . <p> To make things more complicated there is no one-size-fits-all approach . Considerable flexibility remains between local regulations and industry recommendations that leaves companies confused as to what ESG strategies they should adopt . From my viewpoint , much more work needs to be done to help businesses understand their green and sustainability positioning . As advisors in this area , industry bodies also need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done and easily adopted to enable those beginning their ESG journey in the best way possible . <p> For those firms with the financial means and with access to experts and professional ESG guidance , ESG strategies are much more established . The best ESG strategy , like any good business strategy , comes from those who are building measurable ESG programmes and embedding them into the company 's DNA . The best ESG strategies originate from those who see this as emanating from the inside out and from the top down . In this way , there are countless opportunities to engage employees , management , boards , and external stakeholders to ensure ESG is core to the business and that everyone it is behind the changes and actions required . This also helps to reduce reputational risk . <p> What is clear through the new lens of the pandemic-impacted world , is that it is no longer good enough to be measured against CSR activation programmes like cleaning plastic up from the beach . While it is absolutely a noble and good thing for any corporation and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own and is a great CSR but not ESG initiative . <p> ESG strategies need to run through the veins of the company culture and align more broadly with industry and regulatory requirements so that it can measurably achieve sustainable and environmental goals linking to carbon reductions and emissions . <p> Cutting through ESG noise - who to align to ? <p> For companies in the financial sector , there is an entire toolbox of acronyms from A to Z that relates to green and sustainable alignment . In the highly regulated insurance and asset management or investments sectors , firms often align with one or a number of principles and guidelines such as the GRI , SASB , SBTI , TNFD and many more , but it 's about more than alignment or signing up to an organisation to agree with its approach . Being a signatory requires a company to continually demonstrate progress towards the objectives or principles it agrees to and report that progress back each year . This is often done in the format of a sustainability report . <p> A common option for companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nations Sustainable Development Goals ( SDGs ) . While not many companies can adopt all of the principles , a selection of the most relevant options can support the right ESG strategy . As stated by the United Nations , the Sustainable Development Goals are a collection of 17 interlinked global goals designed to be a blueprint to achieve a better and more sustainable future for all . <p> Principles for responsible investment ( PRI ) <p> Many of our clients in the financial services sector align with PRI . This is a United Nations-supported network of investors working together to implement the six aspirational investment principles : <p> Principle 3 : We will seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the entities in which we invest . <p> Principle 4 : We will promote acceptance and implementation of the Principles within the investment industry . <p> Principle 5 : We will work together to enhance our effectiveness in implementing the Principles . <p> Principle 6 : We will each report on our activities and progress towards implementing the Principles . <p> Greenwashing and reputational damage <p> Green washing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corporate world , and this is a trend that is on the rise . <p> Companies being accused of not being fully carbon neutral despite their claims has impacted even major international brands such as Volkswagen and Nestle . Others have been accused of overstating their green investment activities , resulting in share prices tumbling like it did for DWS . Deal makers also need to rethink how they manage their reputation like Australian fossil-gas giant Santos had to , after being attacked by activists and facing court action for not doing enough to reduce emissions before its acquisition of Oil Search when the accuracy of its net-zero pledges were called into question . <p> Scrutiny of greenwashing will only continue to increase so all companies , large and small , and in every market must take care . <p> Staying ahead of the curve on ESG means asking the tough questions .

Among the 54 unique timepieces that go on sale , we 've selected a dozen that , for various reasons , have caught our eye . <p> Held every other year since 2005 , Only Watch is an auction with a difference . Not only has every timepiece offered for sale been created especially for the event -- and is thus utterly unique -- but it 's also one of the few major auctions in the world in which 99 percent of all revenues have gone direct to charity . <p> Only Watch was founded by Luc Pettavino , a former president of the Monaco Yacht Show , who in 2003 set up the Monaco Association against Muscular Dystrophy after discovering his son , Paul , was suffering from this rare and debilitating genetic condition . Quickly enlisting the support of Monaco 's Prince Albert to the cause , Pettavino then set about convincing many of the world 's most eminent watch brands to create a unique timepiece , all of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ association . <p> For the first Only Watch auction , which was held in collaboration with Antiquorum , 34 watch manufactures responded to the call . The event proved such a success that Pettavino decided to do it again two years later -- and so it went . By 2015 , when the sale moved to Geneva , the number of watch manufacturers involved had risen to 50 , and when the hammer fell for the last time in the 2019 event -- the eighth Only Watch auction in the series -- the total funds raised to combat Duchenne muscular dystrophy exceeded ? 70 million . <p> Although his son sadly succumbed to the illness some years ago , Pettavino remains as committed as ever : for the 2021 sale at Christie 's in Geneva on November 6 , he 's brought together 54 brands , each of which -- in a remarkable display of collective altruism -- has created a singular watch for the occasion . From the treasures on offer , we take a look at 12 of them . <h> AUDEMARS PIGUET <p> If Audemars Piguet 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most covetable timepieces on the planet , the maison has made its Only Watch one-off even more desirable by treating it to a case and bracelet in sandblasted titanium , with bezel and bracelet links in a palladium alloy called bulk metallic glass .

With its stunning plique- ? -jour enamel dial , the timepiece appears translucent like a stained-glass window , while the one-minute tourbillon regulator is held in place by a titanium frame so slender it seems to float . <p> Est : US$175,000-$219,000 <h> BOVET 1822 <p> Bovet 's whimsical contribution is the Miss Audrey Sweet Fairy Only Watch , whose dial -- made from pure sugar -- combines miniature painting techniques with Super- Luminova , so it glows in its entirety , while the hands come together to form a heart every 65 minutes .

Not only does it come in a 43mm pebble-shaped yellow-gold case that houses a double-barrel , monopusher-operated MB R-200 automatic movement , but it 's also accompanied by a wooden replica of Rieussec 's 1821 timepiece . <p> Est : US$32,800-$49,200 <h> ULYSSE NARDIN <p> A contemporary reinterpretation of a marine chronometer , Ulysse Nardin 's UFO Table Clock for Only Watch is based on a limited edition produced earlier this year .

Winemakers often tell us that more fauna has returned to their vineyards since they took up organic farming and decreased chemical spraying ; that the soil has become healthier with composting , and that the humus has gradually degraded to help improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology deeply etched into every aspect of the viti-vini process , wine consumers today often encounter wines that have endured excessive intervention and manipulation . While this does n't necessarily translate into lower quality , such processes turn the wines into more commercial and industrialised drinks , lacking any artisanal , aesthetic or environmental appeal . Organic farming , to an extent , fulfils winemakers ' quest to reach a continuum of " authenticity " and " naturalness " in their wines , making it an inviting proposition for them to revive traditional , more natural farming methods before the use of chemicals became the norm . <p> France -- where " Bio " certification ( agriculture biologique ) is now a widely accepted stamp of approval -- has a strong presence on the list , too .

In fact , these regions are also notable for taking a step up in the organic stakes and following " biodynamic " practices . <p> But the meaning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mandates , as well as market realities . According to the United States Department of Agriculture , attaching the label " organic " to wine means that the wine-growing phase and vinification process must both be organic and free of added chemicals , including the addition of sulfites to the wine . <p> In the European Union , the label " Wine made from organic grapes " is the only one permitted in the " organic " category . This underscores the naturalness of the grape itself , and the addition of sulfites is permitted during the vinification process -- similar to the " Made with organic grapes " label in the US . <p> During the past 12 months , we tasted 1,682 bottles of " organic " wine , more than 1,500 of which received 90 points or more , with 232 attaining scores of at least 95 -- our sweet spot for great wine .

@@43575231 <h> What Is Relationship Anarchy And Is It For You ? <p> By Amanda Chatel , Oct 26 2021 10:57 am <p> Share this article <p> If you have n't heard of the term " relationship anarchy , " do n't fret -- you 're not out of the loop , nor are you alone . <p> The term first appeared in a 2006 essay entitled , " Relationsanarki i 8 punkter " on a Swedish blog written by Andie Nordgren , who translated the work to English six years later , titling it " The Short Instructional Manifesto for Relationship Anarchy . " The essay is exactly that : a manifesto for relationship anarchy . Considering Merriam-Webster defines anarchy as " absence of order and a state of lawlessness , " trying to understand how a relationship anarchist navigates their relationships can be confusing . Good thing there 's a manifesto for both anarchists and the rest of us , so you do n't need to scratch your head all day long muttering " WTF ? " <p> " Relationship anarchy is a growing movement , with people all over the world identifying as relationship anarchists , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a project dedicated to providing couples with information to help promote happy and successful relationships . " You might be thinking of some kind of free-for-all where anything goes ... But it 's not that simple . " <h> What Is Relationship Anarchy , Exactly ? <p> Relationship anarchy is actually a philosophy , says Harrison . This philosophy includes how relationships should be structured with the ultimate goal of alleviating all elements of control , ownership , and power within romantic relationships . <p> " In relationship anarchy , you 're free to choose what kind of relationship dynamics will work for you , whether they are monogamous or non-monogamous , or not defined at all , " says Harrison . " You also get to define what relationship anarchy means for you and what it would look like in your life , rather than falling into a certain ideology that 's expected of you . " <p> In other words , contrary to the word " anarchy , " there is a structure involved , but not quite the structure that other relationships might have -- the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What Nordgren was trying to cultivate was the elimination of expectations and the societal " rules " as to what makes a relationship , well , a relationship . ( Think : Practicing monogamy , being on a path towards marriage , assuming traditional gender roles , etc . ) <p> " I believe Nordgren was trying to help people get rid of the ' shoulds ' in relationships , " says Taylor Sparks , erotic educator and founder of Organic Loven . " We tend to lean toward what the majority thinks is ' normal , ' when , in fact , you and your partner(s) are quite capable of establishing your own way of relating that works best for you all . " <h> The Relationship Anarchy Manifesto <p> As for that manifesto , Nordgren came up with nine points to explain what relationship anarchy entails . Keep in mind , this manifesto is n't the end-all , be-all of relationship anarchy , and is just a jumping-off point of what this could look like . <h> 1 . Love is abundant , and every relationship is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that love is not limited . Love is abundant and humans are capable of loving more than one person . In doing so , love for other people is equal , and relationships are n't ranked . This means there 's no primary relationship , which tends to be the case in many non-monogamous relationships . <h> 2 . Love and respect instead of entitlement <p> Those who practice relationship anarchy want and even encourage the people they love to be independent in choosing their path and the others they will love along the way . " Staying away from entitlement and demands is the only way to be sure that you are in a relationship that is truly mutual , " writes Nordgren . While there are boundaries that should be respected , relationship anarchy should n't include compromise ; loved ones are given the opportunity to follow the beat of their own drum , so to speak . " Love is not more ' real ' when people compromise for each other because it 's part of what 's expected , " writes Nordgren. <h> 3 . Find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your relationship(s) , your core set of values should be used in all of them . These values are unique to every person , of course , and exceeds just sex-related values . It 's how you see the world , how you want to be treated , what respect looks like to you , among all other values that define you and make you who you are . There should n't be differing exceptions for one relationship or differences in values ; as all relationships are equal . <h> 4 . Heterosexism is rampant and out there , but do n't let fear lead you <p> Lead you where , you might be asking ? Toward the " powerful normative system in play that dictates what real love is , and how people should live . " According to Nordgren , heterosexism is what forces people into a " normative system " ( ahem , heteronormativity ) of relationships . Because of this , Nordgren says that people who are n't relationship anarchists will likely question your ethics and morals as well as the validity of your relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that fear should n't affect your relationships , who you love , and how you love . <h> 5 . Build for the lovely unexpected <p> " Being free to be spontaneous -- to express oneself without fear of punishments or a sense of burdened ' shoulds ' -- is what gives life to relationships based on relationship anarchy , " writes Nordgren . If something works out when you meet someone new , then great ! If not , there 's no room for disappointment ; there are others out there to meet and love . <h> 6 . Fake it ' til you make it <p> Because relationship anarchists are constantly breaking the norms when it comes to relationships , going against societal pressures can sometimes feel overwhelming . If you " fake it ' til you make it , " in terms of your mindset and being at peace with the relationship lifestyle you 've chosen , you 'll be able to put a positive spin on the relationships you 're cultivating and how you 're living your life on your terms , writes Nordgren. <h> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in trusting your partners , you 're likely to have fulfilling relationships . While trusting ( especially if you 've been burned before ) can feel like a risk , trust is necessary for relationship anarchy because there are so many components involved . It 's about not thinking the worst when a partner withdraws a bit but , instead , supporting that . People need their space sometimes and it 's important to realise and trust in that . <h> 8 . Change through communication <p> Any type of relationship -- whether it 's monogamy , polyamory , non-monogamy , or anything else -- requires communication to make it work . This is even more paramount when your relationship does n't fall under what 's considered " normal " in our society . " Radical relationships must have conversation and communication at the heart -- not as a state of emergency only brought out to solve ' problems . ' Communicate in a context of trust ... Ask each other about stuff and be explicit , " writes Nordgren. <h> 9 . Customise your commitments <p> Credit : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designed with the people they 're in relationships with , therefore " freeing them from norms dictating that certain types of commitments are a requirement for love to be real , " writes Nordgren . <h> Is It a Relationship Structure or More of a Mindset ? <p> Relationship anarchy 's concept of " anarchy " may not be completely " absent of order " ( per the dictionary definition of the word ) , but it 's definitely about freeing yourself and those you love from the restrictions and expectations that come with society 's view of relationships . " Relationship anarchy challenges the traditional idea that people must conform to certain roles in relationships , whether they be the breadwinner or homemaker , the dominant or submissive partner , etc. " says Harrison . " Relationship anarchy is about rejecting those norms and creating your own path . " <p> Because relationship anarchy can be whatever you want it to be , trying to categorise it is n't exactly easy . While , yes , there are some specific core values that fundamentally rebuff what 's " normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a " relationship structure " ( such as , say , a polyamorous relationship ) goes against what relationship anarchists stand for in the first place : ultimate freedom from the trappings of normative lifestyles . <p> " Relationship anarchy stems from the concept of anarchy in a political sense , so it 's more of a philosophy and ideal than a relationship structure , " says Courtney Kocak , co-founder and co-host ofPrivate Parts Unknown , a podcast exploring love and sexuality around the world . " While the term connotes dissent , consent is actually a core principle of relationship anarchy . The whole idea is that relationships should n't be defined -- or confined , in many cases -- by rules that all involved parties do n't agree upon . Obviously , relationship anarchists make their own rules , but they typically do n't subscribe to cultural norms , they avoid hierarchical power structures , they buck against heteronormativity , and they tend toward non-monogamy . Thus , relationship anarchy and polyamory are n't exactly the same , but they do share a large overlap on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrees that relationship anarchy is an approach to relationships that has been deconstructed . " There are boundaries , but they are set by those involved within the relationships and do not follow the ' norms ' of society , " says Sparks . <h> Is Relationship Anarchy for You ? <p> Well , it depends . How does that manifesto sound to you ? Do you think you could live a life and be in relationships with so much freedom that break away from all the societal norms ? Setting your own rules and boundaries that do n't coincide with what people usually think of when it comes to relationships does seem extremely freeing , but some people need " normal " to ground them . Some people struggle when there 's too much freedom in their life -- and that 's totally okay ! <p> " I think relationship anarchy is for everyone because the focus is on making a relationship that works for you , and on the idea that love is n't a finite resource , and that monogamy is n't inherently better or more moral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandra , co-founder , and co-host ofPrivate Parts Unknown . " That does n't mean you ca n't practice monogamy as a relationship anarchist , it just means that the freedom to make the kind of love life you want lies with you . Freeing yourself from the way we 've been conditioned to view love , sex , and relationships can only enhance the way you live . " <p> It also involves mass amounts of trust and communication , as Nordgren points out in the manifesto . People who have a difficult time communicating their feelings , concerns , and desires , as well as those who ca n't trust wholeheartedly , might not be the best fit for relationship anarchy . <p> The entire point is to create an environment where individuals can be themselves without fear of judgment or retaliation . This means relationships do n't need to look the same as others around them or conform to society 's expectations and norms . Instead , it encourages people to explore and find what works best for them . <p> -- Megan Harrison , L.M.F.T. <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this means that each person gets to define the parameters of their own relationships based on how they feel and what they need , " says Harrison . " And when it comes to these parameters , there 's no limit on how many partners you can have or how often you see them ... Of course , this might bring up some questions about jealousy and possessiveness . After all , it 's only natural to feel those things when you see your partner getting close to someone else . " <p> The best part about relationship anarchy is that there is no " right " or " wrong " way to practice it . It 's steeped in freedom of the individual , as well as the rejection of norms that are constantly being shoved in our faces . It 's about commitment on your terms , believing there 's no end to the love that exists and can be shared , and customising a sort of utopia , especially in comparison to traditional relationships . There are so many ways to love and explore love -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a relationship that 's been deemed socially acceptable ? <p> Although definitely not for everyone , relationship anarchy could really jive with how you feel about romantic relationships and what you want out of partnerships in your life . In fact , you might already be a relationship anarchist and did n't even know it until now .

The estimated cost of the project , to be funded by the private sector , is 19.3 trillion rupiah ( US$1.35 billion ) . <p> Once in operation , the road will provide quick access to and from the western ferry port , help reduce traffic congestion during peak hours , and speed car travel from the neighboring island of Java . <p> The project is part of Indonesian President Joko Widodo 's national infrastructure push , with a slew of new airports , toll roads , dams and ports being planned and built across the archipelagic country . <p> Bali Governor I Wayan Koster has expressed his support for the Gilimanuk-Mengwi toll road , saying last year that it would improve logistics on the island . <p> But some Balinese say they fear the toll road will wreak havoc on the island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of hectares of wet and dry lands in the western Bali district of Jembrana , including rice fields , forests and parts of West Bali National Park , according to Walhi . <p> The NGO says 481 hectares ( 1,189 acres ) of rice fields would be breached by the project , including 34 subaks in Jembrana , 54 in Tabanan and nine in Badung . <p> The Jatiluwih rice terraces in central Bali are a UNESCO world heritage site and a classic example of the subak system . Image : Trent Strohm , CC BY-NC-ND 2.0 . <p> For thousands of years , subak has been at the heart of Bali 's agrarian society . The island 's mountainous terrain makes conventional irrigation challenging . Subak is essentially a water-sharing system bound by philosophy and trust , through which rice fields can obtain water from a single source interconnected by rivers and canals . In use for centuries , subak today has grown into more than just a community arrangement or farming technique shared by the Balinese -- it represents the relationship between nature and the people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Udayana University in Denpasar , spoke alongside Walhi campaigners at the launch of the report . The obstruction of water flows would bring with it the threat of flooding , he said , while the loss of farmland would impact Bali 's food security , and put the island at risk of diminishing its core culture . <p> " One rice field , on average , can contain up to 3,000 metric tons of water , " he said . " With 97 subak disappearing , where will the water go ? And with a significant drop in productive rice fields , what will happen to the most important sustenance of our people ? " <p> Walhi estimates the island 's rice fields yield at least 6 metric tons of the grain per hectare . If the toll road cuts across 188 hectares ( 465 acres ) of rice fields , it would reduce Bali 's rice production by at least 1,128 metric tons , the group says . <p> The construction may also affect 67 hectares ( 166 acres ) of land inside West Bali National Park . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community conservation movement in western Bali , called this his worst nightmare . He said he fears the new toll road and its economic stimulus will give the green light to other construction projects , such as a long-mulled idea for an airport in the area . <p> While the project would create jobs , Nono said , it would lead to a change in lifestyle . There will be a drastic shift in mindset , he said -- from nature to concrete . <p> " There is care and awareness for conservation for now , " he said . " It might be a different story once money gets into the picture . " <p> Many see western Bali as a money maker , the island 's highest contributor of non-tax state revenue . " Very few are willing to fight the battle because of this , " Nono said . " They ask themselves , what is the best bet ? In the end , nature loses , tourism wins . " <p> Nono said the biodiversity around Menjangan , a tiny island in Bali 's northwest corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop in tourists as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic . It would be a shame to see it come to grief , he said . However , he said he could also see how the project could play a role in helping Bali recover economically . <p> " We 've been fighting for conservation in west Bali for a long time . There 's no backing down now . What we can do is maximise our actions to minimise the damage of the construction , " he said . <p> The Bali starling became the official mascot of Bali province in 1991 . A critically endangered species , it almost went extinct due to its popularity in the songbird trade , but conservation interventions have helped it begin to rebound .

What is your employee experience strategy that led to this achievement ? <p> Thank you for this recognition . We started with the end in mind by having an employee-centric culture as key . This needed to start from our daily business practices before working its way into the work environment , and the training and developmental courses that we provide to our employees . <p> OCBC aspires to create a more open culture and growth mindset . To do so , we are continually upskilling our employees towards embracing a culture of learning . <p> Once we had set in place our strategy by having an employee-centric culture , we provided our employees with the opportunity to learn on different platforms , with resources and mentors as necessary to get everyone up to speed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Q How did you and your team conceptualise and adapt this strategy to suit evolving workforce needs in the past year ? <p> We leveraged the strong foundation of the OCBC Group as we recognise the importance of our employee proposition as a strategy . We have , ever since , been on a journey toward rethinking how we might reskill and upskill people to meet the changing workforce needs . <p> Besides , we strengthened our digital foundation in building capabilities , crafting our talent and workforce strategy , and connecting learning programmes with new behaviour and skills whilst embracing our OCBC learning philosophy based on three key themes : autonomy , relatedness , and ' better me and us ' . The learning philosophy allows us to establish a clear focus on executing our plan the best we can . <p> Q What challenges did you face along the way , and how did you overcome them ? <p> With a monumental paradigm shift in the way we learn , coupled with rapid digital advancements , it was not just our HR team that recognised the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about minimising skill gaps in the midst of evolving needs . <p> Our challenges included : <p> Rapid transition to digital learning , <p> Employee time constraints in learning , <p> Up-to-date learning programmes relating to their roles and skills . <p> To do so , we constantly set for ourselves new ways of working and thinking by using scalability , partnership and reach , amidst the regulatory boundaries in banking . We leveraged our strength with our regional presence whereby we facilitated knowledge and integration through sharing and tapping on each other 's strengths . <p> Upskilling employees is more than a strategic decision for our bank to stay relevant with a competitive edge . <p> Not every employee learns at the same pace that we want to embrace , thus we often delegate upskilling actions via a programmatic approach , noting that this is indeed about more than mere programmes . <p> Q How did the strategy add to the overall employee experience in your organisation , in terms of ROI ? Any achievements you 'd like to show off ? <p> As we navigate increasingly complex environments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opportunities that will help our business in achieving its goals more efficiently and effectively . <p> Our view of ROI is that its focus is on the results of the employee experience .

The learning initiatives are trusted for providing advice , ensuring effectiveness and quality , and how those results help improve the businesses ' scorecards and results . <p> As part of our focus on equipping our employees to thrive using future skills , we have a lined up ' Future Smart ' programmes that we map according to proficiency and certification levels . This , in turn , translates into workforce transformation roles and competencies for our bank . <p> Q What is the most exciting and valuable thing about being part of the debut Employee Experience Awards ? <p> The award describes our organisation 's accomplishment , and it conveys a message of inspiration to the team members , apart from boosting employee morale and a sense of belonging and purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and culture , i.e. being forward-looking and bringing lasting value to how we want to uplift and sustain employee experience . <p> Q Looking ahead , what else do you have planned as you continue to enhance the overall employee experience ? <p> We have a clear focus on our people strategy which entails the upskilling and reskilling of our employees . <p> Our next focus is to ensure we bring learning impact to the next level where employees are taking charge to learn , relearn and be part of a stronger learning ecosystem . <p> Q Do share tips to inspire your peers who are working on their EX strategies and would love to participate in the awards next year . <p> To us , the award is not a reflection of a single employee or a department .

@@43766239 <h> Geek Review : The Silent Sea ( Netflix ) <p> These are the qualities that one would expect to feel when watching an apocalyptic drama like The Silent Sea . <p> Advertisement ? <p> Sadly , the real emotion that one would feel instead settles somewhere between dreary , dismal , and draggy . <p> Set in the future , we learn that the world is facing a water crisis which results in severe resource rationing . So much so that humans are now segregated by class depending on how much water they are provisioned a day . The Korean drama treads familiar ground in its Snowpiercer-like setting , and we 've seen this script before . <p> Facing a grim reality , dramas offer the chance to witness the triumph of the human spirit or see it at its ugliest , and the biggest issue with The Silent Sea is that each character has weak motivations such that even by its eighth episode , it 's still challenging to relate to any of the characters , even as the show unfolds at a glacial pace . <p> Adapted from the 2014 short film , The Sea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Choi Hang-Yong , taking the helm once again . It must have been a challenge for Choi to expand his vision from a 37-minute short film , considering that the original seemed more arthouse and emotional in nature as opposed to The Silent Sea which leans more into the realm of action-thriller . <p> Fans of sci-fi expecting tension-filled moments in the quiet of space will end up disappointed , as The Silent Sea meanders around the space station they were sent to . Led by Han Yoon-jae ( Gong Yoo ) , the crew is joined by Doctor Song Jian ( Bae Donna ) , to retrieve a sample from a space station on the moon , which was abandoned five years ago due to an incident . <p> If heading into a forsaken moon base sounds like a bad idea all round , the crew themselves have no idea what they are heading into . Even the administration themselves have no idea what to expect but dangle the proposition of having the crew 's water status upgraded upon the successful completion of the mission and you end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people for the job . <p> Instead of using lengthy exposition to fill in the backstories of each of the crew members , the show opts for flashbacks to give us a better idea why Han Yoon-jae and Doctor Song Jian are motivated to even step foot on the moon in the first place . As for the rest of the crew , they are merely window dressing for the most part , and expectedly , merely a roster of characters to serve their utilitarian purpose . <p> Upon landing on the Moon , the audiences learn that the sample to be retrieved is key to solving the crisis on Earth . However , the word sample here should give you an idea of where this is heading . <p> No , this does n't turn into yet another Korean zombie drama , but that might have been a consideration given the results here . <p> While the show is successful in subverting audience expectations , there 's actually little payoff for anyone looking to power through the entire eight episodes . It does really pick up right at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew never comes into any real danger outside of events within their own control . This makes us wonder why the need for a fully manned operation in the first place . <p> Gong Yoo , Bae Doona , and the rest of the cast make the best of a weak script but audiences do n't really get much true sense of their motivations even at the end of the show and if it is even worth the effort . While the audiences should expect some level of heroic sacrifice for the greater good of humankind , The Silent Sea is devoid of such key set pieces . Even though the crew was sent to the Moon by government suits , the political aspect does n't shine through at all . There 's even a moment in the show where Han Yoon-jae is advised by Kim Jae-Sun ( Heo Sung-tae ) , the resource administrator on Earth , that his hands are tied due to political bureaucracy and fear of career suicide . It 's a bit too on the nose , and Yoon-jae does n't even put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This sense of helplessness persists throughout the film though it 's not via the actions of the characters but from the weak script . And the show would have been weaker if not for the performances of Gong Yoo and Bae Donna , who carry the whole show . This is not to discount the rest of the cast , especially with Lee Joon ( Captain Ryu Tae-Seok ) returning to the screen for the first time since 2017 . While Netflix is a great platform for him to showcase his acting chops globally , The Silent Sea does n't serve him , or the cast well . <p> Thankfully , the real bright spark of the show would be in the realm of cinematography and set design . We know that when it comes to period shows , the Koreans have it locked down especially with the likes of Kingdom . With The Silent Sea , the production team has been able to show off how well they are able to translate their craft into sci-fi . The only sore point would be the CGI open-world sequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bare minimum . <p> With the year coming to a close , many would have hoped that The Silent Sea would have been a good show to end it all off .

Most of the time , they did not have any time to review and check the implemented measures for compliance , which may lead to subsequent JSS-related misunderstandings between employees and employers . " <p> Additionally , some employees may think that the JSS is their entitled payment from the government and that the entire sum received by the company should be given to them as their salary even if they were unable to perform work during Circuit Breaker . <p> Some employers , on the other hand , perceive the JSS to be meant only for the company 's survivability , while employees should look elsewhere for other available government grants . <p> In many cases , employers had misinterpreted MOM 's advisory when they adopted cost saving measures for the company , neglecting baseline salary support for their employees in the process . <p> After MOM 's intervention however , these companies would comply with providing baseline salary support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges of companies who abuse the JSS <p> In more extreme cases , there have been companies who actually made mandatory CPF contributions that are not reflective of the actual wages paid , thereby receiving more JSS payouts than what they are entitled to . <p> In such instances , MOM would take action against these companies by revoking their work pass privileges and referring the incident to the Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore to suspend future JSS payouts . <p> Businesses or individuals who wish to report any malpractices or potential abuses of the JSS may do so via email to email protected or online at go.gov.sg/jssreport . <h> Helping workers obtain retrenchment benefits <p> MOM had also formed a joint team with TAFEP to help retrenched workers request for retrenchment benefits when Covid-19 first happened . <p> Industry lead James Pang , who has been working in TAFEP for the past four years , was roped into the team to supervise 10 officers from TAFEP . <h> Comforting and advising retrenched employees <p> Like Teo , Pang 's role involves addressing queries from retrenched employees , understanding their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their company . <p> According to Pang , retrenched employees usually " share their shock , anger , worries and fear of being unable to support their family or financial commitments " during these one to two-hour phone calls : <p> " It is very painful to be retrenched . Imagine working in a company for some 10 to 20 years where you spend one third of your waking hours at . You give your best to the company , and out of the blue , your role has been made redundant . It will be a real shock to you . Sometimes , the reality does not sink in until after a few days , when you realise that you have to rely on your savings to pay for bills , children 's school fees , housing loans , etc . That 's when you feel really lost , helpless and anxious . " <p> To motivate retrenched employees , Pang would also find opportunities in the conversations to guide them on moving forward in their lives : <p> " Most importantly , I check in with them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job opportunities . I will advise them to look at this as an opportunity to think about what they want to do and to stay relevant by thinking about what skills they should pick up , upgrading themselves or trying out a different industry during this period . " <p> Pang also explains that it usually takes several rounds of conversations before his colleagues can persuade the company 's top management to provide retrenchment benefits for an affected employee . <p> When asked what the best part of his job is , Pang says : <p> " Being able to persuade the company to provide even a little bit of retrenchment benefits makes me happy , because it can go a long way in helping the retrenched worker and his or her family tide through this difficult period . " <h> Not mandatory for employers to pay out retrenchment benefits <p> According to Pang , one thing that many people do not know is that it is actually not mandatory for companies to pay out retrenchment benefits unless it is mentioned in the employment contract . <p> As explained on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depends on what is provided for in the employment contract , memoranda of understanding or collective agreement ( for unionised companies ) . If there is no contractual provision , it is to be negotiated between employees ( or their union ) and the employers . " <p> As far as possible , employers should pay a reasonable sum to enable the affected employees to move on to new employment opportunities . <p> Having said this , employers who are in sound financial positions but choose not to provide any retrenchment benefits may be denied future government support or have their work pass privileges suspended . <p> If you believe that you have been wrongly denied your right to these retrenchment benefits despite it being provided for in your employment contract , you can seek the assistance of MOM or TAFEP by writing in to email protected <p> You may also visit this link to find out more information about retrenchment benefits . <p> Work in Progress is a sponsored series by MOM that helped this writer understand more about the JSS and retrenchment benefits .

@@63382240 <p> But the full reality of the situation -- the fact that it impacts people I love more than it does me -- hit me hard about a month ago , when I received a text from the Ministry of Health ( MOH ) informing me that I had been given a quarantine order . <p> It forced me to come to terms with the questions : What does it mean to be socially-responsible in endemic Covid-19 times ? Even if I 'm safe , how do I keep my vulnerable loved ones safe ? <h> The stress of putting my grandmother at risk <p> When I received the call that I had been in close contact with a positive Covid-19 case , I was furious at myself . My initial thought was , " Why the hell would I choose to go out that day of all days ? " <p> I normally do n't go out often for leisure , but the day I decided to go to the movies and have a good time , I turned out to be a close contact with a Covid-19 positive case . <p> But another realisation then dawned on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the confirmed case , I met my 92-year-old grandmother , who is unvaccinated , for dinner . <p> I went to her home for about three hours -- had dinner , chatted with her , and even shared a hug with her before I left . And it never crossed my mind that I could be a threat to her and her health . <p> Of course , I felt extremely anxious waiting for the results of my first PCR test . <p> Waiting in my quarantine facility , I checked my phone at least six to seven times , just waiting for the results to come in . I felt guilty that I could have , even in the slightest chance , put my grandmother in harm 's way . <h> Negative PCR test , but the anxiety was still there <p> Thankfully , my first test result came back negative . But the anxiety did n't quite settle , because I was n't " safe " until my second test . Because of that , I have to admit that my time in quarantine was not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel . <p> I googled the chances of someone testing negative on their first PCR test but then positive on their second two weeks later . I also felt a little under the weather , which , now looking back , was probably just my mind playing tricks on me . <p> I was just hoping that I could get an answer so I could tell my grandma , and anyone else I met after the day of my exposure , that I tested negative for Covid-19 . <p> At the end of my quarantine order , I took another PCR test , and thankfully it came back negative . I was extremely relieved and finally , for the first time that week , I had a good night 's rest . <h> Becoming more cautious <p> Since Singapore 's reopening , there have been varying degrees of restrictions put in place for social gatherings and dining out -- wearing of masks , social group sizes and social distancing . For the most part , however , it is n't illegal to go out . <p> Before my quarantine order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made me think that everything was pretty good and safe . <p> And of course , I do n't blame anyone for going out . Everyone wants to regain some semblance of normalcy . <p> But since my quarantine ended , I have become more cautious and have n't really left the house much -- I wash my hands immediately when I come home , even before greeting my dogs , and make use of public hand sanitisers more often . I 've also taken it on myself to not visit my grandmas or my young cousins and nephews for the time being , which has n't been easy for me . <p> I think it finally hit me that getting Covid-19 could happen to anyone , including me , and I could be a carrier to more vulnerable people like my grandmother . <p> However , not being able to visit my loved ones during this pandemic period took a toll on me . <p> In pre-Covid-19 times , I used to visit my extended family at least once a week and have joyous gatherings during the holidays . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I find that any time I can spend with them is precious . <p> Now , it feels like avoiding them for the time being , for their own safety , would be the right thing to do . <p> Because while the spread of the virus is out of any one person 's control , we all can minimise the risk of transmission to vulnerable groups . Which is what I fear : being the one to transmit a potentially deadly virus to people like my grandma . <h> Living in fear is unsustainable <p> I was pretty hard on myself for choosing to go out for a movie that day ; it seemed to me like my decision to have fun could have had dire consequences -- the possibility of testing positive and spreading the virus to my grandma . <p> However , being a close contact or contracting the virus could happen anywhere , and to anyone , whether it be from going to the supermarket , running errands , having a quick meal with a loved one , or sending your kids to school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diligently and updating my parents regularly -- most of the time , the numbers only seem to confirm my worries that the situation is n't too good right now . <p> Currently , Singapore 's vaccination rate as of Sep . 22 is 82 per cent -- a very respectable rate . Plus , it 's not that we do n't have a good contact tracing system . <p> But I ca n't help but still feel worried and scared . <p> As case numbers climb and are expected to exceed 3,000 in a couple of weeks , I imagine that we would be faced with these questions : Should we just take extra precautions and give that outing a miss ? How many outings should we be turning down ? And finally , is it possible to not go out at all ? Well , until when ? <h> Lowering transmission &amp; protecting loved ones <p> In an endemic Covid-19 state , which is the direction we 're inevitably headed towards , we 'll eventually have to live with the acceptance that someone near us may have the virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowering the risk of transmission . <p> Many younger people who are fully vaccinated , including my friends and I , are reassured that it is unlikely for us to fall seriously ill if we were to be infected . But , this is n't the case for vulnerable people in our community . <p> Visiting or living with those who are vulnerable is n't so simple . My vaccinated dad is 70 this year , and his age puts him in a vulnerable position . <p> For me , I think the best way to keep him safe is to have good practices even at home : wash my hands before touching anyone , use sharing utensils while eating , not go out too often , etc . <p> When it comes to visiting other vulnerable people , like my grandmother , I 'm planning to take an ART test before I go and make sure that I have few to no outings in the week prior to that , just to be safe . <p> In the long run , we 'll have to learn to live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to live with the guilt that I infected a vulnerable loved one because I was out partying . <p> I am lucky to be young and healthy , but there 's a community of people who ca n't bear the same risks . <p> Some of these practices that I plan to employ to protect my older family members are easier to keep up with than others . In an endemic state , how long can I really change my behaviour or limit my lifestyle choices because of this fear , before it becomes unsustainable ? Honestly , I do n't know . <p> But getting that Quarantine Order was definitely a much-needed wakeup call for me to think about these questions . 
@@63416232 <p> Near the end of a 10-hour marathon debate on the Foreign Interference ( Countermeasures ) Bill ( FICA ) on Monday ( Oct. 4 ) , Minister for Home Affairs and Law K. Shanmugam gave his closing speech . <p> In it , he addressed questions and clarifications raised by a number of Members of Parliament ( MPs ) on the Bill , and laid out the plans for the tribunal . <p> He also criticised the way the debate had gone , claiming that the Workers ' Party ( WP ) MPs did not engage substantively with what he had said . <h> Who checks the checkers ? <p> One of the main concerns raised by the WP MPs in their proposed amendments and speeches was the potential overreach that the Bill could facilitate , and they thus called for more checks and balances to be implemented . <p> In his speech , WP MP Leon Perera said that FICA overlooks the potential for foreign interference through influencing senior government figures , including the Minister for Home Affairs or even the Prime Minister . <p> " Who checks the checkers ? " , he asked , positing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people holding more power , such as ministers . <p> Perera asked whether , under the Bill , the Minister for Home Affairs would be able to take action against fellow ministers or even the Prime Minister , if such a case of foreign interference directed at ministers were indeed to be successful . <p> In addition , he asked what the recourse would be if the Minister for Home Affairs himself or herself fell under foreign influence . <p> In his speech , Shanmugam stated : " The ultimate check are the people . " <p> He went on to say , " But do you expect the people as a collective body to deal with day-to-day problems of foreign interference ? That is why we are elected . And we are in Parliament here to debate what is the best way possible for the people . " <h> Open court process not appropriate for sensitive intelligence work <p> He agreed that executive powers must be subject to checks and balances , but added that the question is what form the checks and balances should take . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court process would not be appropriate due to heavy reliance on sensitive intelligence , collaboration with foreign counterparts , and many things that can not be publicly disclosed . <p> Shanmugam stated that in cases when the courts have been deemed not to be suitable , the government has implemented other bodies or tribunals with statutorily imposed safeguards ; in this case , a Supreme Court judge is appointed to chair the tribunal . <h> Tribunal given powers to overrule minister 's decision <p> WP MP He Ting Ru had proposed an amendment to make it such that appeals would be heard by the High Court , rather than the reviewing tribunal , " in line with the doctrine of the separation of powers " . <p> She stressed that the reviewing tribunal -- which is appointed under the advice of the Cabinet -- is " clearly not an effective substitute for the Courts " and thus creates a situation that is " effectively a check , by the executive , on an executive decision " . <p> Perera referred to the tribunal as " government-appointed " , and called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the standard of independent oversight that is seen to be independent , a standard that is embodied in our judiciary " . <p> Shanmugam then chided Perera 's reference of the tribunal as " government-appointed " , saying , " Let 's please not insult our High Court judges . Please . " <p> The tribunal , he said , has been given powers to overrule the minister 's decision . In addition , a clause in the Bill protects the members of the tribunal from pressure , and states that the minister is not allowed to reduce the salary or terms of office once the tribunal members are appointed by the President . <p> Shanmugam stated that the tribunal will be able to consider a matter without telling the appellant the full details of the conduct that the appeal is about , but explained that there are reasons full evidence sometimes can not be given : <p> " There might be times when the evidence might need to be given to the tribunal for it to be looked at and decide for itself whether it makes sense to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of orders that can be made . We 're not talking about the liberty of the individual . " <h> Set-up of the tribunal <p> Shanmugam elaborated on how the tribunal will be chosen and set up . <p> It will be a standing tribunal , with a few discrete and fixed panels set up . <p> Members will be selected for their areas of expertise , and will need to undergo security vetting due to the fact that they will be receiving highly classified , highly confidential information . <p> The members must be people with experience and standing , he said , similar to any other tribunals or independent committee . <p> They will be given the same protection and privileges as a Supreme Court Judge , and they must protect secret information , under the Official Secrets Act . <p> Shanmugam stated that , while it is not written in law , Supreme Court judges are appointed to panels after consultation with the Chief Justice . He added that he had spoken with the Chief Justice to suggest some names . <p> Specific rules for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other laws -- will be worked out in the coming months as subsidiary legislation , and the rules will be public . <h> How the tribunal will work <p> Shanmugam also laid out a broad outline of how the tribunal will function : <p> " The government will have to present the evidence to convince the tribunal . The tribunal will have powers to call witnesses and compel the production of documents . <p> Information will be disclosed to the appellant to the extent that it is not sensitive from a national security perspective . The Tribunal can take an inquisitorial approach when the information can not be given to the appellant . <p> And the tribunal will decide whether to uphold or overturn directions . " <p> In addition , he said , the tribunal will be able to consolidate and hear similar appeals as a single case , or take one case as a reference point that will apply to other similar cases . <p> The tribunal will also be able to dismiss " frivolous or vexatious " appeals . <h> Use of powers and transparency <p> Shanmugam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of powers under FICA and the degree of transparency that will be given . <p> Progress Singapore Party member Leong Mun Wai voiced concerns that under the Bill , a person could be arrested with " no need to give them a reason " and detained without bail , and that the government would not be need to reveal a source of evidence . <p> Shanmugam stated that under the Bill , there is no detention without trial . Rather , there is a power to give some directions . <p> " In the Bill , the powers of arrest relate to specific offences which need to be proven in Court -- like any other offence -- and proven beyond reasonable doubt . Those will be prosecuted in open court . " <p> He also addressed a concern expressed by WP MP Jamus Lim , on whether a person who was tricked into committing harmful activities would be charged . Shanmugam clarified that in such a situation the elements of an offence would not be made out , and thus , there would be no basis for criminal action . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government has made the decision not to name foreign state actors suspected to be involved in attempts of foreign interference , due to wider national and foreign policy considerations . <p> However , he said , they will alert Singaporeans when such communications activity has been detected and if FICA directions are issued to block and contain such foreign interference . <h> All Directions issued under FICA will be made public ( except for Technical Assistance Directions ) <p> All Part 3 activities -- which are Directions Against Harmful Foreign Online Communications Activity -- will be published on a website accessible to the public , except for Technical Assistance Directions . <p> This is because " national security concerns may make it impracticable to publish the reasons for actions taken " , Shanmugam explained . However , he said that when possible , the government will tell the public the broad grounds for issuance of directions . <p> PAP MP Xie Yao Quan had asked whether appeals made and ruled under FICA will be published , to which Shanmugam replied that it " would depend on the facts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the information used , the less likely we are able to do so , " Shanmugam said . <h> Difference between covert and overt actions <p> In his speech , Perera also asked whether Shanmugam would agree to applying FICA directives and actions " equally to foreigners who improperly intervene in our domestic politics " , regardless of whether they were supporting the PAP or the opposition . <p> He gave an example of a man living in Europe who " runs a Facebook page that makes frequent interventions concerning partisan politics in Singapore , often to defend the ruling party and criticise the opposition in Singapore " . <p> Shanmugam replied saying that if a foreign commentator writes articles and puts out his name , people are able to assess for themselves how much weight to attach to his ideas . <p> " It probably will not come within the proportionality test , " he said , but added that it depends on a variety of factors , such as the facts , whether there is covert action , the intensity and the nature of the matter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covert or deceptive is an assessment that " depends on many factors " , he explained . <p> " Indicators of covert or deceptive behaviour would include attempts to mask the tracks , misrepresent their identity , attempting to launder their narratives by having them amplified by sympathetic or unwitting locals , and these can never be exhausted . " <p> " There is a line -- a fine one -- between a campaign to persuade and a campaign to manipulate , " Shanmugam stated . <p> " When the campaigning is done openly , Singaporeans know who the content is from , they are able to make up their own minds , and you know , free to agree , disagree . It depends on their persuasion . <p> In fact , Singaporeans are free to agree with a foreign idea , if they are so persuaded . So , in our view , that should not be criminalised . " <h> FICA not meant to stop from interactions with foreigners <p> Several MPs , both from the PAP and the Opposition , had asked about whether FICA would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clan associations , and more . <p> Shanmugam said that the short answer is , no . He explained : <p> " FICA will not stop individuals , businesses and organisations in Singapore from building overseas partnerships , soliciting overseas businesses , networking with foreigners , sourcing for donations , discussing government policies or political matters that affect their businesses with foreign colleagues or business partners , or supporting charities . " <p> That is , as long as these interactions are done in an " open and transparent manner " and " not part of an attempt to manipulate our political discourse or undermine public interest such as security " , he added . <p> He also clarified that FICA does not cover Singaporeans expressing their own views : " It goes without saying : Singaporeans have every right to speak up on our domestic politics . They are free to engage in advocacy . That is not touched by FICA " <h> FICA is only part of picture <p> In his speech , Singh had brought up the lack of non-legislative measures to deal with foreign interference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information . <p> Shanmugam said that the government agrees with Singh . <p> " I have explained that FICA is part of a comprehensive strategy to deal with foreign interference . Powers under FICA are only part of the picture , and I have said it is a calibrated piece of legislation to allow us to act surgically against threats . " <p> In addition to legislation such as FICA , he stated that the government has been and will continue to strengthen other defences against the threat of foreign interference , such as detection and response capabilities and Singaporeans ' ability to discern legitimate and artificial online discourse . <p> Shanmugam highlighted some of the public education programmes that the government has introduced , such as the Digital Media and Information Literacy Framework , which educates the public on using information more responsibly and the risks and benefits of technology . <p> The government ca n't do this alone , and it needs a whole-of-society effort to engage in this public education , he said . <p> " So , we will welcome everyone 's assistance in helping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he insisted that these efforts " must be complemented with strong laws , which is the focus of FICA " .
