@@4614234 <p> Ever wondered how a badminton shuttlecock flies ? This Badzine special feature takes a scientific look at the flight of the shuttle through the magic of computational fluid dynamic simulation . <p> By Denis Vuillemin , Badzine Special Contributor <p> Perhaps most of you are more or less faithful badminton players who have been joyfully practicing and passionately reading Badzine about the game . So am I. But have you ever wondered how that curious thing , the badminton shuttlecock , flies ? If you think that looking at this badminton question from a scientific point of view sounds interesting , take some time ( and maybe have some aspirin handy ) to read a few lines which will bring you a new vision of your flying shuttlecock ! <p> CFD ? What 's that ? <p> Usual CFD application for an experimental rocket <p> Any time you watch a weather forecast on TV , you have , no doubt , been shown those maps with curious moving lines and vortexes . Would you ever have thought that you could apply that type of model to a badminton shuttlecock ? Well , I decided to merge my two oldest passions : aerodynamics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured I could investigate with my means and my knowledge on my own to finally visualize what 's happening around a shuttle during its flying motion . <p> Now , in the case of using the same science for meteorological forecasts , the science can be imprecise , particularly when one is trying to predict the weather a week in advance . But let me explain you how it does work , on a shuttlecock . <p> The equations in fluid mechanics ( the science of fluids , liquids and gas motion ) are very complicated , so complicated that it would take several weeks for a human to solve one in a complex geometry such as a shuttle . In such cases , we use computational fluid dynamics ( CFD ) , to predict what will happen , just like meteorologists do . This means that the space is divided into millions of very tiny cells and every fluid mechanics equation is solved by a supercomputer for very short time increments . <p> For example , imagine I 'd like to predict the flow behaviour around a shuttle over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If my space model is divided into 10 million cells , and my time increment is 10 ? s ( 0.00001s ) , then the supercomputer will solve the 10 million CFD equations on ten thousand different time ' periods ' . Then there are 2 main equations in fluid mechanics , for each of the 3 dimensions of space , which make a total of ... let 's see ... <p> Sorry ... It would take generations for human to solve that . That 's why we leave that job to supercomputers , just like those used for meteorological forecasts or nuclear prevention scenarios . <p> I will not explain the entire theory of fluid mechanics due to its complexity , but if you 're interested you will find the 2 governing equations ( the Navier Stokes equation and the mass conservation equation ) here . <p> Modeling a virtual badminton shuttlecock <p> Virtual Shuttlecock conception <p> Let 's begin . Engineers have come up with some fantastic computing tools for three-dimensional conceptualization to create virtual designs with expensive or complicated geometries before actually trying to build them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shuttlecock on computer-aided-design software such as that used to design famous aircraft like the Airbus A380 or the Rafale fighter jet . <p> Just with my ruler , compass and protractor I measured the real dimensions of a classical feather shuttlecock . I successfully designed the cork , the collars , and then , placed the feathers inside , just like in real life . <p> I acknowledge that I 'm not really an expert yet ; thus , as a first model , the shuttle is considered as inflexible , and feathers are solid ( not porous ) . Moreover , the spinning motion of the shuttle will not be studied with this model . <p> The meshing ( dividing surfaces and space ) procedure is quiet complicated . An example of the shuttle mesh is shown below : <p> Example of a coarse mesh around the shuttlecock model <p> The surface of the shuttle is divided into very small cells ( around 0.1mm ) whereas the rest of the space will be affected with larger cells . Of course , the higher the number of cells , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater the accuracy , the longer and more expensive the calculation , too ! But once the mesh is ready , actually with 75 million cells , the model can be exported into supercomputers in order to run the simulations . <p> Simulation Results <p> I decided to run the simulation with a constant velocity of 250km/h -- the speed of an above-average professional badminton smash -- to visualize how the flow acts on the shuttle during its motion . <p> Pressure on the shuttle surface and its path <p> Cp is called coefficient of pressure , the higher it is , the higher the pressure applied on the area . An interesting thing to see is that the biggest pressure is applied on the cork and in the bottom of feathers . Indeed , in the cork , the Cp has a value of 1 , which means it 's a stagnation point : the flow stops exactly at this point ! Moreover , the high pressure applied on the feather base , ( meaning high aerodynamic forces ) might explain why our shuttles tend to break suddenly so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two adjacent feathers ! Actually , the pressure is very high outside the feathers , and very low inside them , which yields to very strong aerodynamic forces , applied from outside to inside the shuttle . <p> The table below summarizes the repartition of aerodynamic forces on a shuttlecock as Drag ( Train ? e ) , Lift ( Portance ) and Side force ( force lat ? rale ) : <p> Suddenly , we understand why once the shuttle loses a bunch of feathers ; it simply becomes an unstoppable rocket ! Almost no more forces are applied if feathers are broken . And as lift and side force are negligible compared to drag , we understand there why , a shuttle , is definitely bound to slow down very quickly . Indeed , all feathers undergo a force of 4N , which approximately represents a weight of 400 grams ( remember that since a shuttle weighs only 5 grams , it 's tantamount to a human holding off an African elephant ! ) <p> Inside Velocity Animation with mesh : <p> Outside Velocity Animation : <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside the shuttlecock , and inside it . The animation is more beautiful that useful , but we can easily see there the huge drag yielded by the feathers : the velocity is much reduced in the wake of the shuttle due to its feathers . <p> Some of you have noticed the absence of vortexes in the wake of the shuttle . Of course , the turbulence is so huge at 250km/h that there are many vortexes ! <p> But for this simulation , I used a calculation method called LES ( Large Eddy Simulation ) , which averages the equations and shows only the main flow and cancels micro perturbations and vortexes . <p> Moreover , we can see inside the shuttle that the flow is very unstable , even if it 's not spinning here . Needless to say , if one feather is changed , the whole flow inside the shuttle and consequently its trajectory will be changed . That 's why our favourite badminton superstars love changing shuttlecock every 2 points ! <p> An idea of the turbulence explicated can be visualized on the animation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pretty mess inside the shuttle ! This animation is showing all the properties explained before and can summarize the whole behaviour of a steady shuttlecock during its motion . <p> Turbulence and velocity field animation : <p> Well , that 's it for a first public scientific approach of aerodynamics , applied to the badminton shuttlecock . I 'm very sorry if you 'll have a headache all the day now ... But just imagine there are many things that can be improved in my model : implement the spinning motion , simulate a feather break ... Broadly , science will always be busy , and even a simple shuttlecock can be a whole lifetime of research ! <h> 3 Comments <p> Great article ! I always thought the use of CFD to model shuttlecocks would be quite interesting though I think treating the feathers as solid and not considering spin means the results are limited as the degree at which the feathers allow air through will influence drag .

Chandran <p> Published : 5 March 2014 10:48 AM <p> Sustainability is a word which resonates in the ears and lingers in the minds of concerned consumers all the way up to chief executives of multinational corporations . <p> It is a concept that is making waves in many diverse industries and markets . Above and beyond the traditional annual reports that highlight operations as well as profits and losses , companies now have to report on their sustainability . <p> This will provide accountability and showcase efforts undertaken in ensuring that economic growth goes hand in hand with social and environmental safeguards and improvements . <p> In other words , it is no longer enough to generate huge profits , for investors and stakeholders are also interested in how companies integrate people and planet and profits into the triple bottom line . <p> " Sustainability " is finding the compromise between the need for economic expansion while minding both the social and environmental impacts that may arise from the related activities . It is a market-driven agenda stemming from the rise of ethical consumerism . <p> Consumers are increasingly aware of the environmental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now hold these companies more and more responsible , pressuring them to take immediate action to dampen any adverse effects that occur as a direct or indirect outcome from their commercial activities . <p> Into this steps the Environmental and Social Non-Governmental Organisations ( NGOs ) , which promotes itself as a trustworthy and influential faction as it polices or champions the various relevant causes . <p> This somewhat differs , however , in countries such as the United States , France and United Kingdom , among others , where industries such as agriculture are regulated and monitored . <p> Palm oil is by no means excluded from this subject . <p> Without question , the issue of sustainability in palm oil production is the greatest challenge of the coming decades . More than two billion people will be joining the human race by 2050 , at which time 70% to 80% of the population will be living in cities and consuming more edible oils and fats . <p> Standing at the nexus of these changes , the agricultural sector is simultaneously facing unprecedented scrutiny from governments , regulators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their business practices impact on the environment and the wider world . <p> Palm oil has been at the forefront of these environmental and reputational challenges . <p> However it must not be forgotten that oil palm cultivation uses a small proportion of available agricultural land , compared with massive users such as the cattle industry . ( See the FAO report " Livestock 's Long Shadow " . ) <p> With Malaysia being the number one trader and the second largest palm oil producer in the world , this scrutiny hits close to home . <p> The significance of ensuring that the world 's most widely consumed edible oil is produced sustainably should be high on the agenda of all palm oil producers in the country . <p> We anticipate growing criticism against agro-based industries with relatively new issues emerging , such as , perceived lack of transparency with respect to land use change , rights of indigenous people and local communities , deforestation , peat land conversion , loss of biodiversity , greenhouse gas emissions and zero waste . <p> But how do we ensure that sustainability is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk ? <p> Enter RSPO -- the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil -- the first global multi-stakeholder initiative as a response to this call . <p> RSPO promotes the production and uptake of sustainable palm oil through cooperation and open dialogue with its stakeholders with the ultimate goal of transforming markets to make sustainable palm oil the norm . <p> It has made unprecedented progress since its formation 10 years ago and is today , the most advanced standard setting platform that is dedicated to the sustainable production of a single commodity . <p> Today , the RSPO comprises 1,400 members covering the entire supply chain of an extensively used and traded commodity . <p> It has taken pains to set a robust standard to ensure that the industry subscribes to best management practices . <p> The RSPO principles and criteria ( P&amp;C ) stretch across the environmental , human rights and governance agendas . Compared with other commodity alliances , the RSPO is a phenomenal success story because it is a market-driven instrument working to use resources responsibly . <p> The decision-making process in RSPO is only achieved through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it operates under great constraints and pressure . <p> Often enough , it is a battlefield among stakeholders which differ in opinion while focused on similar goals . On one hand , there are stakeholders who feel the RSPO places too much pressure on them with the perception that these demands are too Euro-centric . <p> On the other hand , other stakeholders have expressly and vociferously stated that not enough is being done . They have questioned the relevance and credibility of the RSPO standards and devised their own higher standards or RSPO++ . <p> A decade after its inception , RSPO had its stakeholders come together to work on and most recently , revise the RSPO principles &amp; criteria , which are the certification standards . <p> To achieve the common goal , this tug-of-war will inevitably persist . Both sides of the divide will realise that ultimately , there can be no winner as compromise and understanding is indeed crucial in such a complex multi-stakeholder organisation . <p> The RSPO today is the platform on which plantation operators face the challenges of the 21st century . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Certification by the RSPO is already on a par with that of the Fair Trade International ( FTI ) , Forest Stewardship Council ( FSC ) , Better Cotton Initiative ( BCI ) , Round Table on Responsible Soy ( RTRS ) , Ethical Tea Partnership ( ETP ) , Marine Stewardship Council ( MSC ) , 4C Association for coffee , Bonsucro for sugarcane , RA-Cert by Rainforest Alliance and other stewardship councils . <p> The transformative effect that RSPO has had on plantations and mills is quite evident . Improved staff morale and reduced turnover , better yields , more consistency , improved community and government relations -- these are all the norm . <p> Within the foreseeable future , investors , buyers , traders , together with China and India will all converge around concepts of sustainability and traceability . <p> Indeed the major importer of edible oils into China is already committed to importing only sustainably produced palm oil and the same applies to another significant importer of vegetable oils into India . <p> What will this mean for major producers ? Indeed , we stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil palm : the incredibly high yields , the carbon sequestration and the mass employment of the rural poor . <p> As an industry , we now have two choices . The first is that we accept that the world , our customers , have the right to insist on sustainably produced palm oil , to the ultimate benefit of both producers and consumers . <p> The alternative is ostrich like , which is to hide our heads in the sand , refuse to change our production standards and be shunned and attacked worldwide for our intransigence . <p> This will endanger the plantation industry as we know it , putting our national resources at risk . <p> Nor , in making our decision , should we disregard the old adage : the customer is always right . The choice for our industry now is either between realising this sustained economic benefit and pursuing a short-sighted position that may put our national resources and industries at risk . <p> It is , therefore , essential that we take the right decisions at this time and operate our key sectors with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transparent production according to credible international standards does not generate a net cost for companies or our economic development . <p> In fact , it is quite the opposite . RSPO-compliant operations are simply more profitable , in terms of benefits conferred both directly and indirectly on both the estate operations and the environment in which the plantation operates . <p> For the estate , research has shown benefits for employees insofar work conditions , better housing and amenities and for society , in terms of preservation of unpolluted water courses , leading to benefits downstream and retention of riparian reserves . <p> In parallel , these standards generate broader social benefits for our people and preserve the key natural resources that underpin the wealth of our nations . <p> We should , therefore , recognise that extra costs of compliance with enhanced levels of sustainability are the price which producers must pay for retaining the support of the ultimate consumers of our products . <p> Currently consumers in the developed world are calling for such safeguards , but as indicated above , it is only a matter of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the developing world as well . <p> While the establishment of the RSPO has not yet to completely resolved the issues faced by the palm oil sector , it certainly has come a long way in inspiring change and innovation . <p> It has made an excellent start with an unwavering commitment to move forward and strengthen the commitment of its members to sustainability . <p> As of late 2013 , there are 14 Malaysian plantation companies with 105 palm oil mills that are RSPO-certified . The total certified plantation area is almost one million hectares , or nearly 20% of the total land bank under oil palm cultivation in the country , producing 4.3 million tonnes of certified sustainable palm oil ( CSPO ) and 1.1 million tonnes of certified sustainable palm kernel ( CSPK ) . <p> Many others have decided to jump on the bandwagon with a multiplicity of standards revolving around palm oil such as the International Standard for Carbon Certification ( ISCC ) , Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil ( ISPO ) and the newly introduced Malaysian Sustainable Palm Oil ( MSPO ) having emerged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislate sustainable practices in the oil palm industry to strengthen these and perhaps similar standards that may materialise in time to come . <p> The last two national-based organisations will ensure that all producers in their respective countries will at least achieve a basic level of sustainability in their operations and facilitate the way to later full RSPO certification , carrying with it a degree of international recognition so far not available elsewhere . <p> Whatever the standard adopted , be it RSPO , ISCC , ISPO or MSPO , participants , and indeed the standard setters themselves in those organisations , must be prepared to progress by addressing new issues and higher standards : for one of the core principles of any standard is continuous improvement . <p> Since palm and palm kernel oil and their derivatives constitute essential ingredients for food , fuel and oleo-chemical products worldwide in many different industries , the sustainability of palm oil has become an international issue that requires an international standard . <p> RSPO uniquely provides this platform . <p> We must all remember that RSPO enhances the acceptability of palm oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March 5 , 2014 . <p> * M.R.

Is it a demographic bonus , as believed by the government , to have a productive working force and create a market for production , or a burden that is demographically unsustainable and threatening the long-term socio-economic development of the country ? <p> I believe that we have to create an Indonesia that can sustain our population now and in the future , in the forms of economic progress , productive working force , healthy social surroundings and viable environment . <p> However , looking at the current population of Indonesia , 250,585,668 ( World Population Review , December 2013 ) , with an additional of 15 million in just three years , can the future Indonesia sustain this demographic bonus/burden ? <p> Indonesia 's population is the fourth largest on earth after China , India and the United States . In January 2014 , the National Development Planning Ministry ( BAPPENAS ) presented the Indonesian Population Projections for 2010-2035 to President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono ( SBY ) , highlighting the population growth of 33.4 million in 10 years or from 237.7 million in 2010 to 271.1 million in 2020 and a staggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growth at 1.4% , relatively low in terms of percentage but huge in absolute figures , is not slowing down and may likely soar . <p> The government , so far , employs hands-off approach in addressing the population growth .

SBY noted that the population growth create opportunities such as the demographic dividends which are the driving force for development and help propel economic growth due to the rising number of the middle-income class as a lucrative market . <p> On the other hand , he also pointed out the challenges that have to be confronted , such as a larger population would require more availability of basic human needs . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the necessity to control population growth . The government has overlooked the fact that the baby-boom trend is demographically unsustainable . <p> The government has misconstrued a simple equation that a growing population would require more natural resources which are finite and has already been depleted . Dire consequences of unsustainable population growth will fuel poverty and competing demands of resources , which may lead to fundamentalisms , chaos , economic downturn and disintegration of the country . <p> Worse , the government is indifferent towards making any remarks or official statement on its commitment to better manage the population growth and set the optimal population for Indonesia . <p> Indonesia 's population growth in the period of 1990-2010 is among the highest in the world with 31% growth from 184 million in 1990 to 239 in 2010 . During the same years , Nigeria has the highest rate of 62% followed by Pakistan 55% , Bangladesh 41% and India 40% . <p> The most populous country , China , fared better in managing growth rate at 17.1% .

The government has changed its priority to put family planning and population control as a subset of development , sidelined family planning programmes and abandoned what were once the most successful public education and awareness efforts . <p> The absence of this important programme has led not only to higher birth rates but also help reverse the family values to more traditional ones which are based on the " more children means more prosperity " concept and also fertilised religious conservatism , including more permissive polygamy , gender-bias policies and younger marriage age . <p> The projection gave a grim picture on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lead to mitigate current population growth .

We need to set 300 million as the ideal population in 2035 and aim for zero population growth in 20 years through gradual growth reductions from existing 1.4% to 0% . <p> This can only be achieved with serious commitment and investment from the government and stakeholders , covering a policy framework to integrate family planning with household economic improvement and the provision of incentives for birth control . <p> It has to be augmented with efforts to revitalise nationwide family-planning facilities and services to villages or hamlets , such as having mother and baby care service post ( Posyandu ) and healthcare services to provide birth control measures at grassroots level . <p> The government must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stakeholders to re-create the national mindset and rebuild family values in support of curbing the population growth and birth control .

The 685kWp photovoltaic system installed there can supply 30% of the mall 's energy needs or power 250 typical Malaysian households for a month . It saves emission of 360 tonnes of carbon dioxide annually . -- Suria KLCC <p> Under the Feed-in Tariff scheme , anybody can be a solar power producer . <p> THE current dry spell may be driving many crazy , but Michael Chou is unperturbed . He welcomes it , in fact , for the solar cells atop his house in Shah Alam , Selangor , are chalking up plenty of kilowatts under the sunny , cloudless sky . <p> " The solar power generation is at an all-time high , over 40kWh a day . These are the biggest numbers I have seen since I installed the system almost four months ago , " said Chou . <p> He is among the 1,900 people generating solar energy in their homes . After years of slow progress , growth of the solar energy sector is finally seeing a healthy spurt ; more roofs are sporting solar cells while sprawling solar farms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the roofs of malls and car parks . <p> It is all due to the Government 's Feed-in Tariff ( FiT ) scheme to promote generation of green energy , under which companies and house-owners can produce renewable energy for the national grid from four sources ( solar , biogas , biomass and hydro ) and get paid favourable rates for it . When the quota of 1.5MW for non-commercial solar PV projects ( residences and buildings ) was released last September for applicants , it was snapped up within an hour . <p> Growing demand has seen the cost of solar panels dropping and becoming more affordable . The smallest system of 4kWp now costs around RM40,000 compared with RM50,000 to RM60,000 two years ago . So , installing solar cells to produce energy in your home is now a reality , as in Chou 's case . He is still awaiting payment for the sale of energy from the 12kWp system installed in his home in October , but estimates that he has earned some RM5,000so far . <p> A closed landfill in Pajam , Negri Sembilan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 8MW solar farm by Cypark Resources . <p> " Installing the PV system is not just for investment . Equally important is that I 'm producing green energy . I would prefer to use the solar energy myself as it will reduce my carbon footprint , but under the present FiT system , it has to go to the grid , " says the simulator flight instructor . <p> Tapping sunlight <p> Another solar energy producer is Datuk Dr Abu Bakar Jaafar , who has a 4.75kWp system in his home in Bukit Jelutong , Shah Alam . He had installed the system in 2009 under the Suria 1000 project , whereby the Government subsidised the PV system . The former Department of Environment director-general had paid half of the total cost of RM120,000 . <p> His earnings from the solar power vary between months depending on the weather and cloud cover ; it ranges from RM620 ( the rainy season in December and January ) to RM720 ( in the warm months of February and March ) . Most months , he generates more than what he uses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm about one-third of the way to getting a return on my investment . " <p> He does not use the green energy himself as it is fed into the grid . This is a better system , he reckons , for if he were to be totally independent of the grid , the cost will be higher due to the battery for energy storage and other supporting systems . <p> The 5MW Fortune 11 solar farm in Sepang , Selangor , sits on oil palm land leased from Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd . The panels move with the sun so as to tap maximum solar radiation . <p> Dr Abu Bakar believes small power producers like himself should be encouraged . <p> " We 're generating surplus power that 's taken up by others who need it . So we wo n't need big power generators . If the Government is serious about renewable energy , we should expand this programme . If home-owners do n't want to pay for the PV system , we can have an organisation which installs the systems on their roofs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Aside from residential roofs , large PV installations are also boosting the local power supply with solar energy . Driving towards KL International Airport ( KLIA ) in Sepang , Selangor , one will pass by rows of glinting solar panels amidst oil palms . And when your aircraft lands , look out the window and you might catch a glimpse of solar panels on the roof of the airport satellite building and a nearby car park . All three projects , by Sunedison , are the latest commercial solar energy schemes here . <p> " It is a good site as solar farms should be away from tall buildings to avoid shading , " says Sunedison business development director Naresh Kumar Govindan . What makes this project unique , he adds , is the tracker system which enables the panels to follow the sun 's path in order to tap maximum sunlight . So the 17,000 solar panels in the farm will face either East or West , depending on the time of the day , and will sit horizontally when the sun is directly overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof is one of the largest such facilities in the world and will be a case study for other airports . Likewise , the 10MW installation on the parking canopy is among the world 's biggest " solar car parks " and will supply power to KLIA2 , the new low-cost carrier terminal . <p> " Rooftops , parking lots and buffer areas at airports are traditionally not multi-purpose facilities , but we 've turned them into a clean energy generation facility , " says MAHB managing director Tan Sri Bashir Ahmad during the launch of the solar farms last month . <p> For the Malaysian Photovoltaic Industry Association , generating solar energy is a no-brainer . <p> " Solar will buffer against the impact of future fluctuations in fossil fuel prices . It improves energy security as it reduces dependence on gas and coal . Solar power will be produced during peak demand hours , thus benefiting TNB , which need not run expensive gas-fired power plants to meet the daily maximum demand . It will also save on foreign exchange on imported gas , " says president Ahmad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boost the solar energy sector , the association has two suggestions : implement " net metering " and establish utility-scale solar farms outside of the FiT programme . In the net metering approach , the solar energy generator uses the power first and feeds the unused power to the grid . This differs from the present FiT scheme where all generated power goes to the grid . <p> Ahmad Shazli says with electricity prices foreseen to hike in the future ( the Government is gradually withdrawing gas subsidy until 2015 ) , commercial and industrial premises will want to install PV systems to produce energy for their own use . The sector now consumes 70% of our electricity supply ( 40,000GWh by commercial premises and 30,000GWh by industrial premises in 2010 ) . <p> The industry group also suggests the installation of large-scale solar utilities of over 30MW as only such sizeable facilities can divert the current dependence on fossil fuel power plants . Currently , the largest solar farm in the country is of 10MW capacity ; Thailand , on the other hand , already has a 84MW solar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make PV systems cheaper , such as expanding the current exemption on import duty and sales tax for solar modules and inverters ( which convert the direct current output of a solar panel into alternating current ) to all PV system equipment and components . <p> " This will encourage more people and businesses to invest in PV systems . With these incentives , the industrial and commercial sector will be able to get a return on their investment in under 10 years , " says association vice-president Chin Soo Mau . " The tax exemptions will also make installation of PV systems more attractive for holiday chalets and small-scale food processing industries in remote areas , many of which now rely on diesel generators . " <p> Chin says current tax incentives assist companies , not house-owners . For instance , the waiver on sales tax for solar cells and inverters benefits only operators of big solar installations . It will be tedious for home-owners to fill numerous forms to obtain the waiver . There is also financial support for companies under the Green Technology Financing Scheme whereby the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finance green projects . <p> Keen to see more houses with PV systems , the association disagrees with Sustainable Energy Development Authority 's ( SEDA , the statutory body that administers the FiT scheme ) current approach of emphasising commercial projects . <p> " In Germany , 80% of the quota goes to residential but in Malaysia , it goes to commercial set-ups . With a higher quota for residential , more people will get the opportunity to produce solar power . Since the money is from the people ( collected from home-owners for the Renewable Energy Fund to pay for the green power ) , they should be given the chance to install solar panels . More households will benefit instead of just one company . "

Jambu Air <p> This pinkish-purplish all-rounder manages to be juicy , crunchy , AND packed with minerals ! Consisting 93% water content , the jambu is carb-free and fat-free . At the same time , a serving of this wonder fruit contains vitamins A and C , as well as calcium , iron , magnesium , phosphorus , potassium , zinc , manganese and dietary fibre . <p> Shopping tip : Choose the ones with full-coloured and shiny skin for the best flavour . Avoid wrinkly and scratched skin as they are n't fresh and wo n't be as juicy . <p> 2 . Dragon fruit <p> These pretty pink things may look slightly like lost aliens , but they 're sweet , creamy and pulpy , and smells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protein , and provides other nutrients like vitamin C , phosphorus , calcium , fibre , and antioxidants . Not overly sweet , this super fruit is also low-cal ! ( Plus you can eat the seeds , so no pesky de-seeding chores ) . <p> Shopping tip : Look for bright , even-coloured skin . It should be firm when pressed and give a ripe kiwi-like smell . Stay away from soft , mushy ones , those are over ripe . <p> 3 . Bananas <p> Popularly available in bright yellow , these fruits can also be found in red and purple , and when unripe , green ! While bananas bruise easily , their sweet tender flesh is oh-so-filling when you need a quick yummy breakfast . <p> Bananas are a good source of potassium and hence are highly recommended by doctors for patients with low potassium levels . <p> One big banana ( about 8-9 inches in length ) packs 580-600mg of potassium and gives you 120-140 calories . It also has 2g of protein , 4g of fibre , and an abundance of vitamins and minerals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect your heart from heart diseases . Besides that , the banana 's antacid effects help shield you from stomach ulcers . If you 're having trouble pooping , banana 's soluble fibre helps ease the way . Bananas are rich in fructoologosaccharide ( a prebiotic ) , which nourishes the probiotic in the colon to lower your risk of colon cancer . <p> Shopping tip : Pick bananas according to when you plan to use them . If you get green ones , they 'll ripen over time . If you want to consume them immediately , get the ripe yellow ones . Avoid bruised bananas ( those with brown spots ) as they will only get worse when you store them at home . <p> 4 . Custard apple <p> The cousin of the soursop , the custard apple is also called nona , sitaphal , or bullock 's heart . Break open the green bulbous skin and you 'll bite into a delectably soft , sweet and milky flesh . <p> Creamy white in colour and starchy , custard apple flesh is a good source of energy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All parts of the plant have great medicinal values . For example , an alcohol extracted from the custard apples ( known as anocorin ) is used in various pharmaceutical preparations for its insecticidal properties . <p> Shopping tip : Custard apples are extremely fragile and spoil easily when they 're fully ripe . Try getting unripe fruit at the pasar malam and allow it to ripen at room temperature . After ripening , custard apples can be refrigerated for one or two days . Stay away from custard apples with bruises and black spots . <p> 5 . Jackfruit <p> Fondly known to Malaysians as nangka , this majestic fruit is believed to be the largest tree-borne fruit in the world . It reaches almost 35kg in weight ( like a chubby toddler ! ) and measures up to 90cm ! <p> You can always sniff out the nearest nangka stall by identifying its distinctly strong odour , but the fruit is also a great source of dietary fibre containing carbs with no simple sugar content . <p> Jackfruit delivers a vitamin C , A , and manganese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The phytonutrients found in jackfruit can help your body fight disease-causing free radicals and help prevent hypertension . <p> Did you know you could also eat the jackfruit seeds after you dunk them in boiling water ? They are a rich source of complex carbs , dietary fibre , vitamins A , C , and certain B vitamins , as well as calcium , zinc , and phosphorus . Boiled jackfruit seeds are surprisingly tasty ( they taste a bit like lotus roots ) and can substitute potatoes at the dinner table . <p> Shopping tip : As the jackfruit is rather large , most markets sell them sliced . If you intend to buy the whole fruit , go for the sweeter-smelling jackfruit with no obvious bruises or splits . <p> 6 . Mango <p> A tropical fruit that comes in as many as 1,000 different varieties , the mango is perhaps one of the most popular fruits in the universe ( ok , maybe we 've exaggerated a little ) . <p> Its uniquely sweet flavour and fragrance puts it right up there amongst the kings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carotenoids , fibre , and vitamins A , C , and E make this a fruit worthy of its status . <p> Shopping tip : You need to squeeze it ( very gently because otherwise the fruit stall uncle 's going to yell at you ) and a ripe mango will give way slightly . If it 's hard , it 's probably not ripe enough for consumption . Sniff at the stem end and if the scent screams " mango " , it 's ready to be devoured . As for unripe mangoes , they 're not going to ripen if you store them in the fridge , so room temperature 's best . <p> 7 . Coconut <p> Practically every bit of the amazing coconut can be used in some part of your daily life . The oil can be used for cooking ( and beauty ) , the juice for quenching your thirst , the meat for eating , and the shell for decor . <p> Coconut water has been found to be beneficial for urinary problems ( by facilitating a quick urinary passage ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lauric acid , monounsaturated oleic acid , and has superior antigenotoxic activity ( limits the effects of genotoxin , a toxic agent which damages DNA molecules ) . It does not contain cholesterol but provides dietary fiber ( for an easier time on the toilet ) . <p> Shopping tip : Choose uncracked ones and shake them . If you hear water sloshing inside , that 's good ( it means you get a drink ) . <p> 8 . Papaya <p> Pear-shaped and rather large ( with some growing as long as 50cm ) , these orange fruits contain the enzyme papain that helps to digest proteins . Rich in antioxidant nutrients like carotenes , vitamin C and flavonoids , papayas also provide dietary fibre , vitamins E , A , and K. <p> Shopping tip : As papayas should be eaten immediately when ripened , it 's better to pick a semi-ripe one when at the market . Choose one that has a reddish orange and green shade which is slightly soft to the touch .

@@4634234 <h> Push for a better quality of life <p> AS I prepared for my presentation to the prime minister last week on what the government can do to enhance Malaysians ' quality of life during the Ministry of Finance 's annual budget consultation , I asked myself what exactly " quality of life " means . After all , this could mean different things to different people , especially comparing against regional , gender , age , income and ethnic variations . <p> After reviewing international data and weighing it against personal considerations , my proposals eventually centred around three broad themes of improving public services , having better jobs and a work-life balance , and finally enhancing civic participation which a transparent and accountable government would complement . <p> In the Economist Intelligence Unit 's " Where-to-be-born Index 2013 " , previously known as the " Quality of Life Index " , Malaysia ranks 36 out of 80 countries with a score of 6.62 out of 10 , 1 being the best and 10 being the worst . Switzerland is in the top spot with Singapore in 6th place , South Korea in 19th and Thailand 50th positions . <p> Measures used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , life expectancy , climate , many of which are fairly intuitive and to be expected , especially job security and physical security . Interestingly , quality of family and community life were also included , and perhaps most relevant to civil society activists , governance and gender equality . <p> The OECD has an excellent " Better Life Index " , which asks what matters most to people around the world . Although only a small set of 122 responses in Malaysia were obtained , it shows that health , work-life balance , life satisfaction , education and safety rank very highly . <p> Respondents in Australia , Norway and Sweden , the top three in the index globally , chose housing , income , jobs , community and even civic engagement as the most important in determining the quality of their lives . The more developed the country , the more likely it is that people seem to value community and civic engagement . <p> Improving public services <p> The first proposal was to improve public transport . For instance , the share of public transport in 1985 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12% in 2011 . Although efforts have been made recently to consolidate the previously fractured administrative units covering public transport through SPAD and Greater KL initiatives , there are still outstanding areas that need attention . <p> First , state and local governments are not being sufficiently empowered . Public transport can not be only centrally controlled , as problems start at the local levels . Councils should be used to identify gridlock areas , and errant bus operators . Public transport desks in local councils can be set up to liaise with SPAD , which the Ipoh City Council recently announced . Selangor has set up its Public Transport Council , and it is positive that SPAD has been co-operative thus far . <p> Extended walkways and bicycle lanes should be prioritised , but these should be built closer to train stations . Bikes should be allowed on all railway options . <p> Companies can be given incentives if they allow shower facilities . Cycling to work is a healthy option that would reduce traffic congestion , but conditions must be right . Finally , public transport efforts should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover cities like Malacca , Ipoh and Penang . <p> The second proposal was how the non-state sector could contribute to helping in education services . IDEAS conducted a nationwide survey on parents from the bottom 40% , on the challenges they face with children 's education . We found that only 15% of poor parents benefit from the Poor Students ' Trust Fund , among other findings . <p> There are 10,000 public schools in Malaysia , and the government should be open in working with non-state players to help poor families . But we , outside of government , need clear , defined guidelines on how non-state players can contribute to education services . <p> School boards should be actively restored and encouraged , so that alumni and even surrounding community members can get involved in helping the school . NGOs and social enterprises can be set up through venture funds . <p> The Ministry of Education should also release school rankings publicly . This includes both academic and extra-curricular performance , as this would encourage competition among school leaders to improve . <p> Households in the Klang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This could have been avoided by adopting water demand management early on , which was my third proposal . This requires a paradigm shift from planning for water supply to water demand . <p> This would avoid the need to even develop new resources , and instead encourages water recycling and conservation . Incentives can easily be given to developers that install water-efficient equipment . SPAN as the water regulator should strictly enforce water operators ' activities especially on Non-Revenue Water . <p> I was mugged twice last year ( once in Petaling Jaya and once in Malacca ) , and still get paranoid when I hear motorcycles on the road . This affects my quality of life and mental health . My fourth proposal was on combating crime , where more personnel should be moved from the Special Branch to the CID as a matter of priority , with a strong focus on street crime . <p> An important aspect the administration has not considered is to provide transparent data on crime hot spots . <p> Finally , the public ought to be involved . We all have smartphones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update Facebook and Twitter on-the-go , why not share crime hotspots , crime incidents on social media ? <p> Beat the criminals by getting the public flooding an area in instant time that a certain crime has occurred . There simply is n't enough of co-operation and sharing of information between the police and all other stakeholders . <p> Better jobs and work-life balance <p> A better work-life balance is difficult enough as it is for city-dwellers , and much more so for working women who are also mothers . <p> Talent Corporation has already developed a " flexibility in the workplace " programme that provides tax incentives to companies that provide flexi-hours , and childcare centres to accommodate working mothers . <p> Women should also be encouraged to take part in public office , since being city councillor may offer the kind of flexibility needed for the work-life balance they seek . <p> Transparent government and civic participation <p> By conventional standards , a transparent government does not directly impact on the rakyat 's lives . But transparency and openness equals a government actively engaged with its people . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involved and increase their respect and trust for the government . <p> The first is on the Open Government Partnership , an international platform for governments to make public their commitments to being more open , accountable and responsive . <p> The second is the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative ( EITI ) , an international standard to improve the governance of natural resource revenues via collaboration between government , civil society and oil companies in the oil and gas sector . <p> Oil revenue contributes 40% to our national coffers . We do have a Kumpulan Wang Amanah Negara ( KWAN ) , or Heritage Fund , which is managed by Bank Negara , but such data should be published regularly since its objective is to ensure oil money is sustainable for future generations . <p> This is not the case currently . Signing up to these two initiatives would reflect strongly upon the government 's commitment to governance . <p> Finally , the two most important measures in improving civic participation are the Freedom of Information Act and local government elections . Allowing citizens to access data means they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them feel included by building a sense of ownership over the country and outcomes . <p> Local councils are the very first point of contact that we have . They provide the most basic of public services , and therefore need better accountability . <p> These were the 10 recommendations I presented on improving quality of life in Malaysia . We shall see if any of these are considered for inclusion when the 2015 budget is tabled in Parliament on Oct 10.

He finds both experiences bittersweet . <p> BY Zairil Khir Johari <p> Zairil Khir Johari is a chocolate **26;262;TOOLONG . He finds both experiences bittersweet . <p> Published : 31 May 2014 <p> Earlier this month , I had the privilege of attending the 44th St Gallen Symposium , an annual international conference held in a picturesque town in eastern Switzerland , having been selected as a global " Leader of Tomorrow " by the International Students Council of the University of St Gallen . <p> Over the three-day conference , I met many other young men and women under the age of 35 from all corners of the world , each a leader in their field . From entrepreneurs to venture capitalists to Ivy League scholars to fellow politicians , I relished the opportunity to engage them in workshops , debates and forums . <p> The presence of so many up-and-coming young leaders certainly proved that capability is not age specific . One impressive example that I came across was Lazar Krstic , a Yale-trained 29-year-old from Serbia who was appointed last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought that surely such an appointment must have been an anomaly rather than the norm , until I was told the current Austrian Minister of Foreign Affairs is only 27 years old . Despite being Malaysia 's youngest serving MP at 31 , I suddenly felt old . <p> The theme of this year 's symposium was interestingly entitled " The Clash of Generations " . This is an issue that is quickly gaining relevance in Europe , a continent with a disproportionately large aging population . As a result , fissures have emerged , such as the prospect of rising healthcare costs and unsustainable pensions growth . <p> In Malaysia , we face an inter-generational divide as well , though the problem is not quite the same . With more than 70% of the population below the age of 40 , the increasing number of Malaysians entering the workforce in the next few decades will be enough to sustain the pension payments of the older and smaller demographic of retirees . <p> Nevertheless , the situation in Malaysia produces a different set of issues . For example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will require the creation of not only more jobs , but higher-paying ones . This will require our education system to keep up in terms of staying relevant to industry needs . Besides creating better opportunities , we also need to ensure the vibrancy of our workforce , and that requires us to keep our brightest young minds from leaving our country in search of greener pastures elsewhere ( especially across the causeway ) . <p> Between new politics and old politics <p> In Malaysia , the " clash of generations " is not only manifested in the socio-economic sphere , but also the political one . In fact , I have experienced it first-hand as the deputy campaign director of DAP 's Teluk Intan by-election campaign these last two weeks . <p> In this case , the clash is not simply due to the age gap between our young lawyer , Dyana Sofya , and the seasoned president of Gerakan , Dato Mah Siew Keong . Instead , it is between what they each represent -- between new politics and old politics . <p> The stark differences between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Take for example statements made by senior BN leaders such as Defence Minister Dato Seri Zahid Hamidi , who smugly remarked that Dyana was " ... not as pretty in person as in pictures and on television " . <p> Far from being an isolated lapse of judgement , such an incredibly crude line of argument , as misogynistic and patronising as it sounds , continued to pepper the headlines during the entire campaign . One by one , BN ministers have trumpeted the same sexist tune . <p> Minister of Urban Wellbeing , Housing and Local Government Dato Abdul Rahman Dahlan insinuated that people would vote for Dyana simply because she wears lipstick , while Deputy Finance Minister Dato Ahmad Maslan compared her looks to his wife 's . Capping it off was Deputy Minister for Agriculture and Agro-based Industries , Dato Tajuddin Abdul Rahman , who suggested that it was not wrong to " gawk at her beauty " . <p> Besides the testosterone-induced need to flex their male egos , there has been nothing to suggest that BN leaders have realised the need to try anything other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , intimidation , race mongering and the wanton abuse of government machinery . <p> And this is in spite of the fact that BN has experienced a steady downtrend in electoral results ever since abandoning their reform agenda post-2004 . Instead , it is Pakatan Rakyat that has managed to capture public imagination with policy ideas to improve socio-economic welfare , reform state institutions and fight against corruption . <p> In contrast to BN , DAP 's Teluk Intan campaign has been all about the new brand of constructive politics for which young Malaysians yearn . To begin with , a fresh , idealistic and educated young candidate is proffered , as opposed to our opponent 's recycled contender . Besides being young and female , she also comes across as the unlikeliest of DAP candidates -- Malay , active Umno family and UiTM-trained . <p> Yet despite being what a fellow columnist recently termed as an " Umno product " , Dyana is everything Umno is n't . Vowing to " Malaysianise " Malaysia , she has time and again proven that she will steer clear from the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to present a parliamentary agenda that encompasses policies concerning cost of living , good governance , youth development and women empowerment -- choices made after fusing empirical data from local surveys with her own policy interests . <p> The contrast between the two political paradigms is not surprising , given the vastly different historical experiences that divide the two generations in question . In this context , I have always suggested that a Malaysian dichotomy exists between those above and below the age of 40 . <p> Malaysians above the age of 40 lived through a tumultuous post-war period that included the Emergency , the struggle for independence , the merger , the split and the traumatic racial riots of May 13 , 1969 . For those of us born after , these historical incidences do not quite shape our world-view the same way it has shaped our parents ' . Instead , our experience has been shaped by 22 years of Mahathirism , Reformasi and the Bersih rallies . <p> This is why every general election in this country since our generation came of age as voters has seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general election when Pak Lah was elected as prime minister with an unprecedented majority on the promise to breathe fresh air into a political landscape dominated by one man for the last two decades . <p> Meanwhile , whatever reforms that were promised first by Pak Lah and then by his successor Najib have fizzled out as corruption , cronyism and state monopoly capitalism continue to plague the country 's economy , while the right-wing agenda has become politically dominant . <p> As such , it is all the more vital that Dyana Sofya wins the Teluk Intan by-election . A victory for Dyana would not only send her to Parliament , but also signal the victory of new ideas and constructive politics over BN 's outdated and arrogant politics premised upon race , religion and the total abuse of power . <p> And so , after two weeks of intense campaigning , Teluk Intan goes to the polls today . Although I believe we have done all we can , I can not help but feel nervous and excited at the same time -- nervous in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited at the prospects that a Pakatan Rakyat victory would bring . <p> It is therefore my hope that , come this evening , the feisty young lady I recruited three years ago will take over from me as the 13th Malaysian Parliament 's youngest MP , and in so doing possibly also become the catalyst for much-needed change in Malaysian politics . -- May 31 , 2014 . <p> Please refrain from nicknames or comments of a racist , sexist , personal , vulgar or derogatory nature , or you may risk being blocked from commenting in our website .

Although tourism is not the main source of revenue ( yet ) , Teluk Intan still has a number of attractions worthy of your time . <p> The Leaning Tower of Teluk Intan right smack in the town square was erected in 1885 and was once a water tower supplying water to the entire town ; ironically the underground stream and presumably the constant flooding tilted the tower a good one foot , rendering the tower unstable for storing water and it was transformed into a tourist attraction . <p> Savour the silky chee cheong fun stuffed with dried shrimps , chopped jicama and fragrant fried shallots together with pickled green chilliesTeluk Intan still holds a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hailed from this town .

@@4634238 <h> ROS Lboard <h> Islamic banking terms in personal loans explained <p> June 10 , 2014 <p> So to help you make the best choices , we have compiled a short guide of terms commonly found in Islamic personal loan pages . <p> FEATURE <p> By Brendon Lee <p> If you 've been scouting around for a good personal loan plan you probably would have come across many Syariah-compliant loans : which essentially mean they are in line with Islamic teachings . Syariah refers to laws and practices in Islam and banks that observe this offer alternative financial schemes that operate under these principals . <p> Syariah compliant loans are also available to Non-Muslims and getting a grasp of the Islamic financing system can be challenging when you are not familiar with Syariah principles , especially with all the specific terminology used . <p> So to help you make the best choices , we have compiled a short guide of terms commonly found in Islamic personal loan pages . This is not meant as a definitive glossary but more as an introduction before you start applying . <p> For personal loans in general <p> Gharar -- Refers to financial dealings of unfair practices or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these include investments involving high risks and where the Aqida ( consequence ) is not sufficiently known . For instance , as gambling and short-selling are considered Gharar and are not allowed in a Syariah-compliant business entity . <p> Hibah -- Because interest-giving ( riba ) is against Syariah law , banks may instead award a token ' gift ' to customers with saving accounts . Although in principal it sounds similar to interest given by conventional banks , hibah is voluntary at the sole discretion of the bank . <p> Wadiah -- Wadiah is the concept of custody or safekeeping ( Amanah ) and refers to deposits customers make into their accounts . In return they occasionally receive hibah as a token gift from the bank . Also applies to other services such as deposit boxes and custodial services . <p> For those purchasing a car <p> Ibra ' -- Loosely translated as the ' waiver on right to claim ' , ibra ' is the waiving of the right to collect further monies owed when customers settle their loans ahead of the agreed settlement period . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or profit as referred herein ) up to the date of settlement and not for the entire term as agreed in the agreement . This only applies to sale-based financing such as a hire purchase . Bank Negara Malaysia has recently released a guideline for ibra ' urging more Islamic Financial Institutions to take up the practice so expect to see this new feature pop up a lot in banks . <p> Ijarah Thumma Bai ' -- The Islamic approach to hire purchase loans ; the process incorporates a two-phase contract between bank and debtor . Instead of lending the money , the bank acquires the vehicle on behalf of the customer and leases it them on an agreed term and price . This part of the contract is called Ijarah . Once the conditions of the tenure have been met the second contract , Bai comes into effect officiating the purchase of the vehicle and transference of ownership . <p> Qard -- Shorten from Qard Hassan which means a good or benevolent loan . It layman terms qard is an interest-free loan given on a goodwill basis on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but may pay more than the principal amount as a gesture . This practice is at the discretion of the borrower however and is not a guaranteed outcome of every transaction . <p> For those looking to buy a home <p> Murabahah -- The concept of Murabahah can not be termed as a loan but is more of a purchase of some commodity or property which is then sold to the customer on a deferred payment schedule which includes an amount of profit . It is , like the Ijarah Thumma Bai , a sale and not a financing facility . As such , before a transaction is agreed upon the seller must provide information on actual cost , profit margin and all additional charges on an asset . This form of transparency is to ensure that all financial agreements are made in good faith and protects the interest of both parties and adheres to the term of being a sale and not a loan . Murabahah can not be affected on anything that is n't a saleable commodity or property , such as payment of salaries or debts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract is drawn between two or more parties and profit is shared according to an agreed profit/loss sharing ratio . In the context of real estate and property the bank will assess imputed rent and share the rates in advance before the final agreement . You will see this term often if you are looking into applying for an Islamic home loan . <p> Wakalah -- The Islamic concept of ' power of attorney ' . In this context the bank would act on behalf of the customer to deal with particular business undertakings . It is an ' investment service ' offered by the bank according to Syariah principles . Under the Wakalah system , the bank is able to charge a fee for the investment ' service ' rendered . Upon cancellation , the investor will be given the net amount invested after minusing the requisite fees . <p> As you can see , Islamic banking in Malaysia is not that foreign from conventional financial institutions . Aside from an aversion to interest-based transactions , Islamic personal loans operate on a co-operative system meant to encourage profit-sharing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates it is advisable to consider all options available .

@@4634239 <p> PIC : The GuardianDONATING organs has been gaining awareness in recent times especially when considering that it is regarded in all major religions as a benevolent deed in helping others live their lives . <p> Organ transplant is no longer an alien procedure to society anymore . Many are up for it , supporting its cause around the globe . Malaysia too is not left behind . However , it seems that Malaysians seem reluctant to sign up voluntarily towards the cause despite widely known as the generous nation . <p> What about you ? Are you willing to donate your organs in order to save the live of another fellow human being ? Or are you one of those Malaysians reluctant to do so ? <p> No offense to those who are n't willing . But just read on and you 'll understand why it 's crucial to pledge as an organ donor in this country . <p> POOR STATISTICS <p> The 2014 statistics reads that Malaysia has around 250,000 registered organ pledge donors . The figure may look quite big but it only reflects 0.8% of the population . Thus , it 's not a surprise that Malaysia stands out as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as reported by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . <p> This number is crucially low as more and more people are ushered into operation theatres in hospitals in undergoing organ transplant procedures . The number of actual donors who have come forward to help and give others a better chance to live is a meager 458 . <p> PIC : theodrc.org Many are still on waiting lists to undergo transplant procedures urgently . Current figures claims that there are 18,081 people waiting for kidney transplant alone while there are others waiting patiently for selfless souls to donate their hearts , livers and lungs for a better living . <p> Where are we when these people need us the most ? <p> ALLIGN YOUR THINKING ON THE RIGHT TRACK <p> You 're not to be blamed for not having the confidence to donate your organs . Many , not only in Malaysia , have a misconception in donating organs . This has left them to be in fear and be insecured in pursuing this good deed . <p> According to Dr Muhammed Anis Abdul Wahab , Clinical Manager and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Hospital Kuala Lumpur , most people are confused with the term ' pledge ' and ' donor ' and both are different . <p> " Signing up to pledge does n't mean that it 's compulsory for you to donate . <p> " Not signing up to pledge does n't mean that you ca n't donate , " he explained . <p> After all , the pledge programme is an initiative by the Health Ministry as a means to measure the willingness of our society to donate organs in the future . <p> The current number of pledges stands at 250,000 and it does not indicate that we would have all the needed organs from them . Their families still has the veto power in consenting to pursue the intentions of the deceased . <p> Although the number of pledges is increasing through time but this sheds doubt when it comes to an urgent need of an organ by a patient . <p> DEMAND FOR ORGANS <p> The need for sufficient supply of kidneys is actually proportionate to the number of people needing it . Based on the report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for kidneys are longer as their life span can be extended even with a malfunction kidney . <p> Patients are still able to live with only one kidney despite having a dysfunctional one . Furthermore , these patients can rely on dialysis treatment as an alternative if they fail to undergo a kidney transplant . <p> Dr Muhammed Anis Abdul Wahab ( PIC : The Heat ) On the other hand , the number of heart and lung transplants is lower due to the limited lifetime of the patient . They can not afford to wait for long . When they needed it , it 's already urgent and most of the time , a matter of life and death according to Dr Muhammed Anis . <p> " Those who need kidney can opt for dialysis , but dialysis can only replace 30% of the kidney 's function . <p> " According to our statistics , less than 50% of those undergoing dialysis live more than 10 years , " explained the Clinical Manager and Deputy Head of Department of the National Transplant Resource Centre based in Hospital Kuala Lumpur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffer from social and economic problems . For example , to undergo dialysis treatment , the patient will need to attend a 3-times-a-week session with each session lasting 4 hours . This is usually the main reason why they end up unemployed . Not only that , dialysis treatment is also costly and thus still makes transplant an economic option in the long run . <p> We know globally black market for organs exists and this is due to the scarce of source for the needed organs . For example , in Saudi Arabia , the wounded patients came to the local hospitals for further checkup on the transplant process done outside of the country such as China , India and Pakistan . These patients were desperate to find an alternative to continue living and eventually black market is the only option open and could fulfill their needs . <p> Thank goodness Malaysia is safe from organ black market according to Dr Anis . This is because to carry out organ transplant process needs special skills , treatments and facilities . But there 's a possibility that it could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ YOU 'RE A MUSLIM ? NOT A PROBLEM ! <p> Recent reports by the Ministry of Health states that Malays who are predominantly Muslims , are the least to pledge as organ donors or to donate their organs in our organ bank . <p> This contradicts with the teachings of our Prophet ( Peace Be Upon Him ) . According to Abu Hurairah , the Messenger of Allah said : <p> " Whoever relieves a Muslim of a burden from the burdens of the world , Allah will relieve him from the burdens of the Day of Judgement . And whoever helps ease a difficulty in the world , Allah will grant him ease from difficulty in the world and in the world Here-after . " ( At-Tirmidhi ) <p> Fear remains the main issue for the tendency of society to be reluctant in signing up and pledging as an organ donor . This is because they do n't understand the transplant process and are n't sure if such deed is permissible in Islam . <p> When posed of such a situation , Dr Anis laughed and said that society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ referring to the guidelines issued by the Muftis . It is even stated in the National Fatwa issued in 1977 on the need to donate organs for the well-being of society . <p> " The Muftis understand the reasoning behind the need to donate organs . They have nothing against this , " he chuckled . <p> Associate Professor Dato ' Dr Mohd Asri Zainul Abidin agrees with Dr Anis , saying that donating organs for others is healthy and explains that the fear revolving around Muslims in Malaysia is mainly due to misleading assumptions on the donation process . <p> " Inefficiency in managing the process is what bothers the Muslims . It is especially in the delay in managing the body after the organ is removed and onto immediate burial . <p> " In my opinion , we need to improve the management system involving before , during and after the process , " he explains . <p> When asked if it 's alright to donate to a non-Muslim as there have been debates about it , he smiled and said yes . <p> " It 's alright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're donating to the Israeli Prime Minister who is fighting and committing genocide towards the Palestinians , then it 's prohibited , " said the ex-Mufti of Perlis . <p> LET 'S PLEDGE ! <p> Hafiz Hamidun , a famous Malay nasyid singer , has actually recently pledged as an organ donor at a programme organized by the National Transplant Resource Centre . <p> The ex-UNIC member was made aware of the low statistics and felt that it was his social responsibility to give back to society by helping them by way of pledging . <p> " I feel I should be part of the statistic . It 's my responsibility to society . <p> " The low statistics show that Malaysians are lacking the awareness on organ donation . They do n't know that donating organs also include your skin , cornea and limbs , " he said . <p> When asked of his advise in calling society to pledge as a donor , he smiled and said that knowledge is the remedy to this problem . <p> " Increase your knowledge of this issue and mingle around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it from a different point of view . <p> " Imagine ourselves in the patient 's shoe and there 's no organ supply because no one is willing to help .

@@4634240 <p> You may now stop agonizing over what you eat . What 's always been clear to anyone with the nutritional wit to know it , that the traditional Mediterranean and Asian diets were both healthy and delicious , has now been established as true beyond all reasonable doubt . <p> Ancel Adams , scientist and inventor of WW2 K-Rations , was telling Americans exactly this way back in 1947 . Elizabeth David told Brits and the ANZACs as early as 1946 . What they told us then and what we all know now , except for the Big Food Barons , is that a Mediterranean diet is not just delicious and nutritious , but people who eat this way live longer and healthier lives , without succumbing to heart disease and strokes , and with greatly diminished risks of diabetes , dementia and cancers . <p> The evidence keeps piling up . In January of this year the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition reported the results of a study drawn from over 93,000 women of the Women 's Health Initiative 1993-2008 designed to establish the difference in risk of sudden cardiac death between the DASH ( Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean Diet was associated with a large and significant reduction in risk of sudden cardiac deaths . While there was no comparable risk reduction in deaths as a result of the DASH diet , it is known that this low fat diet reduces blood pressure effectively . <p> Elizabeth David by David Bailey , London 1966 <p> Wider and more conclusively yet , in February of last year the New England Journal of Medicine published findings of a major clinical trial measuring the direct effects of the Mediterranean Diet on cardiovascular disease . So conclusive were the results that the study was ended after just four years because the results were so very clear it was considered unethical to continue.What the study found was that 30 percent of heart attacks , strokes and deaths from heart disease can be prevented in people at high risk if they switch to a Mediterranean diet rich in olive oil , nuts , beans , fish , fruits and vegetables , and wine with meals . <p> The research is especially noteworthy in that the diet saved lives among those following it , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were already taking statins , or blood pressure or diabetes drugs to lower their heart disease risk . <p> Demonising Fats to Sell Sugar <p> It is a lamentable fact that since 1985 there has been a massive and well-funded disinformation campaign devised by vested interests in the food and pharmaceutical industries , who have co-opted government and the medical establishment , in a program designed to shift the blame for heart disease and stroke away from the refined sugars they peddle , and where it mostly belongs , onto fat -- all fats , that is except artificially made ones ( trans fats ) . Even today Big Food and its co-opted creatures in government make it as difficult as possible for you to tell from food labels just how much sugar they have secreted into their otherwise tasteless low-fat approximations of real food . <p> Americans and Britons now consume a colossal annual per capita of 100 lbs ( 45 to 50 Kg ) of sugar , mostly in the hidden form of HFCS ( high fructose corn syrup ) used in low-fat ( diet ) sodas and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good .... the Harvard School of Public Health reveals a strong correlation between the consumption of refined carbohydrates and increased risk of breast cancer , in addition to the chronic diseases already linked to excess sugar consumption : diabetes , obesity , hypertension , heart disease , metabolic syndrome , asthma and now cancer . <p> What the consensus of scientific opinion is now being permitted to tell us is that some fats are actually good for us , some good in moderation or in low amounts and the only truly bad fats are the food industry 's own trans fats or hydrogenated oils they 've been selling us for the past quarter of a century in their packaged foodstuffs . Even previously demonised saturated fats , consumed in moderation and in " real " food forms can be good for you ( butter , eggs , coconut oil , etc . ) . <p> The Med Diet -- what it is ... <p> For those who did n't already know about it , and amazingly it seems a majority of Americans did n't , the Mediterranean Diet was officially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walter Willett of Harvard 's School of Public Health and others defined the Mediterranean Diet as based on " food patterns typical of Crete , much of the rest of Greece , and southern Italy in the early 1960s " . This diet , in addition to " regular physical activity , " emphasizes " abundant plant foods , fresh fruit as the typical daily dessert , olive oil as the principal source of fat , dairy products ( principally cheese and yogurt ) , and fish and poultry consumed in low to moderate amounts , zero to four eggs consumed weekly , red meat consumed in low amounts , and wine consumed in low to moderate amounts " . Total fat in the diet is 25% to 35% of calories , with saturated fat at 8% or less of calories . <p> Olive oil is often considered characteristic of the Mediterranean diet , containing a very high level of monounsaturated fats , most notably oleic acid , which studies show is linked to a reduction in coronary heart disease risk . There is also evidence that the antioxidants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it has other anti-inflammatory and anti-hypertensive effects . <p> A word of caution . Rancid oils , no matter how intrinsically good they may be when freshly pressed , are actively harmful to you when rancid or adulterated . Those of you familiar with the pervasive odour of fish fried in rancid oils that wafts around whole neighbourhoods will know what I mean . Alas olive oil , whose fresh aroma is a gift from the Gods is only to be trusted to deliver its health-giving benefits in its cold pressed extra virgin forms and then only under the imprimatur of a trusted organization . The world is rightly suspicious of all the supposedly Italian olive oils , which can come from almost anywhere and be mixed from oils of varying the qualities from many countries and in many cases blended with non-olive oils . So widespread is the problem that today you will probably find some of best and most reliable olive oils originating in California and Australia . <p> What it 's not ... <p> Having stated what the Mediterranean Diet is , it is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not , for instance , a license to pig out daily on vast plates of pasta smothered in creamy , cheesy ( processed ) sauces . Neither pasta nor bread , even whole grain breads should be eaten excessively . Real fresh and natural ingredients , moderation and sensible sized portions along with regular physical activity are what make such a diet work . <p> Conning yourself and gaming the diet ( remember : watch those desserts and satisfy your sweet tooth with whole fruit , ) will negate the benefits . Those Cretan men surveyed back in the1960s were seven times less likely to die from heart disease and strokes than their US counterpart . Today those causes of death are still much lower in Crete , but they 've risen 30% nonetheless . You can put that down to an increase in consumption of sugar and modern convenience foods , along with a less active life style . <p> What goes for the Mediterranean diet applies equally in Asia . The Asian Diet Pyramid emphasizes a wide base of rice , rice products , noodles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ processed foods , topped by another large band of fruits , vegetables , legumes , herbs , nuts and seeds . Daily physical exercise , a small amount of natural vegetable oil and a moderate consumption of alcohol are also recommended daily . <p> It seems to me a Mediterranean diet is a diet only in the general sense . It 's a great relief to relax and eat deliciously and naturally knowing that it 's keeping you healthy and that your only requirement is not to overeat and to exercise reasonably regularly .

' and as a patriotic and forward-looking Malaysian , I would like to respond in two areas . <p> English is now the third most spoken language worldwide ( after Chinese and Hindi ) with some 400m speakers . Due to its widespread use in many sectors , it is now the most widely learned second language in the world . Many students across the world are required to learn and master English , both spoken and written . A working knowledge of English is a must for anyone to excel in any field . <p> Since the phasing out of English as a medium of instruction in the Malaysian education system beginning in the 1970s and with English being relegated to a second language in our schools , the standard of the language has plunged . Consequently , English has become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to national interest in the long term . <p> Many local graduates are unable to find employment in the private sector due to their poor command of English -- which is not their fault as they are the product of the national education system . It pains me to see so many young Malaysians both in the private and public sectors struggling even to communicate in simple language . How do we expect them to represent the country on international assignments ? <p> The government has realised the seriousness of the decline in English among our students by making English a compulsory subject to pass in the SPM examination , starting from 2016 . This is something to be lauded . But as students only study and learn English as a single subject , more must be done by the government , parents , and the community to boost its learning , especially spoken English . Many students struggle to communicate in English due to limited opportunities , the environment , their mindset and a lack of self-confidence . <p> Being knowledgeable and competent in English , besides our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today 's globalised and competitive world . Fail to master English and we will be left behind ; this is the reality we have to accept . Therefore , the government urgently needs to bring back English-medium schools in the country to arrest the total decline of English in Malaysia and start producing students who are well-versed in the language to meet the needs of the country . <p> Another equally important issue is the question of the official recognition of The Unified Examination Certificate ( UEC ) , which was first established in 1975 by the Association of Chinese School Teachers and Trustees ( Dong Jiao Zong ) . This is a standardised exam taken by all students of all 60 Chinese independent secondary schools in Malaysia . These independent schools are supported by students ' fees and donations by the public ( mainly the Chinese Malaysian community ) . These students also sit for the SPM as private students . <p> At present , the UEC is recognised as an entrance qualification by many educational institutions in the UK , US , Taiwan , Macau , Hong Kong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sadly , after 39 years , the Malaysian government has not yet officially recognised the UEC for entry into local public universities . This has created much frustration and unhappiness among the Chinese community . <p> Along with mission and English schools , Chinese education has been around in this country for a long time , way before Merdeka . They have played an important and meaningful role in nation-building . <p> There is no reason for the government not to recognise the UEC . For the ultimate good and prosperity of the nation , the authorities must view the UEC solely from the education and labour point of view and come up with a positive announcement soon . <p> Otherwise , we would continue to lose many talented , bright and capable students to other countries like Taiwan and Singapore . With just six years left beforee we attain Vision 2020 in turning Malaysia into a fully developed and high-income country , we can not afford to lose any more talent . We must harness our people 's talent and use them fully to propel the nation forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 COMMENTS <p> The Umno schmucks know every bit of what you mentioned about the importance of english . But they just ca n't imagine what is more important for them than remaining in Putrajaya for them to enrich themselves . Hence they would implement policies , in the name of national unity , progress and so on and on . But the real truth is they just want to remain in Putrajaya , for reasons as mentioned above .... Most important of all it is to ensure their own survival because a well educated population would have them kicked out of Putrajaya long ago . They just want all Malaysians to remain as illiterate as possible just so these Umno schmucks can stay as tenants of Putrajaya ! <p> Notwithstanding the poor standard of English in our education system , the biggest setback is the automatic promotion of our students to the next level irrespective of their ability to cope .

More importantly , should n't the weakness of the students be addressed in a timely manner instead of blindly promoting them towards the inevitable failure at the end of their secondary school life .

In just three short years , there is already a waiting list of 40 children seeking admission .

It vibrated like the plucked strings of a violin and the gathering crowd felt it . <p> Whatever it was , a quietness enveloped the Leong San Tong Khoo Kongsi clan house , Lebuh Cannon , George Town . But not for long . The voice of a girl which said , " We shall start after the call to prayer " broke the silence . <p> It was on the heels of this prayerful note that Penang-born filmmaker Saw Teong Hin 's Hokkien play , Hai Ki Xin Lor : You Mean The World To Me , began at this rustic venue . The Hai Ki Xin Lor , which ran from last Thursday to Sunday , was possibly one of the most talked about shows at the recent George Town Festival 2014 . <p> Originally written for a film , Saw had to put the project on hold as many interested parties insisted the play used Mandarin instead . <p> The director , better known for Malaysia 's first epic saga Puteri Gunung Ledang , stuck to his guns , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the festival came a-calling . <p> " I really appreciate how adamant Teong Hin was to have the play in Hokkien .

He visits his sister in the process and heartbreak abounds . <p> " This story is about family and however messed up it is , family will still be family , " said Frederick Lee , who plays Sunny . <p> Layers of love : The past ( lower floor ) and the present ( upper floor ) unfolded at the same time in this ingenious staging of Hai Ki Xin Lor : You Mean The World To Me at the recent George Town Festival . <p> This honest and daring play touched on elements that would speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ambition , disappointments , sacrifices and secrets . And it was these themes that formed the skeleton of the show that annulled the language barrier and conjured something very truthful and relatable . <p> The key figure in all of this is Sunny 's mother played by the brilliant Singaporean actress Neo Swee Lin . <p> " I do n't have children of my own but I drew inspiration from my own mother and how blind and how devoted she can be . You tend to overlook the flaws , " said Neo . <p> It is this blind devotion that triggered the drama of it all . Sunny had an older brother who suffered a mental illness . His mother is very protective of the older boy , notorious for walking around half naked much to the disdain of the neighbours . His misbehaviour and gross indecencies are brushed off . <p> Much to the horror of the audience , the older boy is seen being physically intimate with his mother in a daring and provocative scene .

It seemed necessary for Sunny ( and possibly Saw ) to reenact these crucial moments and live through them . Such was the state of this healing journey , painful though it seemed . <p> The storytelling of Hai Ki Xin Lor , was done masterfully . The audience were lulled into believing that this was just like any other ordinary family story .

In the final scene , with Amazing Grace playing in the background , Sunny and his sister make amends . The darkness was at bay and light was returning . This powerful scene served as a balm to the soul . Hope and forgiveness seemed possible and that is the takeaway message of this masterpiece . <p> One character rightly said , " There are three phrases which are most difficult to say .

But rather than being replaced rapidly by modern humans , their disappearance occurred at different times across different sites from the Black Sea to the Atlantic . " Now that we are using better techniques , the picture is becoming clearer in terms of how the Neanderthals disappeared from Europe , " says lead researcher Tom Higham . " Our results suggest there was a mosaic of populations . " <p> Scientists already know from DNA evidence that there was some interbreeding between the two groups , although it 's not clear whether this occurred once or many times . Recent studies have suggested between 1.5% and 2.1% of the DNA of modern non-African human populations originates from Neanderthals . " In a way , our close cousins , as Neanderthals are , are n't extinct , " according to Higham . " They carry on in us today . " <p> Paleoanthropologist Chris Stringer of the Natural History Museum in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says the new findings are " striking " and back up the idea that modern humans and Neanderthals may have learnt from each other . He believes interbreeding probably first occurred in Asia soon after modern humans began to leave Africa around 60,000 years ago , so the latest evidence indicates the two populations may have been in some kind of contact for up to 20,000 years -- much longer than in Europe alone . <p> Not so dim-witted <p> Many scientists now reject the notion that Neanderthals were dim-witted brutes and point to evidence of use of symbolic objects , which may have been learnt from modern humans . The Oxford team dated a number of items from sites of so-called transitional stone tool industries -- viewed as either the work of the last of the Neanderthals or early modern humans -- and found they were all between 40,000 and 45,000 years old , indicating a period of possible cultural exchange . <p> Interestingly , they found no evidence that Neanderthals and modern humans lived particularly closely together .

That is something the researchers plan to address in follow-up investigations . <p> " Ultimately , our aim is to create kind of movies that show the arrival and departure of different sub-species of humans across Europe , " says Higham in an interview filmed in his lab . " We are part-way towards that but there is a still a lot more work we can do .

It would seem that this Iron Lady had something in common with Madonna , because the Material Girl claims that she needs exactly the same amount of sleep every night . <p> Whenever I hear stories about the little sleep that some leaders and celebrities need , I usually question their credibility . I mean to say , if I had only four hours ' sleep a night , I would n't know which country I was in , never mind be able to run it .

I 'm sure there were many moments during Maggie 's leadership when she could have sneaked in a few extra ZZZs . <p> For example , she probably played catch-up whenever she had to fly anywhere -- even a few minutes sleep on a short flight can re-energise you . Also , while she was being chauffer-driven around her constituency , a pair of sunglasses and a carefully-placed mechanical arm waving out of the car window would have allowed her to nap undetected . Or when she was at her hairdresser getting her hair transformed into something resembling a crash helmet , she surely dozed during the 10 minutes that it must have taken the stylist to spray her hair with cement-hard lacquer .

His sleep deficit dates way back to his pre-president days . <p> During his 2007 election campaign , he claimed that fatigue was responsible for him drastically overstating the death toll from tornadoes in Kansas . <p> He stated that 10,000 people had died . The actual figure was 12 . <p> I just wonder what will happen if his wife Michelle were to ask him to pop down to the corner store and pick up a dozen eggs for breakfast .

And of course , I aim to be a representative of youth in the state of Johor , " he said . <p> The Geoinformation and Real Estate graduate from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia Skudai claims he uses social media as an avenue to reach out to youths and ' Facebook ' as his modus operandi for his recent campaign . <p> With big hopes to reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at improving the lifestyle of youths in the country . <p> According to the Bachelor of Science ( Remote Sensing ) student , it is a shame that the majority of youths deemed as main contributors to youth movements do not want to get involved in politics , declining to join the PBM , leaving the youth body with poor participation . <p> " Perhaps there is lack of understanding and awareness in these early stages of PBM .

It simply lacks implementation and monitoring , follow through " he said . <p> Drawing Inspiration From Youth Parliaments Worldwide <p> Asim also addressed that some of the youth in this country are not mentally ready or mature in a political aspect as compared to more developed countries like New Zealand and the United Kingdom . <p> " I believe that there is a bright future for Malaysian youths to be involved in politics , perhaps in the next 10 to 15 years , " he expressed . <p> For example , in the United Kingdom , the average age of youths joining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , with parliamentary sessions that take place once each year . <p> Like PBM , UK 's Youth Parliament with up to 600 elected participants involved , lends an opportunity for youth to channel their creative ideas and bring about social changes . <p> However , PBM only allows participation for members aged between 18 to 30 years old . Meanwhile , the quota for PBM members is a total of 119 people with the ratio of 1 : 100,000 , in accordance with the distribution of the youth population in each state . <p> File picIn an earlier report , Deputy President of the Malaysian Youth Council ( MBM ) , Muammar Gaddafi Jamaluddin said although the Youth Parliament and social media are two different platforms , but they are both significant , providing a space for youths to speak out . <p> " Youths tend to favour the social media because they are easy to access , but can their voices impact positively on the nation or is it like dumping salt in to the ocean , or lead to the downfall of the nation , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that everyone can air his views directly through social media including to the Prime Minister but are these views sound , or capable of real impact and change .

Not only is it a platform to motivate youth as active rather than passive citizens , it can positively affect the nation as the voices of youths determine the future legacy of this country .

Umno wants its partners especially MCA , Gerakan and MIC to speed up the process of reviving their parties to regain non-Malay support for Barisan Nasional , which remains low since the 13th general election . <p> The call was made by Umno Youth chief Khairy Jamaluddin , who said much of the work in recent by-election and general election campaigns had been done by Umno activists and supporters who made up the backbone of the coalition 's election machinery . <p> He said they would campaign for the coalition no matter who the candidate was . <p> According to Khairy , although Umno as a whole was able to maintain its Malay support , it needed its partners to get the non-Malay vote . <p> " We understand that our component parties are still in the process of reviving themselves . Umno Youth will support them in this but we must intensify efforts to get the support of everyone in society . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to capture young non-Malays . This must be expedited , " he told reporters after an Umno Youth town hall meeting with its members and the public in Kuala Lumpur today . <p> In the 2013 general elections , BN obtained about 54% of the Malay vote while the non-Malays , who had been a mainstay for BN since the 1999 elections , largely abandoned the coalition . <p> At the time , MCA , which was BN 's second largest component party , even decided not to accept posts in the Cabinet because of their worst-ever performance in the elections . <p> Today 's town hall meeting was the first ever for Umno Youth as it seeks feedback from grassroots members before its national assembly on November 26 . <p> Responding to a question from the audience , Khairy said Umno Youth 's biggest challenge was how to win over youths in urban areas ahead of the next general election . <p> He said that while Umno was strongest in rural areas , that vote bank was now a " shrinking market " . <p> " Malaysia is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of the five million new voters that are expected to enter the electoral roll , 65% to 70% are from urban areas . <p> " This is the emerging market . They may register to vote in Pokok Sena , Rembau or Setiu but they may live and work in the cities . <p> " So in the next 15 to 20 years our strategy must be on how to adapt to this trend . " <p> Khairy said the influence of urban residents who returned to vote in rural constituencies could be seen in Kelantan , a state with a high proportion of ? migr ? youth working in cities outside the state . <p> One reason why BN won the September 25 Pengkalan Kubor by-election was because many outstation voters did not return to cast their ballots , he said . <p> Please refrain from nicknames or comments of a racist , sexist , personal , vulgar or derogatory nature , or you may risk being blocked from commenting in our website .

The Employees Provident Fund ( EPF ) has no intention of revising the age for full withdrawal by members from its current 55 , despite the minimum retirement age being increased to 60 , Bernama reported today . <p> In a statement released today , EPF said that ideally , the age for full withdrawal needs to be harmonised with the minimum retirement age as the savings are meant for retirement . <p> However , EPF said it was looking into the matter and will wait further input and feedback from stakeholders and members before making a decision . <p> " Hence , at this point in time , the withdrawal age of 55 remains unchanged , " the statement read , according to Bernama . <p> Meanwhile , the Congress of Unions of Employees in the Public and Civil Service ( Cuepacs ) called for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to increase the age for withdrawal of full retirement savings to 60 years . <p> Cuepacs president Datuk Azih Muda said the age limit to withdraw ones savings should not match the official retirement age because not every employee retires at the age of 60 . <p> " Currently , there are pensioners who chose to retire at the age of 58 . How about them ? Do they also need to wait another two years to withdraw their savings ? <p> " The age limit to withdraw savings should match their personal retirement age or sooner , so as to give them an opportunity to use the money to do things like buying a house or performing Hajj , " he told Bernama in Kuala Lumpur today . <p> According to Bernama , Prof Dr Mohamed Aslam Haneef , the Economic Faculty lecturer at International Islamic University of Malaysia , also agreed that any proposal to increase the minimum full withdrawal age needed to be refined , because the five-year difference for withdrawing funds would not bring significant difference to the total amount . <p> He added that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " lasted longer " but it may not necessarily succeed ultimately if it was still spent without prudence by the contributors . <p> " It is understood that there are many EPF contributors with savings of less than RM50,000 and are likely to finish their savings between the first and fifth year of their retirement , " Bernama quoted him as saying . <p> Prof Aslam said more could be done to help the contributors , especially those from the lower income group , including " intervention by relevant parties " to increase their income bracket . <p> " Those with lower income can only contribute a small amount to the EPF until their retirement . If their income increased , so would their savings amount in EPF . " <p> He also advised the public to contribute more to their own personal savings or use investment channels available in the market instead of relying solely on their funds in EPF for their retirement . <p> " At age 55 , even if someone received an EPF fund of roughly more than RM100,000 , they would not be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bear the expenses during their retirement . <p> " The best way is to have other savings and to save or invest at least 10 percent of their net salary , " he said , according to Bernama . <p> As of September this year , 68% of EPF members aged 54 had less than RM50,000 in savings , while only 33% met the basic savings level -- a minimum of RM196,800 -- in order to provide for a monthly income of RM820 over a 20-year period . -- November 17 , 2014 <p> Please refrain from nicknames or comments of a racist , sexist , personal , vulgar or derogatory nature , or you may risk being blocked from commenting in our website .
