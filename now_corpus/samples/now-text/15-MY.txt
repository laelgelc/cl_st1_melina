Pakatan Rakyat ( PR ) urged police to release all of its leaders and activists detained in a series of arrests ahead of a rally planned in the capital city of Kuala Lumpur later today . <p> In separate statements , both PAS and PKR condemned the arrests , saying that they were done without a justified and clear reason . <p> " It is clear that these latest arrests that are preventive in nature , are to stop the voices of change that are calling for something better through the assembly and peaceful demonstration , " said PKR information chief Syed Ibrahim Syed Noh . <p> " PKR condemns the misuse of power by police and urges that the Independent Police Complaints and Misconduct Commission ( IPCMC ) be set up .

He spoke with Teakster . <p> The prayer hall of the new mosque in Gothenburg , Sweden . Established 2011 . Architect : Bj ? rn Sahlkvist . <p> Please introduce yourself and tell us how you started your interest in photography . <p> I live and work as a freelance photographer based in Copenhagen , Denmark . For over a decade , I focused my work on the physical manifestations of Islam in Europe . As a European Muslim convert to Islam , my faith is the central inspiration for my photography . <p> Photography is my life . I have been photographing since my childhood with a little Agfa pocket camera ; therefore the camera has been always my constant travelling companion . With photography I can " freeze " a fraction of a second and can make it durable for a long time . The photography is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that normally your eyes ca n't imagine . I would wish that Muslims would see more details . <p> What inspired you to document the Islamic traditions in Europe ? <p> The idea , " Islam in Europe " started in 1997 in London , which was inspired by a book I had bought there about Islamic architecture in the Muslim world . I started in Germany : Hamburg , Munich , and Aachen -- my hometown -- and took photos of these mosques . I went to Sweden : Stockholm and Uppsala and I found mosques very different : a design in a Swedish context , not Arabic , not Indian and not Turkish , just Swedish . Now the topic became interesting . <p> Over 13 years of systematic photographing , the photographic documentation has been growing together with me and my vision to what it is today . I wanted to photograph the diversity of Islam in Europe . <p> 1 of 5 <p> What difficulties did face during your project ? <p> The greatest difficulties and challenges are the search for financial support and cooperation for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Muslim artists . I have contacted countless associations , organisations and individuals -- both Muslim and non-Muslim -- for years . Except for a very few exceptions , it ended always with a nightmare . I have experienced ignorance , empty promises und sometimes arrogance , it was appalling ! Now I have established a mutual and honest collaboration with a university in Germany and a Danish journalist/publisher . <p> Among your projects , which one is your favourite ? <p> One of my most favourite projects was discovering the story of the Muslim Tatars , a Turkic Muslim people whose homeland is located in Northeast Europe . Here a European heritage is hiding . These forgotten European Muslims created settlements 600 years ago well outside their homeland , going as far as Belarus , Poland and Lithuania . <p> Whose work has influenced you most ? <p> As a photographer , the French photographer Henri Cartier-Bresson is definitely my role model for photography .

In 2004 I also took a one-year course at the Copenhagen Photo School . There I was able to dwell on my practical photographic experience and experiment further to develop my interest in various types of cameras and photo equipment as well as films . By the way , at the beginning of the course we took pictures with film and analogue camera and we should develop the film in the darkroom -- back to the roots . I recommend it to everyone beginner . <p> Furthermore it is important to visit photo exhibitions , reading books about the basic techniques and " critical image viewing " ( 500 likes and comments such as " wow , " " amazing , " " nice , " etc. are not very instructive ) . <p> Ahmed Krausen <p> What kind of projects do you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a travel photo exhibition about Islam in Europe through Germany .

The book consists of a series of essays by well-known authors of different European universities and my photos . Finally I am also involved as consultant on an EU project : " Islam is our history " -- 14 centuries of interaction between Europe and the Islamic world . <p> What advice would you give someone about being photographer ? <p> Expensive photo equipment does not automatically make you a good photographer . The basics are the key , such as focus , exposure , timing , and composition are very important . Also , the photo has to tell a story in its own way .

@@4684237 potential for the Industrial Internet of Things will climb to over $280 billion by 2019 . <p> The Industrial Internet of Things ( IIoT ) and its potential to transform production operations is one of the hottest current topics in manufacturing . Along with Industrie 4.0 , IT/OT convergence , and Smart Manufacturing , the IIoT is cited as the latest means for making manufacturing production more flexible , more cost effective , and more responsive to changes in market demand .

Then we entered the new millennium , Zoom-Zoom came along and as they say , the rest was history . <p> For this writer , Mazda 's Zoom-Zoom brand campaign is the best in town bar none . It was steadfast in focus since day one ( for those who love to drive ) , is instinctive and catchy ( the way ' The Relentless Pursuit of Perfection ' is not ) and effectively tugs at the heartstrings of its target audience . <p> Lines like " all children know it , some adults remember it , one car company refuses to outgrow it " and " these are the only cars worth building , these are the only cars worth driving " can soften the heart of the most jaded enthusiast . Put on your headphones , view the video below and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , you need the products to back the talk up .

Unlike what some headlines will lead you to believe , it 's not a replacement for Zoom-Zoom , which according to Mazda , will continue to be a part of the brand 's DNA . Driving Matters is the sequel to the North American Game Changers campaign that focused on the functional side of Mazda cars . <p> Since its inception in 2000 , Zoom-Zoom has come to symbolise what a Mazda stands for -- stylish , insightful and spirited -- and Driving Matters will communicate the company 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emotional enhancement driving has on our lives in everyday situations , the company said . <p> " Through the Driving Matters campaign , consumers will get a glimpse at why driving matters so much to Mazda and why we obsess over every detail in designing our cars .

The irony is that later on , the paper he would helm fell under the dictatorship of another imperialist master -- Umno . <p> Both Said and Zunar perform necessary roles in society .

He is aware that these will be used to tarnish his reputation . <p> Said Zahari was against an Umno takeover of Utusan . Zunar is against the takeover of Malaysian minds . <p> For writing critical editorials and blasting the European countries which colonised parts of Africa and treated their citizens despicably , Said incurred the wrath of Umno . He was also in trouble with the Alliance government ( precursor of BN ) because his paper championed the concerns of the people .

Zunar has been arrested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been hauled to prison . <p> In 1961 , Said did not get any support from the international press , which was aware of what was happening but for one reason or another stayed silent . Today , with the Internet and social media , Zunar 's plight is publicised by the foreign media and spread worldwide . <p> The moral of the story is that Utusan Melayu was once a firm and fearless voice of the people and a champion of the oppressed . The man who fought so hard for an independent media was jailed for 17 years . He is Said Zahari , a courageous Singaporean Malay who was prepared to make many personal sacrifices to make a stand so that the ordinary man could have a voice . He was betrayed and punished by Umno . <p> Today , the modern-day Malaysian who is prepared to fight to the bitter end , so that we may enjoy the freedoms we are entitled to , is Zunar .

It is 25 years since the Indian media reported what they then called the first rape case involving Catholic nuns in Independent India . No one has yet been punished for the crime . <p> Police did arrest four men in connection with the July 13 , 1990 rape of two nuns in their convent in Gajraula , near Delhi . However , the trial proved farcical when it was determined they were in jail when the crime was committed . <p> The court rebuked the police and awarded the nuns compensation . The court also said the case could not be closed until the real culprits were arrested . But it is now a forgotten case . High-ranking Church officials told me this week they have no clue as to how the so-called investigation is progressing . <p> Media reports said the case was handed to India 's top investigation agency , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still investigating the case . <p> Between 1990 and 1995 , New Delhi 's Theological Research and Communication Institute recorded 20 more cases of murder , rape and assault on Catholic clergy and nuns in India . Since then the number of incidents has grown with about 100 attacks being recorded in recent years . <p> In the last year the figure has doubled to more than 200 , since Narendra Modi 's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party came to power , according to data supplied by Christian leaders . <p> Another nun was allegedly raped last month in Raipur , while a 71-year-old nun was raped in a convent near Kolkata . Police are investigating these crimes , but if the probes follow a similar pattern to other incidents , all involved , except the victim , will forget about the crime until another one happens . <p> In the rush to move forward , no one seems to be bothered about getting justice for the victims . <p> In nearly all cases the perpetrators get away with it . <p> Over the past 25 years , only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This crime occurred in Odisha in 2008 . Two others were handed prison terms for sexual assault in the same case but they are out on bail . <p> No one else has been convicted or punished for raping a Catholic nun in this country despite some cases reaching court . This kind of impunity encourages criminals to commit more heinous acts . <p> Christian leaders say these crimes are part of an orchestrated effort by Hindu hard-liners to harass and subjugate the religious minority . <p> Police see the offenses as being among thousands of routine crimes being committed across the country . Hindu leaders dismiss Christian allegations against them as baseless and politically motivated . <p> All have their points , but if the criminals in the first few cases were caught and punished appropriately , the situation today would have been different . <p> We are seeing a pattern . Crime repeated ; words repeated ; victims forgotten . The Church and state move forward with no sense of sin in their omissions . <p> One nun , who was raped some time ago , told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case and wishes to see it end , even if it means the culprits go unpunished . <p> Each time the case comes up she is forced to re-live the ordeal answering questions from lawyers and the media , she said . <p> Why is this happening ? <p> In most cases , the rapes were not spur of the moment crimes committed while carrying out a robbery . In the Kolkata case , they specifically chose the 71-year old nun leaving younger nuns in the convent alone . <p> In the Raipur attack , the culprits deliberately chose the 47-year nun , taking care not to disturb two younger women sleeping next door . They also came prepared with drugs to give to the nun . It was evident they were making a statement against Christians with their crime . <p> Rape can mean a statement of subjugation in Indian society . It can mean : ' We trample upon what you love , respect and revere ... your sister , wife and mother . You live as a subject to us or get out . ' <p> It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been sexually attacked in all these years . <p> Often rapes of nuns are also connected to the land they own or property they live in . After the Gajraula case there were reports the rapes were engineered to scare the nuns away and acquire their land at a cheaper price . Similar reports were published after the Kolkata rape . <p> In 1991 , a politician was accused of encroaching on convent land in Bangalore and threatened to do a " Gajraula " if the nuns made an issue of the incident . <p> Why does it continue ? <p> Indian society and the Church are yet to act decisively against rape , despite seeing it as a social evil . <p> In a country where at least two women are raped every hour , police , administration officials and the public shrug them off as just another rape , even if the victim is a Catholic nun . <p> The Church lives immersed in that reality unable to see that every single rape is a dastardly act . <p> If the Church is serious about fighting rape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more concerted action is necessary , not knee jerk reactions . <p> A rape victim is invariably seen as bringing shame to her family and community . Unfortunately and surprisingly , most female religious congregations also consider a rape within their community as a matter of shame . <p> One victim told me she was asked to change her name by her congregation and now lives under a false identity . <p> That sense of shame makes Church hide the crime . Church officials successfully covered up the Gajraula crime for 10 days until the national weekly Sunday Observer published it . <p> A nun at that convent told they pleaded with the Observer reporter not to publish the story . <p> That is good enough reason to believe that many more rapes of nuns must have gone unreported . <p> Even in the latest case in Raipur , the victim 's congregation refused to admit the nun was raped despite the victim making clear assertions that both suspects raped her . <p> Nuns who survive sex attacks continue to suffer because of the turn a blind eye attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a well-defined policy and established system to handle victims of sex crimes within religious communities also rubs salt into the victims ' wounds . <p> All too often the victim is hidden .

We 're in the dark . We do not know what to do , or how to go about things , " according to Father Ajay Kumar Singh , who works to get justice for victims of anti-Christian violence in Odisha state , including rape victims . <p> He said the affected people or the local diocese is left alone to do what best it can . Most often they give up halfway through a case when they run out of resources or patience with what is a painfully slow legal system in India . <p> Opponents of the Church in India also know that its leaders are uncomfortable in dealing with sex-related issues .

Nevertheless , it is stressed that the 30 Articles of the UDHR are not contrary to the tenets of Islam . <p> Article 1 of the CDHRI explains that " ... all men ( humankind ) are equal in terms of basic human dignity and basic obligations and responsibilities , without any discrimination on the grounds of race , colour , language , sex , religious belief , political affiliation , social status or other considerations . " Similarly , Article 2 of the UDHR states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedoms set forth in this Declaration ( UDHR ) , without distinction of any kind , such as race , colour , sex , language , religion , political or other opinion , national or social origin , property , birth or other status . " <p> The commission therefore regrets the many myths and misunderstandings that have sprung up about the concept of human rights , and in particular the construal and superficial understanding of human rights in Malaysia . <p> Furthermore , the interpretation of human rights by the leadership has ignored section 4(4) of the Human Rights Commission of Malaysia Act 1999 which provides legitimacy to the UDHR by stating that regard shall be had to the UDHR " to the extent that it is not inconsistent with the Federal Constitution " . It is the commission 's view that human rights principles derived from the UDHR have been incorporated in Part II of the Federal Constitution ; thus being in harmony with one another . <p> Malaysia 's accession to the three core human rights conventions , namely on women , children and persons with disabilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the global community common standards and values on human rights regardless of religious , cultural and geographical origins . In addition , at the 1993 Vienna Convention , Malaysia had advanced the principle of the indivisibility and interdependence of all human rights thereby also supporting the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action , adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights on June 25 , 1993 . <p> The commission also wishes to highlight that Malaysia , under the current leadership , adopted the Asean Human Rights Declaration during the 21st Asean Summit in Phnom Penh , Cambodia , on November 18 , 2012 , thus repeating and reaffirming its human rights commitments . <p> As Malaysia is still a member of the United Nations , it is bound by the Charter 's Preamble which is the embodiment of values and principles that are subscribed to by the entire international community , including Islamic countries , which have also ratified or acceded to many of the core human rights treaties . The commission would like to highlight that several Muslim countries adopted the UDHR as far back as in 1948 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pakistan , Syria and Turkey . <p> In conclusion , the commission repeats that the challenges of promoting and protecting human rights in Malaysia do not end with the adoption of a declaration or the establishment of a human rights commission . Ensuring the effective implementation of the declaration and mainstreaming the principles and ideals contained within the many human rights documents remains a very critical challenge domestically . The commission will therefore continue in its efforts to increase public knowledge on human rights through its activities with the hope that the concept of human rights is correctly understood and ingrained in our society . At the same time , the commission calls on the government to emulate the best practices of other Muslim countries with regard to the advancement of human rights . <p> Malaysia , as the current chair of Asean , an esteemed and reputable member of the international community , and as former member of the United Nations Human Rights Council , should rise to this opportunity to provide leadership and ensure that the commitments made at the Asean and international levels , particularly on human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2015 . <p> * This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of The Malaysian Insider . <p> Please refrain from nicknames or comments of a racist , sexist , personal , vulgar or derogatory nature , or you may risk being blocked from commenting in our website .

British researchers have created a " stringless " virtual guitar that is putting the power of music in the palms of people 's hands . <p> The Kurv Guitar does not look much like a guitar -- it consists of a button pad that fits neatly into the player 's hand and an oversized , sensor-packed guitar pick that recognises strumming movements .

The concept of majority-minority religions is therefore irrelevant in Indonesia . <p> What is important is that their presence in the country and their contribution to the wellbeing and progress of the nation , including during the independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and development since then , are well recognised . <p> With the exception of a few religious conflicts during the 70 years of Indonesia 's independence , we can take pride in Indonesia 's record of interfaith relations -- the different religious communities have by and large lived peacefully side by side . <p> This is a feat many Indonesians may take for granted , but it is widely admired by other countries where tension , rivalry and conflict between religious communities seem to be the norm . <p> We have to thank Indonesia 's founders for their foresight in laying down the foundations needed for this large and diverse nation to live in peace . <p> The 1945 Constitution guarantees freedom of religion , and the first of the five tenets of the state ideology Pancasila is " Belief in One God " . <p> We may be praying differently and have different approaches to truth , but we all worship the same deity . For better or for worse , Indonesians of all colors and faiths are bound by their fate as one big nation . <p> So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muhammad and Jesus Christ , who Muslims also revere as one of their prophets , in the best of Indonesian traditions : Marking them with joy and mutual respect , tolerance and moderation -- the hallmarks of all peace-loving nations . -- The Jakarta Post , December 25 , 2015 . <p> * This is the personal opinion of the writer or publication and does not necessarily represent the views of The Malaysian Insider . <p> Please refrain from nicknames or comments of a racist , sexist , personal , vulgar or derogatory nature , or you may risk being blocked from commenting in our website .
