As though the name Tetteh Quarshie is not synonymous to some glory in Ghana , there is chaos breeding under his memorial just around Accra Mall . <p> A homeless man lives right under the bridge . It will appear , without professing to be the best judge of mental sanity ( as I have a mirror ) , that , the man is Non-Compos Mentis ; incapable of a coherent life . This article was inspired when I saw him eating one evening on my way from work . He was just putting food in his mouth , and I was the driver right in front of him , in the queue on the Spanner-Shiashe side of the traffic , as the traffic is almost every evening . <p> I reasoned , all we all want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , some warmth and then , of course , a good sleep . Again , it appears he cooks under the bridge and feasts there , alone , in the cold . I have seen him a number of times after that day , but almost always feeling helpless and asking what can I do to help this man . Well as I write , I write about him . <p> I am not oblivious of the many who live on the street ; children , mentally derailed , physically disabled persons as well as fully abled persons who have been driven to the street by poverty . Some I most certainly can guess , live not very different from this my friend under the bridge , let us call him John Doe for the purposes of this article . <p> I imagine how John sleeps at night . John perhaps dreams of a completely beautiful Ghana , where the troubled like himself can dream of a home where they can hope to be fully integrated into a regular life . Before John sleeps , he may pray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his ' shelter ' by accident . He may even say the Lord 's prayer and cry , " Let your kingdom come on earth as it is in heaven . " <p> I do not know what John wakes up to , let 's assume John goes about begging for coins , that at the end of the day , he may have a warm meal and a restful sleep . John sleeps under the relics of a glorious cocoa legacy ; a busy road full of fantastic cars and people . And yes talking about amazing people , Christians and religious alike . Never forget VISION2020 is the year of National Cathedrals . So let 's start from the place of faith as I talk about my friend , John - The Good Samaritan Experiment . <p> In the early 1970s , on the campus of Princeton University , two behavioural scientists , John Darley and Daniel Batson , were interested in studying the psychology of prosocial behaviour . They asked the question ; why do people do good things for others ? To examine this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Seminary : students who were studying to be priests . <p> The researchers set up an epic study . Across three days in late Fall , they had a bunch of seminary students come to a building , meet with a researcher , and fill out a bunch of surveys . The surveys partly addressed if the students were religious primarily for intrinsic or for extrinsic reasons ( with " intrinsic reasons " being like " I am motivated to do good in the world " and " extrinsic reasons " being like " I really want to get into Heaven . " ) . Then the participants were told that they needed to prepare a brief talk about the Good Samaritan from the Bible -- which is a story about how a helpless victim on the side of the road was just passed by from a bunch of holy individuals -- while a non-holy Samaritan took the time to stop and help the fellow out . <p> Participants of the research were all told that they needed to walk to a nearby building to meet up with another member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then comes the fun part . The situation was rigged -- and all participants found a fallen ' stranger ' in a narrow alleyway . The " stranger " was really a key part of the research -- and his role was to seem sick on the ground and in need of help . The catch was that the alleyway was only four feet across ... so to not help this guy , you had to step over him ! I will tell you the results to conclude but let me lay down my hopes and aspiration for our nation and the continent as vision 2020 appears to have expired ; <p> 1 . That we shall define for ourselves an identity which is enduring , progressive and one of leadership . <p> 2 . That we will treasure curiosity and learning above all things and remember for lack of knowledge my people indeed do perish . <p> 3 . That we will appreciate the value of human life and respect each other genuinely . <p> 4 . That we will not seek to bring each other down as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that uplifts each other , firmly holding each other with chants of Ubuntu . <p> 6 . That we will protect the vulnerable , weak , defenceless as that is the highest form of worship <p> 7 . That we will understand religiosity does not guarantee a productive or progressive society but such things as law , social awareness , wisdom and a commitment to do our job as though we do it unto the Lord . <p> 8 . That we will believe in ourselves , dream of a beautiful world we can create out of diligence , vision and a clear strategy , seeking to be the difference daily and yes singing Uhuru . <p> 9 . That we may prosper and be in good health as our soul prospers <p> 10 . That we may think and do only that which is noble , right , pure , lovely , excellent and praiseworthy . <p> So back to the Princeton Theological Seminary , the conclusion of the study showed that dispositional factors had no bearing on helping behaviour . In other words , people who reported as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to stop to help . This study has such dramatic implications for what it means to be human . First off , the overall amount of " helping " was low - with MOST ( 60% of ) participants being , actually , NOT willing to help the " victim . " This is , of course , ironic , because the participants were , Princeton students studying to be priests and about to give a talk on the lessons of the Good Samaritan from the Bible ! <p> As it turns out , simple-seeming situational factors such as , whether one was in a hurry or not , played the dominant role in determining what that person would do in the research . The bottom line remains , no society can count on the good heart of citizen to fulfil John 's prayer to God . If God 's kingdom may come on earth and VISION2020 will not be a concert-party , then we have to remember and hold on fast . <p> So what I ask is not for some generosity for John but to simply ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ca n't write in this article ) and do their job . It takes the created institutions of state to fulfil prayers and dreams , people paid every month to intervene and implement social goods , so before someone reaches to be kind to John , which we should , by all means , someone should tell the head of whoever is responsible for the Ghana National Social Protection Policy to do their job . <p> So as I conclude , I dare ask yet again ; who is the head of the social welfare structure and I hope he/she does not use that stretch of Accra and yes , there is a law in Ghana about the rights of children and mental health people . So during Christmas , let these families of the people paid to their jobs enjoy the Fanta and chicken , let us all eat Jollof and be busy about a Year of Return as John feasts on crumbs under a bridge lonely and completely forgotten ; let us all enjoy the warmth of Christmas and by all means let not remember John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor John Doe . <p> My name is Yaw Sompa and I truly believe in Ghana and a learning revolution in Africa .

@@31585234 <h> Profile of Komla Dumor <p> Komla Afeke ( The Root of the Family ) Dumor was born into a family of recognized educationists . His paternal grandfather , Michael Dumor , was a pioneer in the Catholic Education Project in the Volta Region beginning from the 1930 's . His maternal grandfather , Philip Gbeho , the indomitable music master of Achimota School , was the composer of the National Anthem of Ghana . This was a tradition that emphasized the value of education , a drive for knowledge , and the pursuit of excellence and service to one 's country . Komla was born on 3rd October , 1972 , to Professor Ernest Dumor , a highly respected academic and a public servant , and Cecilia Dumor ( n ? e Gbeho ) , an educationist , a curriculum expert , and an editor of international repute . <p> Komla 's parents taught him the values of sacrifice and love for country through their own professional work . His father was responsible for the building of the Ghana National Identification Systems and the regulatory National Identification Authority established to manage the system . Any child in Ghana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , has been touched by Komla 's mother . She almost single-handedly supervised the production and editing of 50 textbooks , even though she was then chronically ill with rheumatoid arthritis . <p> Komla was born into a Roman Catholic family and was brought up according to the teachings of the Catholic Church particularly as to the sanctity of family and marriage . He was nurtured to internalize basic Christian virtues of humility , charity , diligence , patience , kindness and temperance . He lived these virtues in his family and professional lives . He was strong and firmly grounded in his Christian walk and he would say ever so often that whatever GOD had endowed him with must be shared . <p> The above is just part of the kaleidoscope of Komla 's heritage . However , Komla was taught not to bask in the achievements of his grandparents , parents and recognized family members , but to carve a niche for himself by applying creatively the gift of heritage . <p> As a result of these influences , Komla , through his own passion for good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poor and disadvantaged , evolved into a masterpiece of GOD , cherished and loved by his family and friends and admired as " The Boss Player " in his professional life . <p> Early life and education <p> Komla grew up on the campus of the University of Cape Coast and , at three and half years , he insisted on joining his sister to attend the pre-school program offered at the University Primary School . In 1975 , when his parents left for the United States of America , he began his formal education from the K-I run by the United Methodist Church . He was admitted into the Spartan Village School where he began his real educational journey . <p> In 1979 , Komla and his older sister joined their father in the Tacoma-Seattle area in the State of Washington . He was enrolled in Wildwood Park Elementary School in Puyallup and then Daffodil Valley Elementary School a year later . The years with his father created a very intense bond between them . But those years remained significant in Komla 's early life because as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came face to face with a much more concealed yet dangerous form of racial discrimination . <p> At that tender age , Komla had to rely on the support of his parents to deal with this widespread problem in the American school system . With the right encouragement and family support , Komla dealt with the racial obstacles by working extra hard on his school assignments . <p> He was made to cultivate the habit of reading and spent quite a lot of his leisure time with his nose in a book . He read books that told the story of slavery in America and the profiles of great African American achievers , noting clearly how they got to the top in the face of extreme difficulties . Komla realized very early that these achievers got to the top by pursuing a disciplined life , excellence and a hunger for knowledge and perseverance . <p> When Komla reached the fifth grade in Daffodil Valley Elementary School , he offered to participate in the inter-schools district spelling bee competition . His class teacher at the time who stereotypically thought Komla was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave of the hand . His parents protested and the school allowed him to contest . Komla confounded everyone by reaching the finals and finally becoming the first runner-up . Komla had set the stage for himself and his family in the Sumner Community where this African family was constantly on the invitation list to potluck lunches and dinners . <p> In the Sumner Community , Komla was also the star footballer on the only football team -- The Kicks . He came home with a lot of trophies awarded to him . He was equally the star athlete . With the help of his mother , Komla learnt to play the piano and soon became a star performer in his school of western classical music . To widen the intellectual horizons of Komla and his siblings , his parents organized educational tours which took the family to Canada , states in the Great Lakes Region of the United States , a journey from the Pacific Northwest all the way to Eastern Seaboard . <p> These were great opportunities that allowed him and his siblings to have their imaginations run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities . In 1983 Komla 's parents left the United States of America for Kano State Nigeria . Much to the anguish of himself and his siblings , Komla had no choice but to relocate too . On arrival , Komla 's parents realized that his intellectual growth needed to be nurtured differently rather than placing him immediately in the Kano State School System . He and his brother were , therefore , put into a personalized program run by a lady from India called Mrs Satur . <p> It was a driven program meant to draw out of the children , as much of their academic potential as was possible , and set them on a course for excellence . In this period , their parents took a decision not to have television at home , a sore point initially for the children , but later in life , a decision that they would always concede was the best thing for them at that stage of their lives . In 1984 , Komla was admitted into St Thomas Secondary School in Kano and was placed in Form Two . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top of his class . <p> He took the Nigerian Joint Admission and Matriculation Examination for admission to any of the Nigerian Universities at the time . The results of the examination placed Komla in the band of students who could be admitted to start a pre-medical program . He was only 16 years old . It was an extremely hard decision for Komla 's parents to see him leave home so young and at such an impressionable age . <p> It was hard for Komla himself , but with his sister in the same institution , he launched into his tertiary educational journey . So it was , Komla entered the University of Jos in Plateau State Nigeria . After four years of the pre-clinical studies , Komla abandoned the program and returned to Ghana . On his return home Komla indicated to his parents that he wanted to pursue a law degree and then specialize in forensic science . <p> His parents thought the idea was great but switching from a science-based program to an Arts program was going to be fraught with dangers . The university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would take a degree in the Arts or the Social Sciences . Without hesitation he agreed and entered a program in Sociology/Psychology at University of Ghana for a Bachelor 's degree . <p> Career in broadcasting <p> In his first year in the University of Ghana , his sister drew his attention to an advert in the newspapers requesting applicants for a position on air as a traffic reporter for the fledgling station , Joy FM . The show and the interview were held at the office of the program sponsor , Mobitel , a telecom provider . Komla showed up at the interview to find hundreds of people waiting for the same position he had come to interview for . <p> A friend took him to the interview room where Komla told them to stop the interview and send everyone else home . He was the man they wanted . They liked his smile and his confidence . He got the job . Little did they know that for National Service he had worked on Radio at the Ghana Broadcasting Corporation a year earlier doing an early morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new broadcast career thus took off on the back of a motor scooter riding around Accra at 4 am every morning giving reports on traffic in the capital . Soon thereafter , Komla was noticed by the management as an individual not only with a voice for radio , but someone very much in control of the English Language , and very well informed on issues of public policy . This was essentially the bridge on which Komla walked into the position of Presenter of the Joy FM Super Morning Show . <p> Komla 's place as the driver in the emerging market of private radio and its transforming power in support of democratic practice and its ethos will remain legendary . He handled every aspect of the program with consummate professionalism . He took on major national development issues that many of his colleagues felt afraid to handle . His engaging personality , confidence and passion for evidence , setting the contours for public debate endeared him to many Ghanaians irrespective of political affiliation . <p> Komla found the Super Morning Show as the biggest and best platform to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose poverty touched him deeply . Komla 's investigative skills led to the exposure of corruption which he regarded as wholly unacceptable . He was prepared to pay the price and his appearance at the Commission of Human Rights and Administrative Justice will remain a point of reference in investigative journalism . <p> For the many things he had done , the Ghana Journalists Association nominated him as the Journalist of the year 2003 . This award was the occasion for some to declare resolutely that he was not a journalist . As Komla himself , in an assessment of this period in his career , would tell his parents " Ignorance is blissful but , painfully , many people suffer as a result of it . " <p> Komla was always hungry for knowledge . Therefore he took the opportunity to enter the prestigious Kennedy School at Harvard University to study for a Master 's Degree in Public Policy . In a letter Komla wrote to his parents , he stated the following : ' The academic program has been rigorous and intense . But I have coped very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases and developed some really good relationships with some Professors . Last week alone I got back four ( 4 ) papers and the worst grade was A- which is quite remarkable considering the fact that Harvard uses the forced grading curve system . ' <p> Komla graduated at the top of his graduating class and eloquently delivered the Valedictorian address for the class . Soon after his graduation he was offered a position at Brown University in the Africa Leadership Program . This was a program established by the University to allow former Heads of State in Africa to spend a year reflecting and writing their memoirs . Before he could accept the offer , Kwasi Twum , the CEO of Joy FM , arrived in Boston to plead with Komla to return home to take back the Super Morning Show . Komla returned and rebuilt the morning program and raised the bar even further . <p> The work of Komla attracted the attention of the management of BBC , particularly its African Service , whilst he was still working at Joy FM . At the Initial stages , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some burning issues in Uganda 's development . Thereafter , he was involved in presenting a special programme covering the migration of young African males through the Sahara into Spain . This programme was very well received . <p> In 2006 Komla was officially invited to join the BBC African Service in London as host of the radio programme , Network Africa . From 2008 to 2012 he was one of the presenters for the BBC flagship programme , " The World Today . " Because of Komla 's special interest in the experiences of Africans in the Diaspora , he was at home when he presented a special programme on slavery and its abolition in the UK . Through dint of hard work , Komla began an ascent into the elite class of radio and television presenters , not only at BBC , but worldwide . <p> With this opportunity , Komla saw an avenue to help bring Africa into the mainstream of the global news system . He felt , like many Africans , that the continent had been written out of history and therefore it was necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the huge potential of Africa . As destiny would have it , in 2011 , Komla began his new role on BBC Television and soon became an instant celebrity newscaster . <p> It did not take very long for the BBC to realise his passion for the transformation of Africa . Consequently , the management of BBC Television decided to develop a programme that focused on Business , Trade and Development in Africa . He became the main anchor for the internationally acclaimed programme ' Africa Business Report ' on BBC World Television . In pioneering the launch of Africa Business Report , he set out to challenge the stereotypic view of Africa . <p> He was very passionate about telling the story of a continent that was rapidly changing and taking its rightful place in the world . Komla endeared himself to his audiences because of his own unique style of presentation . Indeed , he raised the bar of broadcast journalism , particularly in his presentation of the new programme , ' Focus on Africa . ' Komla soon became the face and the voice of Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent . He did not seek to glorify Africa in his Africa Business Report and Focus on Africa . He maintained a balance in his presentation . He was always prepared to dig deeper , only seeking the truth . <p> He presented , when the opportunity came , the uneven and unequal distribution of resources within those countries . As he would say , " there must be balance " or " please , do n't patronise me . " He was not simply just a ' broadcast journalist , ' but an intellectual with great analytical skills . BBC Television offered Komla a platform to showcase his varied skills . He was amongst a selected few who constituted the core team that covered the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Canterbury 2011 , the Olympic Games held in London 2012 , and the World Cup in South Africa 2010 , to name a few . <p> Komla 's work at BBC Television was not limited to news presentation -- he had the opportunity to interview some of the world 's richest and most influential people : Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mo Ibrahim . In addition , he interviewed very highly placed world leaders ; these include Bill Clinton , President Kagame , President John Dramani Mahama and Kofi Annan , former UN Secretary General .

He brought home to Africans and the world at large , the place of Nelson Mandela in World History , and was able to draw out Nelson Mandela 's family to share their moments of life with the African Icon , and their own passion for a new hope for Africa . <p> These interviews with the Mandela family will remain a special tribute to Komla himself .

As a lead presenter for BBC World , Komla has considerable influence on how the continent is covered .

It 's in the oily taste of the water , on the blackened leaves of fruit trees , and in the acrid odor in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lifetime risk of cancer in St. John the Baptist , which is about 2 square miles , is 800 times higher than an average American , according to the EPA 's most recent air pollution report in 2015 . <h> In total , about 150 facilities line the alley . It 's the second-biggest producer of petrochemicals in the country , after Texas . But the key difference is that Texas ' industry is spread out over hundreds of miles . <h> Locals live in the plants ' shadows . Many see smokestacks from their windows . Others struggle to hear cicadas over the hum of machinery . Pollution wafts into houses , smelling " pungent and rotten , " like " singed plastic " or " poison , according to The Intercept . <h> Rolling Stone called it the frontline of " environmental racism , " a term first used in the 1980s that refers to segregation around who gets exposed to contaminated elements . <h> Towns and cities , like St. James , Reserve , Burton Lane , Freetown , St. Gabriel , and Bayou Goula , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Giles Clarke/Getty <h> The industrial alley 's pollution is a long-term problem and concerns three groups . <p> BusinessInsider USA Images <p> Giles Clarke/Getty <h> One group includes the communities that live in the smokestacks ' shadow . <p> BusinessInsider USA Images <p> Andrew Lichtenstein/Corbis / Getty <h> Sharon Lavigne , founder of protest group " Rise St. James , " who recently changed its name to Coalition Against Death Alley , told Rolling Stone that locals can do one of three things : get sick , move away , or die . <h> Another resident and protester is Robert Taylor . He has lived in the alley his whole life . He 's lost his mother , brother , sister , nephew , and several neighbors to cancer . His wife is currently fighting cancer , and his daughter has a rare disease that 's linked to chloroprene . <h> " It is killing people by over-polluting them with toxins in their water and in their air , " he said . " This is slavery of another kind . <h> The second group is petrochemical companies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The industry has been a fixture in the area since the end of World War II , when America began to demand synthetic materials . <h> Chemical plants replaced sugar plantations . Originally , they clustered around Baton Rouge and New Orleans , but they soon began to spread out along the river . They were attracted to the area 's cheap land and easy river access . <h> The companies were also looking for places with low populations . Craig Colten , a Louisiana State University geography professor told ProPublica , the black American communities they surrounded were effectively invisible . <h> In 1986 , a woman in Plaquemine was knocked off her ride-on lawnmower when Dow Chemical plant released a cloud of chlorine . She told The Washington Post , " I respect chlorine just like I respect a gun . " <h> That same year a sign was erected on the side of the road , with the question , " Bhopal on the Bayou ? " This was referring to a disaster at a pesticide plant in India that killed 2,000 people when a toxic gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were signs , but no hard evidence . Taylor told WBUR News that while people suspected the emissions were making people ill , taking on these companies was too much . They felt powerless . <h> ... even though The Guardian found a 1956 DuPont technical manual that described the dangers of chloroprene . <p> BusinessInsider USA Images <p> Mark Makela/Getty <p> The manual said it could enter the body through skin or inhalation , and high concentrations would cause " depression of the central nervous system and damage to vital organs . " <p> When The Guardian requested comment DuPont said it was Denka which now produced chloroprene , since it had sold production . <h> The Guardian also reported that Dupont experimented with chloroprene on rats in 1971 , and three out of 10 died from exposure . <p> BusinessInsider USA Images <p> Fritz Goro/The LIFE Picture Collection / Getty <p> In 1999 , the International Agency for Research on Cancer classified chloroprene as " possibly carcinogenic to humans . " <p> Six years later , in 2005 , the National Toxicology Program 's Report on Carcinogens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <h> Still , no correlation between the emissions and locals ' health was established . The state was strapped for resources , and could n't afford to research it . There was n't even enough money to properly monitor the chemical plants . <h> In 2001 , Orion hired his son John Breaux Jr . as a lobbyist . By 2003 , the senator 's son had been paid at least $120,000 . The sign says " land sharks " because Orion was gradually expanding closer and closer to the town . <h> The EPA did investigate Orion for failing to comply with air pollution requirements when upgrading plants . But its investigation was weakened when Breaux pushed for former President George W. Bush 's administration to take it easy on air pollution rules for chemical plants . <h> Louisiana 's air pollution regulations did n't help . Unlike Texas , the state does n't measure air pollution in areas near polluters , only in the air around plants . <h> Some pollution measurements have improved . The EPA requires plants that are emitting over a certain threshold to report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 16% decrease over the last 30 years , plants in Cancer Alley reported toxic releases grew by 25% in that time . <h> On the health side of things , researcher Wilma Subra told The Nation it was difficult to demonstrate increased cancer rates because the tumor registry used to only report data on parish levels . This made it impossible to measure differences within parishes . <p> BusinessInsider USA Images <p> Giles Clarke / Getty <p> Another thing that skewed records was that anyone who had insurance often got treatment for their cancer outside of the state , skewing where the cancer was reported . <h> What worries locals is that the chemical industry continues to grow . Since 2015 , seven new petrochemical facilities have been approved , which the EPA said would be " major sources , " of air pollution . Another five await approval . <h> In December 2015 , The EPA released a report on toxic air . It showed that the 10,000 residents were at a much higher risk of harm from the pollution . <h> Despite the findings , nothing changed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion piece for The New York Times , environmental reporter Sharon Lerner wrote , " But as the people of St. John soon learned , though lawmakers can use the risk levels from IRIS to legally limit chemicals , set levels at federal cleanup sites or shutter factories that emit them , they do n't have to do any of those things . " <h> Examples of pollution continue . In November 2017 , Fifth Ward elementary school , which had 400 students , had Chloroprene levels 755 times above EPA guidelines . <h> In 2018 , Governor John Bel Edwards announced Formosa Plastics planned on opening a $9.4 billion industrial factory , with 14 plants across 2,300 acres in St. James Parish . The plant would create plastic bottles and grocery bags and would double toxic emissions in the area . <h> Across the river , Wanhua Chemical Group plans to build a $1.25 billion plant over 250 acres to produce a plastic that 's used to make polyurethane foam , for furniture and beds . <p> BusinessInsider USA Images <p> Simon Lees/Digital Camera Magazine/Future / Getty <p> But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review , and that another location was under review . <p> According to The Advocate , while the reason for the review was n't clarified , the company had previously expressed concern over President Donald Trump 's trade war with China . <h> In 2019 , Hampton and Taylor visited their Congressman Cedric Richmond for his help . He 's the only Democrat in Congress from Louisiana . Richmond spoke with them for two minutes . He acknowledged their concerns , urged them to vote against President Donald Trump , and suggested they write a letter to the chemical plant . <h> As for Chloroprene , in 2019 , EPA regional director David Gray told citizens that he thought it was unlikely the EPA would ever set a legally enforceable standard for chloroprene . <p> BusinessInsider USA Images <p> AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin <p> " The fact of the matter is there is a sole source of chloroprene in the United States and it 's here , " he said . <h> In August 2019 , the Louisiana health officials announced it would conduct a door-to-door inquiry into how many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but it is a small victory . <h> As recently as June , the risk of cancer in the area was up to 1,505 cancer cases per million people , nearly 50 times the national average .

It reminded me of the saying " if wishes were horses , beggars would ride . " <p> Reality , however , dawned when Ghana unfortunately recorded its first two cases in March , 2020 .

&lt;p&gt;Moving the motion for the second reading of the Bill on June 2 this year , the Minister of Education , Dr Matthew Opoku Prempeh , said the Bill was to establish the Ghana Communication Technology University as a public tertiary institution to provide education in information communication technology . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said the university college was first established in 2005 with the name Ghana Telecom University College and had since provided long and short-term education and training in information communication technology ( ICT ) for diverse stakeholders , both in Ghana and the West African sub-region. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He said the college , which played a leading role in enhancing teaching and training at the tertiary level , had its roots in the Ghana Telecom Flagship Training Centre which was the first of its kind in West Africa . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He noted that the training centre progressed steadily through de-regulation and privatisation to become the source of teaching and certification in telecommunication engineering in Ghana and in West Africa . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The GTUC , which was upgraded in 2006 with the requisite infrastructure in preparation for conversion from a training centre into a university college , had signed various memoranda of understanding with local and international collaborators . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was granted an accreditation by the National Accreditation Board on March 30 , 2006 and officially inaugurated on August 15 , 2006 , he said . &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to him , in March 2012 , the name of the university college was changed to Ghana Technology University College to reflect the transformation that had taken place and the introduction of new programmes in business and information technology . &lt;/p&gt;Hitches attend online **45;10581;TOOLONG ...

@@31902230 <h> How To Lower Your Coronavirus Risk While Eating Out <p> As restaurants and bars reopen to the public , it 's important to realize that eating out will increase your risk of exposure to the new coronavirus . <p> Two of the most important public health measures for keeping illnesses to a minimum are nearly impossible in these situations : First , it 's hard to eat or drink while wearing a face mask . Second , social distancing is difficult in tight spaces normally filled with back-to-back seating and servers who weave among the busy tables all evening long . <p> So , what should you look out for , and how can you and the restaurant reduce the risk ? Here are answers to a few common questions . <p> How far apart should tables and bar stools be ? <p> There is nothing magical about six feet , the number we often hear in formal guidance from government agencies . I would consider that the minimum distance required for safe spacing . <p> The " six-foot " rule is based on old data about the distance droplets can spread respiratory viruses . These droplets tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but that is n't always the case . Aerosols can spread the virus over larger distances , though there remains some uncertainty about how common this spread is . Particles generated by sneezes or someone running can travel up to 30 feet . <p> Talking alone has been shown to generate respiratory droplets that could be infectious . <p> If there is a fan or current generated in a closed space such as a restaurant , particles will also travel farther . This was shown in a paper from China : People in a restaurant downwind of an infected person became infected even though the distance was greater than six feet . <p> The closer the distance and the greater the time someone is exposed to a person who is infectious , the greater the risk . <p> If the servers wear masks , is that enough ? <p> If servers wear masks , that will afford a layer of protection , but customers eating and talking could still spread the virus . <p> One way to mitigate that risk in this imperfect situation , at least from a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surrounded by protective barriers , such as plexiglass or screens , or put tables in separate rooms with doors that can be closed . Some states are encouraging restaurants to limit each table to only one server who delivers everything . <p> Restaurants could also screen guests before they enter , either with temperature checks or questions about symptoms and their close contacts with anyone recently diagnosed with Covid-19 . It 's controversial , but restaurants in California have tried it . Washington state tried to require restaurants to record visitors ' contact information in case an outbreak is discovered , but it pulled back to only recommend doing so . <p> It 's easier to screen employees . In fact , guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend restaurants have employee screening in place before they reopen . But while screening employees for possible infection could decrease risk , it 's important to remember that people can be infectious six days before they develop symptoms . That is why masks , eye protection , social distancing and hand hygiene are critical measures for preventing infection . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down ? <p> Regular dishwashing of plates , glasses and utensils , and laundering of napkins and tablecloths , will inactivate the virus . No need for disposables here . <p> The table should also be cleaned and disinfected between uses and marked as sanitized . <p> Menus are a bit more problematic , depending on the material . Plastic menus could be disinfected . Disposable menus would be more ideal . Remember , even if someone touches a surface that has infectious virus , as long as they do n't touch their mouth , nose or eyes they should be safe . So , when in doubt , wash your hands or use hand sanitizer . <p> Can I get the virus from food from the kitchen ? <p> The risk of becoming infected with the new coronavirus from food is very low . <p> This is a respiratory virus whose primary mode of infection is accessing the upper or lower respiratory tract through droplets or aerosols entering your mouth , nose or eyes .

If food were to be contaminated during preparation , cooking temperature would likely inactivate much if not all of the virus . <p> The use of masks and maintaining good hand hygiene by food preparers should significantly reduce the risk of food contamination . <p> Is outdoor seating or a drive-through any safer ? <p> Vulnerable people may want to pass on dine-in options and focus on pickup or perhaps outside dining if the conditions are appropriate . <p> Drive-up windows or carry-out are probably the safest ; transient interaction with one individual when everyone is wearing masks is a lower-risk situation . <p> Overall , outside dining is safer than indoor dining with everything else being equal on a nonwindy day due to the larger air volume .

@@31902233 <h> Why Ebony May Still Be Angry With Me <p> The morning was bright from the shining sun . It was yet another buzzing day . Sweat trickled down the faces of tired but zealous people on the streets , who were striving to make a living . I too , like those on the street , was going to strive for a living . <p> Then I noticed that people had gathered in two 's , three 's and even more chit-chatting . Then I heard each of them mention the name ' Ebony Reigns ' . I must say I was n't a fan of her music , not a fan of music in general . Only I found her personality awesome ; she was beautiful , very talented and simply enjoyed life . When I heard her name in any group , I thought she had released another ' explosion ' . You know how she does it ! She makes headlines with her music and lifestyle . <p> Then I got to the office , " it seems today is a meeting day of two 's and three 's , " I thought to myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office too . I really did n't bother to find out why . Then my colleague entered my office and said to me that I did n't look like I knew what was going on , probably because I was the only one not engaged in any chatter . Some joy crept into my heart ; I thought we were going to have a surprise party at work but her tone did n't communicate elation . Before I could ask , she dropped the bombshell that blasted my brain . " Ebony is dead ! She died in an accident last night . " My mouth failed to utter any words : I 'm not sure if it was out of sheer disbelief or extreme shock . I only thought to myself " Oh this carnage on our roads " . <p> When we set out to pursue various endeavours , we hope to return when the day is over . In Ghana , this hope is only anchored by divine providence . I concur that all aspects of our lives are , but why does it come with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> Our roads are fraught with sharp knives that cut destinies into nothingness and uncertainties that dissipate our dreams in thin air . Almost every week , accidents do occur and every month someone or some persons lose their lives to road accidents .

( www.graphic.com ) . We have not forgotten the major clash on the Kintampo highway that claimed a lot of lives early this year . The WHO estimates that an average of four persons lose their lives in Ghana every day . This is certainly startling , worrying and alarming . <p> We can count a tall list of losses after we shed tears for our cherished departed souls . The children whose futures have been shattered because they lost their parents , loved ones who have been plunged into perpetual depression because a loved one is no more and dependants who have to face the horrors of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I almost forgot the maimed whose otherwise beautiful lives have been tied to beds and wheelchairs for life or if they are lucky enough , a number of productive years of their life . The effects sweep wide and the impact on our country can not be overlooked . <p> But why does it look like we do n't care about it ? Or have we become helpless ? Is there nothing our institutions can do to help ? Hmmm , it looks like we all need to hold on more strongly to providence . But after you have prayed , resist any driver who moves a car if he 's drunk . Dear driver , please do not neglect the screech from under the car , the little smoke from the engines that can degenerate into huge flames . Understand that you need to get there early but it 's more important that you get there safe . Therefore , do n't rush to make any inappropriate overtaking ; the consequences can be dire . Dear pedestrian , do not cross the road until it is safe enough . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations are strictly enforced . <p> Sorry , I think I got swayed a bit from the story I was telling . Now , I know why I could n't say anything when my colleague announced Ebony 's death to me . I had disappointed her . She may even argue I have a hand in her death . I was so bothered about fatalities on our road but I did nothing about it . Come to think of it , what great difference could I make ? I 'm sure if I was at the spot of the incident , I 'd have bulldozed the heap of sand off the road or I 'd have signalled the oncoming bus to stop or maybe I 'd have even discouraged her from embarking on that tragic journey altogether . I promise I 'd have gone all out to have her alive today . If I had any power , I 'd have done same for all the great minds that have been buried in our soils undiscovered . Everyone understands that I 'm helpless in this matter ; I hope Ebony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great minds in graves confer to send us a roadmap that can help us fight this carnage on our roads . Ermmm .. I have also heard that Sweden has a reputation for safety on their roads . Sometimes , the number of deaths in a whole year equals what happens in Ghana in a month . This is a plea for help ; they may lend us their expertise for only a month . Until they listen , may providence carry us through the to and fro movements , as it remains our best and only resort .

@@31937237 <h> The Minister of Parliamentary Affairs , Mr Osei Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu has disagreed with the Auditor-General 's position that a conflict of interest situation arises in the request to pay some 200 former Members of Parliament ( MPs ) salary arrears amounting to about GH ? 29.7 million . <p> To him , the Auditor-General should rather confront himself with the principles of whether or not the request was legitimate . <p> " ... what should have confronted the Auditor-General is whether or not , a committee was established , whether or not payments were made , whether or not the payments that were made were adequate or not adequate , those are the matters that should confront the Auditor-General , it is not about conflict of interest , " he said in a radio interview with Accra based Citi FM on Monday evening . <p> The Chief of Staff , Madam Frema Osei Opare , in a letter dated April 22 , 2020 , based on a request by the Forum for Former Members of Parliament ( FFMP ) , led by Mr David Apasera , a former Peoples National Convention ( PNC ) MP for Bolgatanga Central in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrears they say is due them in the Fourth Parliament , had asked the Auditor-General to do an audit verification on the request . <p> The forum sent their request to the Chief of Staff in a letter dated April 17 , 2020 . They argued that between 2005 and 2009 , they were underpaid what has actually due them as a monthly salary and therefore demanding that the arrears should be paid to them . <p> The mistake , they said arose as a result of a mistake in repeating the same amount paid as salary in 2003 to them in 2004 , instead of a 20 percent increment . <p> This , they said repeated itself throughout the period , 2004 and 2005to 2009 hence , the need to pay them the arrears after the anomaly was rectified . <p> However , the Auditor-General , Mr Daniel Yaw Domelevo in a response letter dated May 8 , 2020 , declined to carry out the audit verification and said they former MPs were not entitled to the said arrears and that it was an " invalid " request . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because he said the current president Akufo-Addo , the Chief of Staff , Frema Opare , Members of Parliament from the Majority side who are in government are on the list and he believes , " it amounts to a conflict of interest to make an additional payment of 20 percent salary increase per annum for four years to former Members of Parliament covering a period of 10 to 14 years ago , especially when some of them are now in the Executive , i.e. the approving authority . " <p> He used a query raised by former President J.E.A. Mills in 2009 on whether or not Parliament and the President Kufuor had approved of the emoluments for the president and members of the executive , Parliamentarians and Article 71 officeholders and the decision to appoint the Ishmael Yamson Committee in 2009 to look into it as his basis for the rejection of the request by the Chief of Staff . See letter attached below <p> But reacting to the development in the radio interview with Accra based Citi FM on Monday evening May 18 , 2020 and monitored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leader , Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu said " it is really an unfortunate statement to have come from the Auditor General , because , the issue is whether or not , a committee was established by the President " on the emoluments and whether or not , it was approved under President Kufuor 's era . <p> Mr Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu who has been in Parliament since January 7 , 1997 , representing the people of Suame in Kumasi and whose name is also on the list of former MPs requesting the arrears expressed disagreement with the Auditor-General 's position of a conflict of interest situation . <p> He said the whole brouhaha emanated from the era of former President J.E.A. Mills and that when he Mills assumed office , the Chinery Hesse Committee , appointed by his predecessor President J.A . Kufuor had submitted its recommendations in respect of the emoluments to the Speaker of Parliament . <p> In respect of Article 71 officeholders , members of the executive and the legislature , the President is required to appoint a committee that will then submit recommendations to the President in respect of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers and deputy ministers , the onerous is on Parliament to do the approval on the basis of the recommendations submitted by the committee whilst the president approves of those for Parliamentarians and other Article 71 officeholders . <p> " Remember when President Mills assumed office , " he said there was no " evidence that Parliament had approved " of the emoluments due President Kufuor , his Ministers and Deputy Ministers of State , and accordingly he was not going to pay anything . <p> He said in the midst of the " brouhaha " , following an argument by a Member of Parliament that the committee 's report had not been approved by Parliament , President Mills then appointed the Ishmael Yamson Committee " to look into the issue . <p> He said the issue became a subject of litigation because the Ishmael Yamson Committee came to the determination that it could n't find the document which was approved by Parliament for the President , Ministers and Deputy Ministers . <p> This , he said was even after the then-Majority Leader , Alban Bagbin had emphatically stated before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu had also said same when they both appeared before the Ishmael Yamson Committee . <p> He said the committee surprisingly arrived at that determination of not finding the document when everybody else thought the matter had been settled . <p> He said President Mills then came to the conclusion that how much was to be paid as emoluments had not been approved but " we Parliamentarians felt that the President at the time had no power to establish a committee to make a determination as to how much should be paid to the former Members of Parliament because it is not his business or part of his remit to establish a committee to make a determination . " <p> " In any event , the Majority Leader Alban Bagbin and the Minority Leader Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu had jointly made a declaration before that committee Yamson that it had been approved , it was for the president at the time Kufuor to approve of the recommendation , in respect of Parliament , the Speaker and Members of Parliament , which had been done . Now they came to tell us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that report , that had been approved by the presidency in respect of the Members of Parliament , plus the Speaker . Whose fault was it ? " <p> " So As far as I 'm concerned , for anybody to stand on that , to say that the report was n't approved , to me , it was unfortunate understanding of the establishment of the committee by the sitting president Mills , and the approval process granted by parliament on one side and the presidency on the otherside . <p> He argued further that the Auditor General should have rather focused on the following : <p> " The issue is whether or not , the recommendations by that committee , if it was properly established was approved by Parliament . " <p> " The issue is whether or not the recommendations from that committee if it was indeed properly established , was approved by the President . " <p> " And those are the matters of consideration , its not about conflict of interest . " <p> " In any event , the president has not taken any matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mater to court , I Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu have not taken any matter to court but there are many , many people who used to be part of Parliament , who are no longer in Parliament . " <p> " Indeed in respect to our side NPP of Members of Parliament who will otherwise come for consideration if anything should be done , there are only about three or four of us , myself , the honourable Ken Ohene Agyapong , KT Hammond and I think , Opare Ansah , there are only four of us . " <p> " On the other side NDC , we have Alban Bagbin , we have Yieleh Chereh , we have Collins Dauda , we have Eric Opoku ... , infact on the otherside they are even more , that is why I am saying that your personalization to me Kyei-Mensah-Bonsu is unfortunate . Lets talk to the principle . <p> " The principle is what I have raised . And as I 'm saying , what should have confronted the Auditor-General is whether or not , a committee was established , whether or not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made were adequate or not adequate , those are the matters that should confront the Auditor-General , it is not about conflict of interest .

It would be morally and legally wrong to intimidate anybody from exercising his or her franchise , " he opined . <p> In addition , Mr Anim discouraged the use of violence , pressure , fear and intimidation as political tools to struggle for power , recommending that the best form of politicking was the one that addressed issues such as education , health and agriculture through dispassionate , critical and objective analysis of facts and figures . <p> He indicated that human emotions , desires and expectations were involved in elections . Due to that , every election situation would become volatile unless caution , circumspection and tolerance were exercised . <p> He , therefore , urged all citizens to exercise tolerance in their homes , workplaces , churches ( in general social interactions ) and in the election period so that Ghana would go through its democratic process of election peacefully . <p> The Greater Accra Regional Police Commander , DCOP Patrick Timbilla , advised the youth to stay out of trouble and conduct themselves peacefully at all polling stations.He called on them to assist the police positively in ensuring peaceful elections and report any abnormalities , problems or lapses they would find at polling stations to the appropriate authorities , and also respect electoral laws . " You are the vibrant element of the society and everybody would want to use the youth but do not allow yourselves to be used as agents of destruction " , he advised.The regional commander also assured them that the police were ready to ensure a peaceful elections , adding that there was the need to strengthen the capacity of the police and urged all stakeholders to make an input in that direction in ensuring peaceful elections . <p> The leader for the " Yes for Peace " project , Mr Urmar Mohammed , used the occasion to appeal to all political individuals to desist from taking advantage of the jobless youth in the country to set them on the path of destruction . <p> " As young people of the country , we have given ourselves the task of doing our best to avert the eruption of political violence because we cherish the fragile peace we have in the country " , he observed . <p> THE National Security Coordinator , Lt Col Larry Gbevlo-Lartey ( retd ) , has exonerated the National Organiser of the ruling party , Mr Yaw Boateng-Gyan , over a controversial leaked tape in which he ( organiser ) was plotting to infiltrate the National Security with party loyalists . <p> He told Joy News yesterday that the controversial Yaw Boateng-Gyan tape " has nothing of value worth investigating .

" <p> " If there is something to investigate we will investigate , " he noted but National Security will not be lured to go fishing for something which has no security implication on the country , he added . <p> He said contrary to claims on the tape , the National Security at no point issued ID cards to persons who were not entitled to them , adding , even the National Organiser of the party was not informed on how recruitment is made into the Special Forces of the Ghana Army . <p> When he was asked if he was bothered by the part of the tape that had the loyalists tracking the movements of the NPP member and former Attorney General , Lt.

Col Lartey is also yet to listen to another tape involving the Member of Parliament of Assin North Kennedy Agyapong who is allegedly boasting of recruiting over a thousand thugs ahead of the 2008 elections . <p> He said he was not in office when the alleged recruitment was made but assured that nobody will be able to recruit any thug in the upcoming elections.A tape recording purported to have the voices of Mr Yaw Boateng Gyan , the National Democratic Congress ( NDC ) National Organiser , and some unidentified persons stirred the political waters last week . <p> The 35-minute tape was suspected to have been recorded in a meeting with some unidentified party foot soldiers and had Mr Boateng-Gyan discussing plans to draft them into a Special Force of the Ghana Armed Forces whose members would later be given National Security identification cards to enable them to infiltrate the ranks of some parties especially the National Democratic Party ( NDP ) . <p> The plan , according to the voices , was to find information about the strategies of the NDP and its likely impact on the fortunes of the NDC in the December elections.It also made reference to issuing the operatives with National Security identification cards but was not sure about the support from National Security , since in the past such provisions had been abused by those the party recruited for a similar exercise . <p> The recording also made references to the motivational package for the persons to be engaged which included a GH ? 5,000 for the wives of the people to start a business . <p> Mr Boateng-Gyan has confirmed that the voice of the recording is his , prompting calls from several quarters including the New Patriotic Party ( NPP ) for his arrest . <p> THE Council of Elders of the National Democratic Congress ( NDC ) has approved the Vice-President , Mr Paa Kwesi Bekoe Amissah-Arthur , as the running mate to President John Dramani Mahama for the 2012 presidential election . <p> The approval followed his nomination by President Mahama , an unimpeachable source close to the Presidency told the Daily Graphic yesterday.The National Executive Committee ( NEC ) of the NDC is expected to meet today ( Tuesday ) to confirm him . <p> Vice-President Amissah-Arthur , will then be officially outdoored by the NDC at the National Theatre at 4pm by President Mahama during which he ( President Mahama ) will also make some campaign pronouncements .. <p> The source , however , declined to say when the official outdooring would take place but indicated that it would be pretty soon . <p> Mr Amissah-Arthur , an economist and then Governor of the Bank of Ghana ( BoG ) , was nominated on July 31 , this year , by President Mahama to be considered by Parliament as the Vice-President of the Republic of Ghana . <p> Mr Amissah-Arthur 's nomination and approval by Parliament as the Vice-President was in line with Article 60 ( 10 ) of the 1992 Constitution.His nomination followed the swearing in of Mr Mahama as the President following the death of President John Evans Atta Mills on July 24 , 2012 . <p> Mr Mahama was sworn into office in fulfilment of Article 60 ( 6 ) of the 1992 Constitution , which states : " Whenever the President dies , resigns or is removed from office , the Vice-President shall assume office as President for the unexpired term of office of the President with effect from the date of the death , resignation or removal of the President . " <p> Prior to Mr Amissah-Arthur 's nomination as Vice-President , many names had made the rounds in the rumour mill , prominent among them being the renowned economist and Minister of Finance during the Rawlings administration , Dr Kwesi Botchwey ; the current Minister of Trade and Industry , Ms Hanna Tetteh ; the Minister for Local Government and Rural Development , Mr Samuel Ofosu-Ampofo ; the Minister for Food and Agriculture , Mr Kwesi Ahwoi ; the Chairman of the National Development Planning Commission , Mr P.V . Obeng , and the Volta Regional Minister , Mr Henry Ford Kamel . <p> After Mr Amissah-Arthur 's nomination , there were speculations that President Mahama had nominated him only to assist him to complete the term of the late President Mills and that he might nominate another person to partner him for the 2012 elections . <p> The source said the nomination of Vice-President Amissah-Arthur by President Mahama and his subsequent approval by the Council of Elders of the NDC had settled the matter . <p> Mr Amissah-Arthur is said to have been the late President Mills 's preferred choice for the Central Bank 's highest position because of the former 's involvement in the team of technocrats who had impressively managed Ghana 's structural adjustment programme which turned the country 's economic fortunes around in the 1980s . <p> Mr Amissah-Arthur 's management of the nation 's coffers started when he became the Special Assistant to the PNDC Secretary for Finance from 1983 to 1986 . <p> When the Fourth Republican sun , rose with former President Rawlings still at the helm of affairs , he was appointed the Deputy Minister of Finance from 1993 to 1997 , during which he worked with Dr Botchwey . <p> Mr Amissah-Arthur , who was also the Deputy Chairman of the Transition team on the Economy , is a prot ? g ? of Dr Botchwey . He also accumulated a great deal of experience while involved in structural adjustment programmes which enabled him to move into an international consultancy business . <p> When he was the Governor of the BoG , Mr Amissah-Arthur was named the most influential personality in 2010 by the Ghanaian think tank , IMANI Ghana.Before his association with the management of the country 's economy , Mr Amissah-Arthur 's first appointment was at the Institute of Statistical , Social and Economic Research ( ISSER ) at the University of Ghana , Legon , where he was a research assistant from 1974 to 1975 . <p> From there , he took to the classroom at the Department of Economics of the same university as a teaching assistant from 1977-1978 , became an assistant lecturer in 1979 before becoming a lecturer from 1980 to 1988 . <p> He also lectured at the Anambra State College of Education in Nigeria from 1981 to 1983 . <p> Mr Amissah-Arthur was born in Cape Coast in the Central Region on April 29 , 1951 . He had his GCE Ordinary and Advanced level certificates at Mfantsipim School in Cape Coast in 1969 and 1971 , respectively . <p> He then proceeded to the University of Ghana where he was awarded a B.Sc degree in Economics in 1974 and an M.Sc in Economics in 1980 . <p> PRESIDENT John Dramani Mahama has appealed to cocoa farmers to take advantage of the Cocoa Rehabilitation Project and replace all their old cocoa plants with hybrid ones . <p> He said whereas the old cocoa trees did not produce beans early , the new hybrid seedlings being distributed under the Cocoa Rehabilitation Project could mature within two years after they had been planted . <p> He has , therefore , asked cocoa farmers to register with the Cocoa Rehabilitation Project to enable them to benefit from the project.President Mahama made the appeal at a durbar marking the Akwanbo festival of the chiefs and people of the Agona Traditional Area at Nyakrom in the Central Region . <p> It was a delight to watch the chiefs , immaculately dressed in their rich clothes and ornaments , sitting in state with their subjects at the durbar ground.President Mahama announced that the government would distribute test stones to cocoa farmers by the end of October , this year , . Test stones are meant to regulate the weighing of cocoa and protect cocoa farmers against cheating by unscrupulous cocoa buyers . <p> He , therefore , urged cocoa farmers to make good use of the test stones when they receive them , and compare them to the weighing scales provided by cocoa buyers and ensure that their measurement was correct before they sell their cocoa.On the forthcoming election , President Mahama reiterated his commitment to ensure peaceful , free and fair elections in fulfillment of the promise made by President John Evans Atta Mills . <p> He expressed the hope that God would bless Ghana with another peaceful election , making it the sixth successive election since the country 's return to the democratic governance in 1992 . <p> He urged Ghanaians to promote peace during the elections , and not to vote for those who had the penchant for insulting their perceived political opponents but rather vote for those " who can lead the country to the promised land " . <p> Okofo Eku X Paramount Chief of Agona Traditional Area commended the government for tarring many roads in the area and constructing school buildings in the area . <p> He also appealed to the government to assist the area with more school buildings to enable it to absorb the increased number of students and ensure the tarring of the untarred roads in the area to improve the movement of people and goods . <p> Responding to the requests made by Okofo Nyarko Eku , the President said he would instruct the Inspector General of Police to allocate a vehicle to the Nyakrom Police Station . <p> He said that the government had provided school facilities , clinics , teachers and nurses quarters , and provided more street lights in the area . He promised to improve the roads and construct a community centre and more school buildings and clinics in the area . <p> PRESIDENT John Dramani Mahama says he is convinced God will grant the National Democratic Congress ( NDC ) victory in the forthcoming presidential and parliamentary elections to continue to implement the unfinished policies under the Better Ghana Agenda . <p> Therefore , he said , the NDC would not do anything to disrupt the election , since the party was sure of winning the election . " I have hope in God that it is the NDC that will emerge victorious in the election . With the help of God , the election will be held once , " he said to cheering NDC supporters and sympathisers at the Swedru Town Hall in the Central Region . <p> The NDC members , most of who were in NDC T-shirts with President Mahama 's pictures inscribed on them , trooped the venue to catch a glimpse of the President and flag bearer of the NDC for the 2012 and listen to his message . <p> The hall was so packed with supporters that they had to be asked to come out of the hall to be addressed by President Mahama at the forecourt of the town hall . <p> President Mahama said political contest was like a football match where it was only the losing side that employed rough tactics to disrupt the match . He said the winning team always wanted the match to proceed peacefully to the end , because it had the conviction that it would get the goals and win the match.Likewise , the President said the NDC was sure of victory and so the party wanted the election to travel the full time without any hitches.He stressed that this year 's election would not be an " all die be die " affair , and that it would be one of the most peaceful and successful elections to be held in the country . <p> The President , therefore , urged Ghanaians , especially NDC supporters , to avoid acts that could disturb the electoral process and , by extension , the prevailing peace in the country . <p> He said it was only God who would select the best person to lead the country , adding that " it is God who installs chiefs " and that " the voice of the people is the voice of God " . <p> President Mahama promised the people of Swedru that a comprehensive work would begin soon on their bridge which collapsed following the flooding in the area last year . <p> Again , he said he would complete all projects started in the area by late President John Evans Atta Mills and initiate new ones.A veteran actor and citizen of Swedru , Asonaba Kweku Darko , better known as Super O.D. , predicted that come January 7 , 2013 , President Mahama would be sworn in as the President of Ghana . <p> He said President Mahama 's victory in the election would be a reward from God to President Mahama because of his generosity to the poor and vulnerable.For instance , Super O.D. said President Mahama gave him a car in 2010 when he went to his ( President Mahama 's ) house and requested that he needed a car because his knee problem made it difficult for him to walk for far distance . <p> The 2012 presidential candidate of the Convention People 's Party , Dr Abu Sakara , has urged the people of the Volta Region to invest in their future now by voting the CPP into power in the December 7 elections . <p> He stated that a vote for the CPP was an investment Ghanaians would be making since he was determined to lead an incorruptible government to ensure that all citizens were given equal share of the national cake . <p> This was contained in a press release from the office of Dr Sakara . <p> " We will ensure that the people of Ghana are given what is due them in order for us all to develop the Nation in unity , " Dr Sakara said According to him , this year 's election is only about one thing -- whether we will continue in the Ghana of prosperity for the few at the expense of all of us or will vote the Convention People 's Party for prosperity for all of us . <p> We are going to work to honour our fathers and mothers , so that the things which they have not seen , they should be in the position to see it now , Dr Sakara lamented . <p> Dr Sakara stated that the CPP was determined to ensure that the People of Ghana , irrespective of where they find themselves , were given equal access in every aspect of life . He expressed worry , saying it was rather unfortunate that current and previous governments after the CPP had failed to address the fundamental problem of investing in the people and the economy . <p> He advised the people in the Volta Region to choose the Convention People 's Party by voting massively for him and all the party 's parliamentary candidates in the region for a new way forward , which would bring real opportunities for their personal growth and the nation at large . <p> Dr Sakara was accompanied by his wife , Lily Sakara Foster ; National Organiser , Abu Forgor ; member of the Manifesto Committee , Mrs Elizabeth Quarcor Akpalu ; Mr Thomas Ntumy , National Campaign Manager ; P.K. Donkor Ayifli , a member of the Council of Elders ; Vincent Norgbedzi , Volta Regional Chairman ; and some constituency and polling station executive members from the region . <p> THE presidential aspirant of the Progressive Peoples Party ( PPP ) , Dr Papa Kwesi Nduom , has toured the Upper East Region with a call on each and every polling station executive to reach out to at least 10 people in order to help the PPP get the votes that it needs to win the elections come December 2007 . <p> " We do not want anyone of you to spend money travelling to other places . Stay within your polling station and work for the PPP . We have 21 polling station executives in each constituency and if each of you should bring at least 10 people on board , we will be on the way to victory . We live with people . Everybody knows somebody , so do n't look at what others are doing . Talk to your friends , family members , mothers and fathers , brothers and sisters , husbands and wives , boyfriends and girlfriends so we can get the votes , " Dr Nduom said . <p> He was addressing polling station executives at two locations in Bolgatanga as part of his two-day tour of the Upper East Region . He met party supporters at Tindonmolgo and Zuarungu , where he told them that every election was won at the polling station level . " Quite often people want to enjoy themselves , sing , dance and make noise but they end up forgetting why we are campaigning . We 've learnt our lessons from previous elections and we are deciding to spend a bit of time on our own people so that they understand what each and every one of them must do so that we win the votes that we need come December 2007 " , he told the Daily Graphic in an interview . <p> " The purpose of this trip is to talk to PPP people who have accepted to become our polling station executives . We are swearing them in and telling them a simple message on what it is that they must do in order for the party to get votes , " he added.Earlier , Dr Nduom , accompanied by the party 's parliamentary candidate for the Bolgatanga Central Constituency , Mr Robert Anamolga , and the Regional Party Chairman , Mr Roger Akanko , paid a courtesy call on the Paramount Chief of the Bolgatanga Traditional Area , Naba Martin Abilba , to announce his presence in the region . <p> He told the Bolga Naba that as a private businessman , he had succeeded in taking branches of his business to urban areas like Bolgatanga and Bawku , and hinterlands like Garu . He said this should give an indication that when given the nod as the next president of Ghana , he would tackle all the major development challenges facing the rural people . <p> Here in the northern part of Ghana , our people are neglected , there is lack of planning and we in the PPP are committed to bringing real development . Take the recent floods , for example ; we should be able to harvest the water for irrigation and not allow the volumes of water to cause loss of lives and property and PPP will do that when voted into power , " he said . <p> Dr Nduom officially introduced the parliamentary candidate for Bolga Central , Mr Robert Anamolga , to the Bolga Naba and asked for his prayer and support to enable him to win the seat . <p> " I know Robert Anamolga because he is my employee and I know his capabilities , " he said . He added that compared to the other candidates contesting the seat , Mr Anamolga stood tall . <p> Mr Anamolga said the PPP was worried about the old woman who had to walk two kilometres to have access to water , the jobless youth and many other challenges . " Bolgatanga is blessed with vast land but sadly we are not making good use of it . When given the nod , I will introduce ventures like mango plantations to empower the youth , " he said . <p> " GHANAIANS can not wait for the next 20 years before benefiting from free senior high school education " , the flag bearer of the New Patriotic Party ( NPP ) , Nana Akufo-Addo , has stated . <p> He has , therefore , asked Ghanaians to vote out the National Democratic Congress ( NDC ) , which insists that it would take two decades before the implementation of the free senior high school , and usher in the NPP to execute the policy which it will start in its first year of governance . <p> Nana Akufo-Addo , who was addressing a rally at the Karikari Brobbey Park at Dansoman in the Ablekuma West Constituency in the Greater Accra Region , as part of his " Restoration of Hope " campaign , noted that the NPP had really planned a budget and identified the funding sources . It was , therefore , confident that it would be possible to make education free from kindergarten to senior high school level . <p> The Ablekuma South campaign marked the end of the second phase of the Greater Accra tour , which lasted over a month . <p> The occasion was also used to launch the constituency 's campaign and introduce the parliamentary aspirant , Ms Ursula Owusu , and other party executives . It attracted leading members of the party , including the wife of Dr Mahamudu Bawumia , running mate to the flag bearer , Mrs Samira Bawumia ; former Finance Minister , Mr Yaw Osafo Marfo ; and a leading member of the party , Mr Attoh Quashie . <p> Adani Best , a Ghanaian musician , treated the crowd to his famous " Gyata Bi " . He and his dancers , including a man dressed as a lion , danced to the music dubbed " Cub " . <p> Nana Akufo-Addo , who exhibited his multi-lingual skills by speaking English , Ga , Twi and French to the admiration of the crowd , noted that when it assumed power , the NDC made the payment of judgement debt their priority and managed to secure GH ? 830 million to pay for those debts some of which were doubtful . <p> He said the NPP had realised that with the current trend in the world , education had become very crucial for the advancement of any nation and that if the country wanted to make strides in the advancement of its economy , it could not allow education , especially at the secondary level , to be the preserve of only the rich . <p> He added that allowing education to be out of the reach of the poor would also have dire consequences for the unity , peace and prosperity of the nation , hence the decision of the NPP to amend the Education Act to ensure that basic education ended at senior high school and not at junior high school . <p> Nana Akufo-Addo , who had earlier walked through some principal streets of the constituency in the company of the Ms Ursula Owusu to exchange pleasantries , assured the fishermen of Chorkor and other areas that the next NPP administration would bring back the Ministry of Fisheries to cater for the needs of the fishermen . <p> He indicated that unlike the NDC , the NPP would not allow politicians to meddle in the distribution of the pre-mix fuel , but would stay off and allow the fishermen to take charge of the distribution of the fuel . <p> He gave the assurance that his administration would stabilise the cedi against the country 's major trading currencies , modernise the economy and start an industrial revolution that would generate the needed jobs for the people and also create wealth for the nation . <p> Nana Akufo-Addo told the crowd that he was not in politics to amass wealth , but wanted to serve the people and ensure that he and his team worked assiduously so that posterity would refer to him as the President whose era witnessed the greatest transformation of the country . <p> He said God did not create Ghana as a poor country , but the nation was going through hardship due to poor leadership and bad policies by the NDC and assured the people that the NPP would change this and exhibit visionary leadership and better policies that would reverse the bad trend . <p> THE Annual conference of the Democratic Union of Africa ( DUA ) , which comprises of all centre-right political parties on the continent has been held in Accra . It was hosted by the New Patriotic Party ( NPP ) , which is a member and attended by notable personalities like Ugandan opposition leader , Dr Kizza Besigye who chairs the union . <p> This year 's conference was held on theme : " Sustaining Democracy and Economic Development in Africa - the Centre-Right Way " . Delivering the keynote address , the flag bearer of the NPP for the 2012 Presidential Elections , Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo , said his quest to lead the country was not for his selfish gains . <p> According to him , the NPP is determined to succeed creating a free and fair society of opportunities and prosperity for all Ghanaians . <p> Nana Akufo-Addo observed that the NPP , having endured the slimmest electoral loss in the country 's election history in 2008 and their role in expanding the frontiers of democracy , deserved to win the 2012 polls . <p> " At least those who observed our elections in 2008 , know that I have personally tasted the painful experience of losing an election by the slimmest of margins in Africa 's history , 0.46 per cent ( some 40,000 votes ) , after leading the first round of the ballot by over 100,000 votes . I am sure that you will all agree with me that it is about time that I taste some success , as well . But , the success that we seek is not of a personal or partisan kind , " he said . <p> Nana Akufo-Addo said the eight years that the party had to govern the country saw a massive transformation in the lives of many Ghanaians , hence the need for the party to be returned to power . <p> " Today , all that showcases Ghana as a serious nation that provides a safety net for the vulnerable and is dedicated to the welfare of her people stands in the name of the NPP ; the National Health Insurance Scheme , the school feeding programme , the national youth employment programme , the capitation grant , the Livelihood Empowerment Against Poverty ( LEAP ) , and the mass transit programme , that makes transportation easy and affordable for the ordinary citizen , " he said . <p> He said the center-right political ideology was the way for many African nations to broaden their societies , foster democratic tenets and give the citizenry an opportunity to contribute to national development . <p> According to Nana Akufo-Addo , the ideology also opens up the economies of the individual countries for the participation of the private sector to empower the citizenry . <p> He said " an effective way to sustaining democracy and development in Africa is to promote a business-friendly environment that rewards creativity and enterprise and those who play by the rules . The centre-right way is to build an environment in which government and regulatory policies enhance rather than inhibit or frustrate trade , commerce and investments . As apostles of the rule of law , our governments ensure the confidence of the investor community that their investments would be safe . " <p> The NPP leader reminded fresh voters in the upcoming elections to be reminded of the struggles that political leaders like himself had endured to ensure that basic human right principles and freedoms were restored from the hands of military tyranny.While calling for active participation in the free-to-speak environment that the country was currently experiencing , he asked for circumspection and responsibility . <p> He challenged member countries of the union to impress on the African Union to adopt democratic means of governance in their respective countries . <p> " We , as centre-right parties , must encourage AU member countries to demonstrate a commitment to strengthening and protecting the institutions and culture of democratic governance ; respecting human rights , religious freedom , and the rights of the individual and minorities ; building strong market economies and facilitating the free movements of people , knowledge , goods and services across member states . Africa 's small countries will continue to struggle if they do it alone , but the accelerated economic integration of committed nations will breathe new life into the AU and deliver the benefits of African integration to the doorsteps of the Africans , " he said . <p> The centre-right political ideology , also referred to as the moderate right , describes adherence to views leaning to the right but close to the centre on the left-right political spectrum . The centre-right involves the acceptance of a degree of hierarchy in society . <p> It is based on the claim that inferior quality behaviour such as laziness and decadence will lead people to inferior situations in comparison to others . The contemporary centre right , unlike the far-right , usually claims that this is not innate and that people can end their behavioural inferiority through changing their habits and choices of behaviour . <p> The Chairman of the NPP , Mr Jake Obetsebi Lamptey , who opened the conference , said the African sub region was one of the most difficult areas for the centre-right ideology to thrive . <p> As a result , the annual meeting presented a platform where member parties meet to share ideas on the way forward.According to Mr Obetsebi , parties also come forth with success stories and the challenges they face in respective countries . <p> The International Secretary of the Conservative Party ( UK ) , Mrs Philippa Broom , reiterated calls to enhance Ghana 's democracy , rule of law and accountability , On his part , the Secretary General of International Democratic Union ( IDU ) , Mr Eirik Moen , urged other developing countries to emulate Ghana 's democratic achievements . <p> Mr Moen was optimistic that Ghana would once again go through the December 7 Polls as a peaceful and united country . <p> GHANA will witness significant transformation in the first year when a People 's National Convention ( PNC ) takes over the government administration of the country , the PNC 's flag bearer , Hassan Ayariga , has hinted.Consequently , he has charged Ghanaians not to make the mistake of voting for any other party except the PNC on December 7 , 2012 . <p> " Leadership is about taking responsibility of the ordinary Ghanaian and transforming it for the better , " Mr Ayariga said on the third leg of his Accra tour.The PNC , he noted , was the only party that cared so much for the people as a result of the programmes it had developed to improve the lives of the citizenry.The tour took him through to Kaneshie , Kokompe , Darkuman , Fadama , Abeka Lapaz , Nii Boi Town and Achimota . <p> Accompanying him was the First Vice Chairman of the party , Mr David Nibi , and other supporters of the party.A large army of people lined the streets to welcome the PNC flag bearer who was riding in an open-top vehicle . Occasionally he stopped in the areas he passed through to address by-standers , residents , traders , artisans , students and the youth.Shouts of " Two Direct Two Sure " , the slogan of the party , was echoed throughout the tour . <p> Mr Ayariga said past governments had failed the people in spite of the abundance of resources such as gold , diamond , oil , manganese and timber , adding that when voted into power the PNC would make judicious use of those resources for the benefit of the people.According to him , the mismanagement of the country 's resources was responsible for its problems . <p> Today , he said , a section of the youth had engaged in practices such as " sakawa " ( internet fraud ) because there was no jobs for them to do , and that under Hassan Ayariga the story would be good for the youth as they would be given the requisite employable training , skills and education . <p> Mr Ayariga said his decision to contest was to inspire the youth , since it was time for the youth to rule.He told them ( youth ) that " your vote for Hassan Ayariga is a vote for yourself " and that if " you do n't do that you throw your future away " . <p> Throughout his stops , he emphasised the need for peace , as it was very essential to the development of Ghana.Mr Ayariga said there was no way Ghana could develop without peace and therefore urged Ghanaians , especially the youth , not to be misled by politicians to cause havoc during this year 's elections . <p> " Let 's not compromise the peace of this country , since Ghana is the only country we have . Let us put Ghana first in everything we do , " he said.The PNC , he said , stood for peace as it had demonstrated in past elections . <p> The Greater Accra Region has been a fierce battle ground this week for three frontline flag bearers as they undertake important campaign activities across the region ahead of the December election . <p> President John Mahama of the ruling National Democratic Congress ( NDC ) , Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo of the New Patriotic Party ( NPP ) and Dr Papa Kwesi Nduom of the Progressive People 's Party ( PPP ) have all taken their messages to the constituents in the region . <p> The crowds that have followed the campaign trail of these flag bearers indicate that the battle to capture one of the swing regions in the country is just beginning . <p> In the 2000 election , the NPP won 16 parliamentary seat in the Greater Accra Region , while the NDC managed only six seats.But whereas the NPP maintained the number of its parliamentary seats in the region in 2004 , the NDC made significant progress , grabbing 11 seats . <p> The electoral fortunes of the NPP in the region plummeted in 2008 as it won only nine parliamentary seats , while the NDC had good fortunes winning 16 seats . <p> President Mahama had been touring parts of the region on Tuesday and Wednesday on the last leg of his ' Thank You Tour ' meant to express gratitude to the people for commiserating with the government after the death and funeral of the late President J. E. A. Mills . <p> While performing that national duty , he had not failed to seize the opportunity to draw the people 's attention to the good works of the government , particularly under the superintendent of the late president and called on them to return the party to power . <p> For his part , Nana Addo has been touring various constituencies in Accra to rally support for the party in the December polls.The main thrust of the campaign has been a reinforcement of his promise to provide free senior high school ( SHS ) education when elected as president . <p> He has also used the opportunity to criticise the government for what he believes to be a failure to deliver on the expectations of Ghanaians . <p> Although the campaign of Dr Nduom has not been as big as the flag bearers of the two major political parties , the naming and outdooring of his running mate on Wednesday was a key event that shook the foundations of Osu in particular . <p> A number of gender activists and women rights advocates have described the selection of Ms Eva Lokko as the running mate of the flag bearer of the Progressive People 's Party ( PPP ) as a positive step towards changing the face of politics in Ghana . <p> Speaking in separate interviews with the Daily Graphic on their reactions to the selection of Ms Lokko to partner the party 's flag bearer , Dr Papa Kwesi Nduom , in the upcoming general election , they commended the party for its initiative and said the action was a positive step towards the attainment of increased women 's representation in politics and at other levels of decision-making . <p> They said the selection of Ms Lokko who has a lot of experience and professional competence , " adds a lot of value to our campaign and advocacy for increased women 's representation in politics , and it also demonstrates that there are a lot of competent women in the country to hold key positions " <p> The President of the Women Assistance and Business Association ( WABA ) , Madam Gloria Ofori Boadu , said Miss Lokko was not just a women but a competent and qualified person who could work to fulfil the confidence reposed in her . <p> She said the whole world was moving towards gender equality , and that social change was such that no country could hold it back because of the realisation of the economic importance of giving equal opportunities to both men and women to be part of the development process . <p> Madam Ofori Buadu , a lawyer , said women constituted more than half of the population of most countries in the world , adding that " we in Ghana can not remain primitive , but be part of the dynamic process by involving them in national development " . Madam Boadu who contested the parliamentary primaries in the Abuakwa South Constituency on the ticket of the New Patriotic Party , but lost her bid to become the party 's parliamentary candidate in the 2008 elections , called on political parties to develop their structures to promote the increased participation of women in politics . <p> She said women who declared their intension to enter politics should be supported and not castigated . The Executive Director of the Human Rights Advocacy Centre , Nana Oye Lithur , said the selection of Miss Lokko as the first woman running mate of a registered political party for the 2012 elections puts women in the spotlight , and she stood tall among the running mates of the other political parties.She said a look at her curriculum vitae showed she was a very competent and capable person with the requisite experience and qualification . <p> Nana Oye congratulated Dr Nduom and the PPP for selecting Ms Lokko , and said their action conformed with the recommendations of the Constitution Review Commission to get more women in politics and decision making and also fitted well into the commitment of the PPP to involve women in key positions of the party , and to field females for 40 per cent of PPP 's parliamentary aspirants . She said " we are looking up to Ms Lokko to champion the cause of women and demonstrate that women at high levels of decision-making can make a meaningful impact . <p> Nana Oye said it was quite impressive that a number of young women had contested the parliamentary primaries and won on the ticket of the various political parties , adding that they all added to an interesting political phenomenon in this year 's elections . The Executive Director of the Ark Foundation , Mrs Angela Dwamena Aboagye , said although it was exciting that the PPP had selected a woman as the running mate , that was not enough in terms of addressing the critical issues of concern of women in Ghana raised in the Women 's Manifesto , which was compiled by the Coalition on the Women 's Manifesto for Ghana in 2004 . <p> She said an aspect of the country 's culture and the national life led to discrimination against women and relegated them to the background.She said all the political parties needed to take critical look at issues of concern to women raised in the manifesto in relation to the 10 themes , namely , women 's economic empowerment , women and land , women , social policy and social development , women in politics , decision-making and public life and women , human rights and the law , discriminatory cultural practices , women and media , women , conflict and peace , women with special needs and institutions with a mandate to promote women 's rights . <p> She said there were many competent and qualified women in the country , and that conscious efforts should be made through affirmative action and capacity building programmes to encourage them to go the extra mile to come forward to actively participate in the country 's development process . <p> President John Dramani Mahama has called for a " clean and competitive " political campaign devoid of insults and lies in the forthcoming presidential and parliamentary elections . <p> He said political parties needed to conduct their campaigns " in a modest and decent " manner to disprove the notion that politics was a dirty game . <p> President Mahama made the call yesterday at a durbar of chiefs and people of the Greater Accra Region at the forecourt of the Trade Fair Centre at La in Accra . <p> He had earlier visited the family home of the former First Lady , Mrs Naadu Mills , at Prampram , where he thanked the family for collaborating with the government to give President John Evans Atta Mills a fitting burial . <p> On his way to the durbar ground , President Mahama made whistle stops at Ashaiman and Nungua , where he was met by a large number of National Democratic Congress ( NDC ) supporters and sympathisers . <p> The President said politics per se was not dirty , but indicated that " it is us politicians who make politics dirty " . <p> For instance , he said , the late President Mills had changed the face of politics by his modesty , humility and patience . <p> President Mahama said even those who led the onslaught of insults and vilification on the late President Mills praised him as a patient , humble and tolerant person in death . <p> " We , therefore , have to take the unfortunate tragedy of the demise of the Prof Mills to forge ahead . Let his attributes continue to live on . Let us clean up our politics . We have to approach politics with civility and modesty , " he stressed . <p> The President said it was in that light that he had directed the government communication team to focus on issues and not attack personalities or respond to personality attacks . <p> He said he believed that the government had done a lot of work and , therefore , Ghanaians would want to hear those achievements but not insults or lies . <p> President Mahama reiterated his commitment to ensure a free , fair and peaceful election in fulfilment of the promise made by the late President Mills . <p> He urged the youth of Ashaiman , Nima , Maamobi and other areas not to allow themselves to be used as thugs by unscrupulous politicians to visit mayhem on their perceived political opponents . <p> The President reassured the people of the Greater Accra Region that he would complete all the projects initiated in the region by the late President Mills . <p> He said new projects would be started in Accra to improve infrastructure and develop the region to attain its true status as the capital city of Ghana . <p> On behalf of himself , the government and the family of the late President Mills , President Mahama thanked the chiefs and people of the Greater Accra Region for their show of love , support and encouragement during the funeral and burial ceremony of the late President . <p> The President of the Greater Accra Regional House of Chiefs , Nene Abram Akuako III , noted that the late President Mills was a man of peace who had contributed to the development of the Greater Accra Region . <p> He expressed the hope that President Mahama would be able to continue from where the late President Mills left off . <p> Nene Akuako III extended an invitation to President Mahama to convene a meeting with the Greater Accra Regional House of Chiefs to discuss issues of concern to the region . <p> Speaking at a mini-durbar at Prampram , Mr E.T. ? Nartey , the head of the family of the former First Lady , thanked President Mahama for leading the government to give a fitting burial to late President Mills , who was their in-law . <p> The Paramount Chief of the Prampram Traditional Area , Nene Tetteh Djan II , assured the President of the commitment of his people to support him to continue implementing the policies under the Better Ghana Agenda started by the late President Mills . <p> At Ashaiman , the football field where President Mahama was billed to address the people was crowded , forcing the President to speak to them in his open-top vehicle . <p> He later interacted with the market women at the Ashaiman Market . <p> Enthusiastic motorbike riders led President Mahama and his entourage , including the Chief of Staff , Mr Henry Martey Newman ; the Minister of Water Resources , Works and Housing , Mr E.T . Mensah ; the Minister of Local Government and Rural Development , Mr Samuel Ofosu Ampofo ; and the Greater Accra Regional Minister , Nii Laryea Afotey Agbo , through the principal streets of Ashaiman . <p> Some of the motor riders followed the President 's convoy to Nungua , where President Mahama assured a large crowd and sympathisers of his commitment to ensure a free , fair and peaceful election this year . <p> President Mahama is scheduled to continue his ' thank you ' tour of the Greater Accra Region today , to bring to a closure the tour which has taken the President to all the regions . <p> The flag bearer of the New Patriotic Party ( NPP ) , Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo , has stated that the party 's commitment to peace and stability of the nation , before , during and after the elections " is non-negotiable " . <p> Two hundred and seventy-five pupils from the Weija Cluster of Schools have dropped out of school as a result of the lack of a footbridge over the Weija Lake to give them access to school . <p> In addition , 1,200 pupils who live at Ayigbe Town , SCC , Old Barrier , Bortianor and Broadcasting , all communities on one side of the Weija Dam , put their lives in danger by scaling the walls of the dam daily to get to school . <p> Those who can not climb the walls of the dam go through the wire fence gate to cross over the bridge to their respective schools . <p> The only existing footbridge which passes through the Weija Water Treatment Plant is not accessible to the schoolchildren as a result of a directive from the Ministry of Water Resources , <p> Works and Housing to close the gate leading to the dam . <p> Since the directive was issued last year , the Weija Methodist Basic School has recorded the highest dropout with a total number of 120 pupils . The rest are Weija Presbyterian Primary and Junior High School , 90 pupils ; Weija Municipal Assembly JHS , 35 ; the St Joseph the Worker Primary , 15 , with St Jude recording 15 . <p> In addition , the schools are affected by persistent absenteeism and truancy because the pupils can not afford the transportation fare to and from school . <p> This information was disclosed to the Daily Graphic by the various heads of the schools . <p> They are , therefore , calling on the government to build two bridges across the Densu outlet to help alleviate the plight of the children . <p> They also pleaded that as a short-term measure , the gate of the Weija Dam should be opened for only the schoolchildren guarded by security personnel to ensure their safety during school hours . <p> The Headmistress of Weija Methodist Basic School , Madam Faustina Forson , lamented that since the closure of the Weija bridge , activities of the school had greatly been affected , with the major challenge being the rising rate of dropouts . <p> According to her , the lack of a footbridge has reduced the standard of education in the community and affected both the pupils and teachers . <p> ' ' The only source of passage for the schoolchildren was the Weija bridge but the Deputy Minister of Water Resources , Works and Housing , Ms Hanna Bissiw , gave instruction for its closure . Since then the children had resorted to using various means to come to school because their parents can not afford three transportation fares , " she said . <p> The Headmaster of Weija Presby JHS , Mr Bob Djah , said the students had adopted various ways to cross the lake to go to and from school at their peril . <p> He said while many of them prefered to climb dangerously the walls of the Weija Dam , others paid GH ? 1.00 to board a canoe to ferry them across the lake , another dangerous move . <p> ' ' Schoolchildren , some as young as two years from the Weija Presbyterian Primary School , the St Joseph the Worker Primary and Junior High , the Weija Methodist Primary and the Hips Charity schools put their lives at risk to make their way to school daily , ' ' he said . <p> The Headmaster of Weija Municipal Assembly JHS , Mr Shraw Takyi Kodam , recalled that after the Weija dam footbridge was closed by the authorities , the assembly member for Weija came with a proposed sketch footbridge but since then nothing had been done to start the construction of the bridge . <p> He said although the municipal assembly had promised to get a Metro Mass bus to convey the pupils to school daily , after months of waiting , the promise was yet to fulfilled . <p> Mr Kodam said over 80 percent of school pupils from the Weija cluster of schools lived at Ayigbe Town , SCC , Old Barrier , Bortianor and Broadcasting areas . <p> Reacting to the situation , the Managing Director of GWCL , Mr Kweku Botwe , said the closure of the Weija bridge was to protect the dam . <p> He explained that the bridge was constructed for the workers of the Weija Treatment Plant to use during the spillage and other activities of the company . <p> ' ' The bridge was not meant for the schoolchildren or the residents living on the other side of the dam , ' ' he said . <p> Mr Botwe noted that one major problem GWCL faced was that most of the residents who used the bridge dumped waste substances into the dam , which made it difficult for the dam to follow its natural course . <p> Others , he said , used the bridge to construct pipes to discharge their sewage into the dam . <p> The Ga South Municipal Director of Education , Mrs Florence Addo , said her outfit had not received any petition from the various heads of Weija cluster of schools concerning the students ' dropout rate that has arisen because of the closer of the bridge . <p> The Daily Graphic in its June 21 , 2012 , edition , carried a report about how 400 pupils crossed the Weija Dam on canoes or change vehicles three times before getting to school.Story : Dominic Moses Awiah

The challenges with fingerprint scanners were the most commonly reported . <p> There were still challenges with adherence to the COVID-19 health and safety protocols at some registration centers . For example , in 21% of cases , social distancing was not strictly enforced . <p> At a few registration centers ( 2.6% ) , some people attempted to physically prevent some registration applicants from registering instead of using a ' Challenge Form ' . There were also a few reports about abuse of the ' challenge ' provision as some political party agents of the NPP and the NDC engaged in what seemed to be arbitrary challenge of persons they suspected of belonging to the other political party . This for instance happened during the mop-up exercise at the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Statement on the voter register <p> 6 . Unauthorised persons were found at 16% of cases observed . At the M/A J.H.S New Tafo registration center in Abuakwa North in the Eastern Region for example , unauthorised persons prevented some applicants from registering on the basis of non-residence . <p> 7 . Observers reported of acts of intimidation and violence by some persons at a few centers ( 1% ) . For instance , on August 2 , 2020 at the Funeral Grounds registration center , Akanyakrom in Banda in the Bono Region , a group of men entered the registration center and assaulted some registration applicants in the queue , resulting in a temporary suspension of the registration exercise . <p> At the 12 Apostles Church Kormantse registration center in Mfantseman in the Central Region , a man on July 23 , 2020 slapped a party agent who had advised him to use the ' Challenge ' procedure instead of attempting to physically prevent an applicant from registering . <p> On August 8 , 2020 , during the mop-up exercise at the EC office in Takoradi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registration exercise but was driven away by stationed police officers subsequently called in a group of stoutly-built men who claimed to be national security operatives .

At Ayawaso West Wuogon in the Greater Accra Region , about 17 applicants also had their forms filled but could not go through the rest of the registration processes to complete their registration . <p> CODEO observers also reported a few cases where some political party activists and hooligans either physically prevented or attempted to physically prevent some registration applicants from accessing registration centers during the mop-up exercise simply because they claimed they did not know the applicants . Such incidents were reported from the Jomoro constituency in the Western Region , Wa East in Upper West , Nkoranza South in Bono East and Ayawaso West Wuogon in the Greater Accra region . <p> **28;0;TOOLONG <p> CODEO commends the EC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise over the past six weeks . <p> CODEO condemns all acts of intimidation , harassment and use of violence which took place during the exercise . <p> CODEO calls on the Inspector General of Police ( IGP ) and the Ghana Police Service working with the Attorney General ( AG ) to act expeditiously to complete all investigations including the violent incidents in Banda which resulted in the death of one young man , as well as the incident in Awutu Senya East in the Central Region and in Dormaa West in the Bono region . <p> Persons found culpable in various criminal breaches of the law should be prosecuted and sanctioned in accordance with the laws of Ghana .

@@32014240 <h> Letting light into history ( 2 ) - Review of Working with Rawlings <h> My second area of interest is the author 's own personal involvement and contribution to these developments , all the way from Provisional Council ( PMDC ) PNDC through the formation of the National Democratic Congress ( NDC ) , the transition to democracy and beyond . <p> With his undoubted intelligence and frenetic energy , Kwamena did not disappoint Rawlings or Ghana when these resources were required . <p> Even reading this book and following on the many areas of his input into discussions , policy formulation and implementation , as well as his physical presence around the country and the world , makes me tired . <p> There were innumerable committees on which he served or for which he had to find the right persons to nominate , his different ministerial assignments , including serving simultaneously as Minister of Foreign Affairs and Minister of Local Government in a one-year period- these are just astonishing . <p> Most of all , it is the record of his being involved in finding the right people for many important positions that shows that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was in the ring . <p> Revealing <p> Talking of the right people brings me to some of the most revealing episodes in the book . The story about how Prof. Mills was discovered and persuaded to become the Vice-President of Ghana alone is worth a hundred times the price of this book . <p> The same goes for the " discovery " of Dr Kwadwo Afari Gyan to join the Electoral Commission ( EC ) is even more magical . <p> I must say that on both occasions , beer was implicated somewhere and our author played a leading role and it can be said that without his involvement and intervention , history may have taken a different turn . <p> Personality <p> Finally , perhaps the part of the book that engrossed me and kept my nose right into the pages is the personality of Rawlings as he emerges in this book . <p> Perhaps , the best way to describe Ghanaian 's perception of President Rawlings is like the six blind men and the elephant . Everyone has a different way of experiencing the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he touched you . <p> Overall , the Rawlings in this book is a human being -- impulsive , considerate , contradictory , focused and generous . But these are not attributes that come out in single doses . <p> He is all of them at once . Let me illustrate this with an important episode in the book . Prof. Ahwoi tendered in his resignation when he felt that Rawlings has orchestrated a newspaper editorial against him . <p> That same day , Rawlings invited him and his family to take an aerial trip over Ghana 's airspace followed by a sumptuous meal at the castle on their return . The author feels that this was Rawlings 's way of apologising for what could have been a miscalculation . <p> Loaded <p> This is a good book so loaded with events , anecdotes and insights that this review can only scratch the surface . It is a record of many happenings in the PNDC , the NDC governments of Rawlings and Mills . <p> It confirms some theories and hypotheses about some of Rawlings ' relationship with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in office . <p> In reality , the book confirms the rumoured testy and fractious relationship between Rawlings and several people , including President Atta Mills and Capt . Kojo Tsikata . The stuff of whispers has been laid bare . <p> The proverb that you do n't contradict the frog when it reports the death of the crocodile under the river comes to mind . <p> The controversies that have erupted in the past week since the launch of the book centre on the bizarre , such as the alleged squeeze of Mr Bede Ziedeng 's testicles , or on the fact that Rawlings does not emerge as a saint in this book . That is because , by definition he is human . In any case , this is one person 's story . <p> In my view , Working with Rawlings is a well-researched and well-written book . It is neither a partisan project nor an attempt to defend the Rawlings era . It is a sincere effort to tell the story from his vantage point in an honest and candid book . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We need more of such books that reveal the inner workings of our governments and the people and characters that sustain them . <p> Those disparaging the author for his candidness might do better to write their own .

In the state 's 2018 fiscal year , it forgave $79 million in data center taxes , it said . But the breaks paid off as the state reaped $66.8 million over budget in tax revenues from data centers , too , reports Michael Neibauer of the Washington Business Journal . <p> Although Loudoun is one of the richest counties in the nation , the state designated some of the land that Amazon was interested in there as an " opportunity zone .

@@32059230 <h> In the President 's last but one COVID-19 address , he reported the startling finding in a Ghana Health Service ( GHS ) survey that 82 per cent of people in the sample had the ' overall intention to use a mask ' . <p> Regular mask wearing watchers such as the writer of this column challenged the GHS to provide details of the survey because those figures did not match up with what we all see around us . <p> In the 16th address , the President acknowledged that the latest survey report paints a far worse figure than the previous one . <p> The President did not mention the figure in the new survey , but we understand that to be in the 40s range , with that outrageously optimistic . Again , as with all survey reports , the devil is in the details . <p> It appears that the figures being used by officials on mask wearing are way out of variance with what one observes in real life in many parts of the country . <p> In surveys , especially where the subject concerns a law or regulation to which people are expected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to breaking the law . <p> Surveys <p> It appears from the President 's repeated citing of these GHS surveys on masks that the government puts a large store by its own survey reports . <p> Of course , it is important that the government conducts these surveys , but if the result is going to be used as a basis for policy , it has to make sure that they are based on reality . <p> We must be concerned that these figures seem to be out of sync with what we can all see . <p> I spent last Sunday in a part of the Volta Region travelling on the Sogakope-Adidome-Ho Road to Kpetoe . <p> Of course , with this column 's stated concern , I took an extra special interest in masks . The report , as with what I have observed in other parts of the country , is abysmal . There was very little evidence of mask-wearing anywhere , not even in the more urban settings where one would think people would comply with the government directives . <p> The situation is even worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek by jowl . At the scenic Lower Volta Bridge , where women and children sell all kinds of foods to passengers , the vendors who rushed to vehicles as they stopped to pay the road toll , were all maskless as were the Okada riders waiting for passengers at major road intersections . <p> We stopped at Adaklu to admire the majestic Adaklu Mountain and because it was Sunday , saw many people going to church at that time . <p> They were not masked . Perhaps , they would wear their masks at the entrance to the church . <p> The truth is that they wore no masks and there was nothing to suggest that face masks have been accepted as part of the culture in those parts of the country . <p> Concern <p> We must be concerned that the government appears to believe that Ghanaians are wearing masks and bases its policies partly on that assumption , when in reality , we are not complying . In parts of Accra , especially in the posh areas where government people live , people are likely to comply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the situation is as dire as it is in the rural areas . <p> In fact , the attitude one has to confront is that people appear to think that the pandemic is over , if they ever believed it to be real . Maybe , the government 's communication is the victim of its own success . <p> As the President keeps emphasising , we have been spared the worst of the pandemic -- so far . New infections are low and the high recovery rates mean that we have a reducing number of active cases in the country . <p> Many people have taken this good news to mean that the pandemic is over . <p> The President was right to start his last address on this subject and to give a warning that people will be punished if they ignore the directive on face mask . However , as we all know in Ghana and as has become part of our discourse , the problem is with implementation . <p> When it comes to fine laws and regulations beautifully written , Ghana must be the envy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those laws and regulations are implemented , we are the country of zero . <p> We can not expect the President to come on the street to physically enforce our laws . There are agencies that have the mandate to carry out their tasks ; most of the time , they are either unwilling or unable to do their job . <p> Readers of this column would know the repeated references to traffic regulations for motorcycle riders in the country . Basically , they are not enforced so riders are a law unto themselves . I have often wondered why this was the case . <p> Astonishing <p> Three weeks ago , I met a top commander of the traffic police unit in Kumasi where the MTTD had organised a workshop . I engaged the boss on this subject . What he told me was astonishing . <p> The police could not keep up with motorcycle riders breaking the law .

It is incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use technology or any other resource to stop motorcyclists committing traffic offences or worse using their bikes for crime . That is another story . We shall return . <p> Now , back to masks . The country is being returned to normal piecemeal . We are grateful to the President and the government for its leadership in the management of the disease . But the whole thing can unravel if they do not ensure that the effort is sustained . <p> The Accra International Airport has opened and people from overseas are coming into the country again . This is happening at a time when countries in Europe may be going through the so-called second wave . It is expected to get worse in the winter months . <p> We would not have forgotten so soon that the first cases of COVID-19 in Ghana were imported into the country through that same airport . However , the numbers grew and the sad death toll got to where it is because of community spread . <p> Therefore , we ought to recognise that the combination of factors -- second wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and influx of people from Europe -- poses a risk for our wellbeing . <p> The government can not relax now .

@@32067237 <h> Serie A Look to Restore Gambling Sponsors <h> Gambling and Football <p> There is an unmistakable relationship between the beautiful game , and the act of gambling . A relationship so strong and successful one may say that they were meant for each other . It has seeped into football fan culture as well with " the odds " of almost every possible outcome in a game being discussed by fans . Being the world 's biggest sport has made football a prime market for betting companies and the likes to ply their trade , and the coalition has been massively successful for both parties to say the least . So much so that nowadays , it seems that they can not do without the other , such that gambling and football appear inseparable . And it feels absurd when you think of a state in which they are not together . <h> Decreto Dignita <p> The Dignity Decree ( Decreto Dignita ) is a decree that was passed and in full effect since July 2019 , that prohibits gambling ads and sponsorship deals in Italy . This obviously has serious effects on football in the country , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top flight division having at least one sponsorship deal with a betting company . Roma based footballing giants -- SS Lazio , for example have on their shirts , their Marathonbet sponsors . <p> This mandate for this decree was originally birthed when the Lega/5-Star coalition were in office in 2018 , as a way of introducing civil methods of conducting business in Italian society . And with this they made Italy the first European country with a gambling ban , and a strict one at that . The current Prime Minister , Giuseppe Conte , under a coalition between the Democratic Party and the 5-Star party upholds this decree . <p> It was met with " extreme worry " and disagreement from Italian football authorities when it was first proposed in July 2018 . The president of Genoa , Enrico Preziosi , was particularly not happy with the mention of such a law and he labelled it " madness " . The problem with such a decree was obvious -- football in Italy was going to suffer . With estimated losses being charged in hundreds of millions of euros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams in Serie A , and without a doubt , their influence among their footballing peers in Europe . <p> All these pleas of reason however fell on deaf ears as , even though the date for the passing of the new law was pushed from January 2019 , it was eventually passed in July that same year . The only concession being that teams with an already existing partnership with a company from the gambling industry would see out their current contracts . <h> Fightback <p> The effect of the decree has been more than massive as initial estimated figures are now being realised . These losses are being realised by the absence of the revenue that was initially released from gambling advertisements and sponsorship deals . Matters have been made worse by the long break that football has had to go on , and consequent lack of ticket sales which had been another huge source of revenue for Italian football especially in the Lega Serie A. <p> These effects put the league and Italian football in general at a disadvantage to their European neighbours especially . With leagues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for betting companies in Asia and such . And Spain 's LaLiga Santander , is also heavy on betting sponsorship deals . <p> However , it is the recent state of events that have mostly caused the Serie A authorities to seek a restoration of previous legislatures on betting advertisement and sponsorship deals as a means to quell the financial storm that have hit Italian football and sports in general . The idea is to pause the Dignity Decree for a 12-month period . <p> During this period gambling advertisements will return and revenue can be generated for the sustenance of the football association , teams , players , facilities , etc. , until things are normal again . And this would also be beneficial in other sports in the country , not just football . <p> Other heads of sporting associations have not been left out in the fight with several stating to the government the clear and obvious need to at least put the Dignity Decree on pause to serve as an umbrella in this financial rainy period . <p> The chairman of the Olympic Committee in Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an emergency and instead of asking for money , it is appropriate to restart any potential marketing action with the betting companies . I have always been totally against the ban , which weakened our teams and our sports facilities " . <p> Scathing criticism has also come from other areas , like the media agency called AGCOM , who have been against the decree since inception and tagged them " unconstitutional and incompatible " with business laws . <p> Despite all these , the 5-Star authorities have remained adamant in their rigid anti-gambling stance in response to the request from Italian sports authorities . Francesco Silvestri said in parliament : " The 5-Star Movement has always been against gambling , as well as gaming advertising . For us , there is no way to step back from the ban . " <p> However , if the situation is left to move along this direction it would be detrimental for the entire Italian sports sector . And the very businesses and society whose so-called civility is being " protected " will crumble . With this in mind it feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish . <p> When they do succeed in restoring gambling sponsorship and advertisement deals , there will be a fresher feeling to the beautiful game in Italian society .

When we talk of female genital mutilation , it is the women who are doing it ; only a few men are doing it , just because maybe it 's their source of livelihood . <p> ADVERTISEMENT <p> " When we talk of eloping of girls , there are women contractors who talk to these men that at this particular time this girl will be sent to this market at this time , so you people should cross her there .

The essence of this programme is for you to change yourselves here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to also change , " said the CHRAJ Director . <p> As resource persons took questions and contributions from the floor , participants cited financial hardship as a reason some poor victims were not reporting abuses reportedly being meted out to them . They further explained that such poor persons had been having difficulty taking care of just transportation fares on their own to travel from their remote communities to town to lodge complaints with the relevant institutions . Responding to that concern , a Station Officer at the Domestic Violence and Victim Support Unit ( DOVVSU ) headquarters in the region , Detective Inspector ( DI ) Godfrey Quaye , pledged to personally offer financial assistance to any poor person with a genuine abuse-related case but without money to pay his or her transportation fares . <p> " DOVVSU , we do n't collect money .

The project is being implemented by the WOM in six communities in the region in collaboration with the Oxfam International Ghana and the Women in Law and Development in Africa , Ghana ( WiLDAF-Ghana ) with support from the European Union ( EU ) . It is aimed at empowering women , girls and boys to take up positive actions against SGBV . The six communities , according to the officer in charge of the ENOUGH Project , Gifty Abalansah , include Balungu , Bongo-Beo and Vea in the Bongo District and Gundork , Kongo and Logre in the Nabdam District .

@@32166234 <h> Pressure is all of a sudden mounting on Liverpool after Virgil van Dijk injury <p> A cloud of grief seems to have enveloped Anfield since Virgil van Dijk 's devastating knee injury in the Merseyside derby . <p> ' We will wait for him like a good wife is waiting when the husband is in jail , ' was Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp 's typically colourful lament on the Dutchman 's likely absence for the remainder of the season . <p> And while one newspaper 's online book to collect ' messages of support ' for Van Dijk - unsurprisingly mocked by rival fans as a ' book of condolence ' - may have been a touch too far , there 's no doubt his injury is a game-changing moment in this Premier League campaign . <p> It does n't exactly plunge the defending champions into crisis but Klopp will be well aware that it 's the kind of thing that when combined with other unfortunate events can snowball quickly into one . <p> There 's no hiding that Van Dijk 's absence comes as a body blow for a Liverpool defence already showing signs of vulnerability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary parts of a defender 's game perfectly as well as offering leadership from the back that helps the whole team . <p> As Liverpool legend Mark Lawrenson said , Van Dijk is ' irreplaceable . ' He was one of many observers now seriously questioning whether Liverpool have enough to retain their title without him . <p> It will fall to Joel Matip , Joe Gomez and possibly Fabinho to ensure Liverpool 's back line remains watertight enough to challenge for the crown in what is already a hugely unpredictable Premier League season . <p> It led to a tetchy exchange between Klopp and Anfield legend turned Sky pundit Jamie Carragher , who said Liverpool should have ' gone big ' to sign another centre-back in the summer . <p> ' We went into the season with three centre backs plus Fabinho as cover and some youngsters , ' Klopp said . <p> ' It 's hard to have four world-class centre halves . <p> ' If anyone wants to tell us we made a mistake - I think Carragher mentioned already - there are a few reasons why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defended the comments , tweeting : ' Not once this season have I said it was a mistake for Klopp not to buy a centre back for the exact reason he states . ' <p> For Klopp , there 's obviously no good time to lose someone as influential as Van Dijk but it comes with Liverpool looking some way inferior to their imperious best this time last year , dropping early points and already out the Carabao Cup . <p> But abrasive comments directed at pundits - this came after his argument with Roy Keane when the Irishman described Liverpool 's win over Arsenal as a ' sloppy performance ' - are n't going to help . <p> Unexpected defensive frailties emerged during Liverpool 's opening day 4-3 win over Leeds United with Van Dijk culpable for Patrick Bamford 's goal in a moment of miscalculation pundit Carragher described as ' arrogance .

It 's impossible to win every single week , so results like this actually come as a pressure release . <p> Manchester United 's Treble winners were brought down to earth by a 5-0 thrashing at Chelsea in October 1999 , for example , then romped the league by 18 points . <p> Nonetheless , Van Dijk and Gomez played as though they 'd just met and it raised a litany of questions Klopp did n't expect to have posed following a meeting with someone like Villa . <p> Saturday 's Merseyside derby saw a useful point gained given the shock of losing Van Dijk and a very strong Everton side . By rights , Liverpool should have won it in stoppage time but for a dubious offside call . <p> But Klopp will have also come away wondering why Michael Keane was able to outjump Fabinho and Roberto Firmino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against Andy Robertson and Gomez for the second . <p> If this is a foretaste of their defending without Van Dijk then it could be a long , long winter . It 's another concern that simply was n't there a month ago . <p> The last time Liverpool went three games without success was October 2018 , such has been the machine Klopp has turned them into . <p> But with things taking an unexpected turn for the worse , it is n't a great time to be heading to Ajax to open another Champions League campaign . <p> There will be little margin for error in a group alongside the always talented Ajax and a free-scoring Atalanta who almost reached last season 's semi-finals . <p> Get a positive result in Amsterdam on Wednesday night and Klopp can relax a little . It would potentially allow qualification to be secured early and for some squad rotation , especially with Danes Midtjylland up next . <p> But suffering a third consecutive Champions League defeat for the first time since the 2014-15 group stage would only deepen the despondent mood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atletico Madrid last season - as the reigning European champions - still rankles and they 'll be determined to make the perfect start this time . <p> The season started so well but all of a sudden the pressure is mounting on Klopp and Liverpool . <p> The pressure to find another way of winning games in the absence of a player who clearly means so much to them .

In three rooms , without running water , dwelled the entire family : Diego Sr and Tota , Diego Jr , his four elder sisters and three younger siblings . <p> Outside the dirt roads of Villa Fiorito played host to his first football games , but on rainy days they would become rivers of mud -- although the house 's tin roof did little to stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buckets and pots to avoid flooding indoors . <p> At the age of three Diego received his first football as a gift from his uncle , and the pair were soon inseparable . He honed his talents on the dusty roads and empty wastelands of Fiorito , taking on other kids from the neighbourhoods or entertaining himself juggling on his own . <p> That could be a perilous pastime in the barrio , though , as Diego recalled years later . " One day I was chasing a ball , I would have been younger than 10 , and I fell into a septic tank , " he stated in his autobiography . " I was up to my neck in sh*t , but I did n't try to get out : I kept looking for the ball and sank further and further in . <p> " My uncle saved me by wading waist-deep in the tank , almost up to his head , and stretching his hand out to grab mine . <p> " If he had n't done that I would have died in that septic tank ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Caradona ' <p> By the time Maradona 's 10th birthday arrived in October 1970 , his ability with the ball at his feet had already been recognised . <p> Having started out at Estrella Roja , a neighbourhood club run by his father , in 1969 the opportunity arose for the youngster and two close friends from Fiorito to undergo a trial with Primera Division club Argentinos Juniors . <p> After finally convincing Don Diego to let him travel into Buenos Aires for the test , the eight-year-old hopeful took two buses to arrive at Argentinos ' training complex , only to be faced with devastating news : owing to torrential rain , the day 's activities had been cancelled . <p> Rather than send the batch of aspiring footballers back home disappointed , the club 's youth scout Francis Cornejo instead took them to Saavedra Park on the other side of town and set up an impromptu match . " They say that once in a lifetime every man witnesses a miracle , but that most do not realise it , " the late coach stated in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maradona . " I did . " <p> Indeed , such was the young Diego 's assurance with the ball that Cornejo soon became suspicious . " When he controlled a pass in the air with the left and , without letting the ball drop , hit it with the same foot to knock it over the defender 's heads I was in no doubt : he was a dwarf , and a lying dwarf , because that kid could n't be eight years old , " he added . <p> Once the trial was over , the coach demanded Maradona present his identity card to prove he was who he was claiming to be . " ' I do n't have it ' , he answered in a low voice , as if I 'd caught him skipping school . My mother has it back home ' . <p> " I made him look into my eyes and asked him again , ' are you sure you were born in 1960 ? ' " Cornejo continued . " ' Yes , sir ' , he replied ... If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my team , a player who could make the difference . But if he was older we could n't afford to lose him either . " <p> The mystery over Maradona 's age was eventually resolved and , from 1971 onwards , he entered Argentinos ' Cebollitas youth division . That Diego-inspired side soon became the stuff of legend , winning , according to the man himself and his coach , 136 straight games between 1973-74 while winning the national league at Novena ( Under-14 ) level . <p> His prodigious abilities also caught the eye of the Argentine press . On September 28 , 1971 the 10-year-old earned a brief column in Clarin after wowing the Argentinos crowd during the half-time break of a first-team match with his tricks . At that point , though , there seemed to be some confusion over the wonderkid 's true identity . <p> " He is left-footed , but he can use his right . Diego Caradona , aged 10 , earned applause at half-time in Argentinos Juniors vs Independiente , showing off his rare ability for ' keep-ups ' with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the article , titled " Bearing and class of a superstar , " explained . <p> " He does n't look like a modern kid , but he is , and with that typically Argentine love for the ball our football will never stop feeding off great players . " <h> Argentina 's most wanted <p> It did not take long for the young ' Caradona ' to make a ( real ) name for himself . <p> Within five years of that first appearance for Argentinos and still 10 days short of his 16th birthday Diego made his first-team debut off the bench in a 1-0 defeat to Talleres . With his first touch of the ball he nutmegged his marker ; he would later say of that day , despite the result , " I touched heaven with my own hands . " <p> By 1980 and his 20th birthday , Maradona had already become a fixture in the Argentinos team , racking up more than 150 appearances and 100 goals for La Paternal side to become one of the highest-rated players in Argentine football . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that point his experience in the Albiceleste had been rather bittersweet . Two years earlier he had been left in tears by coach Cesar Menotti due to his last-minute exclusion from the nation 's ultimately triumphant World Cup bid on home soil , only to bounce back in 1979 by leading the Under-20s team to glory in Japan . <p> Maradona finished 1980 as top scorer in both the Metropolitano and Nacional championships , making him the first and only player in Argentine football history to take that crown in five different competitions . By the end of the year the question was not whether he would leave Argentinos , but where his next destination would lie . <p> After the 1978 World Cup , Sheffield United came close to sealing one of the most curious sensational transfers in football history , only for the deal to collapse following a disagreement over agents ' fees . <p> Back in Buenos Aires , meanwhile , the contest boiled down to a straight fight between Superclasico giants River Plate and Boca Juniors . <p> River 's transfer offer and contract terms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were in the midst of a financial crisis ; Diego , though , put his foot down and insisted he would only move to the Bombonera . <p> Boca , then , eventually got their man , sealing a devilishly complex 18-month loan deal with Argentinos -- who were to receive US$2.5 million , six Xeneize players and the right to transfer their debts with the Argentine FA onto the club 's balance sheet -- and Maradona completed his move on February 1981 . <p> The enormous fees eventually proved impossible for Boca to fulfil , and by the time the 1982 World Cup came along Diego had been sent back to La Paternal due to breach of contract , although given that the No.10 had already agreed a transfer to Barcelona he never again represented his boyhood club . <p> Over at River , meanwhile , a mutual loathing grew between player and snubbed club which survives to this day . <h> The only way is down <p> When Maradona blew out the candles on his 30th birthday cake he did so as the undisputed king of world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifting the Scudetto in 1986-87 and 1989-90 , had led the south of Italy to accept him as one of their own , even leading to split loyalties at the 1990 World Cup . <p> It may have been the Mexico finals in 1986 , which included the infamous ' Hand of God ' and ' Goal of the Century ' strikes against England and a series of virtuoso performances aside , that made the entire world sit up and applaud Maradona 's talents ; but in Italy a different facet of his personality came through : his immense bravery and ability to play through the pain . <p> A week before the action kicked off in 1990 , Diego had been felled by two over-zealous training ground challenges . <p> The first ripped off the entire nail of his left big toe ; the second caused considerable damage to the left ankle that had been shattered by the ' Butcher of Bilbao ' , Andoni Goikoetxea during his time at Barcelona , causing the joint to swell to the size of an apple . <p> " I have almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Maradona confirmed . " I do n't know how my ankle held up . <p> " I met several times with the doctor and he said I could n't keep playing in that state . But I was n't about to leave the guys . They proved to me in every game they were giving everything and as captain I was n't going to drop out . " <p> At 30 , Maradona should have been entering his peak on the pitch and , after an understandably slow start to the 1990-91 Serie A season given the ravages inflicted on his body that summer , he soon found his rhythm again . <p> On October 28 , 1990 he received an early birthday present as Napoli battled past Fiorentina 1-0 at a packed San Paolo , young defender Ciro Ferrara netting the only goal of the game . <p> Four months later , however , disaster struck . Diego was chosen for post-match drug testing following his side 's victory over Bari and tested positive for cocaine . <p> The star fled back to Buenos Aires , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undergo rehabilitation , while the Italian FA handed down a ban of 15 months from footballing activities . <h> The lost decade <p> That failed drugs test at San Paolo marked the beginning of a dizzying , bewildering period in Maradona 's life in which the wayward star appeared to spiral out of control . <p> Upon completing his ban he returned to the field in underwhelming spells at Sevilla and Newell 's Old Boys and earned a call-up to the Argentina squad , where early signs that he may have recovered the magic were destroyed during the 1994 World Cup when a second doping test , this time for a banned diuretic , earned him another suspension and effectively ended his career at the highest level . <p> From there he turned his hand to coaching in short , chaotic stints with Argentine sides Deportivo Mandiyu and Racing Club before finally ending his playing days back at the Bombonera , overweight and a shadow of his former self but still capable of his old wizardry when the mood struck him . <p> On October 25 , 1997 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injunction suspending yet another doping ban , he played his final professional match in Boca 's Superclasico victory over River . <p> The nadir for Maradona arrived at the start of 2000 when he was hospitalised while holidaying in exclusive Uruguayan beach resort Punta del Este . Doctor Jorge Romero later described to Infobae the call he received from the star 's long-time agent and nocturnal partner-in-crime Guillermo Coppola , who told the medic : " I am here with Diego Maradona , who has been sleeping for two days . We can not get him to wake up . " <p> " If he has been sleeping for two days , " Romero replied , " he is n't sleeping . He is in a coma . " <p> Close to death , Maradona was treated for hypertension and arrhythmia , and by the end of January had travelled to Cuba in order to enter an extensive rehabilitation program and treat his ongoing addiction problems . <p> Diego stayed in Cuba on and off for almost four years , becoming an honoured guest of then-president Fidel Castro and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaking of his addiction years later , Maradona credited his eldest daughter with finally helping him to beat the demons . " Nobody should hang a medal off their chest , it was Dalma who got me off them , " he told TyC Sports , while also recalling his collapse in Punta del Este . <p> " I hit rock-bottom in the coma . I remember I was in something like black star and hooks were being thrown at me , I held my hand out and could n't get out . And I remained in the coma . " <p> Four years after hanging up his boots , in November 2001 aged 41 Maradona was finally able to hold his farewell match , a star-studded affair at the Bombonera which included the likes of Marcelo Bielsa , Eric Cantona , Davor Suker , Javier Zanetti and Juan Sebastian Veron . <p> Back in Cuba , meanwhile , he left a different kind of legacy : in 2019 the star 's attorney Matias Morla revealed that he had fathered three children on the island , taking the total number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa by storm <p> Following his brush with death , Maradona continued to suffer health troubles , memorably ballooning in weight before undergoing gastric bypass surgery in Colombia which helped him shed more than 50 kilograms in a matter of months . <p> He also received his break as a television presenter , fronting a talk show in Argentina titled La Noche de 10 ( A night with No.10 ) . Pele , Mike Tyson and Fidel Castro were among Diego 's star guests on the show , as was Maradona himself in an unforgettably bizarre mocked-up interview . <p> But despite this flirtation with showbiz he remained close to the football world , culminating in his shock appointment as Argentina coach in 2008 through to the end of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa , on the eve of his 50th birthday . <p> Maradona 's time at the Albiceleste helm , though , will ultimately be remembered for his off-pitch antics more than his side 's prowess on it . <p> He dived clean across the soaked Monumental pitch to celebrate Martin Palermo 's crucial World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journalists to " suck it and keep sucking " in his post-match press conference . <p> At the finals themselves , Maradona drew attention for his ever-quirky statements to press and curious team selections , famously picking Ariel Garce in his squad after an alleged dream where he glimpsed the Colon defender with his hands on the trophy . <p> The team itself , with stars such as Lionel Messi , Carlos Tevez , Gonzalo Higuain , Sergio Aguero , Maxi Rodriguez and Juan Sebastian Veron , was packed with attacking potency but lacked balance across the pitch , with Newcastle midfielder Jonas Gutierrez and Velez Sarsfield youngster Nicolas Otamendi used as makeshift right-backs in the absence of a real option in the position . <p> Argentina cruised to the quarters , scoring 10 goals in four games , but were brought swiftly down to earth by Germany . <p> Maradona had exhorted his troops to " not believe the bullsh*t " when it came to the Europeans , but they instead received a footballing lesson as Joachim Low 's men ran out easy 4-0 winners . <p> The Albiceleste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fans filing out to greet them at the airport ; although few were subsequently surprised when , following a brief pretence of keeping him on in the role , AFA strongman Julio Grondona promptly engineered Maradona 's resignation due to a supposed conflict over his backroom staff . <h> Diego at 60 : what does the future hold ? <p> Just as few could have imagined back in 2000 that the ailing Diego would a decade later be leading Argentina once more into a World Cup , 10 years ago it would have taken a brave man to predict the 60-year-old gearing up for the coming Primera Division season in his home nation . <p> Gimnasia kick off a shortened , Covid-affected version of the Argentine top-flight on their coach 's birthday at home to Patronato , and if the events of the last 12 months are anything to go by , Maradona is set for a lavish celebration , even if the stands in La Plata remain silent due to the pandemic . <p> Throughout the 2019-20 season , battling a seemingly doomed relegation battle and beset with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he was feted by every side Gimnasia visited , proof of his unique standing as Argentine football 's biggest idol . <p> After leaving the Argentina helm he cut a nomadic path through world football , appearing on the bench at Emirati outfits Al Wasl and Al Fujairah , taking over the presidency for Belarus ' Dinamo Brest and then sending Mexican football into raptures at the helm of Dorados , falling just short of promotion in his single term with the Sinaloa side . <p> It has been a long , and not always smooth journey for Maradona from Villa Fiorito 60 years ago to his current home in La Plata . <p> One of the greatest footballers the world has ever seen , he has also suffered countless setbacks and scandals over the years which have threatened to tarnish his legacy for good . <p> As Maradona himself stated , however , the ball can not be tainted .

It is the bedrock of innovation and inventiveness . At all points in time , what makes a child or an adult unique in all spheres of life is their ability to create something out of anything within their reach . <p> That is to say that everything that one does should be given a touch of creativity , uniqueness , value and life . For children to develop their capabilities and hone their creative ability , it is required that they are offered an environment and opportunities that help them , right from the beginning , to achieve all these skills and capabilities . <p> The act of family reading which was advocated by Ghana Book Development Council ( GBDC ) , an Agency under Ministry of Education , is to ensure that school children do not only cultivate the habit of reading but also to ensure that they embrace and take advantage of all the benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> From time immemorial , the world has yearned for school children and adult workers who show creativity and innovation in everything that they do . For instance , school children are expected to go beyond what they read from books and taught in school , when answering questions or giving account of what they have experienced in the learning curve . <p> That is to say , school children are discouraged from engaging in rote learning , where they memorize what they have read or have been taught leading to regurgitating such information during examination . Instead , school children are expected to add value to the lessons they have received by being innovative and productive in future outcomes . <p> In the same way , it is expected that adult workers show similar traits in the world of work . Creativity is required in the management of resources -- both financial and material . Good communcacation and effective leadership also require creativity . These are the ingredients required in today 's world to overcome the emerging challenges , and family reading is one of the means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenges of today 's world . <p> The concept of Family Reading , as has been advocated , is the conscious effort by parents and guardians to create an enabling environment for parents and children to read together , share and discuss stories . It is also an avenue for parents and guardians to help children to glean the benefits of reading from stories read , shared and discussed by the whole family . <p> The practice is for the elderly ones to read to the hearing of the children . This is a practice which children all over the world enjoy so much . One of the positive sides of this practice is for parents and guardians to take time to explain the content of reading books to children . <p> It also gives parents the opportunity to engage and interact with their wards , leading to offering advice and explanations , where and when necessary , as the reading activity goes on . Children get to be creative and interactive at this point , even as they try to answer questions , as well as ask questions that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their brains to answer intriguing questions that come out during family reading and story sharing periods . In doing so , children are offered the opportunity to develop and hone their creative abilities and skills . <p> Reading books and stories that are narrated for listening are all carefully woven or put together to achieve a desirable effect . A lot is put in to sustain the interest of readers and listeners , especially for books written for use by children . A lot is also put in to ensure that readers and listeners are able to assimilate the content of the stories . All stories have plots , i.e. , the sequence of events that took place in the story . In effect , every story read or told has a beginning , middle and an end . In a more advance explanation of plot , a story begins with introduction ( exposition ) , then it gets to the Rising Action ( conflict that builds between or among characters ) , then to Climax ( conflict at peak ) , to Falling Action ( when reader or listener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflict ) and finally the Denoument ( Resolution ) , that is , the resolution of the conflict . Exposing children to such creative structures at the early stage in life help them to be creative and analytical . And this goes a long way to help them translate this skill into other life 's endeavours . <p> In conclusion , society has a big role to ensure that the expectation of ensuring creativity in all life 's endeavours are met . Parents and guardians are expected to create at home an environment that engineers creativity . This can be achieved by making time to read and share stories with kids . In doing so , parents and guardians give children the opportunity to hone their skills in critical thinking , exercising their brains , developing communication skills and feeding their brains and hearts with good thoughts . <p> By <p> Daniel Ofosu-Asamoah <p> Literacy Promotion Manager <p> Ghana Book Development Council <p> Disclaimer : " The views/contents expressed in this article are the sole responsibility of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect those of Modern Ghana .
