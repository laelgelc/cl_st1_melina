@@33713232 <p> On paper , there is n't anything especially noteworthy about a 1-0 home win for Mexico over Panama on Wednesday night . In every World Cup qualifying match at home against the Central Americans ( in 2000 , 2005 , 2013 , 2017 and now 2022 ) , El Tri have always walked away with a victory . <p> But in a near-empty Estadio Azteca , three points against Panama proved to be the most important so far in the tenure of Mexico men 's national team manager Gerardo " Tata " Martino . <p> Losses to the United States and Canada in November 's Octagonal qualifiers , along with bitter losses in the Gold Cup and Nations League finals to the U.S. in 2021 , meant Martino had no room for mistakes . Before the start of the latest international break , FMF president Yon de Luisa gave his support to El Tri 's coach but " no guarantees " about his future . Seven points were laid out as the goal that would make the FMF content in the three-game run . <p> A positive start to the break was earned with a 2-1 away win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dismal 0-0 draw with Costa Rica at the Azteca on Sunday ultimately brought Martino back to square one . Already in a tenuous position at third in the qualifying table , a loss to Panama would have meant a move down to fourth place in the table and out of a direct spot for the World Cup . <p> And for almost the entirety of Wednesday 's match , that appeared to be a possibility . <p> Panama were the better side in the early stages of the match . Led by manager Thomas Christiansen , Los Canaleros did n't show an ounce of fear as they pushed forward and won several midfield duels against an uncoordinated Mexico . <p> Things improved after halftime for a more energetic El Tri , but a goal continued to elude them . A correct call from VAR -- which highlighted a pass from Hirving " Chucky " Lozano from outside of the endline --- ruled out what first appeared to be a goal for Raul Jimenez in the 49th minute . By the 66th minute , things then began to become more worrisome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an injury , confirmed on Thursday to be a dislocated shoulder . <p> Reinforcements were brought off the bench by Martino , more attacking pressure followed , and yet still no goal -- that is , until a golden opportunity when substitute Diego Lainez won a penalty in the 78th minute . <p> Jimenez strolled over to the spot with an opportunity to repeat history . <p> Back in 2013 , the then up-and-coming Club America product scored a dramatic late game-winner against Panama in a CONCACAF qualifier at the Azteca . Panama goalkeeper Luis Mejia was on the bench in that game , and a little over six years later , he had a chance to deny Jimenez another similar chance of glory in Wednesday 's defining moment . <p> Unfazed by the occasion and with the Club America crest emblazoned in the stands in front of him , the Wolverhampton Wanderers star placed the ball right past Mejia in the 80th minute . <p> With the lone goal , Jimenez not only significantly helped Mexico 's chances at qualifying for Qatar 2022 , but also probably saved Martino @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said a relieved Martino after the match . " It brings us closer to a new World Cup . " <p> A deserved victory , but much work is left to be done . For Mexico , qualifying for the World Cup is always more of an expectation than an ambition in the CONCACAF region . <p> And while they are likely to earn that invitation for Qatar in the final three-game round of Octagonal qualifiers in March , it is imperative for Martino to fine-tune his process that had one too many close calls in recent matches . <p> " What we need to recover is our football , so we can have some aspirations . Both in March 's FIFA date and eventually what may come in the rest of the year , " Martino said in the post-game newconference . <p> With the likes of Raul Jimenez , Mexico is way too talented to be struggling this far into World Cup qualifying .

Mexico had chances , and 58 total shots through three games to prove it , but only two goals off open play and one off a penalty . <p> A healthy Jimenez , who was only cleared to start in the last match of the window , would probably resolve this , but behind him as the backup No. 9 ?

We need to understand why we have succeeded as a party , but we also need to understand why we have to succeed again tomorrow and decide on the important changes and new hope we can bring to the people of Ghana . This is the only way to keep our tradition going . <p> There is one thing I want to make clear to the followers of this great tradition . We have won four general elections not only because the people of Ghana distrusted the bad politics of our opponents . We have been winning because we have always presented convincing alternatives . Our policies have produced good results for Ghanaians and the world is watching . <p> There are good signs that we are succeeding , but signs alone will not do it . Neither will good policies alone nor the charismatic leadership of one person get us to where we want to take Ghana . Well , come to think of it , it will not be such a bad idea if the visionary leadership I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more than ever , we have to open greater avenues of change to the advantage of the people of Ghana .

The people of Ghana have kept faith in us all these years . We need to reward their faith with good progress and good development . We need to raise the stakes of our present agenda , but we also need to change the pace . <p> You and I know that our vision and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of economic policy and manifesto promises . We need to demonstrate that we mean what we say and we say what we mean . This is how to get Ghanaians to think what we are thinking . <p> What do people in politics think ? Well , I can tell you what I think , because I have been in politics for some time now , and I think like a retail politician . I have been with this tradition for long enough , and I have always been in our stream of thoughts . I have interacted with the good people of Ghana well enough to know what they are also thinking . <p> Everywhere I go in the country , I resist the temptation of listening to only the good things I want to hear about our great party and our effective policies . I seek to delve into the inner recesses of the thinking of the average Ghanaian , and I can tell you that Ghanaians are thinking what we are thinking . But they want something more . People want to see a leader who will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives count for more than anything else . <p> People want to see a leader who knows how to put a decisive finger on their everyday instincts , so they can feel what they feel . People want to see a leader who talks like a human being , not messianic policy wonks who prophesy above their heads . This is what my brand of politics is all about . This is what I stand for . <p> The kind of politics I do n't believe in is the one that simply spreads money to win trust . That is dangerous for the health of Ghana 's democracy and our rich tradition . I believe in earning trust . Everywhere I have served in a leadership capacity , both home and abroad , my top priority has been how to look into the hearts and minds of the people I lead . That is the responsibility of those who seek to lead . Those who seek to lead must in turn open their hearts and minds to the people . It is a partnership that can not be bought with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread money , I spread the vision and the ideas needed to make money . I doff off my hat to the foot soldiers of our great party . Those working so hard in the various constituencies . Those making great sacrifices for the good of this party . <p> They know how far money can go , and they know how far great ideas can get us . And I am only happy that they are the ones who are going to decide on who leads our party to win the next election . <p> I do n't have a naked ambition to be president . Well , maybe , it would n't be a bad thing if that is the only way you could see the true picture of the passion and the determination I have to serve Ghana . I am privileged to belong to the NPP . I am proud to live for it . Come with me.

@@94463232 <h> When Susan Wamaitha started feeling sick a year ago , she thought it was the side effects of a contraceptive pill she had started taking a few months earlier -- but it turned out that she was eight weeks pregnant . <p> The 32 year old is now a mother of three children . Unbeknown to her , the pill that she began using in June 2021 was banned in Kenya . <p> Its street name in Kenya is " Sofia " but it is manufactured in China and all the details about the product on the packaging are only written in Chinese . <p> A translation of the first line says it contains " Levonorgestrel Fast Estradiol Tablets " . The pill is a " long-acting oral contraceptive " , according to the second line . Then there is information about the manufacturer on the third : " Zizhu Pharmaceutical Co Ltd " . <p> The sale of the pill was prohibited by Kenya 's authorities 10 years ago because of high levels of levonorgestrel -- more than 40 times the recommended levels . <p> Levonorgestrel is a hormonal medication used in a number of birth control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full lab results about its findings , but said children conceived after the pill failed were found to have developed early puberty . <p> Headaches and nausea <p> " I did not know it was banned . Many of my friends were using it and had no side effects , " Ms Wamaitha told the BBC . <p> Like many other Kenyan women , she was attracted to the pill by its affordability and the convenience of taking it only once a month . <p> Women tend to buy the Sofia tablet each month -- most suppliers will not sell it in bulk . Each pill costs between 300 Kenyan shillings ( $2.50 ; ? 2.20 ) and 400 Kenyan shillings . <p> The pills are often imported illegally from neighbouring countries <p> Other family planning methods available in the country include the daily contraceptive pill . A month 's supply costs about $1.70 from government hospitals but their stock is not always guaranteed so women then have to buy it from pharmacies for considerably more . <p> This makes the hormonal implant that lasts three months , offered at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various intrauterine devices , like coils , that last several years and cost up to $9 , more common alternatives . <p> Condoms are offered for free in public offices and toilets but sometimes run out , though they can be bought in shops . <p> " Because I had a non-hormonal copper T-shaped coil that was giving me back pains , I decided to remove it and use the pill , " Ms Wamaitha told the BBC . <p> She was also impressed that her friends who recommended Sofia had not gained any weight -- a key consideration for her as she says she struggles with keeping the pounds off . <p> However , right from the beginning she did not feel great on it -- though she thought it would just take time for her body to get used to the new medication as she had to take two pills initially followed by one a month . <p> " I started having headaches and nausea . The first month I missed my period , " Ms Wamaitha said . <p> But she did not worry as she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it skipped again in the third month that she began to get concerned . <p> Her husband then started researching the contraceptive pill and that is when he found out it had been banned . <p> " We started panicking about using a banned pill and when I realised I was pregnant I was worried about the effects it may have on my baby , " she said . <p> They now have a healthy three-month-old girl , but the couple are upset by the lack of information and possible implications for their daughter as she grows up . <p> ' One size does not fit all ' <p> Only 50% of women in sub-Saharan Africa in need of modern contraceptive methods have access to them , according to the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . <p> In Kenya , contraception tends to be discussed in hushed tones -- mostly because of cultural and religious beliefs in what is a patriarchal society . <p> Some men do not allow their wives to use contraceptives while some religious sects are against it . The Kavonokya Sect in eastern Kenya , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bible only recommends prayer as an intervention . <p> For population and development expert Dr Josephine Kibaru , a grassroots approach would be best to gain acceptance for modern family planning methods . <p> " We need community health volunteers to be more empowered with information because a woman is likely to trust a neighbour and friend more than a healthcare worker who has been posted at the dispensary , " Dr Kibaru told the BBC . <p> She says there is a chasm of ignorance about the birth control methods available , along with many myths and misconceptions that need to be dispelled . <p> A combination of both is probably what is required as gynaecologist Brigid Monda says women should consult healthcare providers to be able to find a family planning method that works for them . <p> " One size does not fit all , " she told the BBC . <p> Yet some women have also been forced to mix different contraceptive methods because of a lack of consistent supply at dispensaries located in rural areas . <p> Sofia remains easily available despite its ban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banned is down to poor public health messaging , according to Dr Kibaru . <p> " Using the media alone is not enough . Intentional public messaging at grassroots level is important to ensure the masses understand well why a drug has been banned , " she says . <p> Sold to trusted customers <p> Pharmacists do know it is banned -- another warning was issued by the health ministry last month -- yet they still sell the pill because of demand . <p> It is not on display , but sold under the counter to trusted customers who come in to buy it each month . <p> The BBC visited several pharmacies in the capital , Nairobi , to make inquiries about Sofia -- most said the drug was not for sale . <p> One seller -- who spoke on condition of anonymity -- explained that it was available , just not on display , and pharmacies were able to buy it from suppliers who brought it in from neighbouring countries . <p> Earlier this month , a Pharmacy and Poisons Board ( PPB ) official told Kenya 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border . <p> Ms Wamaitha says she actually bought her pills from a friend who gets them in bulk from one of these suppliers . <p> She says this friend and others knew the pill was banned when they recommended it to her . <p> Her pregnancy has not persuaded them to stop using it -- nor do any of the complaints on the various Facebook groups for Kenyan mothers . <p> On at least three of these forums there have been discussions about Sofia , where several women taking it said they had fallen pregnant . <p> This has convinced Ms Wamaitha to keep on urging her friends and other women to consider a different form of birth control . <p> " I just know that the mention of that Sofia pill makes me get chills on my body . I do n't know what family planning method I will use to prevent a fourth pregnancy , but I 'm done , done with that pill . " <p> BBC <p> Got something to say about this story ?
