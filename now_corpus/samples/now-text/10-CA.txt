@@1363235 <h> Gameday : Raptors vs Heat -- Jan 27 <p> The battle for fifth . Currently the Raptors stand one game back in the loss column and in 10 games will be at least a couple games ahead of the Heat . See , while the Raptors come into a relatively easy stretch of games , the Heat pay visits to Chicago , Cleveland , Boston and Atlanta . The fifth seed hardly means much at this point , right now getting there would mean playing Orlando instead of Atlanta on the road which is n't a hair 's breadth worth of difference . So what 's the fuss about ? Nothing much , it 's mid-season and you find reasons to motivate yourself and this happens to be one of them . A win against Miami is n't exactly a feather in a cap , but it would continue to signal the resurgence of the Raptors . <p> We covered the talk out of practice yesterday and even contemplated who we should start instead of DeRozan , who is out for this game after tweaking an ankle . Triano hinted at giving Sonny Weems major time after his DNPCD against the Lakers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likelihood , it 's going to be the veteran Antoine Wright who figures to have the experience advantage over Weems which should come into play when guarding a player of Wade 's caliber . <p> Miami , Toronto , Charlotte and Chicago occupy the 5-8 spots with only 1 1/2 games separating 5th from 8th as Milwaukee sits 3 games back of the 8th spot . I suppose every game means something but what would really mean something is one of these teams got close to the 4th spot and home-court advantage -- Orlando sits 5 1/2 games clear of Miami for that . In a battle of 2010 free-agents , Wade lost to Lebron on Monday after having it stolen late by Lebron . The Raptors are 6-4 in their last 10 and the Heat are 5-5 in the same stretch . Even though neither team is tearing it up , the talk around the clubhouses has been positive since both teams have played very tough schedules . Miami has played the 2nd toughest schedule so far while Toronto is at 3rd and projected for a whopping 51 wins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the schedule is behind us , the team has a great chance to sore and rise in the standings . <p> Last time we played the Heat , Michael Beasley and Bosh ate each other for dinner . Beasley 's ability to nail the jumper coupled with his explosiveness gave Bosh a lot of trouble and his play was the decisive factor in Miami 's win . Bosh was conceding Beasley the jumper and he kept hitting it over and over again , you hope that since the trust factor on the team has increased , he 'll be able to check him tight and rely on the interior rotations to provide help on Beasley . Dorell Wright had 16 points in that game and went to the rim too easily too often , Belinelli and Weems will get the assignment on him . The former had an 0-7 night and the latter played sparingly , scoring a few meaningless buckets . <p> DeRozan 's injury might benefit Weems the most , he 's fallen a little out of favor with the coach as Belinelli 's heated up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was unavailable against Cleveland and has gotten a run of 9 , 0 , 6 , 4 , and 0 minutes of late . His effectiveness in the open floor ca n't be questioned , but when the game slows down his success becomes dependent on his mid-range jumper and that 's still a work in progress , although his shot-mechanics are excellent . <p> We also got killed on the boards last time , the Heat were +13 on the glass , +8 in second-chance points and +22 in the paint . Their bench had a 24-11 edge in rebounds and a 45-31 points advantage , safe to say that 's where the game was lost . We need to punish Miami where they 're weak -- at center with Jermaine O'Neal and at PG with Rafer Alston . Calderon and Jack should be able to get whatever they want against Alston , who has usurped Chalmers as the starting PG . ( BTW , where 's Rafer 's ACC night ? ) . I do n't know how they determine who 's playing what position , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his time at the off-guard considering just how much he handles the ball . <p> The Raptors are a 3.5 point favorites and with us being 9-1 in our last 10 games at home , you have to like our chances .

@@1368232 <h> ROM 's Living Gallery Gives Grim Warning <p> When you visit a museum you expect to see collections of items well past their prime : mummified corpses from the tombs of Egyptian rulers , dinosaur teeth that ripped prey to shreds millions of years ago , a gaping hole in the back of a dusty skull left over from the Battle of Thermopylae -- relics of things that were once alive but are now most vibrant in our imaginations and memories . The " Life In Crisis : Schad Gallery of Biodiversity " exhibition at the Royal Ontario Museum , however , teems with life , though it also warns that much of this life may not be around for long . Opened last May , the ten thousand-square-foot interactive gallery takes a look at the wide variety of species on Earth , featuring more than two thousand mounted and living specimens ( including a leaf-cutter ant colony , and an aquarium of live tropical fish and invertebrates indigenous to coral reefs ) from seven different ecosystems around the world . <p> A lion lounges on the savannah . <p> " We 've got three themes : Life is diverse , life is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Douglas Currie , senior curator of entomology at the museum .

" <p> But the raids also swept up Kenyan citizens , who had never visited the country of their ancestry , and Somalis with visas and citizenship from Canada , the United States or European countries . <p> Kenyan Mohammed Ibrahim was near one of Eastleigh 's mosques when police arrived and stood his ground while others fled . When the officer demanded proof of his citizenship , Ibrahim could tell from the constable 's accented English that his native tongue was Luo , a dialect from western Kenya . <p> Ibrahim , 30 , was one of the few who escaped the dragnet .

Kenya has also become a key transit point for foreign fighters lured by Internet propaganda to join the Shabab . The group 's prized Western recruits are difficult to detect in Kenya , as they usually enter the country legally as visitors , then slip across the largely unguarded border into Somalia . <p> Five young Toronto men disappeared last fall after coming to Nairobi and are believed now to be among al Shabab recruits .

Abdullah said the group is keen to attract followers from the West because they elevate the status of the network from a local fight to part of a greater global struggle . <p> He said a fighter by the name of Idris Mohamud Barkhadleh , or " Abu Wajir , " acts as a recruiter for foreigners . Abu Wajir is Kenyan , of Somali heritage , and fluent in English , Swahili and Somali .

The U.S. convert to Islam ( whose real name is Omar Hammami and was raised Baptist ) lived for a year in Toronto in 2004 , where he reportedly ingratiated himself in city 's large Somali community . His YouTube videos calling for foreign fighters are widely circulated . <p> The trend of Western recruits was first noted in Minneapolis , Minn. , after at least 20 young men of Somali heritage disappeared in the last couple of years .

Although the border is closed , except to refugees , there are gaps . <p> Ibrahim , who escaped being scooped up in the raid here last month , says he saw the Shabab 's influence when he attended a Dec. 27 wedding near the Bula Hawa border crossing .

" It would be very unfortunate , " said Darwitz , a forward . " This is all we have . This is our NHL , this is our Stanley Cup playoffs -- two weeks of us getting attention . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran Angela Ruggiero . " You ca n't expect whole nations to adopt a sport over night . " She noted the U.S. had just 5,000 registered women 's hockey players in 1990 , and has 60,000 today . Other countries could see a similar leap if national federations continue to support the sport . ( China , with more than 650 million women , has fewer than 500 registered female hockey players ; Slovakia has fewer than 300 . ) <p> " Hopefully , there can be other countries that understand they have to put resources in their programs , said Canada 's Caroline Ouelette . <p> " We have a $250,000 budget -- Canada has $3.5-million , " Swiss captain Kathrin Lehmann told Maclean 's after the game . Canada has " 80,000 skaters -- we have 800 . " <p> Chinese coach Hanna Saintula , a Finn who communicates with his Chinese players in what he calls " basic hockey English , " said he figures it will take at least two years for China to compete against the U.S. and two-time gold-medalist , Canada , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ score of 127-19 . <p> So why do Canada and the U.S. keep running up the score ? " The goal differential is secondary , " says Davidson . " It 's more about playing your best . We did n't come here to put on a second-class show . We came to win five hockey games . " <p> " These games are prepping us to play a full 60 minutes , " added Canada 's Cherie Piper . " You ca n't take these games for granted . " <p> Do you watch World Juniors ? DO you watch other sports where they are just learning ? It takes time to get there and right now womens hockey is growing to be very big now . So give them a break and enjoy in the fact they are getting some of the spot light because I enjoy waitching it . <p> I agree , let 's give it time , and while I do not enjoy it until it gets to Canada USA , sorry , let me put it this way , I can only enjoy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other team to score , but in the end , that 's what this whole article is about is n't it ? We 're rooting for the growth of the sport until it get 's to the level of mens hockey , where its whoever has the hottest goalie and the timeliest goal wins all . If we do n't put the sport on International display , it never gets the attention needed to inspire young girls , who in other countries never get to see a team like Canada perform , set them to dreaming of being the next Hayley Wickenheiser for the Chinese team . We better enjoy it while we can . When 350 000 000 women set their mind to a task like the Chinese seem intent to do , we might just lose our hold on that supremacy . It 's a ways off , but mark my words . <p> So ..... nobody forced you to go ..... would you be more happy if the Canadian and US team only put in half the effort because they felt sorry for the other team ...... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pong or proper name is table tennis our women would be in the same shoe the Chinese women are now in hockey ..... they would clean the floor with our women , , , , but would we want to to put only half the effort ...... anything less then a hundred percent at this world level of competition would be considered an insult . Ken <p> I think it safe to say were the shoe on the other foot they would accomdate Canada in the same fashion . Not terribly mature but I think you pummel them while you can . Fun wo n't last for long . The numbers are not in our favor . <p> The fact is like any other the Chinese are a proud people ; letting up is likely only deeper insult . Call it the price of admission . <p> the fact that someone would even suggest to take woman 's hockey out of the Olympics is outrageous . these women both Canadian and American have showed that its not only the men that can play and give a show that 's worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are out there and maybe there should be a mercy rule but maybe the other countries need to spend more time with there woman 's hockey program . even though the scores have been crazy i commend all of the women from the other countries for showing all of us that anything is possible . taking something away that these women love to do while either winning or losing would be a huge step back in time where women had to fight for rights . being a man and watching women come so far in sports would be a huge mistake ... <p> how can they even suggest getting rid of women 's olympic hockey ? who cares that it 's lopsided right now . even if other countries are getting creamed by Canada and the U.S. , they are getting the opportunity to learn and play with the best . they 'll get there eventually . you would n't see the same suggestion in men 's hockey . it 's insulting . <p> How can they even suggest such a thing ? Are we getting rid of olympic hockey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the european teams ? Should we get rid of bobsled because it 's not dominated by the jamaicans ? ? ? ? <p> The game was a joke i will admit , but in a tournament like this goals count as a tie breaker so it is beneficial to run up score as much as possible . Slovakia also cant complain about Canadian running up the score because in September 2008 Olympic qualifying game the Slovaks beat Bulgaria 82-0 . <p> How can we , as a people , tell our children that when they grow up they can be anything they want to be but take away what women have fought so hard to become ? If you do n't want to watch a high score hockey game , change the channel . If you take away the women 's hockey in the Olympics the sport will never grow . Get over it people ! Instead of complaining do something about it , donate to the programs or show your support ! I would love to have the opportunity play against the best in the world , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my life ! <p> Dreamer , I would just like to be able to play hockey at all but at 50 I 'm too old . But I want the opportunity to see my grandaughter play and if they keep cutting down women 's hockey , I might not get to see that . All the other comments ( except Speedo ) I agree with too . <p> There was a comment in the story from the Women 's coach saying people do n't get all fussed about blowouts in the mens game . She must not have been watching the coverage then . Both this year when Canada beat Latvia and last year when they beat Kazakhstan by huge margins , there was outcry that this was not the most sportsman thing to do . <p> Because of the way the seeing goes in the World Jrs. there is no reason to run up the score . If you win all your Round Robin games , you get first place in your pool , and face the winner of a pre-determined crossover game . <p> In the Olympics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you play in the second round . <p> It was disappointing that the article did not discuss the Swedish and Finnish teams which are not at the level of the Canadians and Americans but still competitive and capable of an upset in the Medal round in any given tournament . <p> I do n't understand what women 's vs. men 's hockey has to do with it . The point is , it 's classless . Once the opponent is down you do n't keep bludgeoning them . In my view , once you get to 10-0 the classy thing to do is play 4 on 5 . <p> I disagree . Just toying with the puck and not trying to score is humiliating the other team . Being better or dominant is not classless . These are grown adults on both teams who know that 100% effort is required and should never have to apologize for winning or losing by whatever goal differential . If you are a severe underdog you are still brave for trying your best and maybe you even inspire future generation in your country to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medal some day . <p> The " mercy " rule is applied to my daughter 's mixed league which is not very competitive . The Olympics is not that league . If you are too ashamed of watching excellence on display simply turn the channel . <p> I have no problem with them scoring at will when when there 's goal differential involved , but enough with the celebrating your 4th goal of the game in a 15-0 lead . I hate to think I 'm agreeing with Don Cherry , but put your head down and go back to the bench . <p> If a team is in the Olympics , then I have to agree with JAS above . It would be patronizing to play keep-away . There 's also the problem that if you- let up on your game ( as the players say ) -- you could lose your edge when you really need it . <p> Maybe they should just call the game a win after 2 periods if the score is outrageous -- like 15-0 , but I doubt that rules will be changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Premier and Development . Promote winner of development for the following olympics . 4 teams in each . Finals could be best of 3 . Probably Canada v USA for a series would be fantastic . Americans would probably watch too , in contrast to the men 's World Cup of Hockey which did n't even make USA news when they won it . <p> This is crap watching teams win 18-0 , and does n't help the sport AT ALL . Makes everyone involved look bad . 20 years ago they said it was because the game was in development . <p> As for the world juniors . Nobody cares except for Canada ..... few people will admit that though . That 's why it 's here every other year . <p> err US beat China 12 -- 1 not 12 -- 0 ..... surprised no one has pointed this out yet . <p> More on the subject it seems that the concept of good sportsmanship has been forgotten somewhere here . Beating the opposition is one thing but disgracing the opposition with overly massive scores should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sport to continue in any shape or form . Yes playing keep away for the full time should be avoided , if it 's 6 -- 0 though and it 's clear that they probably wo n't even get 1 at all then maybe slowing the pace of your scoring might be in order ? Yes it would involve some level of compassion and decency but 18 -- 0 is just showing that Canada has no restraint . If they want women 's hockey to exist they ca n't destroy the opposition in this way , the bludgeoned wo n't come back and then there really wo n't be any women 's hockey and who does that help . I was at the US vs China match and I like to think the US team who saw that it had gone a little too far actually let themselves get 1 person down so China could have a chance to score . If they did I applaud them because it gave the Chinese girls the ability to at least save a little face . Small concessions in these early days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it continues to be an Olympic sport in future . Beating up the weaker teams now without restraint will only help to destroy any chance of keeping this as an Olympic event <p> Wrong ! buy letting up on an opponent , no matter how weak they are , it 's a lack of respect . How is the weaker opponent supposed to ' honestly ' judge their improvement over time if the stronger team is n't playing them to the absolute highest possible ability every minute , every game ? That makes a complete mockery of the sport and the entire meaning of the word competition . Maybe rethink your statement and views on this . <p> this is the Olmpics to see who is the BEST in the WORLD and it happens to be the Candaian women hockey team DOSENT MATTER IF ITS 50-0 OR 1-0 a win is a win and one step closer to getting gold .... may the best team win <p> like in the summer games theres some countries that are better then others and thats the whole point to see whos THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it was any other countries nothing would be said <p> Ok so let 's get the cross country skier to hold up so the 4 or 5 place skier is n't embarresed by losing by 10 minutes .

@@1388238 <p> PORT HOPE - A Port Hope-born American naval hero has been honoured on an American postage stamp . <p> Admiral William Sowden Sims was one of four such personages honoured with his own postage stamp on Dec. 8 . <p> Sims 's father , American civil engineer Alfred William Sims , came to Port Hope in the mid-19th century to do surveying and engineering work for the railroad .

His wife Margaret Caldbick displayed a photo in a 1968 book , John Sims and His Descendants , of an old three-storey frame house with a two-storey bay window . No address is mentioned in the book . <p> The plaque reads : " Admiral William Sims -- Commander of the American naval forces in European waters in the first World War , naval writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community in 1876 .

He argued for the new British technique of continuous-aim firing , and even committed an insubordinate act by conveying his criticisms directly to President Theodore Roosevelt . <p> Fortunately , the president was impressed by his arguments and made him his Naval Aide in 1907 . According to Caldbick 's book , by the end of Roosevelt 's administration ( 1901-1909 ) , American gunnery was second to none . <p> Sims served with distinction as Commander of the Atlantic Destroyer Flotilla and , in 1917 , became president of the Naval War College . <p> After the U.S. entered the First World War , Sims became Commander of U.S. Naval Forces in Europe .

@@1388240 <p> Before the rise of Internet shopping , the only reviews you 'd encounter at the point of sale were testimonials selected by the manufacturer or retailer . Real reviews were the domain of specialty publications , written by professionals who were paid to put devices through their paces and report the results . <p> But behold the transformative power of the Internet : These days , online reviews have evolved to take advantage of the medium 's strengths , and they 've expanded to fill the extra space . Retailers like Amazon love user reviews , and have made them an integral part of the sales cycle : " Do your research right here , on this page , before you buy ! " they seem to say , passing off user reviews as a complete replacement for professional reviews . <p> Bloggers , fans , and enthusiasts by the millions now share their feelings about all sorts of tech products -- on their own sites or as free content for other sites . And marketers , faced with the reality that traditional marketing has lost much of its power , now create replicants that walk and talk like authentic reviews , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to specific demographics . <p> It 's not all bad news . Though there 's a lot of noise at review sites , there are also many more sources of good advice that a consumer can look to prior to making a purchase . The challenge is to figure out how to filter out the junk and find the feedback that tells you what you need to know . <p> Here are three strategies to get the most out of user reviews . Taken together , they can help you ensure that you 'll make a wise decision on your next purchase . <p> Figure Out Your Real Needs <p> First , be honest with yourself . If you plan to buy a digital camera , be clear in advance about whether you plan to be a professional photographer or are simply looking for an easy-to-pocket model that you can use to capture snapshots of birthday parties and recitals ? <p> Being realistic about your needs will help you impose an appropriate budget on yourself , and it will enable you to home in on the right review types -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and general-audience Websites , in-depth and standardized evaluations from professionals , or hard-core geekery from specialty forums . You need n't -- and should n't -- limit yourself to one review source ( more about that in a moment ) , but knowing where to start will help you avoid wasting time and will prevent you from being overwhelmed or seduced by jargon . <p> Another crucial step is to make your own feature list . Doing so will help you organize your priorities so that you can quickly evaluate models before plunging into the reviews . A quick online search for " intro to HDTV , " for example , should help you gather enough information from experts to assemble ( in less than 15 minutes ) a short list of must-haves , would-like-to-haves , and deal-breakers . Create this list before you start browsing user reviews : If you look at the reviews first , they may subtly influence you to add things to your " must-have " feature list that do n't belong there . <p> If you want some feedback before you start shopping , run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the category -- but be sure to explain just what kind of consumer you are so you 'll receive relevant advice . <p> Balance Your Reviews Diet <p> User reviews on retail Websites are the quickest way to see what real shoppers think about a product . But the trap -- especially with retailers like Amazon which have mastered the technique -- is that user reviews make it easy to do all the research you can stand without ever leaving the shopping page you landed on . You want slice-of-life examples of the product in use ? Highlights of problem areas ? Entertaining little feuds between different reviewers ? The ability to interact with the reviews by voting them up or down ? It 's all conveniently located there , right below the ' Buy ' button . <p> The problem is that the proximity of all of these options to the point of sale subtly transforms them into an extension of your shopping experience , as if each review were enabling you to hold the product in your hands from a slightly different angle . And when you 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buy ' button and put your shopping expedition to rest . <p> Will Chamblerlain , the editor-in-chief of Steve 's Digicams , has been writing and editing reviews for a decade . He says that he looks to user reviews on sites like Amazon as a supplement to more-rigorous reviews when he 's shopping for new electronics . " It 's nice to see what actual consumers have to say about products they 've purchased , " he says , " To see if they 're in line with what the professionals are saying . " If every shopper on Amazon complains about some weakness that all the pros missed , Chamberlain says , it can give you an edge when you 're deciding what to buy . <p> Lack of Standardization <p> On the other hand , Chamberlain notes , user reviews lack the standardization required to make accurate comparisons , which is why they function better as a supplemental source . After all , it 's much easier to compare laptops if someone has measured the number of seconds it takes each one to apply the same graphics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long each one 's battery lasts in indentical longevity tests . " Standardized testing is key . Make sure that whatever type of electronic you 're looking at , the reviewer is using a standardized test that every manufacturer 's model is being put through , so results are consistent , " Chamberlain says . <p> A good standardized review should clearly state how the product is being tested , and present the results in a way that lets you quickly compare them to the results of previously reviewed models . <p> Try the User Forums <p> Then there are user forums , which tend to mix experts with newbies , objective real-world tests with subjective preferences , sober judgments with passionate opinions . Chamberlain says , " You get a lot of feedback from people who may have purchased not only that model but several of its predecessors . You get feedback from professionals in the industry or from enthusiasts who buy every model that comes out . " <p> Throw Out the Extremes <p> Jeff Keller reviews digital cameras semiprofessionally at Dcreviews.com . When he goes through user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that most people are probably familiar with . " I typically throw out the really positive and really negative reviews , " he says , " And try to find a general theme . The really positive reviews often look like they were written by the manufacturer , while the really negative reviews can be due to bad luck or maybe that person has an ax to grind . If most people said that the air purifier is noisy , it probably is . " <p> The best way to protect yourself from misleading assessments is to rely primarily on professional sources that have staked their reputations on providing unbiased reviews -- yes , like PCWorld and Consumer Reports . ( Full disclosure : I blog for Consumerist , which , like Consumer Reports , is owned by Consumers Union . ) It 's also a good idea to look at forums and specialty sites ( sites that focus on specific tech products such as cameras ) . The wider you spread your net and the farther you move away from relying exclusively on user reviews , the more accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be . <p> Avoid the Shills <p> " The one thing you ca n't trust about reviews at online retailers is you ca n't know if someone is just trying to move more units , " says Chamberlain . Most user reviews on most Websites are probably authentic , but fake reviews do exist -- and given the level of anonymity that the Internet permits , posting a phony review could hardly be easier . Unscrupulous bloggers might receive money , free products , or simply a boost in status for praising a company or product . Tech user Joe Smith could easily be a PR flack , or a stay-at-home parent earning extra some extra bucks as a reviewer-for-hire , or a desperate marketing manager determined to improve sales . <p> There 's enough opportunity for misbehavior , in fact , that an informal marketplace has sprung up in recent years . " Reputation management " firms might offer to burnish a manufacturer 's image with a little strategic fine-tuning of user review pages . Last August , the website MobileCrunch posted internal sales communication from a game publisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promises to frontload new releases on the Apple App Store with reviews provided by " in-house writers " and " written from the angle of each target age group including key words that resonate with each audience . " <p> Shills have been discovered in a variety of retail channels . In January of 2009 , blogger Arlen Parsa reported that he 'd found job listings for fake reviewers on Amazon 's Mechanical Turk ; they turned out to have been placed by a business development rep at Belkin who was trying to improve the Amazon rating for a router . That same month , blogger Bruce Goldsteinberg reported that he 'd discovered Carbonite employees pretending to be customers on the company 's Amazon pages as far back as 2006 . <p> The ongoing attempts at gaming user reviews has led to inevitable crack-downs , too . Last July , the New York Attorney General fined cosmetic surgery company Lifestyle Lift $300,000 for fabricating online reviews . ( One internal email told employees to " devote the day to doing more postings on the Web posing as a satisfied client @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website TripAdvisor , which is owned by Expedia , was briefly in the news after reports that customers had found nearly 100 warnings posted throughout the site by the company , saying that specific property reviews were untrustworthy . By the end of 2009 , the FTC had revised and re-issued guidelines instructing all bloggers to disclose any relevant business relationships to their readers , in part to combat fake personas created to provide testimonials for health drinks and diet products . <p> How to Spot a Shill <p> Spotting a shill review is more of an art than a science , but here are some red flags to look for : <p> &lt; <p> ul&gt; <p> Unduly specific use case , user narrative , or consumer segment : If the review paints too complete a picture of the reviewer 's precise demographic , the odds are good that you 're reading an impostor 's work . Most real people do n't bother ( or even want ) to explain their careers or provide a typical day-in-the-life scenario when they 're writing about whether a camcorder works . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with caution . <p> Example : " I travel a lot on business , so I need a laptop that 's small , durable and gets out of the way so I can do my work . The Atlas 4oo has an extra-long battery life that lets me make good use of all the down-time I spend in airports . It also looks sleek , which means a lot to me when I 'm trying to impress a new client . " <p> Emphasis on feature lists and marketing bullet points : Some amateur reviewers innocently add bulleted lists of features to their reviews ; after all , tech companies have trained us to look at products in terms of a marketing-friendly set of bullet points . But marketers try to hammer these points in impostor reviews , too . And even if the review is authentic , you do n't want to evaluate the product on the basis of someone else 's features list -- and especially not the one printed on the side of the product box . <p> The single , mild criticism : The sneakiest impostor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and coo over how much they like it . Then they 'll dirty it up with a minor criticism -- something they wish the product did that it does n't . This is the old " exception that proves the rule " gambit ; after all , if a quibble is the only thing that a fair and balanced reviewer can find to put in the " con " column , the product must be pretty great . When you see such a review , though , check to see whether the criticism refers to a crucial feature that 's missing , or whether it 's just a throwaway bit of fluff that most consumers will disregard . If it 's the latter , the probable reason it 's there is to prove the reviewer 's objectivity -- a type of proof that impostors are unusually keen to provide . <p> The deja review : Buried in a pile of reviews or scattered in review collections across multiple retailers are three or four that sound eerily similar , as if the authors were -- surprise ! -- the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- for the same reason that student essays purloined from CliffsNotes are -- but only if you read enough reviews to catch them . <p> Reviews Are n't Everything <p> Finally , remember that even the best-reviewed product may break , and at that point you 'll hope that you bought it from a manufacturer who takes after-the-sale customer service seriously . I 've read every sort of complaint about manufacturers , from the ridiculous to the infuriating . My advice : When it comes to user-complaint Websites , do n't put too much stock in any one complaint , but try to look for themes -- which manufacturer does n't provide trained technicians , which one delivers poor warranty services , or the like .

@@1396232 <p> The vast and unruly credit-default-swap market is facing renewed scrutiny as U.S. authorities probe the role Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks may be playing in pushing Greece toward financial collapse . <p> The move comes amid growing angst about the ailing of finances of Greece , Spain and several other European countries , which some analysts fear may threaten the future of the euro monetary union . <p> U.S. Federal Reserve Board chairman Ben Bernanke expressed concern on Thursday that U.S. banks and other investors may be compounding the debt pressures facing some European countries by using swaps to wager the countries will default on their debts . <p> " Obviously , using these instruments in a way that intentionally destabilizes a company or a country is counterproductive , " Mr. Bernanke told members of the Senate banking committee on the second day of his twice-yearly economic report to Congress . <p> Mr. Bernanke said both the Fed , and likely the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission , would look into any such involvement of the banks they oversee . <p> U.S. banks and hedge funds are major players in these financial derivatives - essentially , insurance policies that kick in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debts . <p> For example , Goldman , JPMorgan Chase and about a dozen other banks backed a company called Markit Group Ltd. , which last fall created a popular CDS index . <p> That index in turn provided an easy way for investors to bet big on the likelihood that Greece and other indebted European nations will go bust , according to The New York Times . <p> The largely unregulated $25-trillion ( U.S. ) global CDS market played a key role in toppling insurer American International Group Inc. , which was rescued by the U.S. government when it could n't make good on the various insurance contracts it sold . <p> A big chunk of the $182-billion in government money that went into that bailout was to cover CDS contracts issued by AIG to Goldman and others . <p> The cost of insuring against a default on Greek debt using CDSs rose for a fourth day yesterday after credit rating agencies Standard &amp; Poor 's and Moody 's Investors Service warned they may downgrade the country 's debt . The soaring price of the CDSs , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other heavily indebted countries to raise cash to pay their debts . <p> " We 'll certainly be evaluating what we can learn from the activities of the holding companies that we supervise here in the U.S. , " Mr. Bernanke added . <p> Goldman Sachs is already facing accusations from some European officials that it helped Greece to play down the full extent of its foreign debts in a series of currency swaps back in 2001 . And yesterday , Mr. Bernanke suggested the Fed has concerns about those transactions as well . " We are looking into a number of questions related to Goldman Sachs and other companies and their derivatives arrangements with Greece . " <p> Goldman officials have insisted those transactions were consistent with European statistical principles at the time and had a " minimal " effect on Greece 's overall fiscal health .

He raised the spectre of limits on the use of credit default swaps to prevent " the intentional creation of runs against governments . " <p> But the push for stricter controls on derivatives has proved difficult in the face of opposition from financial industry players . Already , asset managers and hedge funds are resisting a call by the Fed to shift the bulk of CDS trading to clearing houses , as a way of limiting risk . <p> The Fed has given the industry until March 1 to set goals for making the shift . <p> Some analysts are n't convinced U.S. authorities are serious about stricter regulation . Janet Tavakoli , a derivatives expert and president of Tavakoli Structured Finance in Chicago , wondered whether Mr. Bernanke made his remarks to " placate the EU , who must be very miffed with us at the moment . " <p> Ms. Tavakoli said Mr. Bernanke did n't go nearly far enough in using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Such swaps are a cheap and easy way for investors to bet that a country 's finances will deteriorate . As the demand for such instruments rises , that sends a negative signal to the bond market , where investors become inclined to sell the country 's debt , sending its borrowing costs higher .

But in health care as in most other fields , power rests mostly where the money is . The Health Ministry has power , because it still makes most of the big-picture funding decisions . The hospitals have power , because they still decide where most of their funding is allotted .

In both cases , the original tree may have died long before being made into a tool . <p> So reliance on wood-based radio-carbon samples is n't a good way of estimating the age of an artifact and where it came from . <p> McGhee looked at older research and took out the data that came from such unreliable sources , and came up with new , later , dates for the approximate ages of Inuit settlements . <p> Based on the new dates McGhee estimated , the Inuit settlement on Ruin Island started around AD 1330 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> An Inuit settlement at Creswell Bay on Somerset Island had been thought to begin around AD 1190 <p> After removing data from wood radiocarbon dating , McGhee estimated the site there only dates back to about AD 1360.

@@1400231 <p> This is the final article in Globe Investor 's Investing Heroes series , in which we profile prominent investors and exploring their investing strategies . We started with an interview with Stephen Jarislowsky and a profile of William O'Neil . <p> Betty Sinnock is talking about one of the biggest mistakes her investment club has ever made . Early on , in 1987 , they bought shares in The Fur Vault Inc. , a fur retailer , at $8 a share . <p> " I had chosen it because the fundamentals looked like it was supposed to really grow , " she recalls . <p> It was about the time when anti-fur activism began to go mainstream and , that year , the winter was quite warm . Pretty soon , the stock price dropped to $6.75 and the club had a decision to make : Stick with it or sell ? Afraid to hurt the feelings of Ms. Sinnock , the rest of the group decided to hold on - and did so until the stock was at about $3 . <p> " We sold it then , " Ms. Sinnock says . " It went down after that , till it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> It 's a cautionary tale for any investment club : Preventing hurt feelings can be costly . <p> Ms. Sinnock 's investment group is n't just any club , though . She 's a founding member of the Beardstown Ladies , probably the most famous and influential investment club in history . The group of 16 women , with an average age of 70 , became international celebrities in the early 1990s when they were plucked from obscurity in tiny Beardstown , Ill. , and given television appearances on CBS 's This Morning show after being a star club in the National Association of Investors Corp . for years . <p> Those appearances led to a book deal and more television spots . Pretty soon , the ladies were everywhere . The Beardstown Ladies ' Common-Sense Investment Guide - which included investing advice and the ladies ' favourite recipes ( Ms. Sinnock 's was Betty 's Shoepeg Salad ) , was a huge bestseller , selling 800,000 copies . Other books followed . <p> " I think the story was that if a group of women who were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that well on their own by using common sense and fundamentals , then I can do it , " says Ken Janke , who was then president of NAIC , a non-profit organization that educates individuals and clubs how to invest . <p> Their influence , he says , was not just in the number of people who decided to start investing clubs on their own , although " the numbers of inquiries we received on how to start clubs was just phenomenal . " It was also that they took control of their investing with a do-it-yourself approach . " Some of the brokers did n't like it , some of the security analysts did n't like it . They tried to throw darts at them saying they made a huge mistake . " <p> Says Brooke Harrington , the author of Pop Finance , an in-depth look at investment clubs : " I think the fact that they wrote three New York Times bestsellers in the early 1990s suggests how influential they were . Amazingly so . <p> " They plugged into a lot of the classic American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough gumption and effort , anyone can do anything , even a group of little old ladies in rural Illinois could make a fortune in the stock market . With homespun advice . It was like a Frank Capra movie . " <p> But by 1998 , the Beardstown Ladies ' time in the spotlight was over . The end came when Chicago magazine did the math and disputed the book 's claims that the club had seen 23.4-per-cent annual returns . An audit showed the 23.4-per-cent claim was way off . In fact , the Ladies made an average annual return from 1983 to 1993 of 9.1 per cent ( though their next few years were stellar , with their audited results showing an average annual return from 1983 to 1997 of 15.3 per cent . ) . Ms. Sinnock put out a detailed press release explaining the mistake as her error . But the damage was done . <p> But the Beardstown Ladies persevered - meeting every month and continuing to invest $25 each and every month . Ms. Sinnock , now in her late 70s , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the club - the rest have died . The group continues to get audits , but refuses to release the results " since we got burnt . <p> " We 're pleased with them . We are doing very well , through all the bluster and the market pitfalls . " <p> In fact , the Ladies ' investing style remains unchanged from the one they outlined in their wildly successful first book . <p> " We 're pretty well buy and hold . We run fundamentals and when we buy , we keep . " <p> Ms. Sinnock says that her club 's success stems from the fact that everyone does their homework and contributes . It 's her strongest advice to anyone who wants to form a similar club : Pick people who get involved . <p> Also , be patient . " We had people in Beardstown who jumped in and thought they were going to get rich quick , and that 's not what the club is all about . A club is an education experience - to learn . " <p> Ms. Harrington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States , says the clubs that do best have members " who are n't too chummy " and stick to the matter at hand . <p> On the other hand , the groups that last the longest have members who are friends . Those groups , she says , do n't necessarily make money - but people tend to stay for social reasons . <p> Here 's some of the advice they gave investors on how to choose profitable stocks : <p> Is the company in the top third within its industry or sector ? <p> The Beardstown Ladies get that information from Value Line 's Investment Survey , a publication that analyzes companies ' annual reports . There 's hardly a page in the investing section of their first book that does n't mention Value Line . <p> The principle , however , is that you should n't buy shares in a company unless it is a sector or industry leader . <p> Ms. Sinnock says that when choosing a stock , she picks the sector first and then figures out what the top companies in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Is the company 's debt under control ? <p> The Ladies only pick companies with total debt that is equal to no more than a third of total assets . <p> Solid growth in sales and earnings <p> The first question investors should ask is : Does the company have at least five years of solid growth in sales and earnings ? <p> If the company does , then you should ask whether the industry itself is growing . <p> The Ladies ' advice : If you 're investing in small company , make sure the company 's earnings are projected to grow at least 12 to 15 per cent ; 10 to 12 per cent for a medium-sized company or 7 to 10 per cent for a large company . <p> Low P/E ratios <p> The Ladies look at price-earnings ratios , but compare the current ratio to those over the last five years .

Fit Chicks , a Toronto-based women 's fitness company , was dreamed up not in a yoga studio or gym , but in a living room . <p> In March 2008 , best friends Laura Jackson and Amanda Quinn were in their townhouse chatting about the fitness classes -- from belly dancing to hip hop -- they had tried over the years . That night , the newly certified personal trainers decided to design a fitness program combining the best elements of all the classes . <p> Even then , the two were thinking big . They believed the new program would boost not only their own workouts . " We figured if we were looking for this , other women were , too , " Quinn says . <p> They were right . <p> Fit Chicks , which launched in September 2008 , runs fitness classes for women at 14 locations -- 13 in the Greater Toronto Area and one in Ottawa .

Quinn , 31 , manages advertising and sponsorship for the Toronto International Film Festival . <p> The company 's most popular class , G.I. Jane Bootcamp , combines cardio drills , weight training , yoga and kickboxing . In a four-week session , each class is different to keep participants motivated .

On the other hand , impatient people can often get those people who are very slow or feel less urgency to move a little faster , " he said . " If it comes down to doing nothing - many people are comfortable with the status quo - versus trying to make some changes and taking some risks , I can see impatience having some positive benefit .

" It was first published close to 20 years ago , and is still a great resource for anyone interested in local traditions . <p> In her introduction , Rieti remarks about arriving at the Memorial University Folklore and Language Archives ( MUNFLA ) and discovering hundreds of accounts of fairy traditions . Her subsequent fieldwork revealed people still told those types of stories . <p> It is a source of great interest for me this continues to hold true ; people in Newfoundland still tell stories about the fairies . <p> Many local stories revolve around the idea of protection .

A bit of stale bread , a piece of hard biscuit , even a fresh slice of a mother 's home-made three-bun bread was said to do the trick . <p> I once heard a man from the Southern Shore talk about being bedevilled by bad dreams , dreams which only stopped once he put a slice of bread under his pillow . <p> A woman from Placentia Bay told me a story about a relative who had been taken by the fairies , and who was only able to escape once the family threw bread into the woods . <p> The Dictionary of Newfoundland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led astray by fairies ; lost in familiar surroundings ; dazed .

What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeper like North 44 ( 1990 to present ) ? <p> The interesting part about the restaurant business is that a lot of people can become chefs and restaurant owners without a lot of knowledge about the restaurant business itself . You need to understand what a profit and loss statement is and how it works . You ca n't just be a chef or a sommelier . I 've always been good with money and numbers . <p> Is it not enough to be able to cook well ? Why do some chefs fail in business , despite their celebrity ? <p> School for being a chef is really a basic curriculum . You have to have a business side or someone managing the business for you . Otherwise , it will go sideways . Sideways is down . It 's a gradual slope . <p> How did you find the nerve to serve a $34.95 burger ? I am , of course , referring to the signature Bymark burger . <p> Well , you go to New York and they sell it for $59.95 . I saw it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interpretation of the burger is certainly different from his . We were n't the first place in the world to do it . <p> What 's the difference between a five-star customer and a three-star customer ? <p> I 'm not a five-star chef . I do n't like five-star restaurants per se . <p> But you have one that is often described that way -- that is , One in the Hazelton Hotel . <p> I like a slightly more relaxed dining room and table service than what a true five-star restaurant is . I find it a bit pretentious for my taste . Occasionally , you find a client that actually lives in that fantasy world and they can be challenging . You can still be five-star precise , but relaxed , and not be as uptight and stiff as some formalized dining rooms can be . <p> You were born and raised in Buffalo . How did you come to Toronto and end up as a chef ? <p> My family is all Canadian . My father was drawn to Buffalo on business in the early ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Toronto based on work . I did my Grade 13 here . I imagined myself going to Guelph university and taking hotel management . There were big chefs in France , and food was coming more forward . I thought I 'd take a stab at apprenticeship for one year . ( That was at the Regal Constellation Hotel in 1976 . ) I got into the kitchen and I never looked back . I felt like a fish in the water . I moved through the ranks quickly . <p> Your first restaurant job was in 1974 , as a dishwasher at Mindy 's Wine Cellar in Amherst , N.Y . What did you learn there ? <p> Oh , how to keep a really clean dish room , because Mr. Gleason was a tyrant . I guess I succeeded . I graduated to the kitchen . That was my first time behind a stove . <p> Which chefs inspire you ? Which chefs do the opposite ? <p> I am fan of Thomas Keller . I remember as a young boy I was very impressed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing . I 've never been a fan of the lab-meets-kitchen style of food . It was a phase that has come and gone very quickly . As I 've gotten older , I 've become resigned to cooking very classic , comfortable food . <p> How does Toronto 's restaurant and food scene stack up against other big North American cities ? <p> If you asked me that question 12 years ago , I would have told you that New York was leaps and bounds ahead of us . Now , if you go to New York or Chicago or any other major cities , Toronto holds its own very nicely . <p> Recently , there were rumours that your supermarket was closing . Where did those come from ? <p> Absolutely no idea . Toronto is a rumour mill . People love to talk and gossip . Ridiculous ! We 're here and things are going very well . There are people in the grocery business in Toronto who really believe they are the epicentre of the universe . It 's amazing the chatter they create . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , across from the McEwan supermarket . How is that coming along ? <p> We start construction this week . It should open the first week of July . <p> Do you ever reach a point where you feel you have bitten off more than you can chew ? <p> That is a common question in Toronto . If you go to the States , Boulud has eight to 10 restaurants , Puck has 30 at least . In Toronto , the moment you have more than one restaurant , they ask , " How are you going to do that ? " There are many other chefs who have many other restaurants . So the answer is , " No , I do n't . " I find it easier to operate when you have a bigger company .

They want to get in and get the job done . They do n't want to sit and complain or get involved in office gossip , " Ms. Roney said of staff at TheBump.com . <p> That was the case for Carla Young , a Calgary copy writer who worked from home after the birth of her daughter in 2005 . <p> " My daughter would go down for a nap , and two seconds later I was at my desk writing , " Ms. Young said .

He put it in the fridge before basketball games , dinners , and he even stuck all his gum on the inside of his locker . This was his art . <p> " When you create opportunities or ideas where you want to turn something into a product for people , you 're a maker , " he said . <p> Like Marraccini , some artists have always considered themselves makers , because doing-it-yourself is the most expressive art form . <p> In an art school in Toronto 's West End , art instructor Mike Goodge sits in a class of six children .

Originally from the U.S. , Raine and her partner arrived in Toronto with few connections and no secure employment . She currently works part-time as an ESL teacher and stumbled upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of her students , whom she had taken to sign up for library cards . " I saw a map with all of the ninety-nine branches , and I thought , this would be kind of a nerdy challenge , " she says . Travelling to the far-flung branches allowed Raine to get to know Toronto better . " Because I was n't from Toronto , I wanted to venture out of my enclave . Sometimes you hear Toronto people say things like , ' Oh I never go east of there , ' but I wanted to see all the parts of the city , " Raine says . " Through the libraries , I found a point of community and contact for myself . Going to the library is an important part of becoming a citizen of Toronto , of Canada . " Raine began by visiting the libraries in closest proximity to her job and her home . " The first one was the Deer Park branch at St. Claire and Yonge , and then I did the ones that I lived and worked near -- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scarborough . " Raine admits that she was initially apprehensive about the expansive nature of her goal . " It 's overwhelming ; when you think that there are actually ninety-nine branches , it 's like , whoa . And when my husband suggested I should write a blog about the project , I said , ' Who would want to read that ? ' " But as Raine continued to write about her excursions readers flocked to her blog , and she was the subject of a feature on libraries in the Toronto Star not too long ago . While Raine has covered up to five libraries in one day when necessary , she still enjoys researching and discovering each location . " Each branch has its own distinctive personality and history , " she maintains . Her personal favourite is the Humberwood branch in northwestern Toronto , where she was charmed by the natural surroundings . " It 's in the suburbs but it feels rural , " she says . " There are these beautiful tall grasses and a wooden footbridge . It 's not big and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressed , Raine admits that there are a few locations that could use a little work . She mentions that both the Brookbanks and Palmerston branches are pretty battered , with people actually reading on the ground for lack of adequate seating . ( She was glad to learn that the Palmerston branch just started to undergo renovations . ) The money the City puts towards funding libraries is both essential and well spent , she argues ; after her local branch , Kennedy/Eglinton , completed renovations , it became busier and more vibrant . In the age of e-books and Kindle , Raine maintains that libraries have achieved relevance beyond simply housing books . " I think libraries have become more viable by not just being silent mausoleums where you sit and read , " she says . " I do n't think anything can replace the unique aspect of home that a library has ; whatever you are doing , even if you are n't talking , you are still a part of something when you are there . " Raine also acknowledges that the people who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or those with lower incomes , often do n't know much about it . " I ask my ESL students if they have library cards , and many of them say no , " she says . " While it 's not hard to get , many people do n't really know about it ... the library system could maybe benefit from more education about it , more outreach . " At this point , Raine is as knowledgeable about the Toronto Public Library system as you can get : she has currently managed to visit ninety-eight branches . The project remains just shy of completion due to renovations at the final location , Thorncliffe , but she has word from the staff that she will be allowed in sometime this spring . " It 's been kind of a library overload , but when I get to a new branch , I get excited , " she laughs . " It 's like an adventure ! " Thanks to Joe Clark for the tip . @ @ @ @ @ @

A similar contradiction is revealing itself in South Africa , where massive amounts of public and private spending on the upcoming 2010 Soccer World Cup are expected to salve a faltering economy and crippling poverty .

While these glib slogans are never truly intended to reflect the complex diversity of national culture -- see Germany 's " A Time To Make Friends " -- this slogan simplifies issues dramatically for viewers , investors and tourists . As Local Organizing Committee chairman Irvin Khoza puts it : " Africa is a continent rich in resources . But its biggest asset by far is the warmth , friendliness , humility and humanity of its people . " It is not only South Africa being viewed , sold , bought and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Brand South Africa , " open for business . " Former president Thabo Mbeki hopes " the event will send ripples of confidence from the Cape to Cairo -- an event that will create social and economic opportunities throughout Africa . " <p> Selling Africa is tricky . Most African nations since independence have a shoddy record of upholding human rights and democracy . A report in African Business says distressing images of suffering in neighboring Zimbabwe are threatening the branding campaign of the World Cup . Blemishes like these have led spin-doctors to roll out an image polishing campaign that makes situations like the national emergency in Zimbabwe entirely separate from African development as a whole . When , in fact , they are intricately linked . Thabo Mbeki 's policy of quiet diplomacy with Zimbabwe drew fierce criticism in South Africa , and his inability to prevent a social and economic meltdown in the country has been blamed for the masses of migrant Zimbabweans still streaming across the South African border . " From a branding point of view , " says Dr. Nikolaus Ebert , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat to South Africa 's image is blowback -- the unintended consequence of an unsympathetic or cynical foreign policy . " <p> But as the Ugandan scholar Mahmood Mamdani says , South Africans have always seen themselves as unique from the rest of Africa . Selling Africa means highlighting the successes of South Africa 's wholesale embrace of neoliberalism and distancing it from the unsavory actions of its neighbours . The marketing and media campaign behind the World Cup will no-doubt seek to smooth out the complexities of growth and development while framing South Africa as the success-story of African neoliberalism . A glossy picture its neighbours should attempt to emulate . <p> A national survey reveals that 74 per cent of South Africans are optimistic about the employment and economic impact of the World Cup . But does this mean they will directly benefit from the billions poured into the games from their own pockets ? The record indicates the opposite . If the World Cup is to bring any domestic benefits , it must serve the interests of ordinary South Africans before those of Budweiser and Coca-Cola . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Africa have focused heavily on the alarming rise in violent crime in South Africa and the daily-increasing rape and homicide rates ( 50 murders a day ) . Domestic and international pressure to take action on violent crime before the World Cup was so intense that South Africa 's chief of police told Sky News that his officers should kill criminals if they came under attack . A British company has even begun marketing a 2010 stab-proof vest for football fans visiting the country . <p> International concern has largely been for the safety of tourists and players visiting South Africa during the tournament and not for those poor and disenfranchised South Africans who face violent crime while living in dire poverty . Indeed , few commentators have asked what benefit the games will have for those living in townships in sight of the new million dollar stadiums . Daunting economic problems remain from the apartheid era -- particularly poverty in black communities , lack of economic empowerment among disadvantaged groups , and a shortage of public transportation and housing . More than one-quarter of South Africa 's population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the largest welfare state in the world . South Africa has a 24 per cent unemployment rate with 50 per cent of the population living below the poverty line . At the same time , the richest members of society have increased their annual earnings by as much as 50 percent . According to the Gini Index -- a measurement of household income inequalities -- South Africa has the second most unequal distribution of income in the world , just behind its neighbor Namibia . <p> For these reasons ordinary working South Africans may see the billboards and advertising brought by the World Cup , but they are unlikely to see the games themselves . The ticket prices to the big event are likely to deter most of Africa 's soccer enthusiasts . With 3 million tickets available , less than 100,000 have been sold in Africa as most Africans are not able to afford the expensive entry fees . Chief Executive Officer of the 2010 FIFA World Cup , Danny Jordaan said that it is the first time in World Cup history that the host nation is not topping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheapest ticket will cost 55 Euros ( 570 Rand ) for tickets that will entail the holder to sit behind goals . The cheapest ticket for the final is going for 275 Euros ( 2,842 Rand ) . <p> At the bottom end of the economic scale , are those who will only be impacted negatively by the World Cup . Like Cape Town 's street sellers , who are reportedly being driven from the city 's streets by police and a private security company . Police also recently relocated 600 people who had been camping alongside an inner city railway line in Cape Town to a transit zone on the outskirts of the city . While Danny Jordaan has promised no evictions , the record is against him thus far . These forced relocations draw on the legacy of apartheid era racial and spatial segregation . In this practice South Africa is not alone . It is estimated that the 1988 Seoul Olympics resulted in the eviction of 700,000 people ; and the 2008 Beijing Olympics displaced 1.5 million residents . <p> Udesh Pillay and Orli Bass , researchers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " inequality may even be exacerbated by the hosting of the World Cup ... There is no proof that the hosting of mega-events will result in meaningful job creation . " They argue that billions invested in stadium construction and infrastructure renewal may not trickle-down as many politicians expect . " The success of the games will be measured not only in terms of how South African cities are made more competitively global , but in terms of how an undertaking to the poor and indigent can be fulfilled . " <h> Energy , Climate Change and Privatization <p> The cup will occur at a delicate time for South Africa 's energy mogul , Eskom . The national energy utility has warned that power cuts that have plunged millions of households into darkness for years could continue right through to 2010 . " Eskom 's power system will remain tight over the next five years with an increased likelihood of power interruptions . This trend is set to continue at least until the first new coal-fired base load power station is commissioned in 2011 , " the utility reported last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utility and is the primary source of greenhouse gas emissions in South Africa . South Africa is also the biggest greenhouse gas emitter on the continent , with 73% of African emissions . Coal is the major fuel source used by Eskom , and the utility used 94.14 million tons of it in 2001 . Eskom receives its coal at rock bottom prices because the high volume of supply contracts awarded to coal companies allows them to sell non-export quality coal cheaply . Despite these high emission levels , South Africa is already engaged in doubling its electricity generation capacity from coal-fired power stations by 2025 . <p> While Eskom avoided the large-scale privatizations that swiped many South African utilities from the public , it has consistently been on the neoliberal chopping block . Increasing electricity prices and restructuring led to some 20,000 Soweto households being disconnected every month in 2001 , until resistance from militant communities rolled back the process . Access to water and electricity has become a key struggle in South Africa 's townships . One study conducted through the South Africa 's Human Sciences Research Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cutoffs and electricity disconnections under privatization , mostly because they could n't afford new , higher rates . Instead of selling off large chunks of Eskom , the government has moved toward partial privatization of projects , which has been identified as a new source of funding in Eskom 's search for solutions to its financial woes . <p> The Congress of South African Trade Unions ( COSATU ) and the grassroots Anti-Privatization Forum ( APF ) believe that electricity should remain publicly owned and controlled . The APF , which has actively campaigned against electricity cutoffs , evictions , and supported workers ' struggles against privatization in Johannesburg , has heavily criticized Eskom for doing nothing to bring basic electrical services to the poor and for continuing to rely heavily on fossil fuels . According to COSATU , the privatization of Eskom would contradict the Government 's previous commitment to enhance services for the poor and support economic development . <p> The partial privatization of Eskom and the on-going debate over privatization and nationalization in South Africa plays into the ideological battle being waged around the World Cup and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of global competition and brand identity , is the fact that global capitalism has not delivered the goods for the vast majority of South Africa 's population . In the townships outside Cape Town and Johannesburg , dreams of real liberation -- and even basic service delivery -- have been put on hold while the country reintegrates itself into a neocolonial system that is intent on draining further wealth from an already exploited continent . As the late political economist Giovanni Arrighi commented , " there may be little that most states can do to upgrade their economies in the global hierarchies of wealth . " Global games represent one option , but as his colleague John Saul points out " the fact is that Southern Africa simply can not compete with more powerful capitalist centers at playing their own game .

@@1425231 <p> Construction work began on the first phase of the Northwest Sector Sewer Project near the intersection of 104th Avenue and 81st Street on the morning of March 22 . Although the effort to extend the Town of Osoyoos 's sewer system to roughly 130 homes on or near Osoyoos Lake 's northwest shore is underway , some residents feel certain aspects of the project do n't add up . Photo by Paul Everest - Click on picture for larger image <p> OSOYOOS TIMES-March 24 , 2010 <p> By Paul Everest -- Osoyoos Times <p> After more than two decades of planning and waiting , construction work on the Northwest Sector Sewer Project finally began on the morning of March 22 . And while workers and heavy equipment were busy moving earth near the intersection of 104th Avenue and 81st Street , some residents in the area where the first phase of the sewer line will be installed were considering whether they would actually hook up to the project or not . The residents of 15 properties along 87th Street were given the option last week to decline the opportunity to connect to the Town of Osoyoos 's sewer system . In a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Regional District Okanagan-Similkameen ( RDOS ) state they will " consider formal applications from each property owner fronting 87th Street to opt out ( be excluded ) from the Northwest Sector Sewer area . " The Town will be accepting applications to opt out of the project until March 31 , the letter states . The letter also contained an advisory that anyone who chooses to opt out now may not be able to change their minds and hook up at a later date . Choosing to hook up to the system in the future will mean a cost of " no less than $23,790 " as well as approval from Osoyoos town council and the RDOS board of directors and sewer servicing bylaws from both governments " to include your property , " the letter states . Currently , the roughly 130 property owners in the area to be serviced by the project are being told the cost for hooking up to the system is about $8,000 plus a $115 sewer inspection fee and annual user fees of $302 . According to the letter , " the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwest Sector Sewer area is because your property is outside the environmental control zone established in the early 1990s by the Ministry of Health for septic tank systems . " One resident who lives in the area where the first phase of the project is being constructed and is questioning many aspects of the sewer system extension said the March 31 deadline is unacceptable . Rick D , who lives on 87th Street and asked not to have his last name used due to privacy concerns for his family , has asked officials with the Town , the RDOS and the Town 's engineering consultants , TRUE Consulting , why several properties on 87th Street were slated for inclusion in the project in the first place . He said the properties are not near the lakeshore and therefore pose less of a pollution risk to Osoyoos Lake from leaking septic fields than properties on the water . <p> Resident wants opt-out deadline extended <p> In a response to the Town dated March 19 , Rick stated that the March 31 timeline " not only puts unnecessary pressure on those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as you can well appreciate might not even reach several of our neighbours who are away . " He added that the Town should extend the deadline to give the property owners in question " sufficient time to receive and process the answers to several questions . <p> Connection costs for residents questioned <p> Rick , along with Mike Mortimer , an 81st Street resident whose property will also be hooked up to the Town 's sewer line during the project 's first phase , have been seeking answers from the Town , the RDOS and the engineers about several issues relating to the project . For one , they want to know why rural Area A residents that will be serviced by the project have to pay anything at all . The project is estimated to cost $6.4 million . But contributions from the developers of the Willow Beach and Reflection Point properties totalling nearly $1.4 million , plus an infrastructure grant from the provincial and federal governments of which roughly $4.3 million will be used for the project as well as a pledge from the Okanagan Basin Water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been committed to paying for the project . Since the sum of those contributions is roughly $7 million , Rick and Mortimer ask why residents are being asked to pay $8,000 a property . Even taking into account problems that arise over the course of constructing the project , they argue , the contributions outmatch the estimated cost of the project by roughly half-a-million dollars . Last month , the RDOS approved a bylaw enabling it to borrow more than $1.2 million to service the debt created by the project which area residents will have to pay back . Rick and Mortimer also want to know why the engineers have agreed to build access roads across a large property in the Phase 1 area owned by the Demelo family . Rick said he believes the Town and the engineers have agreed to provide the roads , and run the main sewer line through the property , to accommodate a future subdivision on the property . The Town and engineers from TRUE Consulting have said the project was not designed to accomodate any future development in the northwest shore area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with " latecomers " to the project . While the project is intended to service 130 lots in rural Area A , 40 lots on the Willow Beach property and 22 lots on the Reflection Point property , 28 lots will be left for future connections . Rick and Mortimer want to know if the money paid by property owners who join up to these 28 connections down the road will go towards reducing the costs of residents who are hooking up to the project now . Rick said he believes the Town will keep any money paid towards the project by latecomers down the road , even though he feels such cash should be used to reduce the financial burden placed on property owners hooking up to the system now . The Osoyoos Times posed some of these questions to the Town of Osoyoos , but was told by Barry Romanko , the Town 's chief administrative officer , that such inquiries " will be dealt with on our priority basis and not on the priority to meet your press deadlines . " " We are providing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we feel that this is sufficient information at this time , " Romanko wrote in an email . " We may be able to respond to questions later in the week depending on our workload . All inquiries for information must come to me and not to contracted engineers or other staff . " <p> Engineer says moving fill to orchard cheaper than hauling it away <p> However , Terry Underwood of TRUE Consulting , did talk to the Times about the access roads on the Demelo property . He said the Demelo family agreed to provide a right-of-way across their property for free . Dirt excavated from the area to accommodate laying the sewer pipe would have to be trucked away anyway , Underwood added , and so moving it to the nearby Demelo property will actually be a cost-saving measure and will not add to the price tag of the project for taxpayers . Underwood said crews working on the project will compact the dirt into roads for future development on the property . Mark Pendergraft , director for rural Area A , said the 15 properties on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cluster of development " near the lake and that increases the likelihood of potential pollution from septic fields reaching the water . While some argue the leakage of pollutants from septic fields in that area is negligible , Pendergraft said when you add roughly a dozen homes together , that negligible amount of pollution increases . He also said that having some of those properties opt out of the sewer project should n't affect what other residents in the area pay for connecting to the sewer line . If anything , Pendergraft said , costs could go down since fewer properties would need to be serviced . Ultimately , Rick and Mortimer said they are looking for some accountability from the Town and they want the RDOS to do a better job of looking after their interests . They added that they have met with lawyers and a legal challenge against the Town and the RDOS is **30;0;TOOLONG <h> 2 Comments <p> mike mortimer <p> March 24 , 2010 at 8:40 am <p> Memo to Mr. Romanko ( seeing that it takes you 2 wks to answer my emails @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you can stall us long enough to get the pipe in the ground on the Demelo property .

Your response was that it is not always cost effective to go in a straight line . You went on to say that in this case the difference providing this alternate route is minimal as the servicing depth in the straight line route is 4.5 meters and the alternate route is 1.5 meters . Actually ( if you knew how to read " blueprints " ) the OPPOSITE IS TRUE . If you eliminate the manholes and go in a straight line , the depth is 1.5 meters and my straight line theory is still intact ! You went on to say this route was necessary to secure right of way access and that no new roads or other concessions were granted to the future Demelo subdivsion .

Now that $30,000 cost savings could be passed on to the 121 lakeshore residents that are actually paying for this project !

I 've just lost my job and I 'm packing my bags and moving to London tomorrow to be an actor . " And , even though I made that joke about my parents saying " As long as you 're not a drunk , I do n't care what you are , " I actually got a letter which was similar to that .

Jesus , I screwed up ! <p> Q : America , it 's interesting in animation you 're talking about Scotsmen being Vikings but here you are playing a Viking girl and you get to run away from the stereotypes . Is that something that you feel you can do in animation that perhaps you ca n't do in live action ? <p> America : I think the obvious is that in animation they can make you look like whatever they want to make you look like . I think what was really cool is that they could just choose the voice that they wanted and it was n't at all dependent on who looked the part which was really nice for me because I got the job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ super cool that they put a female character into the story because it could have easily just been all men , a male dominated Viking movie . <p> Q : Do you anticipate having problems with stereotyping now that you 're leaving Ugly Betty ? Are you concerned about that in terms of roles that you 'll be allowed to take or you would be offered ? <p> Jay : We all have those concerns . ( Laughs ) Stereotyping is part and parcel with every actor . <p> America : I think that by nature any character I take on at all will have to assume a Latino background because that 's what I am . But I hope that that does n't limit the stories that I can be a part of telling . <p> Jay : I did n't even think about you being from a Latino background until he said that .

" This guy loves his Coca Cola and I identify because I love Coca Cola as well . You spot it , you got it , as they say . The flying sequences in this movie are so breathtaking . You know , I heard about these kids after watching " Avatar " who went into depression because they could n't really live in that world and whenever I watch that in this movie , I thought " That 's where I want to be .

He had them in abundance -- honesty integrity , humanity and a duty to serve the communities in which he found himself through a long career -- Oshawa , Windsor , Detroit , London England , Europe , Ottawa and Orillia . He relished challenges , giving generously and quietly of time , talent and resources if the cause was worthy . <p> I can attest to that . <p> In the late 1990s , Orillia city council and the board of the Stephen Leacock Museum were trading blows over the question of governance . For 40 years , operating on a meagre municipal budget , the volunteer board had worked wonders -- attracting thousands of visitors to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh for generations .

While I should have been listening to the sermon , an idea was taking shape in my mind . What if we were able to recruit someone of Don Lander 's renown and experience to our board ? In the narthex after the service I put the question directly to him and got a cautious answer . He still had corporate responsibilities to discharge but he would give it serious thought down the road . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Brewery Bay , my 1994 history of the property and Stephen Leacock 's attachment to Orillia /Mariposa .

One thing he was sure from the start -if our museum was municipally operated it stood little chance of corporate support . <p> The report was unveiled to council one wintry Monday night and reaction was swift . Residents of the adjoining subdivision said their view of the lake would be obscured by an enlarged Swanmore Hall . And councillors were taken aback by the estimate of $6 million to complete the project ... to be raised in a national campaign .

Part of his role was deciding what to do with abusive priests . <p> It has also emerged that Ratzinger , while archbishop of Munich in 1980 , approved the transfer of a priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to police . <p> Ratzinger was later notified the priest had been reassigned to another parish , according to a memo cited by The New York Times on Friday .

" <p> Talach represented 11 of the 13 men Prince was convicted of abusing as young boys . <p> Prince was ordained at the Pembroke diocese in 1963 . Pappin says he stopped working there in 1967 .

@@1442234 <p> Remember Sam Lau ? Two years ago , the self-taught chef became an overnight sensation when New York Times reporter Jennifer 8 . Lee wrote a book , The Fortune Cookie Chronicles , in which she named Zen Fine Chinese Cuisine the greatest Chinese restaurant outside Greater China . <p> The initial fanfare looked like a golden windfall for a restaurant , relatively unknown outside Richmond , B.C , that had been teetering on the edge of bankruptcy . <p> Alas , it was n't enough to impress Mr. Lau 's clientele , who , he says , kept trying to haggle down his tasting-menu price . Six months later , when the restaurant lease came up for renewal , he decided to take time off to search for a better venue . <p> And now Zen rises again , in Richmond 's Steveston Village . <p> Personally , I still do n't think Zen is the greatest Chinese restaurant in Vancouver or Richmond , let alone the world . Of course , " greatness " is a highly subjective evaluation and my criteria ( based on the quality of food and service ) are different than Ms. Lee 's - or those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Restaurant Critic 's Choice Awards , which will be announced this afternoon . <p> Ms. Lee 's quest was to look at the ways Chinese cuisine had been adapted around the world and find an authentic Chinese restaurant ( nothing Pan-Asian or too fusion-y ) that appealed to Chinese and non-Chinese diners alike , while offering " some kind of twist that would hold up on the global stage . " <p> The original Zen impressed her , in part , because it was a tastefully decorated fine-dining restaurant on the second floor of a suburban strip mall . <p> The new Zen - located on the ground floor of a new , three-storey condo development near the tastefully touristy Steveston piers - is no dive . The clean , modern room is fronted by glass and floored in pale bamboo plywood . Inside , pink silk-covered sconces cast a soft glow against a sea of cream walls and tablecloths . Simple metal chairs comfortably padded in bright vermilion provide minimal punches of colour . And the women 's bathroom , appointed with complimentary perfumes ( Chanel , Cartier and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toilet , is the height of luxury . <p> It 's a vast improvement over the old restaurant 's simple , DIY aesthetic . <p> It also still seems to be attracting a predominantly Chinese clientele ( who comprise more than half the diners the night I visit ) . " This is an amazing feat , since most Chinese do n't want their cuisine modernized , " Ms. Lee wrote . <p> Modern , for Ms. Lee , meant more than just d ? cor . The " twist " that truly amazed her was Zen 's " audacious " Western-style tasting menus . The " clincher " was the price : an eight-course gourmet meal , which then included squab and half a lobster , for $38 . <p> The tasting menus have n't changed much and still offer a very good bang for your buck . There are now four set menus ( slightly different than those advertised online ) , priced at $33 , $55 , $75 and $160 . <p> Mr. Lau has also added a small , 12-item ? la carte menu . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something special off-menu with wine pairings . <p> Although we do n't drink any wine ( which might explain why the haughty waiter does n't dote on us quite as attentively ) , the list looks interesting , with a reasonably priced by-the-glass selection that includes Ornellaia Le Volte and Tablas Creek Vineyard 's Esprit de Beaucastel . The cellar , which Mr. Lau plans to expand when the budget permits , is housed in an impressive glass locker that separates a semi-private table from the main dining room . <p> We order Menus A ( $33 ) and B ( $55 ) , which get off to a promising start with a jellyfish salad weaved with glassy strands of imitation shark fin and house-smoked salmon rolled with cream cheese in a spongy spinach roulade . There 's nothing authentically ( or even remotely ) Chinese about the latter , but both are nicely plated with fresh fruit and lightly dressed with clouds of citrus foam . <p> Double-boiled soup is the hallmark of a good Chinese chef , and Mr. Lau 's organic chicken broth is brilliantly clear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone-in quail floats in the hot tureen , which comes with a saucer of soy kicked up with chili , ginger and garlic for dipping . <p> A flaming whelk shell stuffed with curried seafood seems creamier , richer and spicier than it was at the old Zen .

Then everything starts going downhill . <p> Drab Dungeness crab , while purportedly steamed live , tastes like it 's been precooked and reheated . The three-leg portion is spread with a thick layer of the steamed white garlic mince that blew Ms. Lee away ( though I 'm not sure why , since it 's hardly novel ; Sun Sui Wah does it better . ) <p> A tofu duo includes one portion that is deep-fried in a greasy shell that tastes of funky , old grapeseed oil . <p> Although individual Western-style plating is Zen 's calling card , the cold-shredded chicken , Chilean sea bass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on family-style sharing platters .

And though I tend to agree , this free-range chicken tastes like all the flavour has been poached right out of it . <p> Never mind the fact that Chilean sea bass is non-sustainable , this deep-fried filet is encased in a tough , leathery brown skin and scented with that same funky oil . Fatty pork belly , braised for 24 hours , falls apart on the tongue and smells like Christmas . But the sticky-rice risotto with mascarpone is as bland as baby food . <p> All in all , the new Zen Fine Chinese Cuisine would probably still rank right up there with Ms. Lee 's " greatest .

@@1442238 <p> Linkages , to be clear , are efforts to break an impasse or otherwise improve one 's bargaining position on a particular issue by tying it to another , unrelated issue . Linkages can be co-operative or coercive , and they can be prospective ( promises , threats ) or retrospective ( rewards , retaliation ) . Most government officials and many academic observers have argued that the virtual absence of coercive linkages is one of the most distinctive features of Canada-U.S. relations , and for many it is the key to the special relationship . Others have argued that linkages do in fact play an important role in Canada-U.S. relations , although it is usually through the anticipation of American linkages and the profound self-restraint it induces in Canadian policy-makers . The question of linkage is a crucial one for Canada-U.S. relations , and for Canadian foreign policy more generally . If the U.S. is willing and able to use coercive linkages to force changes to Canadian policies , then Canada faces some tough choices . It can find ways to limit vulnerability by restraining or even rolling back interdependence between the two societies , which would involve severe - perhaps even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find ways to set limits on the exercise of American power , which apparently can be purchased only through reciprocal cessions of Canadian sovereignty , or perhaps not at all . Or it can find ways to live with profound vulnerability , which would ultimately amount to accepting strict limits on Canada 's autonomy in both foreign and domestic policy . If , on the other hand , the U.S. is not willing and/or not able to make linkages in disputes with Canada , then the overall asymmetry of the relationship matters less , and the limits of what Canada can " get away with " depend on the specific bargaining context within particular issue areas . <p> I make four main arguments . First , the U.S. historically has not used direct , coercive linkages to force Canada to change its policies . American self-restraint has increased the space for Canada to pursue policies at odds with the U.S. , and to exercise greater autonomy than the overall asymmetry of the relationship might lead us to expect . The expectation in Canada that the U.S. might resort to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canadian policy-makers have generally been much more cautious ever since , and more inclined to pursue previously unthinkable strategies ( such as integration ) as a way to set new limits on the exercise of American power . <p> Second , the reasons for American self-restraint have changed since the 1970s . In the early Cold War decades , the bilateral relationship was effectively governed by the broad diplomatic culture described here , and relevant U.S. officials were committed to the norm against direct , coercive linkages . Their adherence to the norm was so reflexive , in fact , that American policy-makers tended not to see linkage options as options at all , even in high-stakes bilateral disputes . In the 1970s , a new cohort of policy-makers , who knew and cared little about Canada , began to make their presence felt , and the established transgovernmental network had to work hard to keep U.S. bargaining strategies in line with the postwar diplomatic culture . The traditional foreign policy bureaucracy 's claim to " manage " the bilateral relationship broke down under pressure from a newly assertive Congress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transgovernmental network had been effectively displaced , the degree to which the U.S. would be prepared to bargain aggressively with Canada - up to and including resort to coercive linkages - depended mainly on shifting configurations of bureaucratic and societal interests within the United States . There was no sudden outbreak of coercive linkages in the 1970s , but - as I will explain below - that was mostly because of American officials ' growing appreciation for the domestic political consequences of linkages , not because of broad adherence to a norm against them . <p> Third , the virtual foreclosure of these " hard " linkages as bargaining options for the U.S. increased the importance of what we might call " soft " linkages . In what we normally think of as coercive linkage - what Wynne Plumptre once referred to as " tit for tat " retaliation - the aggrieved party makes a threat , or actually lashes out , in a way that is immediate , direct , and unambiguous .

@@1442240 <p> Over the last three decades , the globalization and the communications revolutions have created the most striking transformation of society since the Industrial Revolution . This informational revolution , to borrow from Manuel Castells , has meant that knowledge and learning ( including intercultural communication ) are the keys not only to technological progress and economic prosperity but also to social cohesion and global security . Values and ideas are common currency , and the free movement of people - especially the young - is both necessary and inexorable . These transformational trends have made every country more aware of its image , identity , and reputation . Whether a country needs to build international coalitions against terrorism , co-operate to protect the environment , or attract investment , foreign students , and skilled immigrants , influencing global public opinion is critical to national success , because in the absence of substantial military or economic weight , most countries in the world are the image and the ideas they project abroad . In a global system in which this soft power is growing in importance , the competitive advantage should go to countries that are able to present distinct national voices , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from international communications is tantamount to relinquishing sovereignty and , therefore , national security . For this reason , the process of one government informing , understanding and persuading citizens in other countries - public diplomacy - is now at least as important as the classic diplomacy of communication between governments . Classic , or quiet , diplomacy is not being devalued ; privileged government to-government communications have always existed and always will . What has changed in the last thirty years is not that classic diplomacy has disappeared but that public forms of diplomacy have become increasingly recognized as vital for addressing the many pressing international challenges , such as the spread of infectious diseases or the need for sustainable development , that require public input and co-operation . More than in any previous period of world politics , the international stage is now a mirror of a country 's identity . What happens on this stage can have profound effects on domestic identity and vice versa . When a country 's citizens see themselves reflected in the mirror of others ' perceptions , that reflection can either strengthen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or challenge prevailing values by providing new perspectives on them . This is especially true for Canada , a country that for most of the second half of the twentieth century defined its national identity according to its global role as a " peacekeeper , " its inclusiveness as a society , and its sense of being distinct from its giant neighbour to the south . <p> From a domestic perspective , Canada 's official policy of multiculturalism projected an image to the world of a tolerant nation that would welcome newcomers . This perception of Canadian openness served to strengthen Canadian citizenship and national unity at home by emphasizing ( and some would say exaggerating ) the difference between a Canadian society that celebrates diversity and an American one that celebrates a " melting pot . " In a twenty-first-century foreign policy environment characterized by the blurring of the domestic and the international , more non-state actors , and a ubiquitous , converging mass media , the management of Canada 's international image has become a key determinant of national success both domestically and internationally . Canada , described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unique contribution to make in this new world of ideas and knowledge . It is not an exaggeration to say that in this informational world , Canada 's greatest comparative advantage is not its rich endowment of natural resources but Canadian citizens themselves - who they are , what they have accomplished , and what they stand for . As other countries adapt to the emergence of multicultural , multilingual societies with multiple levels of governance , Canada is in many respects a " model nation " because of how it manages its diversity and what it can teach the world about living with ambiguity and constant evolutionary change Although it is by no means a perfect model , with its history of inclusion , pragmatism , and the rule of law , Canada has defined itself as a workable federation . <p> However , just being a model nation is not enough .

The realization that she put on pounds after following a strict training schedule left her feeling shocked and dismayed . " It is very discouraging , " she says . <p> As counterintuitive as it may seem that someone who is getting regular exercise would gain weight rather than drop pounds , it is actually quite common , sports nutritionists say . Many runners overestimate the number of calories they have burned during exercise , which can lead them to believe that they can have a slice of chocolate cake with dinner or an extra tall latte and still lose weight . And when they come home ravenous from a run , it can be difficult not to eat everything in sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling like , ' Yeah , I deserve this .

" <p> Runners who are just a few pounds overweight are more likely than others to add pounds as they train . Typically , they will gain about three to five pounds , says Jennifer Gibson , a registered dietitian and nutrition consultant based in Victoria . <p> For a small percentage of those people , the weight gain is due to added muscle , especially if strength training is part of their routine .

" If I do n't eat what I 'm eating , I wo n't be able to train , " Ms. Lawson says . <p> But after gaining weight while preparing for her Ironman race in 2006 , she has become much more food-conscious , she says .

She also suggests eating warm foods , such as a bowl of soup , rather than a sandwich , since warm foods are perceived to leave you feeling more full than cold foods . <p> Perhaps most important , Ms. Mansfield says , is to avoid thinking that training sessions are all the exercise needed to lose weight . <p> Indeed , one mistake many runners make , especially people who are new to the sport , is ignoring the benefits of other physical activity , whether it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs rather than the elevator , she says .

@@1450234 <h> Quebec 's Health tax -- right question , wrong answer <p> Posted on Wednesday , April 14 , 2010 <p> By Wendy Thomson <p> With its announcement of what will ultimately be a $200 per adult person health tax and plans to introduce user fees , the Quebec budget brought the financing of our health-care system roaring back onto the public agenda . Canada 's universal health-care system needs new ideas to face a confident future , on that we agree . But experience in the U.K. and elsewhere suggests there are better alternatives for reforming -- and maintaining -- universal health care than those announced this week . <p> We should n't assume that more funding is the answer . Canada already spends more than most OECD countries on health care and while Quebec is n't the highest , it 's still above most others . A flat rate of tax hits the poorest hardest , and low-income people already pay a higher cost in their shorter and less healthy lives . User fees will cut demand , but adversely affect people on low incomes and lead people to wait till their condition is acute and more expensive to treat . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient or effective . Without better accountability -- not only upward to government but downward to public and patients -- people may not be as willing to pay more as Quebec Finance Minister Raymond Bachand believes . <p> Courage is needed to make radical changes in the design of the health-care system . My shortlist would include a few things we should " just do " and a few we should avoid . Let 's examine closely the cost and effectiveness of our health services . Rather than adding more funding , we should look at the way we allocate our funding . <p> Current funding arrangements reward activity , but offer little reward for innovation or efficiency . Quebec 's most recent health-care reorganization signaled a move to a population-based approach to health -- ensuring that services meet the most important needs of the population served rather than reacting to deal with demands for existing services . It 's time for funding to be allocated on that basis , weighted to reflect variable needs so that services can become proactive and targeted to people who need them most . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patient . " <p> In the U.K. , overall system performance has improved with the introduction of standard financial tariffs for common treatments and increasingly , whole " episodes of care . " In this system , a fixed fee is set and hospitals receive that amount for the patients they serve ; thereby creating incentives for them to bring costs in line with or better than best practice . We also need to shift from the most expensive tertiary hospital care , toward primary health care and prevention . Montreal can be proud of progress establishing Groupe de M ? dicines Familiales ( GMF ) and Clinique R ? seau ( CR ) , but too few Quebecers have a regular primary health provider . More in-home medical and personal care services would reduce demand on expensive acute care while meeting older people 's preference to remain at home . Studies consistently show that more than half the people arriving at Emergency would be better served in primary care or minor-injury clinics . In the U.K. , to divert inappropriate demand from the ER , dedicated centres for diagnostics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the hospital . <p> Third , the system needs more transparency , so patients as well as administrators and clinicians are clear about what is working ( and what is n't ) . With its Patient Choice program , the British National Health Service has introduced patient-friendly health information , from the overall quality of service ( judged by an independent regulator ) , mortality rates , other patients ' views , waiting times , infection rates , food quality and even parking facilities . With better information about the differences in access and outcomes across their universal system , patients can chose care that works . When funding follows their decisions , serving people well begins to make more sense financially as well as clinically . When the cost of specific health services is known , it 's possible to introduce an element of competition through the quasi-market reforms that have proved successful in the U.K. All funded from tax revenues , the provision of health care could be diversified across a wider array of institutions , spurring greater choice and best practices to harness further improvement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services and hospitals need more incentives and flexibility to manage . People -- communities and professionals -- are the most valuable resource in the system . They need to be motivated and supported to spawn innovation and generate creative solutions to intractable problems . Finally , another major top-down restructuring of the health-care system should be avoided . It 's not about structure and great plans , but the attitudes and activities shaped by the way the system works . The health tax and proposed user fee wo n't necessarily address the changes needed to drive the health-care system toward sustainability . Some of the political courage shown this week should focus on the patient , with population- and patient-based funding , accountability and transparency about what 's working at what cost . <p> Wendy Thomson is Director of the School of Social Work at McGill and served as an advisor to former British Prime Minister Tony Blair . <p> Currently you have JavaScript disabled .

@@1450236 <h> The ideological fight going on in Toronto that pits car drivers against bike riders is n't really about transportation . <p> University Ave . is the focus of one pilot bike lane project planned for this summer , which would reduce car lanes on each side from four to three from Richmond to Wellesley , with bike lanes added alongside the broad central boulevard . <p> By:Robyn DoolittleCity Hall Bureau , Published on Wed Apr 14 2010 <p> With news that University Ave . is poised to become the next major route to get a cycling makeover , the bike lane battle has again taken over election chatter . <p> Rocco Rossi is against lanes on major routes . Joe Pantalone is for them . George Smitherman has avoided taking a solid stance . <p> Giorgio Mammoliti boldly announced Wednesday that if elected mayor , he would introduce a $20-$30 registration fee for bikes . <p> " It 's an agenda that seems to be taking over so far in this election .

This electoral wedge item is really just an emblem of every other ideological divide in the city : Rich vs. poor . Uptown vs. downtown . Right vs. left . <p> It 's about the environment . The role of government . And somewhere under all those issues , there are practical concerns about commuting . <p> " Cycling should be a non-ideological , dare I say common-sense , issue that spans the political spectrum . It should transcend left-right ideological divides . But in reality , it does n't , " said Myer Siemiatycki , a politics professor at Ryerson University . <p> " Some of it has to do with if your mindset is locked into the idea that the city is a place of business and efficiency , " he said .

" The left seems to have more concern , generically , for quality of life , the recognition of diverse and different needs and lifestyle . " <p> Siemiatycki muses that Rossi 's tough language against bike lanes , such as those planned for University Ave . and Jarvis St. this summer , has something to do with bolstering the name recognition of a candidate who 's not that well known . Although technically a Liberal , Rossi will need the right-wing and suburban vote this fall to stand a chance of beating Smitherman . <p> " In some ways Mr. Smitherman 's campaign has been sort of defined by the curse of the front-runner . " Front-runners are often " afraid to open their mouth because whatever they say may lose them votes , " said Siemiatycki .

Before denouncing lanes on major routes , Rossi always points out he is an avid cyclist and fully supports a bike network -- on side streets . <p> Smitherman has never said if he is for or against the Jarvis and University projects , only that bike lane expansion should stop until an " integrated , city-wide transportation plan is drafted . " <p> Rossi denies trying to court the right . Voters " tell me gridlock is one of their top concerns , " he said . " This is not a political move on my part . It is being responsive to the citizens of Toronto .

I 'm in favour of no new lanes until an integrated , city-wide transportation plan is drafted . <p> Sarah Thomson : This is not a yes or no answer . <p> Rob Ford : No . <p> Question : If no , would you remove the lanes if you are elected ? <p> Giorgio Mammoliti : Yes . I can promise you this : When I 'm the mayor of the City of Toronto , if they succeed with these bike lanes , I will take them down -- and that will be the first thing that I do . <p> Rocco Rossi : Yes , I would remove these new lanes . <p> George Smitherman : No . <p> Rob Ford : No . It would be a waste of money to remove it if it 's already there , that is unless there was a huge public outcry in the area . <p> Question : What is your general philosophy regarding bike lanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must end now ! There absolutely needs to be a pro-bike agenda in this city , but we ca n't be turning everything upside-down to accommodate for a very small percentage of the population . We need to be realistic and realize that bikes will never take over the car , not without proper transit . It just wo n't cut it in this city . Not in this lifetime . <p> Joe Pantalone : I strongly believe that cycling is an essential part of Toronto 's transportation solution . Cycling is healthy for inviduals . Cycling is environmentally friendly . Cycling moves people around the City . <p> Rocco Rossi : I have been clear on this from the beginning . Bike lanes do n't belong on major arterials where there are quieter , nearby parallel roads like Sherbourne ( instead of Jarvis ) and Beverley/St . George ( instead of University ) . Bike lanes that eliminate car lanes on major city roads will cause further gridlock . <p> George Smitherman : Toronto needs an integrated transportation plan that does n't pit one form of transportation against another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I see a place for them , but for now , I think we need a time-out on new ones . If the city has financial resources to dedicate this year to bike lanes , let 's improve the quality and safety of the ones we have . <p> Sarah Thomson : I am in favour of bike lanes done properly using a connected grid system across Toronto . On streets where emergency vehicles abound they need to be separated physically ... Jarvis St. is another example of political agenda , not common sense . We already have a bike lane on Sherbourne . If this were planned out properly we would have another north/south route on a street two or three west . Not right beside Sherbourne . <p> Rob Ford : I do n't live downtown , but if I did , I 'd probably own a bike . It would be more economical .

@@1450237 <p> Yield can mean different things : To give up or surrender ; A measure of agricultural production ; That big yellow sign you missed before slamming into another vehicle . <p> Most people know those definitions of yield . But do you know the difference between dividend yield and earnings yield , or between current yield and yield to maturity ? Judging by some of the reader e-mails we receive at Investor Clinic , there 's a fair bit of confusion about yield . <p> That 's not surprising , because yield has a multitude of meanings in the investing world . <p> So today , we 'll explain some of the most common usages of the term . Do n't yield to the temptation to ignore this article . Reading to the end could yield substantial benefits . <p> Dividend yield <p> One of the most-discussed types of yield , dividend yield is the annual dividend paid by a company , divided by the stock price . The result is expressed as a percentage . <p> For example , pipeline operator Enbridge Inc. pays annual dividends of $1.70 a share . Its stock closed yesterday at $49.74 . Its dividend yield is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The dividend yield is always changing . When the stock price goes up , the dividend yield goes down ( assuming the dividend itself does n't change ) . When the stock price falls , the dividend yield rises . <p> Like Goldilocks , dividend investors usually look for a yield that 's not too hot and not too cold . If a yield is too high , it may signal that the dividend is vulnerable to being cut . If it 's too low , investors who want income wo n't be interested . At Investor Clinic , we like our dividend yields to be somewhere between 3 and 6 per cent , but that 's just us ; there are no hard and fast rules . <p> Earnings yield <p> Take the annual earnings per share of a company . Now divide it by the share price . Presto : That 's your earnings yield . <p> The earnings yield shows how much profit a company generates relative to the price investors are willing to pay for its shares . The higher the earnings yield , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which posted a profit of $2.69 a share for the fiscal year ended Jan. 2 . Yesterday , its stock closed at $38.23 , so its earnings yield is $2.69/$38.23 , or about 7 per cent . Notice that Shoppers ' earnings yield is a lot higher than its dividend yield of 2.3 per cent , because Shoppers pays out only a portion of its earnings as dividends . <p> Warren Buffett is known to be a fan of earnings yield . When evaluating a stock , he compares the earnings yield to the yield on U.S. Treasury bonds . The earnings yield is usually several points higher than the Treasury yield to compensate for the additional risk of owning a stock . <p> More about Warren Buffett : <p> Think like Buffett : Tips from a pro <p> What Warren Buffett owns <p> Warren Buffett sings a different tune in his advice to investors <p> Investing by copying Warren Buffett 's style <p> To restore trust , look to Warren Buffett <p> Buffett 's hits and misses in 2009 <p> A baby Buffett portfolio <p> Here 's a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its head - that is , divide the stock price by the earnings per share - you get another common valuation measure : The price-to-earnings ratio . <p> Free cash flow yield <p> Free cash flow is an important measure , because it shows how much cash a company has after paying all of its bills and reinvesting in its business . Free cash flow can be used to pay dividends , buy back shares , pay down debt or make a big bust of the CEO to display in the lobby . <p> To calculate the free cash flow yield , take the free cash flow per share and divide it by the share price . The higher the yield , the more cash the business is generating relative to its share price . Some investors consider free cash flow yield a more accurate valuation measure than earnings yield , because the former accounts for capital expenditures whereas the latter does not . <p> As a general rule of thumb , some investors like to see a free cash flow yield of at least 10 per cent before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bond yield quoted , it usually refers to the yield to maturity . This is the total return an investor can expect , including interest payments and any capital gain or loss , if he or she holds the bond until it matures . It 's also known as the bond 's internal rate of return . <p> Bear in mind : The yield to maturity assumes that all interest payments are reinvested at current interest rates , which usually does n't happen because rates are always changing . So the investor 's actual yield to maturity may be higher or lower depending on whether rates rise or fall . <p> It 's also important to distinguish between a bond 's coupon rate and its yield to maturity . Consider a Province of Ontario bond with a coupon of 4.75 per cent and a maturity date of June 2 , 2013 . My discount broker was quoting this bond yesterday at a price of $106.699 . <p> Because the investor will get only $100 in face value at maturity , he or she will be taking a hit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loss will offset a good chunk of the 4.75 per cent in annual coupon interest . Result : The bond 's yield to maturity will be about 2.5 per cent - 2.25 percentage points less than the coupon . <p> Current yield <p> Many investors are fooled into thinking they 're earning higher returns on bonds than they actually are . This is particularly true of bond exchange-traded funds . Consider the iShares CDN Bond Index Fund . According to GlobeInvestor.com , the yield on this diversified ETF is an enticing 4.4 per cent . <p> Sorry folks , but that 's what 's known as the current yield . In other words , it 's the amount of interest paid over the past year , divided by the current price of the ETF . It does n't account for the fact that , as in the example above , the bonds in the portfolio are trading at a premium and will gradually decline to par value as the maturity date approaches . <p> If you want a better measure of the return expected from a bond ETF , look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is 3.4 per cent .

@@1450239 <p> As it begins construction of the first modern gold mine in war-ravaged Congo , the junior Canadian miner Banro Corp . worries less about the violence than it does about the bureaucracy . <p> Military clashes still plague Congo 's eastern provinces , reaching within 150 kilometres of Banro 's mine site at Twangiza . Roads and bridges here are in desperate shape , and skilled labour is almost non-existent . Yet the biggest obstacle , the company says , is red tape . <p> " The challenge here is not to go crazy , " said Banro 's chief executive , Mike Prinsloo .

" <p> Most foreign miners are too intimidated to venture into a country that contains , by one estimate , $24-trillion in mineral wealth . <p> Modern copper mines have been developed in Congo , but its gold sector is still dominated by thousands of impoverished artisanal miners who pan for gold for an average return of $1 a day . <p> Banro 's determination to overcome a litany of obstacles in developing its mine shows the lengths small mining companies are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - at a time when major gold companies struggle to replace reserves as they mine out existing deposits . <p> Global gold production has been slipping since 2001 , leaving junior mining firms to make risky moves in far-flung countries not usually associated with modern mining . <p> A Toronto-based company that has invested $200-million in exploring a swath of potential mines in this country since 1996 , Banro has been regarded skeptically for years . It was a junior with no history of production . How could it put a gold mine into operation in one of the most difficult countries in the world ? <p> Its $377-million planned investment in Twangiza is dwarfed by the estimated $20-billion that the Canadian mining industry has invested in Africa . But the 11 million ounces Banro believes it has found , if verified , would be almost in the same ballpark as one of the biggest Canadian gold operations on the continent , the five properties of African Barrick Gold in Tanzania , which hold 18.4 million ounces of proven and probable reserves . <p> Ignoring the skeptics , Banro is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the end of 2011 . And it hopes to develop another six mines in the years to follow . " I think people are going to be surprised when we pour gold by December next year , " Mr. Prinsloo said . <p> With its gold-processing plant due to arrive at the mine site in 180 forty-foot shipping containers this summer , the company has already begun building a 35-kilometre road through the bush to the mine site , strengthening bridges to handle its heavy equipment , constructing houses for 850 families who are being relocated from the site , and offering jobs or schooling opportunities to the 450 artisanal miners who work the spot . <p> Because the Banro property is so deep in the landlocked eastern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo ( nearly 1,500 kilometres from the capital , Kinshasa ) , it takes four weeks longer for Banro 's heavy equipment to reach the mine site , compared with most other African sites . And because it lacks a larger partner , the company needs to raise $100-million from private lenders this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year . <p> But the technical and financial problems are not as significant as the whims of Congolese officials , who have the power to delay a work permit or customs clearance for months at a time . " If you try to bulldoze them , they just block you , and then you 're dead - you might sit there for six months , " Mr. Prinsloo said . <p> Banro hit upon a solution that it insists is completely above board : It buys computers for " contact people " in each government office , ensuring that its needs wo n't be neglected . The company calls it an " education " program , supplying the computers through the Banro Foundation , its community development charity . <p> " They do n't have money for computers , so you have to help them , " Mr. Prinsloo said .

The government of president Laurent Kabila , which owned 28 per cent of Sakima , expropriated all of Banro 's mining properties in 1998 , prompting Banro to file a $1-billion claim in international arbitration court in Washington . At one point , four employees and legal advisers were jailed for treason in Congo . <p> By 2002 , however , Mr. Kabila was dead and the new president was his son , Joseph , who was eager to promote foreign investment . Congo was emerging as " the next frontier " for miners , and Banro was able to negotiate a deal with the government . <p> Under the agreement , Banro gave up two-thirds of the property , along with a hydro station and rights to all minerals on site aside from gold .

However , to save money , the company will begin with a 12-year open-pit phase to mine the higher-grade gold on the site . <p> Banro 's shares languish at a little more than $2 on the TSX , a fraction of their former worth . Banro 's original shareholders have seen their positions diluted as other shareholders have acquired stakes in the company - including $3.7-million worth from the Canada Investment Fund for Africa , a $200-million public-private partnership fund set up by prime minister Jean Chr ? tien to invest in Africa after the G8 summit in 2002 . <p> Critics have complained that the fund was meant to be devoted to African companies , not Canadian companies that have ready access to capital markets .

" The agreement has to go down as one of the worst ever for the DRC . " <p> Mr. Prinsloo maintains that the royalty rate ( 4 per cent of net profits , 1 per cent of revenue , and a 5-per-cent administration fee on spending ) is standard under Congo 's mining policies , and will increase sharply after the tax holiday ends . <p> He also notes that the company is allocating $13.8-million to the resettlement project , and says the project will create 1,000 jobs at the peak of construction . The company 's charity , the Banro Foundation , is spending up to $900,000 annually on community projects . <p> But Mr. Prinsloo acknowledges profits will be substantial if gold prices remain high : " Our projects make money at $650 an ounce and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are nice projects .

@@1466239 <h> The New Grindhouse Era <p> PoppaScotch <p> Back in 2007 . Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino teamed up to make a two part feature film experience appropriately titled Grindhouse . Each director provided their own feature length film in the grindhouse cinema tradition including bad edits , missing reels , and noticeable film grain . It was a throwback film designed to not only be an enjoyable time at the movies , but to recall a point in history when the rejected films of society were celebrated in dollar theaters in big cities around the country . These films usually consisted of taboo subject matter including large amounts of sex , violence , and drug use and in some cases , all of those . This was a form of entertainment that a large portion of society wanted to see , but Hollywood was just not producing at the time . When Grindhouse came out in 2007 , it inadvertently opened the flood gates to a style of filmmaking that would invoke a new renaissance of stylistic qualities . <p> This may require some explaining and in doing so , take for example recent films such as Black Dynamite or Bitch Slap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comment on a wilder and loosely time in cinema . For Black Dynamite , it highlighted ridiculous moments in the Blaxploitation era of films like Shaft , Little Ceaser , and Blacula . Bitch Slap goes a little bit of a different route and tires to appeal to the nostalgia of the sex/cars/nudity = awesome philosophy . The films are enjoyable sure , but more importantly they are just a few of the many grindhouse style films ( and internet videos/projects ) that have been popping up steadily since 2007 . I understand the whole craze ( it looks cool , invokes awesome warm and fuzzy feelings ) , I really do , I just feel that this stylistic choice is becoming a bit overplayed . <p> The choice of using this style today does have its uses in the popular definition of what a grindhouse film has been recently become identified with . The film grain , scratches , muted colors , and artfully terrible dialog act as a visual signifier to let the audience know what they are getting themselves into . It 's going to be filmmaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , violence , gore , or even action but that detail is moot considering you already know that you are going to see something that is insanely awesome ( hopefully ) . However , when you overuse this stylistic technique , you can quickly go from a cool and nostalgic throwback to a fun time in movie history into a bloated and terrible film that is using the grindhouse style as a marketing tactic . <p> In Grindhouse , this is not the case . Quentin Tarantino chose to do his segment in Grindhouse ( called Death Proof ) in a very visually specific manner . There are frame drops , scratches , and grain that exist to comment on QT 's personal film experiences growing up . He remembers the Vanishing Point days of massive car chases and collisions and he wants to both narratively and stylistically make homage to those types of car chase films from the 70s . I have no problem with using the style here whatsoever because QT wants to educated and entertain rather than just use the style as a way to give the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the core of his effort is a good film that is only supplemented by this stylistic choice . Robert Rodriquez did something similar with his installment titled Planet Terror . <p> Planet Terror was a study in overused clich ? s that someone made its way into a bad ass movie and fun ride . In many ways , RR wants to not only recall films from his past , but point out glaring clich ? s in a genre that was boiling over with them . Normally this becomes a very annoying practice , but RR 's movie is n't just one big clich ? and gag factory , it 's a very fun and entertaining look at a viral outbreak . It uses just the right amount of recall from previous films as well as its own merits as a storytelling vehicle to invoke all the right responses on a very fine line between comedy and all out farce from a viewer . It was like RR was telling the audience , " This is why I love the Grindhouse era of films ; it 's for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , not everyone uses the style and conventions as supplementation . <p> I do n't want to name certain films here , but I 'm sure you 've all seen recent attempts at capitalizing on the resurgence of the grindhouse style . It 's supposed to be a stylistic choice , not a reason for presenting the world with a terrible movie . Planet Terror and Death Proof both worked because the stylistic choices fit in with the movie 's themes , ideas , and central concept of reliving an entire experience . This was magnified with the fact that if you take away the grindhouse look , you 're still left with two good films . With these imitators , when you take away the grindhouse look , you are left with a terrible movie that if it was n't for the market scheme , would probably have never been picked up by a distributor . <p> Please do n't misunderstand me here ; I love the grindhouse treatment that modern films are getting peppered with . It reminds me of a time when movie going was actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to that dirt cheap cinema and someone became addicted to crack immediately after viewing the film ! It was movie hype at its best with films constantly trying to one up each other in the realms of sex , violence , or Gary Busey levels of crazy . I 'm just not too keen on movies using it to evoke feelings out of viewers that they themselves do n't fully understand . It 's not like we are going to go to one of these nu-grindhouse films and see something that we have never seen before , but then again , maybe someday someone will shut me up . I hope that they do .

To the dismay of Jane Jacobs devotees , they 're going to the suburbs . Over the last 20 years , most of the growth in the U.S. has been in the suburbs that surround the burgeoning cities of the south and west , places such as Houston , Texas and Phoenix that followed the Los Angeles sprawl model of urban planning . <p> The sprawl will get smarter , Kotkin writes , with fuel efficient cars and better planned neighbourhoods , but it 's pie in the sky to assume that Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of the U.S. uses mass transit on a daily basis .

@@1469235 <p> No , that 's not a description of modern corporate leaders . Rather , it lists the natural traits of three- and four-year-olds . And leaders could learn a lot by paying attention to the way that little kids handle their lives and deal with others , contends Toronto-based management consultant Hugh MacPhie , author of the new book Do n't Forget Your Cape : What Preschoolers Teach Us about Leadership and Life . <p> The title refers to a cape that Mr. MacPhie bought for his three-year-old son John , who was obsessed by action heroes . " Every time he put the cape on , I saw an instant transformation : His back straightened up , his eyes brightened and his language skills improved . He suddenly believed he could do anything he set his mind to , " Mr. MacPhie says . <p> That belief that you have the power to make things happen is just one of the messages from pint-sized people that leaders should take to heart in this still-scary economy , Mr. McPhie says . In his consulting work as principal of organizational consultancy MacPhie &amp; Co. , he sees many leaders who have forgotten how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of daily office life can erode confidence and make people afraid to question the status quo , or to take a risk on something that might fail , " he says . <p> Take a cue from the kids , he advises . " Just like when you were four years old , every day should be an exciting new adventure . Have the confidence that there is nothing you ca n't accomplish if you put your mind to it . " <p> Here are some key ways that grownups should act more like kids : <h> Ask why <p> What kids do <p> Preschoolers ask why - a lot - because they are genuinely trying to understand the world around them . Just as important , they are trying to understand the root causes rather than the surface answers . <p> What leaders do wrong <p> Somewhere along the way , asking questions to drill down to fundamental causes often gets lost and complacency sets in . For instance , the leaders of U.S. auto companies apparently were not asking basic questions about why foreign brands that changed models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell the same products year after year , Mr. MacPhie says . <p> Cue from the kids <p> Leaders should constantly challenge assumptions and get to the reasons why things are changing . " The Japanese have a system called the five why 's , which is a management tool that asks any number of times why to understand the genuine reason something is happening , " Mr. MacPhie says . Organizations have thrived by continuing to ask why questions . For instance , Procter &amp; Gamble Co. continually does market research asking customers why they buy even long running products and adapting their products to changing demands , he says . <h> Take more risks <p> What kids do <p> " Preschoolers take risks all the time . And they fail dozens of times a day . They are constantly trying something going outside their comfort zones , and therefore learning , growing , and gaining more skills . " <p> What leaders do n't do <p> " Particularly in a shaky economy , managers tend to shun risk-taking because they are concerned about what others in the organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas from their staff for fear of being to blame for a failure . This squeezes out innovation and creativity . " <p> Cue from the kids <p> Actively encourage employees to take smart risks , and not fear failure . When individuals stop getting outside their comfort zones , they stop learning and growing . And in the process , the entire organization becomes less innovative and cutting-edge . If an idea or innovation does n't work out , learn from it . <h> Share what you know <p> What kids do <p> When kids learn something , they tell their playmates about it incessantly , and the knowledge gets passed on . <p> What leaders do wrong <p> Too often in organizations , rather than sharing knowledge and insights for the good of the overall cause , information gets hoarded , Mr. MacPhie says . This comes about particularly in organizations that are highly political and where teams compete against each other . " People think keeping ideas to themselves will help them gain a promotion or advantage but , in reality , it slows down the spread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cue from the kids <p> Call people out on knowledge hoarding , making it clear to those at all levels that that they will not be seen favourably if they guard information , but will be rewarded and praised for actively sharing information . " That ensures that the best ideas can be found from across the organizations and also that there are no unknown surprises . " <h> Celebrate achievement <p> What kids do <p> " Preschoolers celebrate all the time . They celebrate birthdays . They celebrate snack time . They celebrate going outside . Because of this , they 're always enthusiastic and looking forward to their next accomplishment . " <p> What leaders do wrong <p> " There is n't much celebrating going on in most organizations today and , because of that , the mood in many offices is more uncertain and stressful than it needs to be . " <p> Cue from the kids <p> Acknowledge and celebrate even the smallest win . " Thank people for doing a great job , and encourage others within their teams to do the same . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emphasizes that good things are happening and the team is scoring wins . This builds the loyalty of good employees , making them less likely to leave , and can become a source of competitive advantage . " <h> Play games <p> What kids do <p> Preschoolers love to compete for rewards or attention . They do n't like to be told what to do , but join in enthusiastically if you can turn even something that is a chore into a game they like to play , Mr. MacPhie says . <p> What leaders do wrong <p> Leaders misguidedly believe that if people are n't at their desks slaving away , they are n't being productive , and that fun is something you save until after work hours . <p> Cue from the kids <p> Make work more fun . Do everything you can to create friendly competitions , with incentives to join in .

@@1469239 <p> Employers who factor in a prospective employee 's criminal record when deciding whether to hire should know that criminal record searches are now subject to an Interim Policy Statement that is designed to bolster associated privacy controls and is issued by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ( RCMP ) . <p> Conducting reference and criminal records checks as a part of pre-employment screening is a critical part of the hiring process , particularly in workplaces where the nature of the workplace , client base or work itself is sensitive . <p> Prior to November 2009 , employers could , as part of their pre-employment screening process , conduct either a basic criminal records check or a vulnerable sector check by submitting a request to an authorized agency , e.g. , a local police force or a third-party screening provider . These agencies would then conduct a search of the Canadian Police Information Centre ( CPIC ) , a national database administered by the RCMP . <p> Employers can still check for criminal records , but you may have to reconsider both your hiring process and the human rights implications associated with hiring decisions that factor in the prospective employee 's criminal record . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the RCMP issued a directive to CPIC agencies and third-party service providers , noting that many such entities were not complying with established policies and procedures regarding the use of the CPIC system . For example , many agencies were disseminating the details of convictions , discharges or pardons to employers without the informed consent of the prospective employee , and without confirming identity by means of a fingerprint comparison . <p> The RCMP followed the directive with an Interim Policy Statement , effective on December 8 , 2009 . While the Interim Policy Statement contains substantial information relating to criminal record checks , we note the following elements as key for employers in respect of pre-employment screening : <p> CPIC agencies are not permitted to conduct criminal records checks on behalf of third-party screening service providers that have not entered into a properly authorized agreement with such agencies . <p> An individual must consent ( in an informed manner ) prior to having a CPIC check conducted by either a CPIC agency or third-party screening service provider . <p> Criminal records checks will include a qualified statement with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a negative result , that the search " did not identify any records for a person with the name(s) and date of birth of the applicant " ; or <p> in the case of a positive result , that the search " could not be completed . " <p> In either case , positive identification that a criminal record may or may not exist , as well as the details of any such record , can only be confirmed once the individual subject 's identity is confirmed via fingerprint comparison . <p> Fingerprints are required for positive identification before criminal records are released . Accordingly , third-party screening providers , and other organizations ( including prospective employers ) , will no longer receive confirmation of the existence of a criminal record and/or details relating to the nature of a criminal record , without fingerprint verification . <p> The RCMP 's current fingerprint verification process can take up to 120 days or more , depending on whether the fingerprint is filed on paper or electronically . <h> Human Rights Implications of Criminal Records Checks <p> Employers should note that the definition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as do its implications . <p> For example , in Ontario , an employer may discriminate on the basis of a criminal offence for which a pardon has not been granted or , if granted , has been revoked , but an employer may not discriminate on the basis of a criminal offence for which a pardon has been granted and has not been revoked , or in respect of a provincial offence . In British Columbia , an employer may not refuse to employ , continue to employ or discriminate against an employee because that person has been convicted of a criminal or summary conviction offence that is unrelated to the employment or to the intended employment of that person . <p> It is important for employers to consult the provincial ( or federal ) human rights legislation applicable to their business in order to understand their obligations . <p> Generally , however , in order to be legally entitled to discriminate on the basis of an employee or prospective employee 's criminal record , a clear criminal record must be a bona fide occupational requirement ( BFOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a rational connection between the BFOR and the performance of the job ; <p> the BFOR must have been established with an honest and good faith belief that it is necessary to fulfil a legitimate work-related purpose ; and <p> the BFOR must be reasonably necessary to meet that purpose ( i.e. , it is impossible to accommodate the employee without imposing undue hardship upon the employer ) . <p> Accordingly , in order to determine whether it has grounds to deny employment on the basis of a criminal record check , an employer must have sufficient , specific information with respect to whether any such record exists , what the nature of the offences contained on that record are , whether they have been pardoned , and how such a record might impact the employee 's ability to perform the job in question . <p> Given the restrictions imposed by the RCMP 's Interim Policy Statement , it will be increasingly difficult for employers to get sufficient information regarding a prospective employee 's criminal record in order to make a timely and lawful hiring decision . <h> Tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a criminal conviction , and if one exists , whether it was pardoned . Then , assess the details of that conviction before making any determination as to the suitability of a prospective employee . <p> Ensure that any third-party screening service providers used for background checks are party to authorized agreements with CPIC agencies . <p> Discuss with your third-party screening service provider how they intend to modify their practices in order to comply with the RCMP 's Interim Policy Statement and how that might impact your hiring practices . <p> Where a CPIC check result states that a search " could not be completed , " ask the prospective employee directly about the report , whether they have a criminal record , and the nature of that record . <p> Instruct the prospective employee to verify their response by attending at their local police headquarters and having the police run a national criminal records check , and then submitting the report to the appropriate contact person responsible for hiring decisions . <p> If criminal record checks are a critical part of your hiring process , consider building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fingerprint verification , or requiring that all candidates provide confirmation of a clear criminal record as part of the job application process . <p> Ensure that the individual responsible for hiring is trained and familiar with both the CPIC process and the RCMP 's Interim Policy Statement . <p> The content of this article is intended to provide a general guide to the subject matter .

@@1469240 <p> MONTREAL -- The greatest artist is not necessarily the one who does something first , but the one who does it for the 47th time and makes it feel like the first . <p> That 's the best way to describe what Robert Lepage has done with Totem , the latest show from Cirque du Soleil . <p> There are two kinds of Cirque shows . The " permanent " ones , meant to run for a decade or more in Las Vegas , Orlando , or Macau and the " touring " ones , which travel around the world for an equally extended period of time . <p> The magnificent Lepage first partnered with Cirque on a permanent show in Las Vegas in 2005 , when he did Ka , their mind-blowing martial arts fairy tale . <p> But when it was announced that he was mounting the touring Cirque show for 2010 , a lot of people were dubious . The budgets for these shows were much smaller , the technical restrictions more stringent . <p> Could Lepage thrive within such a tight set of constraints ? The answer is definitely yes . <p> It 's almost as if the fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yes , Totem is similar to the other Cirque touring shows in many superficial ways , but the final result is dramatically different . <p> There is a central playing area , an audience on three sides and one overarching structure to define the action . <p> In Totem , it 's the skeleton of a giant turtle , which underscores Lepage 's theme of following mankind on its evolutionary journey from its amphibious roots . <p> Sometimes it dominates the action , but at other moments it simply hangs in the air , providing a visual counterpoint to the varied busyness below . <p> Like any Cirque show , Lepage 's Totem is filled with acrobats , jugglers , contortionists and gymnasts . But the difference is that each of these has a distinctive personality in Lepage 's world . There is an increased sexuality , a heightened sense of individual awareness , an overall sensation that everyone on the stage is unique and there for a special reason . <p> As Lepage tracks mankind 's journey , he makes room for the egotist , the exhibitionist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride roller skates , some soar through the air on high-tension cables , others ride glance beams or reach for trapezes . <p> One of the most astonishing things is the way that Carl Fillion 's set finds room for everyone and allows the earthbound dancers and the sky-high gymnasts the same freedom . <p> There is an increased sensuality to Lepage 's work here , which raises the stakes on what could have been frequently bloodless gymnastic exercises and lets us forge a deeper connection with the artists who are on an emotional as well as a physical journey in their work . <p> And the often banal and humourless comedy sequences are given new point and perspective by allotting them to characters who have something at stake in the sexual games on display . <p> The overall effect is both shocking and reassuring , allowing us to treat the characters in Cirque 's world as complex human beings instead of asexual clowns . <p> For once , the opening tour in Montreal will not be followed by an automatic visit to Toronto . The lucrative European market has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amsterdam and London before moving on to Canada sometime in 2011 . <p> But make no mistake , Totem is well worth waiting for . <p> Robert Lepage redefines every art form he touches and the Cirque du Soleil touring show is no exception .

Just as well , because there is n't one Canuck player who 'd offer him one . <p> Of course , Burish may be able to have a couple with Chicago 's healthy scratches during the series-opener on Saturday because the winger sat out half of the Blackhawks ' first-round games and did n't make the fourth line for Thursday 's practice . <p> Still , Burish 's sentiment perfectly summed up the prologue to this second-round National Hockey League playoff series .

Even the FACTS can not deny that there is most definitely LIFE in each little fetus ! How come suddenly we have the right to decide to end another person 's life ? Who decided to put that " right " into someone else 's hands ? That 's a frightening thought .... what if it was up to someone else to decide whether you lived or not , based on whether it was convenient for THEM ? <p> Well Amanda , if a four week old fetus wants to crawl out of a woman 's body and survive all on its own , it most definitely has a right to do that . However , for as long is it requires a " host " to survive , the host has every right to decide whether it wants to be sustaining that other life or not ... especially considering the demands on the host 's body . If I could n't live without attaching myself to someone else 's body for sustenance , I 'd expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Well , to be fair , Mature Student , babies/children ca n't survive outside the womb on their own for years . For people with certain disabilities , maybe not at all . And the demands of these people probably could well exceed the demands on a woman 's body during pregnancy . Does the " host " of these individuals have the right to decide whether it wants to be life sustaining or not ? <p> On the other end of the margin , with current technology , a fetus can be viable outside the womb after about 4-5 months of gestation . Not without assistance , sure , but then , there are lots of babies taken to term that ca n't survive without time in an incubator either . If the fetus is viable after 5 months , is it okay to abort it after 6 ? The line of reasoning that you 're taking is fraught with difficulty . What if in 10 years I can keep a fetus alive outside the womb after 6 weeks ? 3 weeks ? A day ? What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise a baby from conception to " birth " entirely mechanically ? <p> The reality is that neither the puritanical pro-life nor pro-choice positions are logically or ethically consistent . There are a few positions that are , but most are far too rational for this sort of debate . <p> @Abarlow , a baby outside the womb can be transferred to a willing caregiver and is not attached to an unwilling host . The law does not compel a mother to raise her child AFTER it is born either . <p> And like I said , if I or anybody else needed to be kept alive through the physical support of an unwilling individual , I would support that individual 's right to have a say in their survival , absolutely . We essentially have that system in place in our country right now . If I get cancer and need a kidney transplant , I can not legally force my brother to donate a kidney to me , even if he 's a perfect match . Nobody in this country is forced to give up the integrity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortion laws are consistent with that . <p> As for whether abortion should be illegal once babies are viable , well , if the baby wants to crawl out of the womb of its own accord , then no . But if it 's still attached to the woman , then yes . <p> But in all honesty , why would you WANT to develop technology in such a way that it could keep unwanted babies live outside the mothers who do n't wish to raise them ? Do n't we have enough trouble with unwanted children already ? Are those kids who are racked with pain from abusive and neglectful upbringings so much better off than the ones who were never born in the first place ? <p> I 'd feel a lot more sympathy for the pro-life position if , instead of protesting on campuses , you used your time and money to give loving and supportive homes to all those unwanted kids you try to keep alive . <p> I never said anything about compelling mothers to raise the child after it is born . That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in place for parents who are unwilling to raise a child , and is quite apart from whether or not they have the right to terminate the life of that child . If the pro-life crowd is willing to put their money where their mouths are , I 'm sure that they would be happy to adopt a 3 week , 3 month , or 8 month old fetus who would otherwise terminate it and raise it as their own . If the fetus can be removed safely from the womb , and someone else is prepared to take it , can there be any real justified reason to terminate ? <p> As far as the baby " crawling out of the womb " , are you saying that people should only be allowed to live if they are physically capable of mobility ? A person paralysed from the neck down may have some problem with that . Are you arguing that if two people are connected physically , that the stronger can kill the weaker ? Siamese twins ought to be alarmed . If I may be blunt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that the fetus is a living person . Our laws do n't permit the execution of murderers , rapists , child molesters , even if they are convicted beyond any shadow of a doubt , because we recognize the inherent value of life . We also do n't terminate the sick , mentally ill , or drug addicted , simply because they place an added burden on their caregivers or on society , or indeed , even if they would likely not survive without such assistance . <p> The definition of life is the crux of the matter . As soon as the definition of the living person is established , the rights of that person are inherent . <p> @ABarlow . None of the situations you describe involve individuals living in an essentially parasitic relationship attached to the body of an unwilling individual . There is no analogy to pregnancy involving people who have left the womb . But I guarantee you that if ever anyone was forced to make their way through life with a 35-year-old physically connected to their body and consuming their energy and nutrition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to terminate grown-ups . <p> As to your question , if every single fetus can be removed safely from the womb at any age and transferred into the hands of a family guaranteed to raise it in a loving , stable home , then perhaps we can talk . Let me know when you 've got that one worked out . <p> I was on the UVSS in 1989-90 when the Board first put this policy in place and it would not have achieved the 2/3 vote it required without my support . I was going to vote against it as I did n't want it to be used to take away the freedom of the Pro-Life club of the time . <p> The members of ND/CFS slate of the day swore up and down that taking a pro-life would never result in banning or restricting a pro-choice club . Five or so years ago the ND/CFS turned more Stalinist then when the UVSS had an International Socialist as it 's Chair . <p> The new Board can settle the claim before a massive legal bill hits the UVSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the far left control of the Society has created . <p> Notice : Your email may not yet have been verified .

@@1474234 <p> Fashion designer turned consultant Linda Lundstrom , who has more than 30 years experience in apparel manufacturing , conducts workshops that show clients how to increase output and cut turnaround time . ( JENNIFER ROBERTS For The Globe and Mail ) <p> Fashion designer turned consultant Linda Lundstrom , who has more than 30 years experience in apparel manufacturing , conducts workshops that show clients how to increase output and cut turnaround time . ( JENNIFER ROBERTS For The Globe and Mail ) <p> Superstition aside , it 's a telling indication that Ms. Lundstrom is focused on her financial well-being . It was just over two years ago that her Toronto-based namesake apparel brand filed for bankruptcy protection on a $1.9-million bank loan . In April , 2008 , Toronto manufacturer Eleventh Floor Apparel purchased the company and all of its assets , and installed Ms. Lundstrom as chief creative officer , a position from which she resigned in June last year . <p> Fast forward to the present , and Ms. Lundstrom has reserved for this interview one of the colourful meeting rooms at Verity , a networking and lifestyle club for women in downtown Toronto . Since launching her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these well-appointed , members-only spaces serve as her office . She has six clients , she says , mostly through word of mouth . <p> Broadly speaking , the niche Ms. Lundstrom has entered is referred to as fashion consulting . The term can be misleading , however , primarily because it gets confused with image or wardrobe consulting , in which experts help people decide what to wear . Nor does Ms. Lundstrom plan to do retail consulting , an area well served by many bigger companies that help businesses understand consumer behaviour , store operations and merchandising . <p> In many ways , her career move represents the arc of the industry : the most viable option -- aside from a book deal , perhaps -- available to those who , for one reason or another , are no longer in a position of creative or corporate authority but have a wealth of knowledge to share and are n't quite ready to hang up their hats . But as retail powerhouse and Club Monaco co-founder Joe Mimran points out , consulting can also be code for " unemployed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very active and really love the business , and for others , they just have n't found the right thing that they can dive into , " says Mr. Mimran , who launched his own consulting business , Joe Mimran and Associates , shortly after Ralph Lauren acquired Club Monaco in 1999 . <p> Since then , his biggest client has been Loblaw Cos . Ltd. , launching the PC Home Collection and Joe Fresh , the cheap-chic clothing line that bears his name . " There are also people who like a variety of work and like to go from project to project and make their own time and develop their own calendars and work on the projects they like to work on , " he adds . <p> Ms. Lundstrom 's biggest asset is her 30-plus years of experience in apparel manufacturing and she sees this as an area underserved by consultants . Since converting her factory in 2001 , she has been a practitioner and champion of Lean Manufacturing , the same efficiency-based system adopted by Toyota in the 1980s . She conducts Lean workshops that show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the need for more space , and believes this specialization , combined with her fashion savvy , bridges many spheres of business . <p> " I 'm a hybrid , really , " says the 59-year-old . " I know there might be a small audience that appreciates my peculiar combination of skills but I have to believe that there is an audience out there that would be interested in my services . " <p> If Wanda Berk 's consulting business is any indication , there is . Based in Toronto , she often works with private-label fashion clients and emerging designers to help source fabric , facilitate introductions with local manufacturers and help build and edit collections . She calls herself a " design and marketing consultant for the fashion industry " and has no website , saying she 's in a position to be selective with the clients she takes on . <p> " I think every company is realizing that they ca n't afford a person with 30 years of experience full-timebut they can certainly utilize them and bring them in and can have them involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is in her early 50s . " I think every type of business is finding that this type of outsourcing is a requirement now , in order to keep up with what 's going on ; it could be very costly otherwise . " <p> Like consultants in other fields , these experts typically work behind the scenes . " I think businessesprefer people do n't know I 'm there , " Ms. Berk says . " I had the days of ego , thank you very much . For me , it works perfectly . " <p> Exceptions would include high-profile design gurus such as Philippe Starck or Bruce Mau who bring inevitable cachet to projects that bear their name . Ms. Lundstrom has been recruited in both starring and unbilled roles . Her first client was Eleventh Floor Apparel , for whom she helped source fabrics . In a series of follow-up e-mails , she reveals that she has been brought on board to create a capsule collection for Urban Cotton Co. , a new Canadian brand that will be opening 41 stores across the country over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days in Santa Fe working on a photo shoot for a forthcoming line of products called " Craft It With Linda " in collaboration with a New York-based company . And that does n't include the two apparel manufacturing classes she teaches at George Brown College and her myriad speaking engagements . <p> Translation : she 's as busy now as she 's ever been but without the responsibilities that come with a business that employs 150 people . <p> Ms. Lundstrom determines her fees based on the scope of each project and she says they range from $500 to $5,000 a day " depending on the requirements of my client and the size of the audience or group . " <p> She will charge more for a large speaking engagement than helping to implement a Lean system . " This is the way I intend to earn my living , " says Ms. Lundstrom , who actually prefers to call herself a practitioner rather than a consultant ( her husband , Joel Halbert , was the CEO of her company for 25 years and he now acts as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in need of a short-term problem solving ) . She seems more at peace being detached from the brand that bears her name than at any time in recent memory . " I had built this thing and I thought , ' if a painter creates a piece of art and somebody purchases it , you do n't go along with it . ' It becomes theirs and I realized it was a very difficult kind of process but no one can say I 'm a quitter . " <p> Mr. Mimran 's biggest concern is that Canada is not brimming with large enough consumer or apparel brands to support a surfeit of independent consultants . " If you try to look at it from the designer end , none of them are big enough really to afford it . That 's why you do n't see any consultants who specialize in that area , " he explains . " You ca n't try to mine a customer base that does n't have the dollars . " <p> Which is not to say that consultants with less experience wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ projects . " You do need younger people to accumulate information , " Mr. Mimran explains . " Based on the way the business is operating or trending , itneeds to gather up that information and itcan sometimes do that with cheaper hours versus more expensive hours . " <p> But Ms. Lundstrom points out that there 's no substitute for years of experience . " See these scars ? " she jokes . " When I 'm teaching my class at Toronto 's George Brown College I give them examples of the time when a ship sank with fabric on it and what I didduring power outages . " <p> Frank Bober , founder and CEO of Stylesight , is proof that fashion consulting can translate into big business if it can be delivered globally in a way that non-fashion companies can understand . Having spent over two decades in both apparel design and private label manufacturing , the native New Yorker launched an online subscription-based site that delivers trend content and market forecasting to over 2,000 international companies . <p> " No one was addressing this fluid obtaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says by phone citing luxury retailers , electronics and automotive brands as clients . <p> Only premium subscription clients receive bi-annual in-person trend presentations from his team of consultants . " We 're the antithesis of b2c ; our criteria is how fast can you get off our site , not how long will you stay on . If we 're doing an efficient job , youcan get your information quickly and get to work . " <p> Mr. Bober believes all businesses stand to gain from fashion consultant-provided research . " Everybody wears clothes and the apparel world influences lifestyle in so many ways , " he says , noting that the entire style industry is an $850 billion worldwide . " We cover the whole gamut of activities , from colour to culture . " <p> On a much smaller scale , Ms. Lundstrom thinks she 's capable of the same thing , but even more customized for her clients . " I can look at a colour forecasting service or go to fabric shows and then I 'll kind of filter it all into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I 'm really skilled at addressing is women 35 and up . " <p> She says she will measure the success of Linda Lundstrom Works less by how much money she makes -- although she would like to earn enough to support her love of travel -- than by the quality of what she contributes . " I want to provide value . I want to be valued , " she says . " You know , I would hate to think that everything that with I 've learned and everything that I 've done -- that nobody but me and my company benefited from it .

" She ( the mayor ) impressed me tonight and I hope it opens up the door to the rest of the city . " <p> It had been quite a week for Ms. Gerow , who just one week ago under her own volition appeared before the Environment and Transportation Committee in support of the issue to allow chickens to be kept on London property . It was at that time she told the committee that she did have chickens on her property . And within a couple of days of that meeting , a city bylaw officer was knocking on her door . <p> " It did n't occur to me that they were actually going to come and give me a warning , " Ms. Gerow says . " I invited her ( the bylaw officer ) in and I thought that as soon as she saw that the chickens were well taken care of and that they were in a clean and safe environment that she is going to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this complaint . There is nothing to complain about other than the fact it is contravening the bylaw . I was very surprised . " <p> Council voted unanimously for a motion instructing city staff to find a way for Ms. Gerow to keep her hens . They also voted 11-7 in favour of a motion looking at food security and reviewing bylaws of other cities that allow chickens inside city limits , but voted against an actual backyard chicken pilot project . <p> Stephen Orser , Ward 4 councillor , was happy to see some movement on the issue . <p> " People educate themselves , many people change their minds . I thought it was retaliatory , and I started concentrating on it as soon as I hear . I was absolutely determined to do whatever it took within the bounds of the law to stop this retaliatory action , " said Coun. Orser , who was disappointed with the action the city took against Ms. Gerow . " Because she came forward on her own , as part of democracy , and she was penalized . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be part of democracy and when someone comes to City Hall and gets penalized it shuts the doors for everyone . I was upset to say the least . " <p> Coun.

Orser says . " We now have a chance to look at something that is happening in 300 other jurisdictions . " <p> City staff will be looking at bylaws , policies and procedures of other cities that allow backyard hens .

" There have been rumours ( on who may have filed the complaint ) that it was not a neighbour , but I do n't want to start anything till we have the actual facts . " <p> Coun. Orser thought it would also be a good idea to protect citizens who come forward with information . " Maybe it is time we have a law that protects people against repercussions , because people are scared about being prosecuted if somebody comes forward at city hall .

@@1474240 <h> It does have an Off button <p> Posted on Wednesday , May 5 , 2010 <p> Profs . Peter Todd and Henry Mintzberg offer their takes on the connected work world <p> To anyone who works in an office , it 's quite clear the proliferation of mobile computing technologies -- from BlackBerries to laptops to iPhones -- has a huge effect on the way managers and other workers go about their daily business . What may be surprising is that not many academics have researched these effects . <p> Desautels Faculty of Management Prof. Henry Mintzberg , who literally wrote the book on the nature of managerial work , and Dean Peter Todd , who has studied the effect of information technology on decision-making , shared with The Reporter some informed speculation about the way email , in particular , influences management work -- for better and for worse . They also offered advice for minimizing the downside . <p> Henry Mintzberg : <p> Studies have made clear that to manage is largely to communicate : many if not most managers spend at least half their time doing just that -- simply collecting , receiving , and disseminating information . Traditionally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether at meetings , chance encounters or telephone calls.Moreover , evidence from study after study , many conducted in the 1960s and 1970s , has indicated that managing is also an action-oriented , hectic job ; its activities characterized by brevity , variety , fragmentation , and interruptions -- galore . <p> This pattern may be inevitable in the effective practice of management , but only to a point . Beyond that , it can drive the practice over the edge , to a place from which it may be difficult to escape . <p> Managers used to be connected only when they were at work , or else within reach of a telephone , itself requiring a line of limited length . Then along came the cell phone , and later the BlackBerry . What joy to be perpetually connected . And what terror . <p> How fast , how hectic , how interrupted can managing be before the manager loses it entirely ? I suspect the answer may not be far away . Look around , or maybe in the mirror . Indeed , is the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in senior and middle management positions in those banks , insurance companies and credit rating agencies so harassed that they lost any sense of reflecting thoughtfully on their important decisions ? <p> Have you tried to use email to schedule a meeting lately ? How many did it take ? At what point might it have been easier to just pick up the phone -- to have become a little more interactive : " Well I can move my 4:00 appointment to 4:15 if you can shift your 4:30 one to 5:00 , " etc . How many emails to do that ? <p> The danger of email is that by giving the illusion of being in control , it may in fact be robbing managers of the control they require . How much easier it is to send off a bunch of emails than to get into an airplane , or even walk down the hall . But at what expense , given that time in front of a screen is not time in front of a person ? <p> Email can drive too much managing over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too superficial , putting managers out of touch with the very practice of effective managing . <p> One thing we have learned about managing , and apply religiously in the programs we have developed at McGill , is that managers today desperately need to slow down , step back , and reflect thoughtfully with each other on their own experiences . <p> Of course , every executive education program requires use of the Off button on BlackBerries , iPhones and the like . But maybe the most important thing we teach in these programs is that the Off button works outside the classroom too : at home , and on holidays , but most important at work , itself . One corporate CEO commented about email that , " You can never escape . You ca n't go anywhere to contemplate . " Not true . You can go anywhere you please . It 's your choice : will you control this technology , so that it works for you , or will it capture you and undermine your practice of management , not to mention that of those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well be at stake . <p> Peter Todd : <p> Mobile computing is particularly adapted to the way managers work , and that goes some distance to explaining the tremendous success of the BlackBerry and the increasing proliferation of smart phones among managers . Usefulness of a technology is known to be at the core of a decision to adopt . <p> But we also know that every new technology has both intended ( and presumably beneficial ) effects , and unintended consequences that are often negative . <p> So what is the reality for wireless computing and communication tools ? Do they allow managers to better cope with the demands on their attention and leverage brief moments in time between interruptions to complete tasks ? Or do they drive managers to an even more frenzied level of fragmentation , pushing away any meaningful time for thought and reflection to the point where they can only manage at the level of the Tweet ? <p> The not surprising answer is : it depends . It depends on how we harness the technology , making it work for us rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about how to use mobile devices and communication technology . It is important to realize that there are times to text , to send email , and perhaps even to Tweet , but there are also times to talk and times to get in an airplane ( as disagreeable as that has become ) . Personal interaction remains the basis on which we build trust , create shared vision , motivate and empower . <p> But the technology affords the opportunity to create managerial white space -- time saved from other activities that can be used for reflection . <p> At the same time , email can bring us too much information . Someone who handles 100 e-mails per day as they arrive would need to deal with 100 small tasks each day , or one every five minutes or so in an eight-hour work day . Such constant distraction probably hurts more than it helps productivity and effectiveness . <p> Alternatively , some may judiciously maintain focus on the tasks at hand and deal with email in the last 100 minutes of the day . They are likely tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the urgent and the important but also the inane . Productivity will likely be low and this may be when error begins to creep in most . <p> So how can you manage ? <p> Here are some strategies : <p> Reduce the messages you send . This is the way to make sure you are not part of the problem . The more traffic you put on a network and the more people you involve in a communication the more email you should expect to deal with . Count not just the number of messages you send in a day but the number of people you include on those messages . Do what you can to reduce the number of email you send to those that are important and relevant . <p> Control via technological assistants . Fight fire with fire . The technology itself has built-in mechanisms for regulating and organizing information flow . Few managers take good advantage of these . Filters and rules can be used to sort and prioritize incoming messages <p> Block off time . You can choose to respond to emails only within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' no email , no meeting , no call times ' in your calendar . <p> Turn off prompts . Even more simply , turn off message prompts and turn on your out-of-office message ( whether you are or are not ) to let people know responses may be delayed . <p> Create a fresh start . Those who feel completely overwhelmed and hopelessly behind have sometimes taken to declaring ' email bankruptcy ' ; out with the old email address and in with a new one . With that fresh start there is a possibility to develop better habits about how to send , receive and respond to messages . <p> Currently you have JavaScript disabled .

The incidents , he said , showed visa officers have too much latitude . <p> For a deeply embarrassed Harper government , the pledge and apology were an effort to repair relations with a country it has been assiduously courting : India 's booming economy makes it a major target for attempts to build trade ties to the East . <p> And at home , the visa flap wo n't help Conservative efforts to woo a diaspora of more than one million Indo-Canadians ; some were offended by the insult , others by the apology . <p> Canada and India now chalk up the incidents to overworked immigration officers in the New Delhi embassy , where about half of the 360 staff members work on immigration matters .

Perhaps that is because unlike Marxism , conservatism is not an ideology or dogma , despite what most people may think .

It really makes little sense to lump all these issues willy-nilly into one or another camp . I can never fathom why denial of global warming is a reflexive conservative dogma ; I 'd have sworn I heard somewhere that some conservatives have kids for whose future they care . Why in the world then should they be pooh-poohing the possible consequences of global warming ? <p> Similarly , the anti-conservative side has its own fault lines as well . Not all treat religion as a cruel hoax , for example , and some conservatives even believe in evolution . And while the conservatives ca n't resist their dreary old anti-CBC tirades , given the low estate of CBC-TV these days I 'm not even sure those who passionately embrace public broadcasting would lift a finger to defend Mother Corp . <p> Besides , there are culture wars within culture wars , some of which actually unite conservatives and their mortal enemies . For example , our politicians in Ottawa seem to live in an impermeable bubble of their own . The quite extraordinary spectacle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public their expenses speaks volumes about the distance between the political world and the real one . <p> The fact that the NDP has been the most intransigent in its righteous determination to keep the public 's nose out of its accounts has bewildered the faithful across the land . What are they thinking ? What are they hiding ? Have they learned nothing from the Labour Party 's humiliation caught charging the state for personal expenses ? Has the culture of " The Hill " corrupted ( with a few honorable exceptions ) the entire caucus ? <p> It 's hard not to see the NDP position on this issue as a betrayal of what the party stands for . Add to this that about a third of the caucus may for the second time vote against the long-gun registry . This would , of course , confuse the culture warriors because the NDP would then be standing with the Harper government and its supporters - Canada 's own equivalent of the National Rifle Association . These positions will surely test the loyalty of the 14 per cent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowing it will not form a government . <p> On both counts , frantic efforts are being made to make this rogue NDP caucus come to its collective senses . But the fact such efforts are necessary at all tells its own dismal story . <p> Ignatieff is right : Stephen Harper has only just begun his dangerous escalation of the culture wars . There are ominous indications that he has had some surprising success in moving middle-of-the-road Canadians toward his regressive political values . Winning them back will surely be easier if our side does n't get trapped in its own unjust culture wars .

They ? ve been working on it since the fall ; today is launch day . <p> ? We are launching a high-altitude balloon into the stratosphere to take pictures of space , ? explains Kaitlyn Hunder , one of the students who built the payload container . The box contains sensors to detect atmospheric conditions that will be transmitted back to Earth , along with a GPS transponder .

This is a great opportunity to see kids go and try something new. ? <h> The shot seen ? round the world <p> As Rafaat and the students fill the balloon with helium , James Ewen of the BEAR team goes over the details of the mission . <p> The Balloon Experiments in Amateur Radio ( BEAR ) team started in 2000 , Ewen says . He and some other local radio fans heard of a group that launched a balloon in B.C. , and wanted to try it themselves . <p> They launched and retrieved BEAR-1 that May 27 , sending a small Winnie the Pooh doll skyward in a hexagonal capsule . Another launch followed that August . ? Ever seen a dog chase a ball over and over again ? ? jokes BEAR member Garrett Sloan . ? We send a balloon up and go chase it ! ? <p> Rafaat , then a teacher in Hanna , says he ? d heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weather balloon and wanted his students to give it a shot . Stumbling across the BEAR site , he teamed up with them and launched SABLE-1 on May 20 , 2006 . <p> It didn ? t work . <p> ? We didn ? t have enough helium and it got caught in a tree , ? Rafaat says , crashing after just seven minutes . SABLE-2 took off , but was never found due to a glitch in its tracker . <p> SABLE-3 captured a perfect shot of the Earth from 117,597 feet ( about four times the height of Mount Everest ) on Aug 11 , 2007 . The BEAR team celebrated and put the picture on their website . <p> It became the shot seen ? round the world . After it was spotted by someone at the Canadian consulate in Los Angeles , it was soon forwarded to popular websites such as Gizmodo , Digg and Slashdot , drawing tens of thousands of hits in 24 hours . ? It just kind of went viral , ? Ewen says . <p> Interview requests rolled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hong Kong . Rafaat went on The Discovery Channel . BEAR had gone big . <h> The launch <p> And so has the weather balloon . After several minutes of helium , the balloon is about six feet across and has enough lift to support the payload . The team prepares to attach the box . <p> The crew drags the balloon out of the garage , weighing it down with student Carter Buchanan . ? It was hard to keep it down , ? he says later . ? It almost felt like it would pick me off my feet. ? <p> He and the others attach the payload . The wind whips the balloon around , almost sending it into a basketball hoop . At 7:08 a.m. , they let go . Within 30 seconds it is but a tiny pearl in the grey sky . It starts to rain . <h> The chase <p> The balloon climbs at about 660 feet ( 201 metres ) a minute over the next 167 minutes , according to the BEAR team , zipping along at up 141 km/hour as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars to chase it . Rafaat is tense as he barrels down Highway 2 towards Legal in the driving rain . He frets about radio reception , and curses a slow-moving quad headed to the Rainmaker Rodeo .

The balloon grows as the atmosphere thins , reducing the pressure on it , until it ? s about 35 feet wide ? nearly six times its original size . ? We call it the bungalow balloon. ? Eventually , the pressure becomes too much and the balloon bursts ? silently , due to near-vacuum conditions . <p> At least , that ? s what supposed to happen . The balloon peaks at 110,216 feet ( about 34 kilometres up ) , sinks , and then rises again . Rafaat and the BEARs are flummoxed . Has it stabilized ? Is it floating ? Will it float @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , SABLE-4 ? s altitude nose-dives . It ? s popped . But it ? s falling way too fast ? about 4,300 feet per minute . The chute must have tangled in the balloon , Rafaat concludes . SABLE hits the ground 26 minutes later , and they lose its tracking signal . <p> The team starts a painstaking search , crawling along country roads to detect SABLE ? s beacon . The beacon is line-of-sight and signals once a minute ; it ? ll be a miracle if they detect it in this terrain . <p> Rafaat sends most of the students home . This could be SABLE-2 all over again , he and others moan ? a long , arduous search , finding nothing . <h> A lucky break <p> It ? s three hours later .

The other trackers verify the signal and converge . <p> Five hours into the mission , at about noon , the trackers locate SABLE-4 in a farmer ? s field west of Range Road 75 near Rochfort Bridge ? about 100 kilometres northwest of St. Albert . The balloon ? s shredded , and the parachute and antenna are a twisted mess , but the box is barely dented . The poem , camera , and instruments are fine . The weary team takes a celebratory photo . <p> Chase Jeffels is the only student on site . Fortunately , he ? s also the cameraman and filmed everything . ? I would have been disappointed if they ? d found it without me , ? he says . <p> Back at the school , the team downloads the photos from the SABLE camera .

Finally , a new production of that venerable classic has come along to steal my heart once again . <p> I doubt that another nor-for-profit theatre in Canada could duplicate the technical complexity and sophistication of this show , or match an acting ensemble where the quality starts at the top and does n't diminish as you go down the ladder of roles . <p> You begin by saluting director Tim Carroll , whose reading of the play is neither too dark for children , nor too fluffy for adults . By having J.M. Barrie himself at the side of the stage , reading his own stage directions and commenting on what 's coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And with the unmatched Tom McCamus playing Barrie ( as well as the superlatively swaggering Captain Hook ) , you get the kind of depth that makes you realize why this work is such a true classic . <p> Yes , the hidden fears of losing one 's parents , or one 's children , are explored and in such a way that you will feel your heart ache every now and then , but this is n't some Freudian nightmare out to scare everyone to death . <p> Joy is the common thread here : the joy of telling a story well , the joy of playing fantastical characters and , above all , the joy of being in a theatre . <p> At the head of the praise list is director/adaptor Carroll , who knows Barrie , loves him and makes us know and love him as well . His staging is past clever into the higher mathematics of theatrical art and -- aided by Carolyn M. Smith 's magical set and costumes -- causes eruptions of delight time and time again . <p> Kevin Fraser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avoid flying wires and other bits of theatrical trickery , but it leads him into a more painterly style of presentation , with moments such as Peter 's arrival at Neverland , or the first sight of Hook 's Jolly Roger , that will take your breath away . <p> The music of Claudio Vena is fulsomely emotional , the flying by Foy convinces throughout and the fights of Simon Fon are splendidly flamboyant . <p> But it 's the actors -- oh , the actors ! -- that make it memorable . Michael Therriault is the most serious Peter Pan I have ever seen , which , ironically , makes him the most engaging , since we are totally involved with his pain and struggles . This is n't some aging skating star in green tights , or an overgrown chorus boy raising his voice to sound young .

From his home , the CEO of mining giant Teck Resources Ltd. can count the boats lined up in the port of Vancouver to carry Teck 's coal to the world . <p> " When the customer stops sending ships , you can see it , " says Mr. Lindsay , 51 , a former investment banker whose youthful face belies a turbulent five years as CEO . <p> In December , 2008 , shortly after Teck closed a monumental $14-billion deal to buy the Fording coal business , the ships quit appearing . Their absence underscored the economic meltdown that , in the next several months , threatened to sink Canada 's largest diversified metals producer . <p> Today , the ships are back and Mr. Lindsay , having finessed a difficult credit restructuring and acquired a Chinese investor , is breathing a big sigh of relief .

We were amazed , on Sept. 30 , 2008 , that the banks still lent us the money to buy Fording ... even though Lehman Brothers had gone down , Citibank had been saved , and Goldman and Morgan Stanley had been converted to banksto save them . <p> We had a fiduciary obligation to do everything we could to close the deal , which we did . Then , you knew you were in for a very tough time . So you move into action ; you go full out .

I had time to reflect and go , " Wow , this is going to be tough . " <p> How do you feel now ? <p> It has been pretty intense but I 'm proud of where we ended up . We worked hard to be well positioned in key commodities that the world needs , particularly China . In the last five years , we 've done a lot of building . We now have $1,000 of resources per share , and at much lower commodityprices . We used to have less than $500 . <p> In the next five years , it is more about converting the resources we got hold of into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different type of growth . It does n't mean we wo n't do acquisitions , but they are n't needed as much because of what we did in the past five years . <p> And you have a Chinese partner ? <p> The Chinese coming on board was the 12th step in our 12-step plan . There is a bit of method in my madness - I called it the " 12 steps " on purpose , as opposed to " 12 points " or whatever . <p> In October-November 2008 , when the world was in freefall and nobody knew where the bottom was , you needed a manageable plan everyone could relate to . The 12th step was to find a strategic investor . We had several choices - major mining companies , major customers - but to get what is effectively China 's sovereign wealth fund was by far the most preferable . <p> Are there lessons about working with the Chinese ? <p> This did n't happen overnight . I 've been going to China for a long time . There is a point at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there long enough that they know you . Then you can probably do business more readily . <p> Our shareholder China Investment Corp. wanted exposure to commodities but they did not need to control them . There are no commercial arrangements , as such . But we are selling coal to China , which we were n't before . They have facilitated introductions . <p> But do n't Canadian companies worry about the Chinese compulsion to control ? <p> It 's case by case . CIC is a passive investor ; they would n't want to take a position over 20 per cent . They have 6 per cent of the votes and 17 per cent of the equity . They did n't even have a board seat for almost a year - and we invited them . <p> At the end of the day , there should be real value in this relationship . But you wo n't know till probably five years later how much they helped you build the company . <p> How have you enhanced your coal business ? <p> We sold zero to China two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of our coal production . We will likely drop that percentage a little bit this year because the rest of the world has come back now . You have to strike a balance between traditional and new customers . <p> Can this be sustained ? <p> There are still serious issues in Europe but I do n't think 1.3 billion smart , hard-working people in China care that much about that . They are working hard to build themselves a better life . That has n't changed because of Greece and Spain - and they need commodities to do that . And the Chinese government has been the best at managing its economy that we 've seen in 20 years . <p> Yet here in North America , everyone is bombarded with U.S.-centric media . They describe the world from their point of view and , if the U.S. is not doing well , then people think , " Well , that 's it for commodities . " <p> Is there a concern that , having gone through such a crisis , you are becoming too timid ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would not be an illogical conclusion given what we went through . The mandate of any mining company 's CEO , board and senior management is during their tenure to secure three to five large , long-life ore bodies to sustain the company for stakeholders in the next generation . <p> We did that and now we are resource-rich . If we see opportunities we will look carefully at those . But I do n't think there is much in the way of big game-changers out there . A lot of that has already happened - and we participated . <p> During the rationalization of 2006-2007 , did the Canadian mining industry get hollowed out ? <p> Yes , hollowing out did occur . Noranda , Falconbridge , Inco , and Alcan all went quickly . They were leading companies that employed a lot of people - and they required services , from finance to legal , accounting and engineering . There is no question that has diminished substantially , and it is a loss for Canada . We said so at the time and people did n't accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost . <p> Having said that , the mining industry in Canada is as entrepreneurial as you will find . New companies get built up to take the place of the Norandas and Falconbridges . But there will be a gap for quite a few years . <p> I can assure you this would never happen in Australia ; it would never happen in Chile . People build national champions in other countries . In the U.S. and Britain , they support and admire their champions . For some reason we did n't take that approach . <p> But wo n't the Australians simply tax their champions to death ? <p> The proposed mining tax is a stunning development in Australia . We will have to wait and watch . We went through a version of that in Alberta when a new resource royalty regime was put in and there was a big backlash . Billions of dollars of investments were cancelled - although a lot of it was due to economy meltdown .

@@1519239 <p> UBC professor emeritus Robert Hare , an internationally renowned expert on psychopaths , has offered his side of the story in a heated dispute over the boundaries of academic freedom . One of his adversaries is his former graduate student , SFU psychology professor Stephen Hart , who is also a highly regarded researcher in the area of psychopathology . <p> In a 14-page paper posted on Hare 's Web site , the UBC academic responds to an article published in the International Journal of Forensic Mental Health , which Hart edits . According to Hare , the IJFMH article maintained that he had not complied with " accepted standards " of scientific discourse when he threatened to file a lawsuit in 2007 against a different academic journal , Psychological Assessment , in response to an evaluation of his work . <p> " This manuscript was difficult to write , " Hare mentions in a commentary at the start of his on-line rebuttal . " Given the circumstances , I felt I had no choice but to respond to what I consider unfair characterizations of my motives and actions in a long-standing controversy . " <p> The issue arose in 2007 when Psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychologist Jennifer Skeem and Glasgow Caledonian University psychology professor David Cooke . It dealt with the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised , a screening tool Hare created to measure psychopathy . Hare collects royalties from its widespread use . <p> Hare characterizes the paper by Skeem and Cooke as an " opinion piece " , adding that descriptions of his work were " so obviously off the mark that anyone familiar with psychopathy would have picked up on the misrepresentations " . Hare claims that he and a colleague , Craig Neumann , were not given an opportunity to reply to the article in the same issue . According to the UBC professor emeritus , Skeem and Cooke revised the article , but it contained " many of the same misrepresentations " . That 's when Hare warned the journal that he might file a lawsuit . <p> " I threatened litigation only after Craig Neumann and I made a concerted attempt to resolve the matter with Skeem and Cooke through discourse , " Hare writes . " We were not satisfied with merely publishing a rebuttal to an article that continued to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> This month 's issue of Psychological Assesment published the Skeem and Cooke article , followed by a commentary from Hare and Neumann , and a rebuttal from Skeem and Cooke . Hare states in the paper on his Web site that he has no intention of proceeding with the lawsuit . <p> " The crux of the dispute has to do with assertions by Skeem and Cooke that we consider criminal behavior to be an essential component of the psychopathy construct , " Hare writes . " We do not , and have said as much many times in print . " <p> University of South Florida researchers Norman Poythress and John Petrila then weighed in with the lead article in the June issue of the International Journal of Forensic Mental Health . In their abstract , they wrote : " We conclude that the use of threats of litigation to suppress the publication of articles accepted for publication in scientific journals strike at the heart of the peer review process , may have a chilling effect on the values at the core of academic freedom , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ models and products . " <p> Hare claims Poythress and Petrila 's article wrongly implied that his lawsuit threat against Psychological Assessment was intended to protect the Psychopathy Checklist-Revised . <p> The editor of the International Journal of Forensic Mental Health , Stephen Hart , is listed as a facilitator with a U.K.-based company called Violence Risk Assessment Training and Consultancy . Cooke is also among the listed facilitators . <p> Hare points out that Hart and Cooke have been collaborating for several years in the development of a new tool to assess psychopathy . " This raises the possibility of a conflict of interest in making editorial decisions , particularly when opting not to seek peer review , " Hare writes . <p> He notes that Hart , Poythress , and Petrila " argued for open discussion and peer review " , but claims that they did n't ask for his side of the story . Hare remarks that his lawsuit threat was issued in 2007 , and Psychological Assessment received the final versions of the articles in 2008 . <p> The UBC professor emeritus closes his article by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would be characterized as someone who tries to hinder research into psychopathy , given that he has " directly and indirectly facilitated the careers of so many researchers " . <p> " Particularly disturbing is the suggestion by some that my concerns about the Skeem and Cooke article were motivated by pecuniary implications , " Hare adds . " Had I taken the route of many forensic psychologists I would long ago have been a wealthy man . " <p> To support this claim , Hare notes that he has testified in court only twice , once in Canada and once in the United States . In both instances , he states , he refused to accept a fee . <p> " One can imagine how many times I have been offered lucrative legal assignments ( many with " ? name your price ' ) , all of which I declined , " he writes . <h> David H <h> Charlie Smith <p> Jun 14 , 2010 at 9:58am <p> David H. : <p> I quote from Dr. Hare 's paper : " As a result of not following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Petrila and Hart failed to give an impartial and complete account of the situation . Their actions resulted in publication and circulation of a seriously biased account of events , and a commentary in the June 11 issue of Science , which noted that there are several sides to every issue . It also contained a comment by the Publisher of APA that threatened litigation has never prevented publication of an article in an APA journal , but that such a threat would lead to an investigation of the legitimacy of the charges . " <p> If Science is quoting the APA journal saying that threatened litigation has never prevented publication of an article , and if Hare is the only one who threatened litigation , then I think it 's fair to assume that this is a reference to Hare . I merely wrote that Science published a commentary on the controversy , which could be broadly interepreted to cover the controversy over people who threaten to sue academic journals .

Jack Layton is a serious leader and he would n't just let his deputy freelance on core policy and let her remain in the role . <p> To his credit , Jack Layton apologized to the Israeli ambassador and made clear her views do not represent the NDP 's ; but in terms of actual consequences to her ? Not a thing . <p> Even her " apology " was a bit confusing .

Except she goes on to deny that she did anything of the kind : <p> " I reject the allegation that I hate Israel , and I reject the assertion that I said that Israel is illegitimate or an abomination .

Not that she 's sorry for saying it ( that was so last paragraph ) , not that she was somehow taken out of context - she simply rejects that she said it . Except of course she clearly did . <p> Oh , and she also called for that boycott , divestment and sanctions , which she makes no apology for whatsoever . <p> And before the haters of Israel start once again bombarding me with hate mail , please note that it 's not just me who feels that she clearly said it and was wrong for doing so : Jack Layton clearly agrees with me - or else why did he apologize to the Israeli ambassador ? <p> And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in demotions for MPs as a form of punishment , given that they have not just called for multiple cabinet ministers to resign over the years but much more . when Ruby Dhalla was dealing with her trumped-up charges last year , the NDP did n't only call for her to resign as opposition critic but went to so far as to suggest she should be thrown in jail ( and to be crystal clear , no , I 'm not suggesting Davis should be put in jail , just making the point that the NDP clearly believes that sanctioning MPs with role demotions - including opposition MPs - for transgressions is a legitimate form of punishment ) . <p> But I guess the question for Layton is if MPs in the NDP caucus are n't allowed to simply freelance policy ( as per Thomas Mulcair ) - and you buy that if a hypothetical deputy leader freelanced on something core to the NDP like universal , public health care or foreign aid then they would no longer be deputy leader - then why is support for Israel any less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @

@@1533230 <h> Get rid of Vancouver viaduct , copy SF 's ' spectacular ' choice : planner <p> Demolishing Vancouver 's viaduct mini-freeway connecting Main Street and Strathcona to downtown is a no-brainer according to a planner who saw the " spectacular " results similar moves created in San Francisco . <p> If that city 's experience is any guide , removing the vestigial freeway from Vancouver 's heart wo n't create traffic messes , but will knit together now divided neighbourhoods and create bustling new public spaces , according to Michael Alexander . <p> Alexander moved to Vancouver after 42 years living in San Francisco , where he was on that city 's major planning body . He said the 1989 earthquake that fractured two of the city 's freeway spurs proved in some ways to be a blessing . San Franciscans debated whether to restore the freeways , eventually deciding to tear them down . <p> One spur was the Embarcadero freeway that curved around the northeast waterfront and into Chinatown , delivering drivers to the outskirts of the financial district . Without the multi-level freeway and its various off-ramps , traffic surely would snarl in such a busy corner of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " negligible " Alexander said , as motorists used surface streets to find various other routes to their destinations . <p> Eliminating the freeway barrier caused a once " derelict " row of piers to quickly be transformed into " the most spectacular addition to San Francisco 's waterfront , " Alexander told The Tyee . The once " essentially dead " Ferry Building now houses one of the most vibrant farmers markets in the Bay Area and forms the centre of a busy destination for locals and tourists alike . <p> Similarly , Alexander said , the demolition of a cracked , raised stretch of freeway dividing the city 's Hayes Valley and replacing it with a surface boulevard has enabled that area to become " the city 's hottest new neighbourhood . " <p> Alexander , who has urged Vancouver 's city council to tear down the viaduct , expects results similar to the San Francisco experience . <p> " It would open up six blocks owned by the city of Vancouver , " said Alexander , who pointed out the raised roadway was intended to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never was built . <p> If the viaduct came down , what should the city do with the freed up land ? Alexander said dense housing developments slated to be built close to the renovated BC Place stadium and a nearby entertainment zone instead should be built where the viaduct stands . Having so much housing close to the noise and milling crowds that come with late night events is " a political nightmare in the making for city council " Alexander predicted . <p> Defenders of the viaduct say those who want it gone , led by Vision city councillor Geoff Meggs , are chasing big development dollars at the expense of commuters . Alexander said the freeway teardowns in San Francisco did create " several billion dollars worth of new development . " But the average citizen gained many benefits as well , he stressed , including a more walkable , livable city . <p> And when the viaduct was closed during the Olympics the traffic disruption was " minimal " according to Alexander . <p> Tonight Vancouver 's city councilors will debate whether to authorize a $695,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> 1 .

Remove both viaducts with either a connection between Georgia and Dunsmuir west of GM Place or cul-de-sac of Georgia and Dunsmuir . <p> 6 .

@@1533240 <p> An Alberta commission recommended adding four seats to the province 's legislature Thursday , a move critics say satisfies a growing population without having to carve up government-friendly rural ridings . <p> The Alberta Electoral Boundaries Commission final report gives two new seats to Calgary , one to Edmonton and one to booming Fort McMurray , as previously proposed . It also redraws a number of existing ridings - including two held by members of the Wildrose Alliance , viewed as a threat to the long-ruling Progressive Conservatives . <p> As such , opposition parties charge that the new boundaries are gerrymandered to favour the PCs , while ignoring urban voters and failing to anticipate population growth over the next decade . They point to a letter , using government letterhead , Alberta Deputy Premier Doug Horner sent three months ago urging partisan boundary changes . He later apologized . <p> " The Tory caucus fingerprints are all over this report , " said deputy Liberal leader Laurie Blakeman .

He said he was disappointed the commission " could n't be more concerned with the people of Alberta than concerned with the PC party . " <p> If the new map is approved by MLAs , Calgary will have 25 seats , Edmonton 19 , and the rest of Alberta 43 . Each region has roughly the same percentage of the legislature as they do the population . <p> However , it will leave Alberta legislators with fewer constituents - about 40,000 - than counterparts in other provinces . Ontario averages about 120,000 citizens per provincial representative , Quebec 62,000 and B.C. about 52,000 .

The New Democrats agreed that " generally , the boundaries make sense . " <p> But , in a minority opinion , commissioner member Allyson Jeffs said two new seats , not one , should have been given to Edmonton , which now has the same number of seats as it had in 1996 after losing one eight years ago . During that time , the city population grew by 27 per cent with no new seats . <p> Edmonton Mayor Stephen Mandel , however , said his city 's new total is " not unreasonable " given current populations , but the failure to predict growth is a major downfall of the commission .

@@1551232 <p> CHESTER , NOVA SCOTIA -- It is a dark and stormy night in Haven , Maine . A deluge of almost Biblical proportions : Thunder , lightning , impenetrable fog , hailstones the size of your fist . . . overcast , with chance of locusts . <p> Fortunately , the worst of this unnaturally inclement weather is merely computer-generated . And we are , in fact , nowhere near Maine , which is actually about 700 kilometres due west . <p> Welcome to the Nova Scotia set of Haven , a new Canadian co-production debuting Monday night at 10 p.m. on Showcase . <p> This particular day on location , unlike the previously described pilot episode , the skies are clear and things appear deceptively normal . Normal , at least , for your basic police procedural -- a male cop and a female FBI agent , guns drawn , make their way slowly through an abandoned boat yard , surrounded on all sides by grounded , derelict hulks . <p> Suddenly , a piercing scream , as a frantic young woman comes running toward them . From my vantage point behind the camera , I 'm not sure exactly what her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do with another scene , shot earlier in the day , where a guy serenely strumming a guitar on deck is attacked and tossed overboard by a dark , mysterious stranger . <p> Pretty much business as usual in Haven , a quaint little seaside community where very strange things happen to very odd people on a fairly regular basis . <p> Which is to say , we 're in Stephen King country , Haven having been essentially extrapolated from King 's 2005 pulp novella , The Colorado Kid -- in much the same way executive producer Shawn Piller previously turned King 's Dead Zone into a successful , and again Canadian-made ( in Quebec and Ontario ) series . <p> But , occasional weird weather notwithstanding , it 's not about the special effects . The emphasis here , Piller says , is on character and tone . <p> " I 'm pretty excited about this , " he enthuses over lunch in a converted local curling rink , " because we put our eggs in the basket of character and look and feel . I mean , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but we ca n't compete with the budget of Lost , and we ca n't compete with Fringe . . . <p> " We do have some very cool effects in the first couple of episodes . Some episodes are going to be big on special effects . Some are going to be small little character plays . I 'm hoping the star of the show is really going to be the characters . " <p> The residents of Haven share a common bond : Powers and abilities far beyond those of mortal man . Or , as they prefer to refer to them , " troubles . " <p> For example , the inclement weather in Monday night 's episode , inadvertently caused -- spoiler here -- by a local shopkeeper ( Toronto-born Nicole de Boer , a Piller colleague on both Dead Zone and Star Trek : Deep Space Nine ) whose relative state of emotional distress has a direct and often devastating effect on the climate . <p> " If you piss her off , the weather changes , " Piller explains . " We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives birth to a baby every week . Which makes it sound like we 're constantly dissing women . . . but the idea is that you can take any sort of situation and exponentially project and externalize it . And it becomes a bigger metaphor . " <p> For example , the aforementioned stoic male cop ( played by Lucas Bryant , who hails from Elmira , Ont. ) , a man who quite literally feels nothing -- slam his hand in a car door , whack him over the head with a plank , the worst he 's going to get is mildly peeved . <p> Bryant 's reluctant partner -- and emotional opposite -- is a newly arrived FBI field agent , portrayed by Emily Rose , who turns out to have more in common with the local folk than she could ever have suspected . <p> " She 's just kind of doing her thing , " explains Rose , whose credits include the similarly surreal John from Cincinnati and Jericho . " She rolls up into this town and she is researching this murder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . There 's something else going on , and it is somehow connected to her own forgotten past . <p> " That kind of turns her head . I mean , she 's an FBI investigator . She 's also an orphan . So why has n't she been able to solve the mystery of her own roots ? That 's got to bug you . And that 's kind of what kicks off our first episode . " <p> " She 's basically Kyra Sedgwick meets Frances McDormand in Fargo , in Cameron Diaz 's body , " gushes Piller . " Emily can do the wit and the charm and the humour and the banter , and she can kick in doors , and she plays the heart of it , enough to make my mom cry . <p> " That was our goal with both Haven and the Dead Zone : Making my mom cry . Every week , we would turn in a cut , and , you know , I would get an email from my dad , ' Yup , your mom cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ' " <p> But Piller does n't want to give the impression that Haven is all gloom and doom . <p> " It really is a lot of fun , " he insists . " That 's what I love about Stephen King . People do n't give him credit for being hilarious . But if you look at Dead Zone . . . well , I thought it was funny , or at least satirical . Misery , all of those books , are really funny , because they 're quirky and odd and they examine things that are odd and true , but with a little slant . <p> " I can just see King at his typewriter , you know , twinkle in his eye , trying to scare the s--- out of you , but also trying to make you laugh . <p> " We try to do the same thing , through our characters and setting .

@@1551233 <p> Two stories concerning the donation of gametes - sperm and ova - appeared recently in the media . <p> One related that a " virtual " sperm and egg bank is being established that will only accept offers to donate from " beautiful " people . Internet polling will determine who is beautiful enough to do so . The goal - informed by the principle that " everyone deserves a beautiful child " - is to enable " ugly " people to have beautiful children . <p> The other story was that New Zealand will possibly allow " double donation " ; that is , would-be parents would be able to use both donated ova and sperm to create embryos ( a practice that is not legally prohibited , although still fairly uncommon , in Canada ) . As Diane Allen of the Infertility Network argues , this " can not be construed as any form of infertility ' treatment , ' but , rather , the deliberate manufacture of babies to meet consumer demand . " <p> What do we , as a society , owe to the resulting children , especially when we are complicit in their coming into being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? They are the people most profoundly and directly affected . They will live their lives as " donor-conceived adults , " " genetic orphans , " as many of them call themselves . <p> Donor conception may be a completely avoidable human tragedy in the making , one for which we might be holding a truth and reconciliation commission at some future date , when offspring ask , as some are already doing , " How could you have done this to us ? How could you have allowed this to happen ? " <p> Is donor conception the 21st-century version of the wrongs we now recognize we did to some children in the 20th century ? Are we repeating in a new context and in new ways the terrible errors and grave injustices that occurred with Australia 's " stolen generation " of aboriginal children , the United Kingdom 's " home children " sent to Canada and other British Commonwealth countries , and the " scoop " of native children from reserves into Canadian residential schools and white adoptive homes , all of which deliberately separated children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , our intentions , as is true in donor conception , were to " do good . " In donor conception , however , we primarily intend to " do good " to the adults who want a child , rather than to the child , as was the motive - although a grossly mistaken belief - in the other historical wrongs I have mentioned . <p> As an old human-rights axiom warns , an unalloyed intention to " do good " has its dangers : " Nowhere are human rights more threatened than when we act purporting to do only good . " Our desire to do good can blind us to the risks and harms that are involved . Is that true of gamete donation ? <p> An argument that is used to support donor conception is that the child would not exist otherwise and , therefore , should not complain . One young donor-conceived woman , confronted with this argument , responded , " If I were the result of rape , I would still be glad to be alive , but that does n't mean I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Adoption is our longest-standing experience of dealing with a situation where children have been intentionally disconnected from their biological parents . <p> In the past , adoption records were permanently sealed . We now recognize that as being harmful to the adopted person and potentially so to the birth family , and unethical . Yet donor-conceived Canadians do not know who at least one of their biological parents is , because donors here are allowed to remain anonymous , which is no longer the case in a growing list of countries ( including Britain , Australia and New Zealand among many others ) . That also is unethical and , if we continue with gamete donation , it must be changed . <p> Adoptive parents were once advised by " professionals " - as the parents of donor-conceived children have been and still often are - not to tell their children of their origins ; they were told that secrecy was best . This , too , should be changed , not least because people excluded from a secret that relates to them in some major way , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the secret is creates a situation of doubt , which can be very difficult for them to cope with psychologically . Moreover , such secrets can damage - sometimes even destroy - family relationships once they come to light , as most inevitably do , often in traumatic situations ( for example , divorce or death ) . <p> Adoptive parents were also told that children were a blank slate , that they would be just fine and would not experience loss because of their adoptive family loving them , really " wanting them , " " going through so much to get them " and so on . For many adopted children , even those who deeply love their adoptive parents , this has not proved to be true , as is also the case for some donor-conceived children . Now , prospective adoptive parents are counselled during the home-study process to expect and accept this sense of loss as normal . <p> Birth parents were told - as gamete donors are today - that it was in their own best interests to " put it behind them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relinquished children would be just fine , that they were doing a " wonderful , selfless " thing in helping people become parents who could n't otherwise do so . But this " moving on " was not always possible for the birth parents , as is also true for some gamete donors . <p> I suggest that the first step in dealing , ethically , with the issues I have identified and with other related issues , is to place the future child , and the child 's human rights and our obligations as a society to him or her , at the centre of the decision-making as to what should be required , allowed or prohibited - that is , what we must , may or must not do , respectively - in the use of assisted human reproduction technologies , including gamete donation . <p> The child can not tell us what they would consent to , but other people conceived in these ways can . We must listen to them in order to apply the ethical doctrine of " anticipated consent , " that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our decision , who is not present , would consent , if present , it is not ethical to proceed . <p> The " precautionary principle , " currently most commonly used in environmental ethics , might also help : We should exercise wise ethical restraint - prudence - until we are reasonably certain that it is safe and ethical to act . And that safety goes beyond assessing only physical harm to the future child and includes existential harm to him or her , and risk and harm to our societal values and ethics . <p> What impact would wanting only beautiful children have on our concept of unconditional parental love ? Hitherto , we have believed we love our children simply because they are our children . Does the selection and purchase of gametes to conceive a child make the child into an object or thing , rather than a person ? How will the child feel knowing that their genetic parent sold - and that their social parent bought - what is ( as one donor-conceived woman put it ) " the essence of theirlife for $25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a second look back ? What kind of a man sells himself and his child so cheaply and so easily ? " Is there something gravely ethically wrong with the commercialization of the miracle of the passing on of human life ? Canadians decided there was , and that leads to yet another recent , donor-conception news story . <p> In 2005 , Parliament enacted the Assisted Human Reproduction Act that made it a criminal offence to buy or sell gametes or embryos . Assisted Human Reproduction Canada - the agency that was established to oversee the implementation of this statute - has just been challenged with allegations it is failing to fulfill its obligations , by not seeking prosecution of those who take part in the continuing sale of sperm and ova in Canada . <p> Margaret Somerville is founding director of the Centre for Medicine , Ethics and Law at McGill University .

" <p> Where/When : Island Soul Festival , Harbourfront Centre , July 31 <p> Who : Silver Stars Steel Orchestra <p> What to expect : On its surface , steelpan is relatively simple - metal oil drums are cut to different depths and struck with a rubber stick - and it also leaves a ton of room for showmanship . Once used as a communication device among enslaved Africans in Trinidad , it has since evolved into a nuanced musical form with extensive choreography , so it 's as much a feast for the eyes as for the ears . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orchestra currently hold the title of Best Steel Band in the World , a title won and defended in Carnival competition . <p> What to expect : An alto saxophonist and all-star brass bandleader , Cape 's repertoire spans the spectrum of Caribbean music from calypso to soca , dance hall , reggae , zouk , and dub . <p> Why : If there 's an elder statesman at this year 's Caribana festival , it 's Roy Cape . He 's been in the music business for over forty years and has been threatening to retire for at least the last few , so this may be one of his final live appearances . <p> What to expect : The Dragonaires are no longer led by the venerable Byron Lee , who succumbed to cancer in 2008 , but they 've kept up the band as a testament to his legacy . <p> Why : One of the most important bands in Jamaican music history , the Dragonaires played a large part in introducing ska to the world . A band since the early sixties , they are known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hits , and they play a lot of covers . As a result , they have a mixed reputation among aficionados , but a solidified place in history . <p> What to expect : Gyptian 's mix of dancehall with reggae , R&amp;B and hip hop has given him crossover success in Jamaica and beyond . Given his propensity for slow-jam-leaning " lovers ' rock , " you can expect the traditionalists to be outnumbered by bleary-eyed young romantics . <p> Why : Gyptian 's last Toronto concert was postponed due to a motorcycle accident , but he fully intends on playing this open-air hot-ticket on August 1 , and his fans are sure to show up in droves . " Gyptian is burning up the charts and the radio , and he 's one of the most popular and well-known Jamaican artists in North America right now , " affirms Craigg Slowly , PR rep for Urbanology Magazine and Caribana. 
@@1551240 @ Caribana 's crowds do n't just come for the beats and the glittery , shaking booties . If anything 's worth lining up for on a hot day , it 's the authentic Caribbean cuisine , prized for the home-cooked flavours that translate into excellent street nosh . Whether you 're at the official parade or a guerrilla-style blocko , go beyond the standard beef patties - here 's our guide to the delicacies you wo n't want to miss , and where to get them . Avoid filling up on a dinner-sized portion of anything - you 'll want to save room for sampling . <p> Dish : Roti <p> National origin : West Indies <p> Why you want it : Toronto has an ultra-competitive roti scene , with various East and West Indian and Jamaican restaurants vying for the crown , but the best of this flatbread-wrapped curry stew is always the kind Grandma makes . The key is in the hand-rolled dough : " The skin should be soft . You should n't have to pull it with your teeth , " says Sheila Ramdhan of Caribbean Bistro at Yonge and Eglinton . Roti lovers are divided into two camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want the bones kept in . The latter is the more " authentic , " admits Famous Recipe owner Kevin Mohammed , who brings his special mango-tamarind chutney and his 20-inch cast-iron pot in from Hamilton every year to feed hungry revellers by the parade on Lake Shore and at several other events . " The flavour is so much better with the bones , but you have to use your fingers , " he says . " It gets messy . " <p> Dish : Jerk chicken <p> National origin : Jamaica <p> Why you want it : Recipes vary , but the flavour relies on two key ingredients : allspice and nostril-singeing Scotch bonnet peppers . Look out for the kind cooked over charcoal in an oil drum : " That 's about as authentic as you can get , " says Carl Cassell , co-owner of Harlem restaurant , who heads up to the vendors at Eglinton and Oakwood for a fix year-round . <p> Dish : Fish cutters <p> National origin : Barbados <p> Why you want it : Jason Inniss , former chef at Amuse-Bouche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying fish cutters - the Bajan word for sandwiches in salt-bread buns . " You rub the fish with a mix of Bajan seasoning , green onions , lime juice , thyme and oregano , bread it , and fry it , " he says . " It 's really , really tasty . " Get it with roasted corn and lots of rum , of course . <p> Dish : Oxtail stew <p> National origin : Jamaica <p> Why you want it : Off-cuts may not be your thing , but this is an island dinner staple . Beef tail , a bony , gelatinous cut of meat , is slow-cooked over several hours and melts into buttery , tender chunks . Every family 's recipe is top secret . Allette Betton of Matchless Catering , a popular wedding caterer and Caribana favourite , says she uses a signature mix of six different spices , but do n't ask her what 's in it . " If I told you , I 'd have to kill you , " she jokes . <p> Dish : Doubles <p> National origin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , filling and hot , this is the ultimate Trini street dish , a sort of chickpea sandwich made from curried channa between two pieces of fried dough , hence the name . The bana - the bread - should n't actually be bready at all , but spongy , pillowy and chewy , yet structurally sound enough to contain the filling . Toppings can include tamarind , hot pepper sauce or fresh cucumber , but bonus points if you get shado beni chutney , made from a cilantro-like Caribbean herb . Traditionally eaten for breakfast , doubles are often gobbled down as a late-night calorie hit ( or any time in between ) . <p> Why you want it : This furry-sounding concoction is actually a beverage made from pur ? ed sea algae , mixed with milk and flavoured with vanilla , strawberry or peanut butter . Get it fresh or canned : it 's famous for its supposed aphrodisiac qualities ( the brand name Big Bamboo is a giveaway ) . It 's said to " put the lead back in your pencil . " <p> Dish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Caribbean <p> Why you want it : Vendors might charge a pretty penny to stick a straw into a nut , but it 's cheaper than a plane ticket to the islands . The sweet juice of young green coconuts is full of electrolytes - ideal after a long day of jump-up - and some sellers hack open the nut with a machete so you can scoop out the jelly inside . <p> WHERE TO GET IT <p> Whet your appetite at the official launch party at Yonge-Dundas Square ( Thursday , 12 p.m. to 2 p.m. , free ) . But street food central is undoubtedly the parade route , which starts at Exhibition Place and heads west on Lake Shore Blvd . ( July 31 , 10 a.m. to 6 p.m . ) . Bypass the big chains and pizza vendors and head to Lake Shore near Jameson . " That 's where most of the mom-'n ' -pop booths are , " says Caribana publicist Stephen Weir .

" But it 's an umbrella word like vitamins . There are all sorts of different kinds . " <p> Smith can dispel the confusion easily . " The bottom line is they are in anything that was once a plant , because antioxidants are essentially a plant 's defence mechanisms . " <p> That makes it surprisingly easy to measure up on your daily antioxidant intake . All it takes is a balanced diet with lots of fruit and vegetables and other healthy foods thrown in to get the right antioxidant " multi-mix " Smith says . <p> While supplements may have a place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for eating right . " Food is the best source of antioxidants hands down . You ca n't make up for it with supplements . You have to concentrate on eating healthy . " <p> The reason it all boils down to the food you eat is that antioxidants work best in their natural state , she adds . " Taking the antioxidants out of a plant could be decreasing the structure . We just do n't know for sure . <p> " Whenever you talk about an extract , it 's an incomplete version of what was once whole food , " says Jennifer Sygo , director of nutrition for Cleveland Clinic Canada in Toronto . " It 's just not the same as eating whole food in complete form . " <p> In fact , research has yet to prove that packing in extra antioxidants through supplements and concentrates helps to reduce disease , Sygo notes . <p> So for those who want to know how to get the biggest bang for their antioxidant buck , here are a few easy basics you can follow : <p> Think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are better than their paler counterparts , especially the deep greens , intense oranges and reds and deep purples . <p> Understand where and how antioxidants in food work . Concentrations can vary depending on how particular items are prepared . Lycopene in tomatoes for example , is better absorbed when cooked in the presence of a heart-healthy fat , Smith says . On the other hand , up to two-thirds of the flavanols found in cocoa can be destroyed if alkaline is used during the chocolate-making process . <p> Check the labels . While people are snapping up pomegranate , blueberry or cherry fruit juices , for example , " Only 100% delivers the full antioxidant power , " Smith reports . " Fruit cocktails are usually watered down with apple or pear juice . But with pure juices , you only need a small quantity a day -- say a quarter to a half a cup . It 's easy to dilute it with water . " <p> Experts ultimately believe that getting the antioxidants you need every day is simply a matter of common sense .

" Herbal Accessory " helps to enlighten people that are not Cannabis Consumers to the fact that we are dealing with a Plant . It is Not some powdered , processed , synthesized , man manufactured substance that 's popped , snorted , or injected . Cannabis is still grouped in the same category as cocaine , heroin , lsd and crystal meth yet it causes far far less harm than the legal and mass consumed drugs -- Alcohol , Tobacco , and Caffeine . <p> As to the risk associated with cannabis . It is a medicine for many people , with positive side effects ( sense of well being , appetite stimulant ) . It is non-toxic and has never killed anyone . There is far more harm caused by it 's prohibition than it 's use . Cannabis is consumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caused any harm , we would be counting the bodies -- the same way we do for Alcohol or Tobacco . <p> Although , I would have to agree that it 's not for everyone -- you ca n't blame the substance for some individual 's inability to determine what they should or should not be doing .

Rest assured , we took the time to explain it to them in our interview . <p> Last , but not least , my quote was used out of context .

Is this a throw-back to when nifty little alcohol flasks were initially marketed ? BTW -- nice comment by Kevin , that he even uses it in the car -- guess it 's easier to hide the smell from smoking up pre-car accident , than having booze on your breath after taking a swig from a flask . Thanks for helping to make our roads a safer place . <p> people act like weed just completely ruins your ability to function fuck its weed it keeps me level headed and prevents me from reacting to situations negatively . people who do coke , crack , meth , alcoholics those are people on the roads you should worry about , those things are more likely to cause you to speed swerve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is misinformed . you can overdose on any of those drugs as well as some others theres alcohol poisoning you can not overdose on weed <p> wow u can take to many prescribed pain pills 1 tylenol 3 can impair your judgement , having something stressful happen to you during the day can distracting you too much hence impairing your judgement in 13 years of smoking pot i have never encountered a single person who could not function normally after smoking a joint , people can function just fine after smoking budder which is the most potent way you can smoke THC its only like 99. whatever % how often do you read in vehicle crash report " speed and alcohol are believed to be a factor " I certainly do nt recall reading 1 article say weed and speed are believed to be factors in the crash . i know ive been in alot more close calls involve seniors driving rather then potheads 5-0 seniors <p> " Performance deficits have been found in tracking , reaction times , visual function and divided attention .

These tactics , however , may not be sufficient to compensate for all the effects of cannabis , particularly at higher doses . " <p> So , my original point stands . The fact that weed has a high enough toxicity threshold that it 's physically unobtainable through the usual methods of ingestion is a different matter entirely from whether or not it can have adverse affects on your driving . <p> the iolite vaporizer is a great product , you get more from a little less the a joints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a smaller amount last longer great item and great article <p> you 're dumb jim weed should be legal 1st of all 2ndly theres places in canada where they give out free needles or crack pipes how is that any better ? sorry cant say ive ever robbed my dying gramma just to go buy a joint yet have heard countless stories of hard drug users doing this to any of their family members , their own childs piggy banks never heard of any stoner doing that perhaps you should pull your head out of your ass it 's 2010 <p> I wonder if there 'll be a ' pollution tax ' and/or a ' you 're going to smoke with this thing so we 're going to charge you a tobacco-level tax ' added to the purchase price of the vapourisor . <p> If so , try eBay ... customs usually do n't check small packages like the one that this article will need -- as long as it 's shipped via USPS ( from the States ) or the normal postal services from other countries . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portable vaporizer .

" The routine gets shaken up and that drives them crazy . " The bank surveyed its employees in the day or two after the move to make sure they were getting down to business , Ms. Mantia said .

@@1571234 <p> QUESTION : Is there any truth to the notion that coughing while getting a needle helps ease the pain ? <p> ANSWER : Some researchers have tested whether coughing during medical procedures can ease the pain . So far , the results are not compelling . Some research suggests it may act as a distraction , taking attention away from the needle or other procedure . We know that if people are distracted , they tend to feel less pain . For others , it may not work because it is a cue that the procedure is about to happen , heightening fear and making the pain worse . <p> The bigger issue here is the under-treatment of pain . Our society has always accepted needle pain as a part of ' good health care , ' but the truth is , it does n't need to be . In fact , in the long term it may be dangerous for us not to address needle pain , right from the time of birth . New research tells us that untreated pain can leave a permanent neural imprint or pain memory . Pain memory changes future pain sensations and may also lead to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common question a child asks when entering a doctor 's office is " Am I getting a shot today ?

Think of the missed opportunities for preventive health measures , such as avoidance of doctor 's or dentist 's appointments , and missed immunizations . We learned from H1N1 how important it is for society to be prepared to be vaccinated ; yet less than 40 per cent of people chose to get the vaccine .

Pharmacological strategies include using topical anesthetic ( numbing ) medicines and sugar water for infants . Breastfeeding is considered an effective combination intervention . Fortunately , these treatments are relatively easy for anyone to use . Combining a few of them can also improve pain relief . <p> Yet a change in the medical community 's attitude about pain is urgently needed .

Dr. Razack says McGill would have kept the MCAT requirement if there was a French equivalent . " But we want to make sure there 's no barrier for a major segment of our population . " According to Razack , the regular med school class from undergraduate programs does n't have as many francophones as McGill would like . <p> The Northern Ontario School of Medicine , the University of Ottawa , and Francophone medical schools in Quebec do n't require the MCAT .

@@1597231 <p> After five miscarriages , and with the odds of ever having children stacked against her , Lee Dix was glad to get a second opinion . It was the summer of 2000 , and the Toronto woman had been referred to a gynecologist based at Scarborough Hospital , Dr. Richard Austin , whom she hoped would eventually deliver her first baby . But far from feeding her optimism , Austin told Dix she had a benign tumor called a fibroid in her uterus , and made a provisional diagnosis of endometriosis , a painful disorder where cells on the uterine wall grow out of control . Between 2002 and 2005 , the greying physician performed two operations on Dix -- one a total abdominal hysterectomy , the other to remove her remaining ovary ( she 'd had one taken out in a previous operation ) . " I just went with what he said , " Dix now recalls . " I trusted doctors , and I thought that if anyone is going to work on me , they must have the proper schooling and knowledge . " <p> With that , her dream of having children ended . By 36 she was entering menopause , and thus began a medical nightmare she now blames on mistakes and misjudgments committed by Austin . She missed months of work in her job as a receptionist , suffered depression and still deals with bowel control issues because , she alleges , Austin twice perforated her large intestine while she was under the knife . More stunning still , the 41-year-old has since learned that the surgeries may have been wholly unnecessary . <p> In a civil suit recently filed in Ontario Superior Court , she cites the results of ultrasounds and other tests performed before and after the procedures showing no evidence of endometriosis or fibroids , raising the question of why Austin suggested surgery at all . The whole experience has left her heartbroken -- and downright fearful of anyone in a white jacket . " I have n't even gone for my yearly physical , " she says . " I do n't want to see any doctors . I do n't know who to trust . " <p> Dix 's allegations have not been proven in court , and Austin has not yet filed a statement of defence ( his lawyer declined to comment ) . But she 's not the only one telling horror stories about doctors these days . <p> From the pathology scandals in Newfoundland and Windsor , Ont. to an O.R . slip-up that nearly cost former NHL coach Jacques Demers his life , highly publicized medical errors are taking a big bite out of Canadians ' confidence in the medical profession , leaving many suspicious before they so much as take a seat in the examination room . In a poll taken last week for Maclean 's , 40 per cent of respondents said they believe Canadian doctors care less about their patients than they did 10 years ago ; only six per cent said physicians care more . One in five said doctors are more likely to make errors than they were a decade earlier , and the MDs did n't score well on questions of honesty , either . More than half the respondents to our poll said they believe doctors do not readily acknowledge their mistakes . <p> This is not about respect , so much as trust -- 92 per cent of those surveyed said they hold doctors in high esteem , and an overwhelming proportion of Canadians believe their own GPs do a good job . But there 's no denying the impact of the recent high-profile cases , given the disproportionately large number of people affected . The doctor at the centre of the Windsor controversy , for example , went on interpreting cancer tests for thousands of patients despite suffering from cataracts that hospital officials acknowledge may have compromised her work . In Newfoundland , pathology mistakes between 1997 and 2005 resulted in wrong test results going out to nearly 400 breast cancer patients , 108 of whom have died while untold others lost breasts only because they started treatment too late . In Saskatchewan , a government review of 68,360 images interpreted by Yorkton radiologist Dr. Darius Tsatsi uncovered 1,988 mistakes that will affect patients ' treatment . In Toronto , Austin has faced complaints from scores of his former patients , at least 38 of whom have filed civil suits like Dix 's , claiming unnecessary surgery or botched procedures . <p> These horror stories have made Canadians wary , says Mario Canseco of Angus Reid Public Opinion , who oversaw the Maclean 's poll . " Not only do they worry that there will be mistakes , but they assume so , " he says . " Even if you 're happy with your GP , you see what 's happened to those around you . You think it may be your time next . " <p> For doctors , this is an unaccustomed , and not especially pleasant , spot to be in . For generations , physicians have enjoyed greater public respect and appreciation than practically any professionals -- a reflection , perhaps , of their status in many communities as the most educated people in town . That 's changing , however , as post-secondary education becomes the norm and Canadians in general grow less deferential . " There used to be a very paternalistic relationship between doctors and their patients , " says Dr. Rocco Gerace , registrar of the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario . " It worked both ways . Patients would essentially give doctors the decision-making ability , as opposed to considering options and then consenting . It 's changed dramatically , and I think for the better . " <p> That shift has been accelerated by the Internet , which puts not only diagnostic information but reviews of individual physicians at the fingertips of patients . RateMDs.com , a California-based site that went online in 2004 , has doubled its traffic every year since , with Canadians as its most enthusiastic constituency . The site now has user-submitted ratings for over 85 per cent of Canadian doctors , and a surprising 45 per cent of its 1.2 million monthly visits originate in this country . The phenomenon speaks not only to patients ' doubts , but an appetite for frank criticism that Hugh MacLeod , chief executive of the Edmonton-based Canadian Patient Safety Institute , says will only grow . " For those in the system who think things are getting wild now , " he says , " put on your seat belts . " <p> All this crowd-sourcing raises an obvious question : are medical mistakes becoming more common ? Or are they merely being amplified by proliferating media , both social and mainstream ? Geoff Norman , a McMaster University psychologist who studies how doctors make errors , believes recent scandals played out in the media have simply caused patients to demand reviews and investigations , the coverage of which has fed impressions that things are going awry . Doctors are more willing to own up to mistakes , he argues , and he points to the publication in 2000 of " To Err Is Human , " a report by the Washington-based Institute of Medicine , as a watershed moment in encouraging practitioners to acknowledge their fallibility . " Now , " he says , " there 's almost like a legislative review process when something goes wrong . " <p> The few statistics we have on the issue inspire less certainty . In 2004 , researchers at the University of Calgary and the University of Toronto produced a landmark study of medical mistakes , and while they have yet to publish an update , those first indicators were enough to set off alarm bells . Some 2.5 million people admitted to hospital each year in Canada suffer what health care administrators call " adverse events " ( i.e. errors ) , the study found , while somewhere between 9,250 and 23,750 died in 2000 because of avoidable mistakes in their treatment . Patient safety advocates say things are improving , but surveys done since suggest only marginal gains . In 2002 , some 20 per cent surveyed in Pollara Inc. ' s exhaustive Health Care in Canada Survey said they 'd experienced some sort of adverse event while receiving care , from misdiagnosis to surgical infections to receiving the wrong medication . By 2007 , the number had fallen by only one percentage point . <p> How many of those cases can be laid at the feet of doctors is unclear , but Canadians are making as many allegations as ever about physician misconduct . Since 2005 , the annual number of complaints to provincial colleges of physicians and surgeons has climbed from 5,482 to 5,990 , with the majority of reports revolving around matters of competence and the doctor 's behaviour ( each province , it should be noted , defines complaints differently ) . <p> What practitioners , safety advocates and patients can agree on is that pressures within the system are often to blame when things go wrong -- not least physician shortages . While more than a third of respondents to our poll believe doctors have their patients ' best interests at heart , 39 per cent say physicians are more concerned about dealing with patients as quickly as possible . And some of the most damaging scandals in recent years have occurred in parts of the country that have trouble recruiting and keeping experienced doctors , notes Dr. Peter Hutten-Czapski , the former president of the Society of Rural Physicians of Canada . Rural communities get a lot of people who are fresh out of residency training , because most doctors are born , trained and have built lives in big cities , adds Hutten-Czapski from his clinic in Haileybury , Ont. , about 200 km northeast of Sudbury . " If your wife 's an aerospace engineer , a ballerina or an architect , " he says , " it 's not likely you 're going to move to Engelhart , Ont . " <p> This seemingly basic problem creates no end of complications , starting with a relentless turnover . One recent study suggests one in seven doctors in rural Canada plans to move in the next two years . Another is a severe shortage of specialists , who in isolated areas tend to be overworked , inexperienced or both . The problem is particularly acute in Newfoundland , which is known for its dependence on foreign-trained medical graduates to fill the demand for specialists . <p> Janet Henley , a lawyer and breast cancer survivor from St. John 's , learned that the hard way . She was 40 years old in 1997 when doctors performed a lumpectomy to remove cancer from her breast . After sending a tissue sample to the local pathologist , they told her she was cured . Four years later , the cancer had grown back , forcing Henley to suffer through a double mastectomy . <p> Exhausted , weak and hospitalized with severe depression , she began to wonder whether she might have avoided such drastic treatment . After seeing news reports that Eastern Health , the authority responsible for Henley 's treatment , had botched hundreds of other women 's breast cancer hormone receptor tests , Henley began to question her own diagnosis . In 2008 , she had the tissue that was collected in 1997 sent for a second opinion at Johns Hopkins Breast Cancer Center in Baltimore . They found cancer on nine out of 14 of the slides , Henley alleges , including one lesion that measured a full 1.4 cm in diameter . The pathologist had evidently missed them all , and Henley is now suing Eastern Health for $5 million . <p> The whole experience has left her with a checklist of unanswered questions . Did the pathologist who handled her slides have proper training ? Was that doctor overworked ? Did he or she have a history of misdiagnoses ? Henley may never know for sure , because when she asked Eastern Health whether it had ever reviewed the pathologists 's work , she was told that the information was confidential ( her case was not part of a judicial inquiry into problems at Eastern Health which focused on hormone receptor tests ) . Nor can she find out whether any other women have sought disciplinary action against Dr. Jessica Shepherd , the pathologist who interpreted her test samples , because the provincial college of physicians and surgeons is n't required to reveal the information . <p> That 's left Henley , like so many Canadians , doing her own research on the Internet . So far , she 's determined that Shepherd was trained at the University of the West Indies in Trinidad and Tobago , and is now an associate professor of pathology at the University of Western Ontario in London , Ont . Shepherd declined comment this week through an office assistant , and Henley 's allegations have not been tested in court . But the Newfoundland woman is not about to let up . " I would like to know whether my case was unique , " she says . " I 'm not sure how you miss cancer on nine out of 14 slides . " <p> Her frustration points to a lingering problem when it comes to getting doctors to face up to their shortcomings : they are powerfully protective of their reputations , and have the money to be so . While some physicians point to declining numbers of malpractice suits as proof they are making fewer mistakes , others claim lawyers for the MDs have been discouraging such claims by dragging out litigation and exhausting the patients ' financial resources . Even when an issue does n't go to court , doctors are quick to go on the defensive , says Dr. Brian Goldman , host of the CBC Radio program White Coat , Black Art and author of The Night Shift , a forthcoming book that explores doctor error , among other issues . " I think physicians have been the single greatest impediment to patient safety in Canada , " says Goldman , who is an emergency room doctor at Toronto 's Mount Sinai Hospital . " I 'm not saying they actively block the search for truth in some evil and nefarious way . But they tend to feel a powerful sense of shame at any insinuation that they 've been less than competent . " <p> That attitude is born of an atmosphere in which errors can have catastrophic impact on one 's career , he says . " It 's hard to take a non-emotional look at mistakes when you 're thinking , ' I 'm terrified . ' " But as the proverbial smartest people in the room , MDs are also prone to overconfidence -- if not plain arrogance . Worried by U.S. studies suggesting such doctors can have a negative impact on patient care , professional colleges across the country have adopted guidelines to combat physicians who belittle colleagues and disregard the feelings of patients , ? la Gregory House of TV fame . And physicians ' reputation for supreme self-confidence may explain why other health care professionals score higher ratings from the public when it comes to personal integrity . A 2009 Gallup poll indicated that Americans rate nurses ' honesty and ethical standards higher than doctors ' -- 83 per cent versus 65 per cent ( the Maclean 's poll also found marginally more respect for nurses and farmers than for doctors ) . <p> The good news is that the profession as a whole is starting to get the message . The Canadian Medical Association ( CMA ) , representing some 68,000 physicians across the country , has supported numerous initiatives aimed at curbing medical errors , such as the introduction of pre-surgery checklists , the establishment of health-quality councils across Canada that measure and report on quality of care , and the creation of disclosure guidelines by the Canadian Patient Safety Institute , which promote transparency about medical errors . Last week , the association published a report called " Health Care Transformation in Canada , " calling for a culture of patient-centred care , including more timely access to services and greater accountability in the profession . " The report , " says CMA President Dr. Anne Doig , " is predicated on the principle that we need to do our jobs better . " <p> Doig acknowledges concern about some of the findings of the Maclean 's poll . But she wonders whether perceptions that doctors care less about patients and are more likely to make mistakes speak more to lack of access to , or long waits for , medical care . She also notes that increased disclosure of medical errors can be falsely interpreted as an increased incidence of mistakes : " We 're not making more mistakes than we ever have , necessarily . " Treatment , she adds , is more complex than it used to be and expectations are now higher . " Life was simpler , " she says , " when the doctor went around in a horse-drawn buggy with a little black bag and did the best he could . " <p> Perhaps . But such reassurances offer small comfort to patients like Lee Dix . These days , she quietly struggles through her shifts at a downtown Toronto law firm , pondering reforms that might save others the misery she 's endured -- greater transparency when it comes to doctors ' past blunders , say , or pre-surgery checklists . " But there 's a lot of things that occurred in my case that would n't have existed on any checklist , " she says . Mostly , she wonders what might have been . " Not being able to have children haunts me pretty much every day . " <p> I had once read that the docs have a group liability protection organization , that seeks to compensate when the care is indeed below par ( and a litigating patient suffered harm ) , and to defend very aggressively when the care could be defended ( no " convenience settlements " of nuisance suits ) . Obviously , that does nothing for harmed patients who do not sue . I think I have found that approach in writing . Have a look at the " Governing Principles " of this web page:http : **43;99;TOOLONG ... <p> Even when a CMA member is in flagrant violation of basic standards of competance or care CMPA ( and their multi-billion dollar endowment ) agressively litigate to the nth degree and then appeal in the hope of patient death and reduced damages . The Fifth Estate ( even a brokern clock is right twice a day ) did a big story on this outfit years ago . It ai n't just lovers who never have to say they 're sorry ! The best medical advice i ever recieved was " never forget it is a statistcal truth that half of all docs graduate in the bottom half of the class " <p> " never forget it is a statistcal truth that half of all docs graduate in the bottom half of the class " is so neither here or there . What 's more important is that those that graduate meet the standard of competence . Where one graduates in terms of the class grades is not the only determinant of how good a doctor they would be . The book smart but socially awkward top student would do well in some internal medicine field but may not do as well in the ER where thinking quickly on the feet is required . A good doctor is one that care 's about the patient , competent enough when his/her knowledge is lacking and humble enough to seek sources ( be it looking it up or a fellow MD consult ) when the knowledge is missing . And that and good communicative skills . <p> Well said Simon , A rational approach , no matter how inflamed and engaging a passionate perspective can be , is what drives the heart beyond it failings to reach for excellence . That excellence , that equanimity as you have so well pointed out is never attained alone nor without words from another . Physicians have worked long thankless hours and been payed little in recourse for the wealth they have given over in another 's health , it is only natural then over time that some would have come to see from inside and out , not a profession in search of answers , but those in possession of them . Of course no one profession of person has all the answers yet every bird to it 's nest does fly that all the forest may sing and so what appears neither here or there may be that ; at the bottom of one class is the height of the other . <p> In Ontario , it is the policy of the medical liability insurance company to fight every lawsuit . This is their approach to deter lawsuit . You better have deep pockets if you want to sue a doctor in Ontario . Aside , the malpractice premium of Ontario doctors are heavily subsidize by the Ontario government . <p> It 's everywhere , not just Ontario folks . Doctors as a " profession " are as ruthless and underhanded and vicious as lawyers . Remember , both groups are " self-regulated professionals " . That means they can , and do , as they wish . And self-interest usually trumps all . <p> In BC a physician molested two young teenage girls . When they got older and made a complaint to the BC Medical Association , this physician was n't suspended or punished in any way . Only when he murdered the still-teenage girl , did the BCMA take his license away -- and only after he was convicted of her murder . <p> So what ? It 's a protective ass'n , a union in other words Yes doctors'make mistakes because they are humans . Whoever told they were God some time ago was ignorant . When they do make a mistake , if the victim if still alive , otherwise the family should be compensated for real loss . But money does not replace love for most people . I think it would be a tragedy , not for doctors , but for our health care system if we allow settlements to mimic those in the US . A doctor can lose his licence fo negligence and there could be other penalties as well like prison . <p> I personally have been under the doctor 's thumb many times in my later years . While most have been excellent , it does n't hurt to get a second opinion , or third if you are n't sure . But be prepared to pay for that second opinion . <p> This is not true . Only 2 percent of patients get any compensation . Rarely are doctors in Canada found guilty of anything . With 24,000 people dying in Canada a year , 80,000 admitted to acute care hospitals and over 5 million claiming to have had a medical mistake or know someone who has then you will see this is not true . <p> There are not enough safeguards in the medical profession . For instance , when a pathologist analyzes a tissue sample for cancer , why is n't there a second set of eyes that analyze the sample ? For something so important , such a safeguard seems essential . There 's too much pressure in the system , that 's why . The same pressure that causes people to wait months to see a specialist is also causing specialists to make mistakes . <p> I agree . Why is n't there a proper peer review process in place , particularly when you 're dealing with such critical illnesses . Further , I agree that rationing in the system is partly to blame . However , regarding the issue of trust , my experience has been far worst in the US . Often in the US , I have a hard time distinguishing the motives of my doctor and that of a salesman . In a private system , the profit motive causes severe challenges for establishing trust . And , I argue that this paternalistic relationship between a doctors and patients is necessary , and indirectly , it is part of the healing process of the patients . There is value to viewing doctors as guardians , and to strip doctors of that title has costs . In my opinion , medical students need to be trained ( and perhaps selected ) to value humility and the inherent altruism of their profession , and not just their status and earning potential . Doctors need to get over their ego -- we need doctors who have wisdom , not just knowledge . <p> Be afraid doctors hide cancer diagnoses . I am a victum of medical abuse in Alberta , The brotherhood of Doctors stand together at the cost of human life . I am critically Ill due to the neglegance of doctors . Canada rates almost last among advanced countries . I stood up against a Prominent surgeon and now no doctor will help me . The health ministeries are corrupt . I was told by The provincal and federal minister that there was nothing more they could do for me ! I was told by the Alberta Minister of health , that he is at arms lenght to his tribunals . This is a lie ! The health Minister has all the authority through the power and authority act . The judicial system is just as corrupt . I now have a law suit . The Justice is bias and refuses to uphold the charter of rights'and freedoms . " I am not here to save your life , only to ensure this lawsiut proceeds " <p> This article does n't even touch on another big issue at play : the role of big business in determining what pharmaceuticals make it to market and are advocated . There is no credible evidence to support the efficacy of flu shots , and I personally know someone who had a serious adverse reaction . It will be interesting to see if Gardasil actually proves to be safe after the insane push to get the government to spend millions on it . Anti-depressants are doled out like candy , despite research showing that they are only effective in severe cases of depression and are , in fact , no more effective than candy for its milder forms . Most doctors , it seems , are happy to push whatever the drug companies are advocating without much question . We all have to be our own health care advocates these days . Not only can we not trust doctors any more . We also ca n't trust the government to act in our interest when it comes to drug regulation . <p> If only the records of nursing homes were made public , then you 'd see where our taxpayer dollars are really going -- -- to drug the residents into barely functioning zombies . Using drugs that are n't approved for this purpose , have very harmful and even deadly ' side-effects ' and -- get this -- have been shown in studies to not have any effect in improving dementia . Nope . It 's just for the convenience of staff . <p> The Pharmaceutical companies have been so successful in flooding newspapers with stories about you should " see your doctor " if you 're the least bit sad or down . I 'm not talking about people who are seriously ill . Just the ups and downs of everyday life . Let 's drug ' em . The side effects of these drugs being given to seniors for dementia , actually include memory loss , confusion , anxiety , .... So , beware folks . You may start out mildly depressed about some matter , but very soon you 'll be a dementia patient . <p> Just be careful about what anyone in a white coat hurriedly tells you to take . He/she have been told to dole these drugs out by the pharmaceutical drug companies . The doctors are their " pushers " . Most doctors have no time or interest in reviewing the studies . They rely on the sales force of pharma companies . <p> Now , before anyone gets the idea that I think all doctors and all drugs are bad , I 'd like to say that I know many good doctors , and good medication . However , the good doctors are bullied by their own medical associations . Indeed some doctors are even persecuted by medical associations for not towing their line . <p> Every person needs to consider that when they see a doctor or take a medication , they are taking their lives in their hands . And , the doctor has very little interest in you , other than your role in his bottom line . Forget what doctors say publicly . As your mother told you , it 's not what they say , it 's what they do that we should pay attention to . Protect yourself , knowledge is power . And if your doctor berates you for asking questions , taking an assertive role in your own health , RUN . <p> Once again , I do n't know where you live but once again in BC those issues are routinely monitored by the licening authority or the doctor . The practice of deliberately and routinely zonking long term care patients so they are la-la and manageble is ancient history since 1978 . Now the BC system has been crapped uponsomehwat by the current government , butb the professionals involved are experienced nurses and question that sort of drug administration . And their visits are linked to program payments . . <p> To reduce medical errors , the compensation scheme for doctors have to change . Instead of pay for service , they need to be on salary . Also , Canada needs to increase the pool of doctors . Competition is necessary but you ca n't have real competition if the pool of doctor is limited by the regulators . Until we can increase the pool -- either through tele-medicine or letting in more foreign-trained doctors -- there 's nothing much we can do about the increase in medical errors . <p> Oh , please . In order for doctors to do the right thing , to act properly , we need to pay them more ? ? ? ? Come on . Doctors ' unions ( medical associations ) are always the first with their hands ' out whenever healthcare budgets are discussed . And they are the first and best compensated by governments . Why is this ? Well , lawyers and doctors work very closely together . Lawyers make lots of money , on both sides , whenever doctors screw up . Medical association insurance companies spend huge amounts of money on lawyers , and so as the clients with the deepest pockets , they will be coveted by lawyers . <p> Why do I go on about lawyers ? Well , they make the laws . To suit themselves . Check it out . Delivery of health care is a provincial responsibility . And in each province there are working committees of lawyers whose responsibility it is to make and change laws . It 's not the elected representatives ( MLAs ) who make laws . They just vote on them , and by the time the laws are made , the MLAs do little , if any , tinkering with the laws . The way they vote has pretty much been decided behind the scenes . <p> So , that 's the story about why there will never be any meaningful accountability . Doctors are just too powerful as a group . <p> Oh really ? Gee , what about medical manpopwer authorities who know nothing about klawyers ; they influence med school intakes so the province is n't overpopulated in the wrong places with doctors ; they try to influence the distribution of GPs through approval of med plan tickets , and othe influencing things- like paying an extra stipend ( contract ) for GP to go to an underserviced locale . Your account of these other provinces is very interesting . Have they heard ? <p> some years ago I had surgery to reverse a tubal ligation with a local ottawa doctor . Unfortunately for me this happened just as the Riverside Hospital was being closed . My doctor said he would have to move the surgery to the Civic hospital and that although I should be paying more for the surgery he was willing to give me a break . A break he gave me . He performed micro surgery which I paid for without a microscope . It was his first surgery at the civic hospital and when he asked for a microscope there was none in the surgery . He went ahead and performed the surgery without a microscope . This I learned a year later after having spent a year on fertility medication with no luck . I made an appointment with a fertility specialist who asked for my records . After picking up the records I was reading them in my car when I discovered the truth . I was so upset I called the doctor and he agreed to meet . His comment was " I am sorry , what did you want me to do ? you where already opened up when we discovered there was no microscope " <p> One of my customers husband went in for routine back surgery and came out of surgery a paraplegic . Doc said oops sorry the knife slipped . <p> I have done business with CMPA and was in a meeting which really disturbed me . I was speaking about the American system of medical malpractice and how they will refuse to insure a doctor that has been sued numerous times . I was thinking it would be the same here in Canada . A group of about 10 high level CMPA folks laughed at me and asked " you mean the frequent flyers ? " lol no , we know who they are but no we do not refuse to insure them " At that moment I lost all faith in our medical system . Imagine CMPA knows who the " frequent flyers " are and do nothing to protect the Canadian people from being victimized and butchered by doctors who are doing it every day ! <p> One way to reduce the harm caused by bad pathologists ( Smith ) or rogue gynecologists ( Wai Ping , Austin ) would be to ask the CPSO to quit dragging out complaint investigations for years on end -- even as the pile of victims ( like Austin 's victims ) piles up . And then after dragging its heels for years the CPSO , if it does anything at all , usually chooses to opt for censures which can be kept secret from the public ( like " cautions " ) . Dr. Gerace , in this article , says he is gald to see the end of the paternalistic doctor-patient relationship . Too bad he continues to prefer the paternalistic and secretive CPSO approach to protecting the public from the likes of Dr. Austin . ( By the way , the CMPA 's heavy-handed , scorthched earth approach to victims of medical negligence is funded by the taxpayer . Doctors only pay about 15% of their CMPA insurance premiums . The province picks up the other 85% . The irony in this is that Austin 's victims are funding his high-paid CMPA defence lawyers but have trouble coming up with the money to pay a lawyer of their own . ) <p> Just got back from a Dr. 's appt . She made me wait for half an hour ( no patients had left during the time ) . My previous Dr. of 17 yrs . did n't have enough courtesty to send us a note that she was retiring ( in her early 50 's ) and passed on our files to our current one . Our current Dr. spends more time checking and updating her online records than she spends with me face to face . I finally told her so . She could n't remember that she had requested certain blood tests -- just referred to the blood results my ' marvelous ' Oncologist requested . Am sure she has never read through my , admittedly , thick paper file . She did n't know I 'm a 7/8 yr stage IV cancer survivor , yet she 's had my file for 2 yr+ . Have a knee problem . Explained what happened . Her response , it 's got to be arthritis -- get an Xray . I 'll be looking for a new Family Dr. tomorrow . <p> I have spoken once to one of the technicians working in a hospital lab ( Pathology ) , and he cautioned me that if I have lab tests done , it is better for patient to always check your physician for the results , do not wait for them to call you . He said many of the samples sent to them , have no labels and name . They have to phone offices that sent those to ask for proper labeling for those blanked samples . And in many cases those doctors do not respond to their calls , or if they do , sometimes they ca n't properly identify whose those blank samples belong to . <p> As for medical trust , I believe the doctors are lossing much of those trusts and respect due to their pharmaceutical allegiance . They boxed themselves as nothing but legitimize drug pushers . As for liability insurance , CMA and their insurance group fight every mal practice issue to discourage patient from suing , not to protect the patient . <p> I am always amazed when people complain about physicians being " pill pushers " when it has been my experience that patients expect a " magic pill ' to fix everything that is wrong with them . Certainly , behavioral therapy works as well as anti-depressants but requires a great deal more work on the part of the patient ; yes- you can treat severe obesity without medication or surgery but it requires a great deal of commitment on behalf of the patient ; yes -- you can quit smoking without medication but again it is not easy ... Yes it would be better is you ate a healthy diet without using vitamin &amp; mineral supplements ...... need I go on ? Do people honestly believe that physicians do n't want their patients to take responsibility for their own health ? Should your physician give you a " pep talk " instead of just handing over the prescription , you file a complaint with the college . <p> Finally , someone who knows what he'she is talking about I suspect there is more attention given to online quacks than their own doctor . And other so-called disciplines that are barely tolerated by doctors but somehow have been fiven a looky-see . And people are so gullible about these " healers " -- have you tried aroma therapy ? Really ! And then there is getting your spheres aligned and on and on . Wherever there is person vainly l ; ooking for what does n't exist , there are these quacks . Despite all this some doctors do make mistakes . And other patients wander between doctors looking for the cure that may not be there . Cancer cure , for example . I have had cancer and I understand what it means to be given very unfavourable odds . I was lucky and it was caught in time for excision by surgery ( radical prostate surgery for aggressive cancer ) . <p> I suspect the state of affairs really does tend to the following : " I 've got the greatest doctor , but as a group they 're a bunch of greedy , parasitic , irresponsible , uncaring , self-protectng , elitist so-and-so 's ... " That 's if you 're lucky enough to even have a doctor . <p> As an ER doc with 13 years of education , 8 years of experience , and ongoing medical education &amp; courses ( that every licensed MD does ) .... I see often overwhelming waves of patients with complex acute and chronic problems -- and I struggle to do my best despite numerous system and resource limitations and pressures . I do n't know a single colleague that wants anything but the best for the patients we see , despite the fact that many of the problems we 're faced with do n't have easy clear-cut solutions or guaranteed outcomes . <p> An article like this , and especially the posted comments below , make me feel at best sad , and at worse despondent . <p> you must live in the land of unicorns and rainbows . to say you know of no colleague that does not want the best for patients they see leaves me incredulous . -I have worked for many years as a R.N and have seen The great , The good , The bad and The ugly . ( in all aspects of health care professionals ) . what I have found really appalling is the lack of accountability a bad doctor or even a good doctor who clearly has made a bad mistake has to the Canadian patient . ER doc , -- if you are at all honest you know you could cite many examples of things that " just were n't right " being swept under the carpet . Real and decent people get hurt by the deceptions . It is doctors like you that sit back and do nothing but lobby for the status qou that are turning Canada 's medical system to a scary place to get sick in . Given a choice I would love to be able to buy a private insurance plan -expensive as they are- so that at least I could complain about substandard treatment and the insurer would be happy to listen and act . What we have now is sub par- . The only Canadians that are smug about out " world class " health care are politicians ( who go elsewhere or to the VIP lounge ) and Canadians that have not been sick lately . Peop ; e reading this may want to write and say you think your care was wonderful -- maybe it was and maybe it was n't -- sometimes the biggest box 's of chocolates and thank you cards come from the people who have n't a clue that they survived not because of but in-spite of the care they received . Oh and by the way- I am one of the good guys that work hard and always put the patients first . I would n't say all this if I did n't care . <p> Interesting that the surgery may have been unnecessary to begin with . Heath care is a business , at least for physicians . What I would like to know is why there is a blood test for prostate cancer , but no equivalent test for cervical/ovarian cancer ? Could it be the case that there is such a blood test , but because physicians get a great deal of business from performing pap tests the blood tests are kept out of the country ? It is odd that there would be a blood test for prostate cancer , but not one for cervical or ovarian cancer . Imagine . . . no more paps ! How wonderful would that be ? But a great deal of lost business for physicians . <p> Doctors hide Cancer Diagnoses . The brotherhood of Doctors stands together , even at the cost of Human life.I stood up against a prominent surgeon and now I am left to die ! Canada is rated among the lowest of all advanced countries . The Health ministeries will not uphold their mandate . They allege they are at arms lenghth to their tribunals . This is a lie . The power and authoroty act gives the minister authority over all his agents . <p> I am liniving with blood cancer and organ failure . I know first hand the corruption in the Medical and Judical systems . The Judicial system protects the doctors . View my story on Youtube fightingforjustice10 <p> Hi Valerie I read your sad story and feel your frustration with the system . I too am a nurse who struggles every day with a system in Alberta that keeps promising to improve access to care and perhaps quality of care but in reality until the powers that be start listening to the front-line workers , things will not change . The money is usually spent on setting up programs and putting another layer of management in place rather than provide for more front-line workers or perhaps solve community social issues to improve lifestyles . My sympathies and best wishes to keep your chin up -- you can proceed with a clear conscience . <p> After just returning from the US after 15 years , I have so far been unimpressed with Canadian health care , other than the fact that it is " free , " insofar as being universally available . One clinic doctor ( apparently trained overseas ) misdiagnosed my ulnar nerve compression ( which I had diagnosed correctly since it caused numbness in my little and half of my ring finger ) as carpal tunnel syndrome which causes numbness in the other fingers . I even took my research in with me , and she ignored it . To add insult to injury , the Chinese " nurse " could hardly speak English and could not spell " ulnar . " <p> Just today , a friend told me about pain in both feet . Her GP threw pain pills at her and referred her to a rheumatoid specialist . In 5 minutes , I found a note from a US podiatrist that pretty much ruled out arthritis ( since my friend is in her mid-30s ) and recommended being seen by a DPM , who then might refer her to a neurologist ... and in fact , the issue may be in the lower back . Where are many Canadian doctors getting their information , and why are they ignoring common medical knowledge ? It 's somewhat scary . <p> In the US , health care was very good to me , but there are obvious issues for 30 million people there who do not have any coverage whatsoever , those with HMOs as their provider ( as opposed to a PPO plan where the patient somewhat controls their destiny ) , and those with pre-existing conditions . <p> More and more Canadians are going out of the country for our medical care . It seems the physicians in Canada ( at least in BC ) take no responsibility if they injure patients physically and emotionally . They lie , they withhold files , they destroy files , they leak information to the media . They drive people to suicide and to the psyc wards -- where they work . <p> Its time to wake up and smell the stink , aka medical " care . " In Canada , where the doctors are guaranteed their salary health " care " is incredibly sh*tty ! Why the hell should n't they have to earn it like every other doctor on the planet ? At least they 'd be MOTIVATED , which they definitely are not . <p> I 've worked in many Canadian hospitals , and I know of what I speak . <p> I 'm really distressed that so many people have been unnecessarily , and permanently harmed . It 's SICK . <p> Had surgery almost two years ago to remove cancer . My first surgery was in November of 2009 to remove a large cyst and this is when they found the cancer in my neck . My second surgery was in January of 2010 was to remove my thyroid and lymph nodes.I was very upset that I had to wait for my second surgery in January , I waited almost two months to have the cancer removed from my neck . My second surgery was more difficult and I after 3 months I had to get back to work and forced myself to feel normal , even though I had been suffering inside while I worked . When I felt somewhat better to visit my surgeon I requested a report of my surgery , I read the details of my surgery and found that the surgeon slipped with the knife and accidentally sliced open my cor artery and my jugular vein . It says they repaired my co artery and had to sacrifice my jugular . I was extremely upset when I read this because nobody informed me of the mistake . I woke up from my surgery and could barely open my right eye , I have no feeling on the right side of my head and part of my face . For almost two years I have been dizzy and still feel out of sorts most days , I do try and do activities that I love , but I ca n't do them as often and I feel out of sorts most of the time . When people look at me , they can not tell that I am suffering , I guess I hide it very well . Just very upset , its bad enough that I had to deal cancer . <p> Had surgery almost two years ago to remove cancer .

After I had my second surgery I had a lot of difficulties , I could n't sleep lying down , i blacked out if I laid down flat , half my body would go numb , it took me about 3 months before I had to force myself back to work .

Just very upset , its bad enough that I had to deal with cancer . <p> It is very difficult to sue a doctor in Canada . Its hard to trust anyone when you know that they are not fully accountable for thier actions . Personally , I have not been seriously ill in some time but I find if I go to see a doctor Im usually brushed aside and nine times out of ten sent home with only some advice . Of course , they still collect thier money from Medicare . I wont waste my time going to see doctors anymore unless Im deathly ill . If I just want some advice I ll get it from the net . Its a lot cheaper for our health care sytem . <p> In the US , it is terribly hard to sue a physician for anything . You read about cases in the papers but I 've yet to actually MEET anyone who was harmed and who did try to sue , manage to even get the lawsuit off the ground ! Insanity ! Our dental boards and medical boards , the supposed policing arm for those professionals , is made up OF their peers ! I want MY state to begin having as many healthcare CONSUMERS on those Boards as well as peers . THAT should at least get the " layman 's " points of view on the table ... have OUR peers there ! <p> Even we personally experience these happening in Ontario . We complained about Surgeon doing unnecessary caserean section and giving false information . The CPSO and Ontario Health also covered up and sided the reckless surgeons for wrong doings . Someone should come with a website , to blacklist the doctors so that to protect the public interest . We are not being protected instead of becoming a victim and endangering our lives with such reckless doctors . After the operations there are complications . They are trying to cut down the birth rate by this method . Beware . <p> As the victim of an extensive fraud and cover up I would not trust a doctor for any reason . I was left in a life threatening condition and denied medical help . Charts were altered and the mental illness diagnosis was put in place to cover up negligent care . I reported this as an infectious disease cover up but those complaints quickly covered up . Canadians have no idea what is going on in their hospitals and what things are being swept under the rug . If they knew they would be shocked and disgusted . <p> Saying that I am grossly disappointed with the Canadian Health care system would really be a HUGE understatement . In 2002 , my mother suffered internal damage in her left ear as a result of a myringotomy procedure , which involved the insertion of a tube in the ear . It was within 2 weeks of the procedure that she suffered a serious bacterial infection which was not adequately treated and/or managed by the physicians responsible for her care . After intensive research and a lot of back and forth with different " specialists " , we learned that the tube insertion procedure was unnecessary and should not have been recommended . <p> The extensive damage that resulted from the tube insertion left my mother completely deaf in her left ear but with all this clearly documented , , it has been nearly impossible to hold anyone accountable , 10 years later ! My mother is a fighter but she has not been able to lead a normal life since then e.g she ca n't work because she now has permanent vertigo spells , a damaged neglected ear ( which has created further complications ) , balance problems ......... and so much more . <p> Everyone that has had their life destroyed , altered by negligent , arrogant doctors should keep fighting . I know it is not easy , but they have to be held accountable for their actions . <p> Everything that is done in the dark , eventually comes to light " , victims should keep fighting because justice always prevails , ALWAYS ! ! This may sound naive to some , but in some circumstances , optimism and hope is what is left to hold on to . <p> Also , never fully trust any doctor that you may be seeing , always listen to your body and do extra research about your health . <p> Saying that I am grossly disappointed with the Canadian Health care system would really be a HUGE understatement .

My wife did n't like the new me ( neither did my friends ) and was concerned that the new Prozac me was also drinking more than he used to . She set me back up with the same doctor , who sent me to 2 x 45 min session with a psychiatrist . The psych for his 90 minutes wrote a report labeling me as Alcohol dependent and my wife to be a full blown Alcoholic . My MD ( the genius in hush puppies ) promptly turned me into the MOT who took my drivers license . They do this to 10,000 Ontarians/yr and it feeds the private rehad clinic industry . It 's gone for a minimum of 1 year , must not drink at all and to make sure they want to stick a needle in my arm once per month . It 's done under the Highway traffic Act it should have been called the Minority Report Act . Bottom line is your doctor is not your friend , they work for the government and spy for them as required , there is no such thing as Doctor/Patient confidentiality ( they share your information with all kinds of companies ) . If you find that a member of your family has developed a drug or alcohol problem , find a private clinic or settle it in the family , do n't go near a doctor .

@@1597232 <h> Campbell 's Cuts : Time for the NHL to cut goalie trapezoid <p> Henrik Lundqvist of the Rangers played the puck away from the Flyers ' Daniel Briere . ( Photo by Len Redkoles/NHLI via Getty Images ) <p> Ken Campbell 2010-08-16 11:35:00 <p> All right , this was the plan : In an attempt to bolster the argument that the NHL should abolish the behind-the-net trapezoid , I was going to go to your YouTube there , type in ' Goalie Fail , ' then watch the deluge of hilarious gaffes that led to goals from bumbling goalies coming out of the net to play the puck . <p> What I got were a lot of soccer goalkeepers doing very stupid things . I watched Marc-Andre Fleury fall face-first after stepping on the ice during the 2008 Stanley Cup final . Heh-heh . I saw Keith Ballard take a baseball swing at his own goalie 's head . Then I watched , ' Cat goes nuts over paper towel roll , ' which led to 15 minutes I 'll never get back as I witnessed innocent pranks go horribly wrong . <p> Even in TSN 's Top 10 NHL Goaltending Gaffes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the puck outside the crease . <p> The point is , the notion we have that goalies are a bunch of ham-handed morons when it comes to playing the puck might not be so accurate . It probably happens a lot less than we think it does , but , like the Grape Lady on YouTube , it can lead to spectacular results . <p> Those who espouse the notion of removing the trapezoid often argue that allowing goalies to handle the puck will lead to more goals because they 're so bad at it . To be sure , some of them are , but the NHL established the trapezoid in the first place because so many goaltenders had become so adept at handling the puck that the league thought they were killing offensive opportunities . <p> Well , we 've had five full seasons with the trapezoid and while it might have been a concern in the pre-lockout NHL , the game has changed so much and the flow of play has so greatly improved that the league could easily abolish the trapezoid and allow goalies to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And who 's to say it would n't lead to more scoring opportunities ? Have you seen the way some of the goalies can pass the puck these days ? Imagine Martin Brodeur or Rick DiPietro retrieving the puck from the corner and launching a long bomb two-thirds of the way up the ice to spring a teammate for a breakaway . Or , imagine an opponent batting the puck down before it leaves the defensive zone and having a tap-in on an unguarded net . <p> Either way , something interesting is bound to happen . <p> The fact is , the speed at which the game is played and the constant flow of the play would not be greatly impacted by allowing goalies to play the puck and there would be a number of benefits to allowing it . <p> First of all , the post-lockout NHL has made icons of predatory hitters such as Colby Armstrong and Jordin Tootoo , who live for nothing more than the opportunity to chase down a defenseman who is retrieving the puck or a forward who is curling around the net @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want to get rid of a lot of the headshots that have become so controversial without actually instituting a headshot rule ? Then allow the goalies to play the puck outside the trapezoid and give them the protection to avoid being bulldozed while doing it . Incidental contact is one thing ; skating from two zones away to make a guy one with the rinkboard advertising is quite another . There 's a clear distinction there and the guys at the NHL are smart enough to figure it out . <p> And really , how fair is it to inhibit goaltenders from playing the puck anyway ? Knowing how valuable a skill it is , many young goalies have honed the craft of puckhandling and made it an essential part of their skill package . Why should they be penalized for doing so ? <p> And is n't prohibiting a goalie from playing the puck tantamount to stopping defensemen from blocking shots ? The next time you watch a game and wonder why the score is 1-0 in the third period , watch closely how many shots do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves in front of slapshots . <p> And if the league is so worried about offense and game flow , there are a host of other rule changes that could be made to offset the removal of the trapezoid . <p> For example , ever wondered why it 's perfectly legal for a player to make a hand pass to a teammate as long as he 's in the defensive zone , but not the neutral or offensive zones ? Either abolish hand passes in all zones and put the faceoff at the dot nearest to the infraction or allow them in all three zones . Simple . <p> Another one I 've never been able to figure out is why teams are allowed to ice the puck with impunity when killing a penalty . First , you give a team a disadvantage for breaking the rules , then you allow it to break the rules again to mitigate the disadvantage it faced for breaking the rules in the first place . <p> Here are a couple of remedies : One would be to abolish the free-pass icing when killing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , retain the rule that does n't allow the team that iced the puck to make a player change during the stoppage in play . That way you 'd have four tired penalty-killers taking a faceoff in their own end . Another would be to allow each team a pre-determined number of icings per period , let 's say three . The first three icings would not be called , but each one after that would result in a defensive-zone faceoff , even on a penalty kill . <p> Sound crazy ? Well , it 's no more outlandish than establishing a small , defined area in which goaltenders are allowed to play the puck . And the results might be a whole lot more entertaining than watching a feline chase around an empty roll of toilet paper . <p> I mean , it was kind of entertaining and all , but ... <p> This article originally appeared in the Feb. 22 , 2010 edition of The Hockey News magazine . <p> Ken Campbell , author of the book Habs Heroes , is a senior writer for The Hockey News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear Fridays and his column , Campbell 's Cuts , appears Mondays . <p> For more great profiles , news and views from the world of hockey , subscribe to The Hockey News magazine .

" <p> Baumeister 's main thesis : Women excel at close-knit relationships , men are better at broad networking . Thus , men create the broader culture in which women live .

He also ignores counter-evidence . In arguing for men as the " networkers , " for example , he ignores the many broad networks established by women ; for example , most churches are de facto run by women , who organize everything from fund-raisers to petitions to bingo . <p> Another egregious flaw is the attribution of human characteristics , or " agency , " to concepts like " society " and " culture .

" Tant , who conducted the background search and hired Schmidt while recommending him to the board , said he did not feel that he was in a tenuous position with the board at this point in the exercise . He said that in hindsight , no normal vetting of a candidate for an administrative position would have uncovered items such as those that eventually surfaced regarding Schmidt 's past deeds . In earlier statements , Tant noted that when Schmidt joined four other potential candidates for the Sun Country job , he had admitted that he had misrepresented himself as a chartered accountant to obtain a job at the IWK Health Centre in Halifax . That misrepresentation led to his dismissal from the job . Sun Country sent for legal advice when it was later revealed in a story first appearing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan from St. Mary 's Hospital in New Westminster , B.C. , while being employed as the CEO there . He never repaid the loan . The hospital later ceased operations and the Fraser Health Authority sued Schmidt for the outstanding amount plus interest and fees . The order called for him to pay $82,401.86 to the Fraser Health Authority as well as another $1,524.43 in interest and $2,215.33 in additional costs . The issue of the unpaid loan only surfaced within the past month , said Tant . It was also noted earlier that Schmidt had not only misrepresented himself as a chartered accountant in Halifax , but had continued to use the CA designation beside his name on subsequent applications for positions in B.C. The vice-president of finance and corporate services in Sun Country does not necessarily have to be a CA , said Tant , since the region has one on staff . The job entails handling such issues as information systems , strategic planning , food and materials management and other health care management issues . The CA on staff is the financial director in charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to details with the review and we should come up with ideas of how we can do things better , " said Tant . Tant said Schmidt 's resignation was tendered and accepted on August 12 . The cost of the two to three week review is not known as yet and legal advice that was being sought after the news of Schmidt 's loan surfaced , has been cancelled . Bauche said the board " has not started any action , " with regards to Tant 's position and he will remain in the role as CEO . " The review , I expect , will give us good direction . Mr. Schmidt 's resignation was a good resolution for us and we 're confident that our financial situation is good . There is no early indication of any irregularities , but we have contacted the provincial auditor to ask him if there is anything else we could or should be doing and we 'll take direction from him . " Asked if the Schmidt hiring process and subsequent blowout created a lot of questions around the Sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lots of discussion about this , no doubt . " Tant said the priorities for Sun Country remained constant and that those were patient safety and quality care . Schmidt 's residential accommodations even came into question when it was revealed that he had remained in one of the Sun Country 's contracted " transition " apartments in Weyburn for two years . Tant explained that because of tight housing markets in Weyburn and Estevan , Sun Country had contracted for two or three apartments in Weyburn to help accommodate health professionals such as registered nurses , laboratory personnel and doctors who were arriving in the region with nowhere to live . The apartments are made available to them on short-term arrangements while they get settled into the job and are able to find more permanent housing . " Hal was in one of our apartments because we did n't need it at the time . He paid the full rental costs and additional costs associated with the rental unit , " said Tant .

The families were separated from their home communities and extended families by more than a thousand kilometres . They were not provided with adequate shelter and supplies .

Moreover , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that did not wish to stay in the High Arctic to their old homes . " <p> " Today 's events are a step in the right direction , " Simon said to those gathered . <p> At a news conference in Inukjuak , shortly after delivering the apology , Duncan admitted that there were a string of broken promises made to the families moved north from what was then the settlement of Port Harrison . <p> " Mistakes were made in the 1950s , " Duncan said , adding that " the government has no way to determine what the government of the day was motivated by when they made this relocation . " <p> Acknowledging that federal officials told the relocatees were they going to a " more abundant place , " promised that they would remain in one communities and that they could leave and return to their home communities after two years if they were unhappy , Duncan said the federal government is " sorry for the hardship , the suffering and the relocation having taken place .

" <p> The apology is " the first of a series " of events that will include ceremonies in Grise Fiord and Resolute Bay next month to unveil memorials to the relocatees , a work by Simeonie Amagoalik in Resolute Bay on Sept. 8 and another by Looty Pijamini in Grise Fiord on Sept. 10 . <p> Today , only 34 of the original group are still alive .

Ltd. leading the charge - have taken notice . They 're starting to launch marketing campaigns and in-store promotions to tell consumers they do n't need to hit up a market to get local produce because it 's available in their stores . <p> Loblaw has emerged with the most ambitious local food campaign , which it calls " Grown Close to Home . " Launched last week for the third consecutive year , it showcases items from growers in " your part of the country " and puts a " spotlight on local fresh produce during harvest season , " according to recent press materials . <p> " I think all in all , customers are looking for locally-grown products more so today than ever before and we offer that convenience and the opportunity to purchase them seven days a week , " Frank Pagliaro , vice-president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What the campaign does n't mention : that the corporate definition of locally-sourced fresh produce is much different from the one used by the farmers ' markets they 're trying to emulate . <p> The company says it 's making Canadian-grown food more accessible and creating a wide market that otherwise would n't exist . But those involved in farmers ' markets say the carefully crafted images and promotions being created are inaccurate , irresponsible and misleading . <p> " The whole thing is almost hilarious , " said Robert Chorney , president of Farmers ' Markets Canada and executive director of Farmers ' Markets Ontario . " What they 're doing in no way , shape , or form resembles anything closeto a farmer 's market . " <p> During the Grown Close to Home program , which runs from August to September , about 40 per cent of produce in Loblaw stores is sourced from Canada , and is highlighted with special signage and bins .

The same goes for cherries and blueberries that are grown in B.C. and sent to Ontario or eastern Canada . <p> Many of the farms participating in the program are large operations encompassing hundreds , or even thousands , of hectares . <p> There are more than 400 farmers involved with the program .

But said she doubts the Loblaw initiative will help the small Canadian farms who typically populate farmers ' markets . <p> Most small producers do n't have the capacity , or the money , to sell to a company like Loblaw , said Andy Terauds , co-owner of Acorn Creek Garden Farm in Carp , Ont. , and president of the Ottawa Farmers ' Market .

In some areas , such as southern Ontario , local produce can be sent directly to stores in the region . In others , food must be shipped over long distances . The company is committed to promoting Canadian-grown food , he said . <p> Other companies , such as Metro Inc. , Sobeys Inc. and Canada Safeway Ltd. , have also started highlighting Canadian produce on their flyers or in stores . <p> Metro , for example , has developed a program called " Harvest from Home " that emphasizes products sourced from Canada . <p> It remains to be seen how far some companies are prepared to go to source local produce .

@@1600240 <h> The sound of music ? 1 in 5 teens suffer from hearing damage <p> Boston - Over the past 20 years , hearing loss in teenagers has risen from 15 to 20 percent . Personal stereo devices such as iPods are one culprit , but noise in the streets and at work are responsible as well . <p> A recent study by researchers in Boston has revealed the hearing loss , which is usually permanent , is on the rise . Comparing government survey data from period 1988 to 1994 with the period 2005 to 2006 , the increase is five percent , meaning that the ears of at least 1 in 5 teenagers in the age group between 12 and 19 are damaged to some extent . According to the study , this translates into an increase impacting 6.5 million teenagers . <p> The results of this study appeared in today 's Journal of the American Medical Association , and many who interpret the new numbers are quick to point out that teens often use portable music players for extended periods of time at loud volumes . The claim , however , is supported by recent study of children in Australia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due to the use of personal stereo devices . <p> Potential hearing impairment from noise-levels , which usually means damage to the inner ear rather than to the eardrum , is dependent on two variable : sound-volume ( measured in decibel ) and the lengths of time the ear is exposed to it . An article in The Hindu , discussing the recent vuvuzela use during the World Soccer Championship , explains it as follow : When noise is too loud , it begins to kill nerve 's endings in the inner ear . As the exposure time to loud noise increases , more and more nerve endings are destroyed . As the number of nerve endings decreases the hearing ability also dips . There is no way to restore life to dead nerve endings ; the damage is permanent . <p> While the safest and recommended exposure to noise is between the ranges of -20 decibel ( dB ) and +25 dB , the environment many of us live in today is far from ideal , considering that the noise pollution from normal traffic in a big city measures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that for merely a short time , it does not have to be damaging . Problems do begin to arise when someone is exposed to 85 or 90 dB more than 8 hours a day , or to 100 dB for 2 hours . The scale is logarithmic : as the noise level rises the permissible time of exposure is drastically shorter . For the ear to receive 115 dB , for example , more than 15 minutes a day will be damaging -- and everything above 140 dB is outright destructive , even for less than 5 minutes . <p> The science is inconclusive , though . An article in Science Daily , for example , quotes a young woman who measures how loud kids crank up the volume on their iPods o similar players . She speaks of 99 dB as so dangerously loud that one should n't listen to this longer than 15 minutes . The woman , Genna Martin , usually warns kids who love to crank it up , saying : " If you listen to it this loud now , by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it anymore .

The shooting is still under investigation , but his " crime " seems to have been to suffer from mental illness . <p> The scenario is depressingly familiar : Young man has a psychotic episode , police are called ( usually by a concerned family member ) , the agitated individual ( screaming threats and sometimes brandishing a weapon ) refuses to obey police orders .

The shooter , the ill person and the grieving family are all victims - of a broken system . <p> Mr. Jardine-Douglas is a case in point . Suffering from severe paranoia , he was taken to the family doctor on Aug. 27 . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took him to a hospital , where he was turned away because no psychiatrist was available .

He is dead because he did n't get timely , appropriate care . <p> " We are convinced that a radical transformation of mental-health and addictions care is necessary if Ontarians are to get the care they need and deserve , " the committee headed by MPP Kevin Flynn wrote in a report tabled a few days earlier . <p> The MPPs heard many heart-wrenching stories about families ' inability to get care for their loved ones in a byzantine system , and about the frustrations of caregivers who have one hand tied behind their backs by senseless laws .

Mental health needs the same medicine . <p> Currently , getting medical treatment , particularly for acute problems such as psychotic episodes , is nearly impossible . Emergency-room protocols are uneven at best ; 24/7 mobile crisis-intervention teams work marvellously , but they are few and far between . There is an acute lack of treatment beds , particularly in psychiatric hospitals . While these institutions have fallen out of favour , they are essential for the sickest of the sick . <p> Most people suffering from mental illness live in the community , but getting appropriate care in the real world is dizzyingly complex .

There are many well-meaning programs , but there is no co-ordination and little collaboration . <p> The lack of leadership and accountability is disturbing , and sometimes deadly . <p> The legislature committee pointed out , quite astutely , that while mental illness and addictions are medical conditions , they have become criminalized to a troubling degree . More than one-third of people in custody in Ontario suffer from a diagnosed mental illness and substance abuse is a factor in half of all criminal offences . <p> " Far too many Ontarians experience their first contact with the mental-health system through the justice system , " the MPPs wrote . <p> Police need to be better trained to deal with people suffering from mental illness and these sick individuals need to be sentenced to care , not jail . <p> One of the most compelling aspects of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most controversial - is the call to broaden the criteria for involuntary admission ( and , by extension , limit the right of severely mentally ill people to refuse treatment . ) " The right to autonomy must be balanced by the right to be well , " the committee wrote . <p> It is a travesty that families have trouble getting care for family members who are clearly very ill , yet refuse treatment or are too quickly discharged . <p> This is not freedom , it 's a death sentence . <p> Similarly , privacy laws create perverse situations where families are emotionally and financially invested in caring for a loved one but are denied even the most basic information about their condition . <p> The recommendations made by the all-party committee are not new , but they are stated plainly , concisely and with an appropriate sense of urgency .

Inside , the federal Joint Review Panel held its first public meeting on the project and listened to a litany of complaints and concerns about the proposal . <p> Enbridge has proposed the construction of two pipelines and a marine terminal in Kitimat to send tar sands oil to export . The 1,170 kilometers of pipeline will carry an average of 525,000 barrels of oil per day west from Bruderheim , Alberta , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for pipeline transport . From the marine terminal , tar sands oil would be loaded onto approximately 225 oil tankers per year , which would then navigate the Douglas Channel and around the coastal archipelago to the sea . <p> Representatives of First Nations , fishermen , environmental groups , and northern communities , as well as various community members , continue to express concerns about the inherent risks involved in the Gateway Pipeline and its associated tanker traffic . The proposed Northern Gateway Pipeline crosses rough , mountainous terrain through the sensitive watersheds of the upper Fraser , Skeena , and Kitimat . There are serious concerns about the risks of oil spills . On July 26 , 2010 , an Enbridge pipeline spill in Michigan released four million litres of oil into the Kalamazoo River . <p> Similar concerns have been voiced about the prospect of increased tanker traffic along the north coast . In the north , the memory of the Exxon Valdez spill still lingers .

The oil eventually covered 2,100 km of coastline and 28,000 km2 of ocean .

The Supreme Court of Canada has recognized a Crown duty to consult and accommodate Aboriginal peoples regarding any project that would impact their relationships to their lands and traditions . The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples has further stipulated the necessity of attaining First Nations free , prior and informed consent for developments that would alter their territories . Many of the First Nations along the pipeline route remain unsatisfied with Enbridge 's limited attempts to consider the importance of their relationships to their territories .

They urged the panel to recognize the project was not simply about a pipeline , but fundamentally about the expansion of tar sands oil extraction , the export of raw bitumen , and the introduction of oil tanker traffic to the northern coast . <p> At the rally outside the meeting , there was little ambiguity about the stance of the majority of those present .

Speaking at the event , federal Members of Parliament Ujjal Dosanjh ( Liberal ) and Finn Donnelly ( NDP ) pledged to work towards a legislated ban on crude oil tankers in northern coastal waters . Coastal First Nations , an alliance of the First Nations of the North and Central Coast of British Columbia and Haida Gwaii , have already declared a moratorium on oil tankers within their traditional territorial waters .

" For hundreds of years , the fisheries have been vital to our communities ' economies and our way of life as coastal people , and we 're not willing to put that at risk .

@@1620232 <h> Op-Ed : Is France lying about Roma crime rates ? <p> The French Interior minister recently released figures on Roma crime rates which suggested they had rocketed in the past few years . There are no official statistics to support his statement , but there are several to contradict it . <p> France 's recent crackdown on its Roma population has resulted in their accelerated expulsion by the planeload back to their countries of origin . This has in turn led to international criticism of French policies and even accusations of racism and xenophobia . <p> So it is only normal that the French try to defend themselves , and that 's what Interior minister Brice Hortefeux did a few days ago when he tried to defend government policies by claiming that crime rates and " delinquency of Romanian origin " in Paris had rocketed " by 138% in 2009 and 259% in eighteen months . " He added that " Today , in Paris , the reality is that almost one thief in five is a Romanian " and that " one theft in four by minors is committed by a Romanian minor . " <p> Now you have to admit that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " Romanian " is not a synonym of " Roma . " They are so impressive in fact that if they were true I myself would put every Roma in this country on a plane and personally fly them to Bucharest . But this is just too far-fetched to be true . <p> The most pernicious aspect of these figures is that there is absolutely no way to verify them . So where did he get them from ? <p> There are no official sources , national statistics , nothing , which can be consulted to verify his statement , which is not unusual in France , a country which is notorious in the West for its reluctance to inform the public on issues which concern it . ( There are no statistics on the ethnic make-up of the prison population , for example . ) <p> As Rue89 pointed out , French journalists have been slaving away for days trying to find some official statistics or documents to back Hortefeux 's figures up , but they have n't been able to find any , even from direct police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immigration authorities and other official bodies . <p> One source sent them to the STIC statistics . These government statistics on recorded crime are so unreliable , unverifiable and manifestly false that they are the laughing stock of the whole of France . But even if they were reliable that would be completely irrelevant , because the STIC database does n't have the statistics quoted by Hortefeux either . <p> Although police figures are hard to come by , there are a few . What do they show ? First of all , they show that the police do not note the nationalities of their ' clients . ' Also , many of those who show up in figures do so because of infractions concerning authorization to be on French territory , which means those crimes can not be committed by French nationals and thus should not be included in any comparison . Not only that , the statistics show that the percentage of foreigners suspected of breaking the law compared to French nationals had actually gone down by 12.5% in 2009 . <p> So if it were true that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must have mechanically gone down dramatically within other immigrant groups . But that is n't true according to the government itself , seeing as officials never stop quoting figures on the supposed rising crime rates of immigrant populations . <p> So Hortefeux certainly did not get his figures there . <p> Available justice system figures do n't support him either . They , unlike police figures , include the nationalities of those condemned before the courts and there are figures available for 2007 and 2008 . Those figures contradict everything Hortefeux says . They say that in those two years , the percentage of convicted individuals of Romanian origin went down by 6% , for a total of 4,300 . The population of France is 64 million . <p> In other words , the only two available official sources for crime figures relative to the Roma completely contradict what the government is saying . So where did he get those figures ? <p> There is an interesting figure available at the Romanian Interior ministry too . The ministry says that of the hundreds of Roma sent back to Romania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romanian police records . <p> M Hortefeux , I 'll ask you this question just one more time . Where did you get your figures ? And if you ca n't answer that question clearly , unambiguously and in a manner acceptable to all , it means that either at best you should never have mentioned them in the first place , or at worst that you are lying . <p> This opinion article was written by an independent writer .

@@1631232 <h> James C. Hathaway : Why human smuggling is vital <p> Hoping to stymie the arrival of boat refugees , the government is expected to announce tough new penalties for human smuggling . Other likely aspects of the Convervative plan -- in particular , intercepting boats carrying refugees in international waters , and denying due process rights to those onboard -- can be counted on to generate controversy as clear violations of international law . But somehow efforts to go after smugglers raise few hackles . To the contrary , many would agree with the assessment of former Australian prime minister Kevin Rudd , who famously called human smugglers the " absolute scum of the Earth , " saying they should be left to " rot in hell . " <p> This is a simplistic view , which should be rejected . <p> Government responses to the recent arrival of 492 Tamil refugees in British Columbia last month routinely confused the issue of human smuggling with that of trafficking . A trafficker engages in coercive , exploitative dealings with people desperate to migrate . Traffickers abuse or deceive the people they transport , for example by subjecting them to debt bondage in the destination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already -- appropriately -- strong laws both in Canada and internationally that treat traffickers as slave traders subject to the full force of the criminal law . <p> A smuggler , in contrast , is simply someone who assists another to cross a border without official permission . The transaction is consensual , reflecting a decision on the part of the refugee that the short-term hell of life onboard a container ship is better than the risk of being persecuted at home . While human smuggling is perhaps normally to be opposed -- borders do matter , and laws are laws -- it should also be recognized that human smugglers play a critical role in assisting refugees to reach safety . <p> This is the nub of the issue . Governments around the world have vilified plain old human smuggling -- that is , assisted border crossing with no exploitation or coercion involved -- in a completely dishonest way . We know that many of those on the boats that periodically arrive at our shores are genuine refugees . We know that no state -- including Canada -- will grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a law-abiding way in order to claim refugee status . And we know that no more than a tiny minority of the world 's refugees will receive a resettlement offer to immigrate to a safe country . The overwhelming majority of the refugee population -- nearly 90% of whom are stuck in states of the less developed world , which often neglect or brutalize them -- are thus left with no option but to take matters into their own hands and flee to a country which they hope will treat them fairly . <p> Indeed , the UN Refugee Convention , which Canada helped to draft and signed , expressly allows refugees to travel to our shores without prior permission , and requires that they be exempted from penalties for breach of immigration laws . Why ? Because the treaty 's drafters knew that countries would not -- understandably -- abolish border controls in order to ensure ready access for refugees . Yet the drafters also knew that if refugees faced the same barriers as all other would-be migrants , access to the protection guaranteed by the Refugee Convention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to refrain from challenging the right of states to control most immigration , but to require governments to ensure that refugees are not caught by exclusionary rules . When Canada single-mindedly demonizes all smuggling , it runs roughshod over this carefully crafted compromise . <p> Does this mean that human smuggling is justified ? In a way , yes . Canada and other developed countries created the market on which smugglers depend by erecting ( literal and virtual ) migration walls around their territories . The more difficult it is to get across a border to safety on one 's own , the more sensible it is to hire a smuggler to navigate the barriers to entry . Smugglers are thus the critical bridge to get at-risk people to safety . Which one of us , if confronted with a desperate need to flee but facing seemingly impossible barriers , would not seek out a smuggler to assist us ? <p> Canada could avoid its current dilemma by taking the lead on getting governments to agree to a system of refugee responsibility-sharing that would ensure that smugglers are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ durable protection . We could then pursue border control without fear of indirectly punishing genuine refugees ( not just the smugglers ) . <p> But if we are not willing to shoulder that political burden , then we should accept that non-exploitative , plain old human smuggling is both inevitable and -- sadly -- critical to ensuring that immigration rules do not operate so as to keep genuine refugees away . Our migration control system will not be watertight . But with Canada now hosting less than one-half of 1% of the world 's refugees , we are in no position to claim anything remotely approaching hardship , much less the critical threat that the government alleges . <p> James C.

@@1631240 <h> Guy Maddin Haunts the Lightbox With His Cinematic Spooks <p> Guy Maddin does n't harbour any particular resentment towards the Toronto International Film Festival for rejecting his first feature , 1988 's Tales From the Gimli Hospital . With the benefit of twenty-plus years of hindsight -- during which time Maddin has cemented his repute as one of Canada 's most important filmmakers -- the decision of the TIFF bigwigs may seem like some great slight . But you ca n't really hold it against them . It 's probably easy to regard an anachronistic 16mm film chock full of necrophilia , buttocks-grabbing contests , and fish-intestine hair conditioner as some bizarre midnight movie oddity , and not a calling card for a cinematic heavyweight . With the modest success of subsequent features such as Archangel and Careful , and the more immodest failure of 1997 's Shelly Duval -- starring faerie fantasia Twilight of the Ice Nymphs , Maddin proved himself more than just a flash in the pan cinematic curiosity . In 2000 , the festival commissioned Heart of the World , a six-minute ode to Soviet-era silent films , and in 2007 TIFF rewarded Maddin 's " docu-fantasia " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's back on TIFF 's stomping grounds with Hauntings I &amp; II , an installation commissioned for the TIFF Bell Lightbox as part of its Essential Cinema exhibition . <p> Recalling his project with Heart of the World , Hauntings has Maddin revisiting the styles of filmmakers he has long admired ( many long forgotten ) . A series of silent shorts , Hauntings constitutes Maddin 's unique imaginings of abandoned , lost , or otherwise forgotten films . It 's a clever complement to the Essential Cinema exhibition , allowing the Lightbox to showcase artifacts that have slipped through the creaky floorboards of cinema 's history . Maddin and TIFF now have what seems like an extremely healthy relationship , one that over the years blossomed , or at the very least congealed , into an exceptionally productive partnership . We 're all lucky that Guy Maddin is so willing to dust off the skeletons in his closet . And just as lucky that the big wheels at TIFF keep encouraging him to do so . We chatted with Maddin about Hauntings , his new " talkie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of " ectoplasmic odours . " Torontoist : Last time we spoke you mentioned this idea of doing something where you remake lost films or forgotten films . So how did it go from being just this nascent idea to an installation commissioned by TIFF ? Guy Maddin : Well I 'd been thinking of doing for a long time . I 've been literally haunted by the idea that there are these really intriguing titles by some of my favourite filmmakers that I 'd never get to see , whether it 's because they 're lost for the time being , or permanently . I told myself years ago that the only way I 'd get to see any version of these is if I made the adaptation myself and watched it.Was n't your first commission for TIFF 2000 's The Heart of the World also a sort of a remake of a lost film ? It was my first wholehearted adaptation of a lost film , Abel Gance 's La fin du monde . I had read a very short , one paragraph synopsis of it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also adapted La Roue , also by Abel Gance , into a short film . Thinking it was lost , I made my own four-minute version . But it turns out it had n't been lost . It just was n't available on video . And it was recently released in a four-hour version . So you have my four-minute version and as well as the four-hour original . But these things were never attempted to be remakes ; they were just adaptations . The same way authors of the nineteenth century would do different versions of the same story . <p> It 's interesting when you say that you finally found La Roue on home video . Because a lot of times these " lost " films may be finished but just suppressed from release . Or they were projects that were abandoned . Or there were just rumours about a director working on a secret project . How did you choose which kinds of lost films you were interested in for Hauntings ? At first I made very specific distinctions : I wanted to know if a film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once described it to a friend , I became more generally interested in films with no known final resting place . It 's as if these films are condemned to wander the earth in limbo . Or they 're resting somewhere in un-consecrated ground . There 's something unholy about them . Then I started thinking of the aborted projects . There was Hitchcock 's famous The Blind Man , with Jimmy Stewart as the recipient of a pair of new eyeballs . And he would see the image of his donor 's murder in them . It was to culminate in a climax at Walt Disneyland , but Walt Disney called it off . I guess he did n't want the director of Psycho sullying his brand or using it for nefarious purposes . So I liked this idea of aborted projects . And then just unrealized ones . I like this idea of hope withering and dying on the vine . It 's kind of sad as well : kind of the Miss Havisham of film spirits . Something that never quite dies . So I lumped them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhume these lost , aborted , and unrealized projects.When you finally got around to putting the wheels in motion , which of these films did you exhume ? Well , I 'm working on a longer-term project with the American poet John Ashbury and the National Film Board to make over a thousand of these things . But for the Lightbox , Artistic Director Noah Cowan and I talked about how brand spankin ' new the place is , and how it was n't haunted by any film history or any ghosts yet . So I volunteered to haunt the joint . I sort of put on my curator 's hat and came up with my array of canonical and non-canonical titles that have haunted me over there years . So there 's a Mizoguchi , a von Sternberg , a Lang , an Alice Guy , an Oscar Micheaux : just filmmakers that have really intrigued me . <p> " We talked about how brand spankin ' new the place is , and how it was n't haunted by any film history or any ghosts yet . So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many more I would love to fit in . Ed Wood , you know , had so many lost films . Alas , Oscar Micheaux was often called " the black Ed Wood " and he made the cut because his films were so much more intriguing to me . There 's a lot of stuff about people " passing " for white in his films , and I like the idea of these films " passing " as something else entirely.Do you know about the rumoured Orson Welles Batman movie ? Think you 'll ever get around to that one ? No ! But I 'm always happy to take a suggestion . Orson was going to do a Batman picture ? Well it 's probably just a rumour or a hoax that has been circulating over the years . But anyway , the story goes that Orson Welles was going to do the first big screen , live-action Batman film . It 's entirely plausible . It seems like the kind of thing he 'd want to pile onto his plate to give him a million more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nixed because he wanted to play Batman , and this was I think in the early 1960s , when he was n't exactly at his physical peak . No ! He was already fumbling through magic tricks on the Dean Martin Celebrity Roasts ! But forget Orson Welles . Did you bring this Hauntings project to TIFF , or did they approach you about it ? Well Noah Cowan approached me and asked me if I wanted to do some magic lantern shows , and I told him how I was thinking about this Hauntings project . And it turned out I could give myself a sneak preview of these pieces by doing a few for the Lightbox . It happened to work perfectly with what they were planning at the Lightbox . Noah and I just had a few back-and-forth conversations . It all came together fairly easily.As an installation , how are these films going to be screened ? The films all play in one room , all eleven of them . There 's no soundtrack , because I did n't want it to be massive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mute ghosts ; scored by whatever sounds the city of Toronto brings.So you have a pretty healthy relationship with the festival ? It feels good right now . I do n't want to infuriate other filmmakers with boasts of what a great relationship we have , as if we 're some happily-married couple . But they 've been tremendously good for me and I 've liked working for them . I love commissions . I like deadlines and restrictions . I 've been happy to showcase my films at TIFF , always.Well did the festival not reject Tales From the Gimli Hospital way back in the day ? They did . But that was a long time ago . Current TIFF co-director Piers Handling was there , and current U of T film and women 's studies professor Kay Armatage , and Toronto Star film critic Geoff Pevere . I think those were the three on the selection committee . And I think it was Piers and Kay versus Geoff . But I 've since become great friends with all three of them . And Piers has more than over-apologized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the whole thing.It looks like they 've more than made up for it . It 's like a revenge wet dream , having the festival 's most important power brokers apologizing to you in public . But I do n't need to hear it anymore . I love the guy now.And of course the festival commissioned Heart of the World , which many consider your masterpiece . It 's the one movie I 've ever made that turned out exactly as planned . That does n't usually happen with me . It happens with Stanley Kubrick maybe , but it does n't happen with me . Laughs . They 'd all turn out masterpieces if they turned out exactly as I planned them ! Do you think that 's a result of it being a short , or a commission ? Are you able to be more precise when you have to colour within these lines ? Things just fell into place . Sometimes I fall into a zone and find myself producing images that I 'm far luckier to get than I deserve . It just happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot a talkie this summer , which I had n't done in a while.Is that Keyhole ? That 's right.There was a recent interview with Kevin McDonald where he mentioned it . He plays a sort of gangster in it . It 's a gangster picture in a haunted house . The film is my tribute to the Bowery boys , where spooks run wild . It has Jason Patric , Udo Kier , Isabella Rossellini , and Kevin McDonald . And a bunch of other dubious Winnipeggers and young Torontonians thrown into the mix.Do you have any skeletons rattling around in your closet ? Any projects that are haunting you and you 'd like to get back to work on ? Yeah , I put some of my own aborted and lost and unrealized projects right into the Hauntings shooting schedule . I figured that shooting them as four minute movies might be the only way they ever get done . It was fun to exercise these films from my own dusty drawers . And I did n't shoot them on film , I shot them on digital.So all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . I had a lot of fun experimenting with different digital looks this summer . Plus it 's nice to be able to immediately see what you 've got right there , instead of sending it off to the lab for five terrifying days , waiting for something to come back only to be met with sweet depression and soul-crushing disappointment . I 'm kind of hooked on digital shooting now . But I 'll never throw away my Super 8 camera.It must be exciting to work with this new medium , after having so thoroughly tamed Super 8 and 16mm and all the other film formats . It 's great . All the happy and unhappy accidents that helped me to develop a style are starting all over again . Just when I stopped having accidents , I started having new ones based on abject ignorance . Like I did n't know you had to re-format a memory card when you switch it from one camera to another , and I 'd end up losing everything I shot.But eventually you work the kinks out . I try not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learned too much , but enjoyed a renaissance when I un-learned everything in time for Heart of the World . But these Hauntings reflect that .

" Right now there might be a half dozen people around Orillia who do skate sharpening , but there are only a couple of us who have been in the business long enough to have the knowledge that you need to do the job properly , " said Carpenter.With hundreds of pairs of skates set to flow in and out of the Rotary Place twin-pad facility on a daily basis , Carpenter landed the contract to sharpen skates in the facility .

" We are not immune to it . No one 's immune to it , come on . The business has dropped by 60 per cent . <p> " How can one not deal with that ? " <p> Indeed , McBride remains unwaveringly confident in the company he started a quarter-century ago . <p> At the time , he and Mark Jowett ( who also co-founded Nettwerk alongside Ric Arboit and Dan Fraser ) were employees at Odyssey Imports in Vancouver and passionate vinyl addicts who got the idea to launch a record label . <p> They started with three bands : foreboding synth-pop purveyors Moev , jangle-folk quartet the Grapes of Wrath and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's book , Nettwerk : 25 Years of Music We Love , tells the story , McBride then was a wide-eyed sort , with the looks of a schoolboy but a determined presence . <p> " It was a phenomenally exciting time in music , " reminisced Jowett in a telephone interview . <p> " It was great to feel like we were really in the thick of it , by ... starting to hook up with all these great bands everywhere that did n't have a home in North America . " <p> Each of Nettwerk 's inaugural signees carved out a niche at home and abroad , but the label would wrangle a bigger star in 1987 , when McBride won over a teenaged Sarah McLachlan as she racked up a high score in pinball at a Halifax bar . <p> Blessed with a cherubic voice and a distinct sensibility , McLachlan soon became an international star , eventually winning three Grammy Awards and dozens of platinum plaques . <p> Even more impressively , she withstood McBride 's lofty demands . He expects his artists to live up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes has a tendency to run people ragged . <p> One of McBride 's strategies was to follow the heat . Any time he saw a blip of interest at a radio station , he and his artists would follow like a missile , ready to perform and build a bigger audience . <p> His strategy certainly impressed the Barenaked Ladies , who became interested in hiring McBride as their manager in 1995 . <p> " Terry was really frank and cool , " singer Ed Robertson recalled . " He said : ' You know , you guys are great , I 'm a big fan , but you look ridiculous . You 've got no image consistency and we need to work harder in the U.S. So if you guys are ready to work your asses off in the U.S. , I 'll take you on .

In July of the following year , the Barenaked Ladies followed out the door for the L.A.-based Cam 8 Management firm . The next month , Tremblay departed too , taking Billy Talent , Sweet Thing and Silverstein with him . <p> While these exits seem to form a trend , McBride insists each incident is isolated . <p> Nettwerk discovered Lavigne when she was 14 , and Jowett received a videotape of the Napanee , Ont. , native singing karaoke in her parents ' basement . <p> Though she was scooped up by an American label before Nettwerk could sign her , McBride eventually agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international star with three No. 1 albums and platinum sales the world over . And then she was gone . <p> " She moved to L.A. and at the end of the day , she wanted an L.A-based manager that could pop into her house within like an hour 's notice , " McBride said by way of explanation . <p> The Barenaked Ladies , meanwhile , were reeling from then-frontman Steven Page 's drug arrest and ensuing departure from the band when they opted to change management . <p> McBride says their split from Nettwerk was mutual . <p> McBride points out that neither artist is necessarily better off having left the company . <p> " Avril has n't released an album since she left Nettwerk , and that 's been over two years . You know , I question that , " he said . " BNL , I mean , unfortunately , this album ( 2010 's All in Good Time ) came and went . <p> Now , McBride is focused on Polyphonic , a new model that collects all an artist 's income streams into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And then there were the frustrations of this summer 's revived Lilith Fair . The original tour was lucrative for the company , drawing in more than 1.5 million fans over three years . <p> This year , organizers were forced to cancel about a third of a planned 35 dates . McBride and McLachlan largely blamed a soft market , but some say there were other factors . <p> " A value that 's always been important to Terry is to be fair to the fans and to listen to the fans and so on and so forth -- I do n't think the Lilith project was going in that direction at all , " Tremblay said . <p> " I think they overpriced the tickets , there was a bit of gouging going on , you know , all that sort of stuff .

Once the financial departments of businesses large and small discovered a taste for the Cupertino ( and its distant cousins the Commodore and IBM ) during the 1980s , the effect these breeds of apple had on the physical and mental health of employees was remarkable . Better health provoked better forecasting abilities , which resulted in many a crystal ball being tossed out the window . To this day the crystal ball industry has not recovered the sales volumes it saw during the 1970s . The Canadian growers of the Cupertino apple later moved their administrative operations from Don Mills to Markham .

@@1681235 <p> CALGARY -- Calgary 's most popular politician of the moment can barely walk a few steps anywhere these days without being stopped and congratulated . <p> One of Naheed Nenshi 's favourite phrases has been that he ca n't think in sound bites and that even saying his own name takes longer than 45 seconds . <p> It 's a name that is now being hollered at him from passing cars and with it a recognition that has people running across the street to shake his hand and pat his back . <p> Civic politics in Calgary has been mainly a straightforward affair . Few surprises . Low turnouts . But Nenshi 's campaign , which got a late burst of energy , did something unusual . It changed perceptions from outsiders of what kind of city Calgary was and who Calgarians really were and his campaign motivated voters to head to the polls . <p> He won with 40 per cent of the vote handily beating his two closest competitors , a high-profile alderman and a former news anchor , both heavily favoured to win . Voter turnout at 53 per cent was the highest it 's been in four decades . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced him to run by starting a Facebook page ; people who knew him through his work as a pundit on civic affairs in the local media , his volunteer activities , and students from the non-profit and business courses he taught at Mount Royal University . <p> He arrived in Canada in his mother 's belly . His parents , Tanzanian immigrants of Ismaili Muslim faith , raised the family in the city 's Marlborough neighbourhood . Among the many firsts , Nenshi is also the first mayor in modern times to come from east Calgary . <p> Then as now , the neighbourhood is known for being one of the city 's most ethnically diverse and poorest . Nenshi did his homework while manning the cash register at the family 's dry cleaning business , an experience he can laughingly recount now as teaching him at an early age how to make change . <p> The first time Kori Street , a chair at the Bissett School of Business at Mount Royal University met Nenshi , they were on opposing sides of a heated discussion at a faculty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-prepared and an effective orator , " says Street , who calls Nenshi 's departure from teaching a real loss for the school and students . " I still did n't agree with him but what I learned was he 's someone who respects alternative perspectives . " <p> Nenshi , who holds a master 's in public policy from Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government , was always interested in finding real solutions to civic problems , said former student Erin Delamont . <p> " We would look at a case study and you think ' I understand this case and this is what should happen , ' " said Delamont . " But you start discussing it with him and you begin to come up with thoughts you never would have before and you end up smarter . " <p> Nenshi explained his platform policies on YouTube and amassed a following of thousands on Twitter . His policies were easy to write , Nenshi said in an interview over dinner with the Star . Many were ideas he had been developing for years . Among his suggestions : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another sandwich in lunch boxes for kids to share . Another plan is to reduce the in-camera hearings at city councils and hold public hearings after work hours so more people can attend . <p> His first priorities are reducing the city 's $60 million deficit , getting an airport tunnel built and expanding rapid transit . <p> A turning point in the campaign was on the weekend of September 11 when unknown people vandalized his campaign office . Support began pouring in from different faith organizations . <p> Nenshi had been targeted before and called names , once getting a racial epithet yelled at him from a passing car when he was in Peterborough , Ont. , and online commentators in news articles have made frequent derogatory references to his background . <p> He has also heard the talk about his status as a single man and can even joke about it . <p> " When you 're 38 years old and single and this darn good looking , people do ask that question to themselves . No one has the guts to ask me directly , " Nenshi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whether it matters . " I would love to have this appear in print . For the record , the answer is no if people care and no it does n't matter . This election has proven these sort of things do n't matter . People want to know my ideas . " <p> Nenshi said he 's not going to shy away from his religion or his race and has faith that most Calgarians do n't care . <p> " My ideas , my experience , my education is all part of who I am . The values I hold are influenced by all those things and it 's part of the crazy mix that 's called Naheed and part of the crazy mix that is Calgary . "

@@1681239 <p> Last weekend I got together with friends and we played a game . The object was to share a unique piece of information about any topic . Now , my friend Jim shared all you could ever want to know about the levator labii superioris alaeque nasi . If that term does n't put a smile on your face , you should worry . As it turns out , he was talking about one of the muscles in your face that allow you to smile . When it was my turn , I shared a tax strategy that very few people think about . ( Note to self : Stay far away from Tim and his friends . They know nothing about having a good time . ) <h> Investing <p> Let me share that strategy once again . It 's the perfect time of year for this one . <p> The Concept <p> Picture this . Your spouse has capital gains on which he 'll pay tax this year . Or perhaps he 's reported capital gains in the last three years ( 2009 , 2008 or 2007 ) . You , on the other hand , have capital losses to use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those losses . So , your spouse could end up paying tax on those gains even though , as a couple , you may not have made any profits . <p> You can solve this by transferring capital losses from one spouse to the other . The capital losses could then be applied to reduce the capital gains of the other spouse . It 's also possible to carry capital losses back up to three tax years , to recover taxes paid in a prior year . Keep in mind , the capital losses must be on paper only ( not actually realized ) in order to use this strategy . The exception is where those losses were realized in the last 30 days , in which case there may still be time to implement the idea . <p> The Example <p> Jackson owns shares in XYZ Corp . that are worth $30,000 today . He paid $70,000 for the shares , so he has an unrealized capital loss of $40,000 . His wife , Nancy , reported capital gains on her tax return last year of $40,000 . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nancy , she could then report that loss on her 2010 tax return and carry the loss back to 2009 to recover the $9,280 in taxes she paid last year on that capital gain . How can this be done ? Easily , in three steps . <p> Step 1 : Sell your securities . Jackson is going to sell his XYZ shares on the open market for their fair market value of $30,000 . This will cause him to realize his $40,000 capital loss . But we do n't want to stop there . After all , Jackson does n't need the capital losses - Nancy does . <p> Step 2 : Your spouse buys them back . Nancy will now purchase on the open market the same class of XYZ shares that Jackson sold . So , Nancy will pay $30,000 to purchase the XYZ shares . At this point , our tax law will cause Jackson 's $40,000 capital loss to be denied . You see , if you sell a security at a loss and then you , or someone affiliated with you ( including your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following your sale ( or 30 days prior to your sale ) , your loss will be denied under the superficial loss rules . <p> But the loss is not gone forever . Under our tax law , the $40,000 capital loss is added to the cost amount of the newly acquired shares . So , even though Nancy paid $30,000 for the shares , her adjusted cost base ( ACB ) will be $70,000 ( the $30,000 she paid , plus the $40,000 loss that was denied ) . This way , Nancy will get the benefit of the loss when she eventually sells the shares ( the higher ACB will reduce a gain or increase her loss at that time ) . <p> Step 3 : Your spouse sells . Nancy will now sell her XYZ shares . Do n't forget , the value is $30,000 , but her ACB is $70,000 , so she 'll have a capital loss of $40,000 which she can use to offset her gains . Presto . Jackson has transferred the capital loss to Nancy . <p> Keep in mind , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 when Jackson sells . Step 2 must take place within 30 days of Step 1 . Then , Step 3 must take place after the 30th day . So , Jackson could have sold on Day 1 , Nancy could have made her purchase on Day 29 , and then sold the shares two days later on Day 31 . You should aim to implement Step 1 by Nov. 20 to make sure this whole strategy can take place in 2010 . <h> Restrictions <p> All rights reserved .

One of the biggest concerns is the amount of radiation they emit : Radiation from one CT scan is equivalent to 400 or more chest X-rays . <p> Another major issue is that screening healthy people can increase the risk of " false positives , " or identifying cancer in a person who does n't have the disease . <p> Some say it 's not an effective way to utilize complex , radiation-emitting and very expensive diagnostic tests . <p> The Canadian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent of all CT scans performed in Canada are unnecessary or provide no relevant information to doctors . <p> The results of the new U.S. study seem positive : Regular CT scans can help spot lung cancer in heavy smokers and prompt earlier treatment , which can reduce the number of people who will die from the disease . <p> Initial results ( the full study has not yet been published ) found that 354 people who had three CT scans a year died from lung cancer , compared with 442 people who were screened with three annual chest X-rays . The 50,000 people involved in the trial were all current or former heavy smokers aged between 55 and 74 . <p> The study has generated considerable excitement because it 's one of the first pieces of research to show CT screening can be effective in early detection of lung cancer . Currently , there are no good screening methods - including X-rays - so many lung cancer cases are detected when it 's already too late . <p> " Screening high-risk populations is always a good thing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Radiologists , adding that strict criteria would need to be adopted before lung cancer screening was introduced to the wider population . <p> But many medical experts say the results need to be interpreted with caution to avoid opening a floodgate of thousands , or millions , of additional CT scans every year . <p> " We should n't rush to judgment that everybody should get screened , " said Steven Seltzer , chairman of the radiology department at Brigham and Women 's Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School . " We 're really at the beginning of the debate . " <p> While regular CT scans did seem to reduce death rates , 300 people had to be screened in order to save one life . <p> That 's a major issue , considering that one scan costs several hundred dollars as well as emitting potentially harmful levels of radiation and raising a patient 's risk of wrong diagnosis , unnecessary biopsies and other unneeded tests . <p> " You think of the cost of one CT scan , the cost of following up false @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't cancer , " said John You , assistant professor of medicine and clinical epidemiology at McMaster University in Hamilton . " It 's going to be a landmark study ... but I think it 's just important to keep everything in perspective . " <p> But perspective can be hard to maintain when talking about medical screening . <p> If 300 , or even 1,000 people need to be screened to save one life , who is to say the cost outweighs the benefit ? <p> " How can you tell an individual patient who 's sitting in front of you that you just do n't think screeningis worth it ?

@@1713235 @ @ @ @ 17-year-old schoolboy , Saul Bellow flexed his narrative muscles . When writing a letter he liked to set the scene . In 1932 , he wrote to a girlfriend , Yetta Barshevsky : " It is dark now and the lonely wind is making the trees softly whisper and rustle . Somewhere in the night a bird cries out to the wind . My brother in the next room snores softly , insistently . ... I am thinking , thinking , Yetta , drifting with night , with infinity , and all my thoughts are of you . " <p> Yetta , a bright and curious member of the Young Communist League , introduced Saul to world politics ( " after a fashion , " as he wrote later ) . His letter confirmed the break-up of their romance and his ( possibly relieved ) acknowledgement that he was losing her to the boy she married soon after . <p> The earliest Bellow letter surviving , that message to Yetta sounds the opening chord of Saul Bellow : Letters ( Penguin ) , edited by Benjamin Taylor , an absorbing record of what Bellow thought and felt from the 1930s @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boyish Saul obviously hoped to be considered both poetic and shrewd . What he says to Yetta stirs our interest in his romantic life , which led to five marriages and many angry letters .

" His widow , Janis Freedman Bellow , recently told an interviewer that " He was a serial marrier . It had to do with a strange desire on his part to be intimate , to have love at the centre of his life . " <p> Saul Bellow : Letters is flecked with remarkable judgments , often harsh , on the people he knew . He considered Hannah Arendt rigid and unimaginative , as well as " monumentally vain , " though " She was n't altogether stupid . " George Steiner ?

Later , after dinner with her at the Pump Room in Chicago , he wrote to his publisher : " I have yet to see anything in Marilyn that is n't genuine . Surrounded by thousands , she conducts herself like a philosopher . " <p> Bellow 's letters reveal him as a restless , agitated truth-seeker , not unlike many of his characters . Herzog , published in 1964 , concerns Moses E. Herzog , like Bellow a Canadian-born Chicago intellectual , whose wife 's adultery ( with his close friend ) has thrown him into a crisis of self-doubt . He writes many brilliant and cranky letters as he struggles to organize his scattered thoughts . <p> He 's an exaggerated version of his creator , Bellow imagining what it would be like to lose his grip . A Herzogian spirit appears in many Bellow letters . <p> " People do n't realize how much they are in the grip of ideas , " Bellow wrote . Ideas floating through the air affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excessive theory . <p> Communism was the dark shadowy idea that clouded Bellow 's own generation of intellectuals . As he wrote to Philip Roth , " There is real mystery about communists in the West . How were they able to accept Stalin -- one of the most monstrous tyrants ever ? " In Paris in 1948 , Bellow found intellectual leaders remaining loyal Stalinists . The reasons , Bellow guessed , were closer-to-home struggles that turned writers against their own countries . The French hated the bourgeoisie ; American intellectuals lined up to fight McCarthyism . <p> Bellow 's anxiety not to be ruled by received wisdom becomes a recurring theme . In 1953 his defiance of rigid and fashionable literary ideas produced an aesthetic breakthrough and his first triumph , The Adventures of Augie March . Daringly , he mixed an intensified version of Chicago Jewish speech with a young man 's search for a life of value and meaning . He knew this was a risk . <p> The letters show how nervously he awaited reviews and the opinions of friends . He was mortified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consoled when the praise started arriving from colleagues like Alfred Kazin and Lionel Trilling . With Augie , Bellow broke free of the solemnity that threatened to engulf him and became , along with much else , a comedian of ideas . He liked nothing more than taking his readers on a skeptic 's journey through history and culture . Augie did n't quite set him on the path to his 1976 Nobel Prize but it gave him the momentum of a young master . <p> Three years later he felt confident enough to reproach an old master , William Faulkner , who was among writers petitioning the government to withdraw the Second World War charge of treason against Ezra Pound and set him free . Bellow pointed out that Pound had preached hatred against Jews : " What staggers me is that you and Mr. John Steinbeck who have dealt for so many years in words should fail to understand the import of Ezra Pound 's plain and brutal statements about the ' kikes .

Now , for the second year in a row , a Giller Prize-winning novel will have the surname MacIntyre on its spine .

Steeves said it was clear that the press would have trouble meeting the expected demand -- last year 's winner , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while Gaspereau could only produce 1,000 copies per week .

She approved it on Friday . <p> In the interim , Steeves was approached by several other publishers , including Random House and House of Anansi , but " there was no other option I was aiming for , " Steeves said . " Lot 's of other people called us , but nobody else was a player . " <p> Gaspereau Press will continue to produce their own edition of the novel , though perhaps not at the same volume as before . <p> " I tell you , they 'll be a lot easier to make now that we know there will be a sufficient supply of that book out there , " said Steeves . <p> In an e-mail , Skibsrud wrote that she was glad a deal had been reached " that allows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Press 's practises and ideals , which make them so unique and special to work with . <p> " One thing that I really appreciate is that Andrew and Gary took into account my own personal feelings and interests when making this business decision , " she wrote .

More often than not when I finally track one down and get a chance to watch them it does n't end up being worth the time it took me to research and dig it up , but every so often one comes along and rewards my efforts . While watching TORMENTED there was a point in the middle that I was starting to lose faith , until a nice finale managed to raise my spirits enough to recommend it to fellow horror fans . <p> TORMENTED is a British teen slasher flick that follows a group of high schoolers being stalked and toyed with by a classmate they bullied relentlessly , the problem is that he is doing so AFTER he had committed suicide . The group of bullies obviously do n't believe they are being picked off by an undead assailant so they try desperately to find a living culprit to pin the nasty and threatening texts on before they end up dead themselves . <p> As much as I love my horror movies to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to change pace and check out something with a strong comedic tinge . Horror comedies are tough to pull off without alienating very specific types of fans in the genre , and TORMENTED was very welcome in this fan 's viewing rotation . That being said , the middle section of the movie came dangerously close to provoking me into really disliking the movie . In fact , the middle section of the film is what will likely keep me from watching it on a regular basis , but is n't blasphemous enough to keep me from urging horror fans to check it out . <p> The film starts off pretty fast and furious with some very interesting characters and some sharp funny dialogue that had me pretty giddy about what I was in for . The humorous mood it sets is mixed with a slight sense of tension as the teens are sent very ominous text messages implying physical harm and personality flaws . As we transition to the middle the mood starts to shift and I feel like a great deal of the humor that was keeping me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that sense of tension and dread . The idea that we did n't know if it was a classmate harassing the bullies or the dead victim of the bullies was far more effective than the early reveal that what you 're dealing with is the undead corpse of a vengeful high schooler . It might have even been more effective if the reveal did n't happen until the last act of the film and preserved the mystery for the two acts . <p> The only other complaint I had in regards to the film , which ended up not bothering me as much after it was over is that the film paints several very nasty and mean characters that you laugh at but know they 'll eventually get their just desserts and then a few characters that you believe have a shot at redemption that then pulls the rug out from under us . There is a point in the movie where a website mentioned at several points in the film is viewed that changes all of our perceptions the characters . It 's at a point that normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teen slashers such as SCREAM would employ , and the problem is that I did n't find it to be an interesting twist . It 's basically all information we had assumed throughout the film , except now we get to witness things on a video that try to illicit certain emotions , which it does , but it just made the moment feel slightly cheap . <p> Despite my gripe regarding the third act reveal the final twenty minutes or so of the film really saved the film from itself after the plodding middle section . There are slight moments of the humor from the beginning except the final moments lean heavily on the horror and is full of blood to really get the viewers back on board . One specific scene involving a paper cutter is easily one of the highlights of the final act . All the actors and actresses perform equally well in the film so it would n't seem right to say any one performed better than another . <p> TORMENTED is an above average example of how to show the horrors of high school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out horror comedy .

Although unsure how much was left of Port Douglas , I knew that once we had made it to the town , I would become immersed in the moment , and the rest would n't really matter . <p> The boat pushed forward and the small canal was coming into sight . It was narrow and shallow in areas , not used regularly in close to a hundred years .

This is where we would spend the night . <p> We docked at the old wooden relic and crawled our way onto dry land via an old wooden beam laying across the water from the shore to the wharf . At first glance , it appeared not much remained of Port Douglas , but with a little exploration I abandoned this assessment . The most recent buildings abandoned at Port Douglas were left from logging operations that were operated on the old town site up until roughly 1970 . The logging company still employed a care taker to maintain and watch over the company interests in the town , which was about a half dozen buildings , a truck and some old logging equipment .

I believe the victim was found innocent after the hanging . <p> Through our exploration of the town we also uncovered two old buildings , barely standing . They were made of wood and contained a collection of forgotten artifacts ; old leather shoes and boots , tobacco cans , petrol supplies and an array of other relics from the past .

This canyon is filled to the brim with old abandoned cars , tractors and other equipment that had been pushed off the edge for disposal . Some of the vehicles had to be at least 50 years old . Maybe older . <p> We wandered back down the dusty old road to the boat at twilight , lost in thought . It was hard to imagine that a little over a century ago this area would have been crawling with rowdy miners and prospectors , saloons lining the streets and steam wheelers coming into port daily .

It got a provisional green light in January , when Mr. Prentice said the proposed gold-and-copper mine was not likely to have significant adverse environmental effects . <p> The Mount Milligan project - 155 kilometres north of Prince George - also had first nations support in the form of a revenue-sharing agreement between the province and the McLeod Lake Indian Band . That deal , announced in August , was only the second such pact for the province . <p> When the agreement was signed in August , McLeod Lake Indian Band chief Derek Orr said it set a new standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ territory . <p> " We have secured benefits for all our members in a way that is environmentally responsible , and good for the McLeod Lake Indian Band , the region and the province , " Mr. Orr said at the time . <p> But this week , a couple of vehicles blocked the road leading to the Mount Milligan site , where crews have begun working on the $915-million project . <p> The roadblock , erected by members of the Nak'azdli Indian Band , is being monitored by the RCMP and the Denver-based Thompson Creek Metals Company , which owns the Mount Milligan project after acquiring Vancouver-based Terrane Metals in October . <p> Thompson Creek has obtained a court injunction against the protesters and plans to deliver copies of it to the blockade site , a company spokeswoman said . <p> " It has been peaceful and we hope it will resolve peacefully , " Pamela Solly said on Thursday . <p> The barricade was not sanctioned by Nak'azdli band council . <p> In a telephone interview on Thursday from Prince George , band councillor Margo Sagalon - whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadblock - said the protesters were upset that trucks were rumbling in and out of the job site and through Nak'azdli territory without an agreement between the company and people whose traditional land holdings are affected . <p> " There has been no movement , nobody was talking to us , " Ms. Sagalon said . <p> There were rumblings of discontent before the roadblock . In 2009 , the Nak'azdli First Nation filed a petition with the Supreme Court of B.C. against the provincial government , contending that it was not properly consulted about Mount Milligan . <p> In September , the band and the province signed an " abeyance agreement " that put the court petition on hold while the band negotiated an agreement with the province to settle its outstanding claims . <p> That agreement has been initialled and is under review by Nak'azdli leadership , Aboriginal Affairs Minister Barry Penner said on Thursday . <p> " We have been encouraging industry to build good relationships with first nations , and already this mine project is providing significant economic and job opportunities for the north-central region of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penner , who assumed the aboriginal ministry in an October cabinet shuffle . <p> The government remains committed to revenue-sharing agreements , he added . <p> " Our government has adopted a policy of looking for these **25;306;TOOLONG , particularly in the mining sector - and thinks it holds out a great opportunity for first nations people .

@@1718237 <p> In this four-part series , we 'll explore cloud computing and whether it 's right for your small business <p> Part Two : Why cloud customers might be worried <p> A good way to understand the differences between the cloud computing market in Canada and other international markets is to start with what worries potential cloud customers the most about the technology . <p> According to IBM 's Institute for Business Value 2010 Global IT Risk Study , 70 per cent of respondents believe adopting cloud computing makes protecting privacy more difficult . Half the respondents also cited concerns about the potential for a security breach or data loss on the cloud . <p> That 's why cloud computing firms have worked especially hard to try to assuage those fears . Whereas many cloud companies argue that their size and scale allows them to employ much more robust security solutions than the average small or medium-sized business , Canadian cloud companies have also figured out another sales pitch . It goes something like this : store your data on a Canadian cloud , because it 's not in the U.S. <p> Although cloud adoption appears to be much more prevalent south of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large firms to establish more cloud solutions , some cloud company executives say potential customers have been especially concerned about the potential having their data compromised -- not by hackers or technical glitches -- but by law enforcement . <p> One of the things that 's very different between Canada and the U.S. around cloud computing is the way the information is managed , " says says Eran Farajun , executive vice-president of Toronto-based cloud backup firm Asigra . " In the U.S. they have the Patriot Act . " The American government has the right to go in to any data in U.S. and look at it . " <p> As such , the combination of Canada 's brand as a country and its less intrusive rules on access to data has drawn some customers in the U.S. to look at Canadian cloud computing solutions , Mr. Farajun said . <p> However , in some industries , jurisdiction still matters . In effect , there are legal reasons to make sure the data centres where a company 's data is stored are in certain physical locations . On that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhat at a disadvantage . Some of the biggest cloud computing companies in the world have yet to set up servers in the country . <p> However Mr. Farajun argues Canada 's population actually makes it a prime market for cloud computing solutions . Because the country 's population density is so low , spread out over such a large land mass , he says adopting a technology that can be accessed from anywhere and does n't need to be in the same location as its user makes a lot of sense . <p> " Cloud computing does n't have to be just a local service , " he says . " Viability is not tied to local population . " <p> Increasingly , Canadian cloud companies are turning their attention to attracting small and medium-sized businesses , which in many ways represent the sweet spot of the industry . Many such firms have a need to establish a greater Web presence through upgraded technology such as servers or Web-based solutions ( a recent Intel Canada study found that 90 per cent of companies with employing less than 100 people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . But many small companies do n't have the resources to buy , administer and continually upgrade the hardware and software necessary for such expansion . <p> But with giants such as Amazon , Microsoft and Google all vying for the traditional cloud market , Canadian firms have largely found their niche in very specific areas of the industry . <p> In August of last year , research firm IDC posted its list of 10 Canadian cloud companies to watch . Asigra , which specialized in cloud-based backup , was on the list . As was Freshbooks , which offers cloud-based invoicing and billing solutions . Another highlighted company , BoardSuite , specializes in on-demand corporate governance software . <p> The number of highly-focused Canadian cloud companies illustrates an important element of the industry : small and medium-sized businesses looking for a cloud solution do n't have to migrate their entire IT department , but instead can pick and choose what services they want to outsource . <p> " You do n't have to buy some all-encompassing solution , " says Mr. Farajun .

When you wake up in the morning before you brush your teeth , those little " sweaters " that your teeth are wearing are the plaque that builds up over night while you are sleeping . <p> Before teeth appear , wiping baby 's gums with a clean face cloth every day is like training for toothbrushing . Parents should begin brushing their baby 's teeth with an infant or baby toothbrush as soon as the first tooth appears . Brushing teeth after each meal is ideal but impractical for most families . Brushing teeth thoroughly twice per day will help to prevent tooth decay . We recommend brushing in the morning after breakfast and just before bedtime as the best times to have the greatest impact . <p> Developing new habits with children takes time and practice . Do n't expect preschool children to cooperate with you every time you brush their teeth . Stick to a consistent routine , time of day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to learn both the habit and your expectations . Many parents make the mistake of allowing their child to stand in front of the mirror while mom or dad become contortionists while attempting to look into their child 's mouth . The end result is that mom or dad ca n't see clearly . It 's like blindfolding yourself and attempting to dice an onion ! Because mom or dad ca n't see well , their child experiences discomfort which makes tooth brushing an unpleasant activity . To improve your visibility , we recommend lying your child down with their head supported on your lap or by a pillow . You will also have TWO hands free for brushing and moving cheeks and lips out of the way . Toothbrushing will happen faster and easier . Make tooth brushing fun ! Sing songs while brushing , read stories about healthy teeth and visiting the dentist . But , most importantly , make sure a parent does the brushing until your child has developed the dexterity to do a good job on their own . Some developmental signs are : ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tie their own shoes ( not Velcro ) . These things usually happen around grade 2-3 . Make sure you are using a brush that fits your child 's mouth . Toothbrushes need to be the right size to work effectively . <p> You only need to use a small smear of fluoride toothpaste with each brushing until children are old enough to demonstrate that they can spit out the majority of the toothpaste , around 3-4 years old . After that age , use a small amount , about the size of a small pea . Fluoride helps to harden the tooth enamel making it more resistant to acid . It can be harmful if too much is swallowed . These days , there are a great many flavours of toothpaste , making it more likely that children may eat it if given the opportunity . That said , be sure to keep the toothpaste tube out of children 's reach . What 's the bottom line ? For children less than 4 , we recommend parents brush their children 's teeth . For children between 4 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brush first , with mom or dad taking the time to check that the child brushed thoroughly . Mom or dad should also complete the brushing if needed . Toothbrushing is a normal part of our daily personal hygiene . It will improve how their smile looks , freshen their breath , and most importantly , reduce the number of bacteria , or " sugarbugs " , living on and around their teeth and gums . Beginning these healthy brushing habits early reduces the risk of tooth decay both now and in the future . <p> Dr. Alan Milnes is a pediatric dentist with 35 years of practice experience and 20 years of experience as a full time University Professor at the Universities of Manitoba and Toronto .

All we get of that is the snap of a child changing TV channels from news about rioting proletarians to a kiddie show . <p> Industrialized Dagenham seems like a remote village in a Brothers Grimm tale , where the workers travel by bicycle to their factory jobs and the women toil like skivvies in Dickensian conditions . <p> Even the subplot about Barbara Castle , then the U.K. 's first female Secretary of State and one of the 20th century 's most significant female politicians , is treated like an episode of Yes Minister , although Miranda Richardson steals the show with her portrayal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , but strictly from the perspective of the stereotypically forbearing British women who are Cole 's chief fascination , as evidenced by such previous confections as Calendar Girls and Saving Grace . <p> The film sympathetically , and somewhat glibly , follows the 187 Ford women who risked the wrath of their bosses and thousands of their male co-workers ( many of them spouses and boyfriends ) by demanding equal pay for equal work .
