She says a direct long-haul route will strengthen the city 's links with overseas business , tourist and education markets . <p> It is the coolest little capital in the world , a thriving tourist destination , a foodie paradise and home to a whole host of creative and innovative businesses . <p> But underneath all the plaudits , the picture is more sobering . <p> A National Bank survey in November said economic activity in Wellington grew only 0.2 per cent in the September quarter after shrinking 0.7 per cent in the June quarter . The result was well behind Auckland and Canterbury , and indicated flat growth for the year . <p> The public sector , which provides nearly 20 per cent of jobs in the city , continues to be squeezed as the Government seeks to save nearly $1 billion over the next three years . There are fears Wellington will be overlooked as the Government focuses energy and resources on the Christchurch rebuild and the Auckland supercity . <p> Enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document that through a range of initiatives aims to create a net 10,000 jobs across the economy by 2015 , increase exports by $500 million , and grow gross domestic product ( currently $12.8 billion ) by 10 per cent by 2021 . <p> The council has singled out long-haul flights to Asia and a talent , business and investment attraction strategy as two initiatives that will be key in reaching the targets -- calculated by consultancy Market Economics . <p> New generation aircraft mean a runway extension is not necessarily required to bring long-haul flights to Wellington , but a fighting fund is , she says . " You ca n't go to the table without some sort of incentive . " <p> The fund , expected to be $10million to $15m , could come from a combination of rates , businesses through the downtown levy -- imposed by the council to fund the costs of bringing big events and tourists to the city -- the council , and contributions in kind such as reduced fares from the airport , she says . <p> Councillors have been told they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or raise rates an eye-watering 7.5 per cent , but Coughlan says the opportunity cost of not attracting long-haul flights should make the fund a priority . <p> " It could be a reprioritisation of funding ... or it could be new money , that 's what we 've got to work out . " <p> The vast majority of the 45 public submissions on the strategy support the long-haul route , but some doubts remain over whether it will be possible to run an economically viable service out of Wellington . <p> Paul Spence , chairman of technology society Unlimited Potential and a former commercial pilot , says he is in favour of " low-cost " lobbying of airlines to come to Wellington , but questions the wisdom of spending millions to subsidise uneconomic operations . <p> There is a risk that airlines could pull out when the money runs out , he says . <p> " Even with the small additions that they 've made to the runway length , there 's a huge constraint on payloads that you can put on aircraft . That 's the fuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 787s that could change , but they 're still quite a few years away . " <p> Departing Wellington Employers ' Chamber of Commerce chief executive Ken Harris says the service will attract businesses to establish themselves and stay in Wellington , boost tourism and also help attract international students , but says the $10m to $15m seems " way too high " . <p> " The sorts of numbers I have heard are $3m . That seems more realistic to me , unless you 're going to extend the runway . " <p> Funding should come from a range of sources , not just businesses . <p> " This requires a reallocation of funding priorities and that 's not going to be easy . " <p> Positively Wellington Tourism chief David Perks says the $10m to $15m figure came from consultants , commissioned by it and Wellington International Airport , who " do this stuff all over the world " . <p> The fund could be used for a variety of purposes , including marketing the route and subsidising the airline 's costs for the first few years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual negotiation with the airline . One thing we 're very clear about is that it will only be given to an airline that 's actually flying airplanes into Wellington . " <p> The airport 's chief commercial officer Matt Clarke says more than 250,000 passengers travel long haul to and from Wellington a year , and an airline with a comprehensive presence in Asia would be able to capture a significant proportion of that traffic . <p> " The Wellington market could easily justify an initial five direct services per week , moving to a daily service soon after with the right mix of airline , Asia destination and aircraft . " <p> Cities compete fiercely to win international flights , and financial incentives and risk-sharing arrangements can be a point of difference between one city and another , he says . <p> A 2009 study by researcher Berl estimated the economic impact of a long haul direct service in tourism alone at $50m a year , and 383 full-time jobs , Clarke says . <p> Coughlan says costs are yet to be finalised for the second key initiative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An attraction strategy could include attending business trade fairs to promote Wellington as a destination , aligning marketing with tertiary education providers to lure international students , and helping businesses settle in the city . <p> Carl Penwarden , managing director at Wellington software firm Able Technology , says finding talent is the biggest obstacle to his company 's growth , but warns that bringing in overseas talent might only be a short-term fix . <p> The strategy identifies linking education to industry needs as an initiative , but Penwarden says there needs to be more done to develop skills locally , including more funding for internship schemes . <p> The company currently takes on interns at its own cost to ensure it gets people with the right skills . <p> " With our particular technology , it 's just impossible to go out and get people off the street .

@@784239 <p> Do you spend all day Sunday dreading what the next workday will bring ? Do you wake on weekday mornings in fright ? We all know that a happy workplace can mean a contented life but new research has found that having a bad boss can affect not only your mental and physical health but also the way you relate to your family . <p> According to a studypublished in the Journal of Business and Psychology by Dr Nicolas Gillet and his team from Universite Fran ? ois Rabelais in France , over-controlling managers who use threats as a way to motivate employees frustrate our basic needs for autonomy , a sense of competence , and how we relate to others . This , in turn , is likely to have a negative impact on our wellbeing . <p> While these findings may not be surprising , it is the first study that provides evidence for the mediating role of need satisfaction in the relationships between perceptions of a supervisor 's inter-personal style and a worker 's wellbeing . <p> Laura* had a boss who had inherited a successful and high grossing business from his family .

" <p> In some cases a worker can become so ill as to be at risk of a heart attack . A Swedish study found that the more a worker feels their boss is incompetent , the higher chance they have of having a heart attack . <p> Clinical psychologist Jo Lamble says she sees many patients suffering as a result of supervisor workplace bullying . <p> " They are showing all the signs of stress including sleep difficulties , irritability , poor concentration and decision making , drug and alcohol abuse ( to self-medicate ) , loss of confidence and anger , " she says . <p> Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can also affect the wellbeing of families .

As a result this harms the family as the job incumbent is more tense and less able to engage fully in the family life . " <p> Lamble says the findings come as no surprise . <p> " We spend so much time at work , so if work is unpleasant , then it will affect our mood and can make us irritable and intolerant when we get home , " she says . <p> " Many people who work for a bad boss will feel the need to vent about it when they come home , which can become very tiring for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else .

This compels organisations to do something to put a stop to this kind of abusive behavior from occurring . " <p> But these are the same organisations that hired and promoted the abusive boss .

The bass-player for Yes , Squire is the only member to appear on every one of the band 's albums . It 's a business now - a job . It 's been that way for some time . And he 's very matter-of-fact about it . <p> " We always said we 'd make it and we never have - I do n't know why , but it 's a long way . We 've meant to come over when we 've been as far as Australia . But , you know what , finally someone gave us the money - so we 're coming . That 's the truth " . There 's a rich chuckle to finish the line off , there 's honesty but little in the way of sincerity . <p> Squire lives in Arizona . The band gets together to tread the boards once in a while . <p> " Yeah , people are unhappy about that - but you know what , it 's still Yes . There 's still the rest of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were about more than just the singer . We think that people are still getting to see as much of the band as they can . Jon left due to ill health . And we were going to wait for him - but it just took too long . We could n't wait " . There 's another laugh . It feels awkward . <p> So there 's a new guy . In fact there 's a second new guy . <p> Since 2008 Canadian Benoit Davidhad been the new face/voice of Yes . He had been in a Yes tribute band called Close To The Edge . He was also the sound of the band 's first new album in over a decade , Fly From Here . Released last year . But , in a curse that some diehard Yes fans could interpret as karma , David has had to step down - due to illness . <p> " Yeah , um , Benoit has had to step aside " , Squire confirms and yet another awkward chuckle . This time he does sound a bit embarrassed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour - and he 's very good . He 'll do justice to both Benoit and Anderson " . He is a C-grade rugby coach putting over the next ringer from the bench . <p> So where 'd they find this guy ? Another Yes tribute-band , was it ? <p> " Actually , yes . Jon had been in a Yes tribute-band called Roundabout " . A hearty laugh this time . <p> Squire believes Fly From Here is a real return to the classic Yes sound . <p> " We are playing a decent amount from it in the show - but we are doing all the old Yes stuff that people will want to hear too . In many ways I think Fly From Here is a return to classic Yes , people seem to have been really enjoying it , integrated into the set along with the old material . One thing that really marks the album as classic Yes is the suite : the title song plays out over nearly half-an-hour . It 's a new album but some of these songs we 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Squire hopes that after the tour concludes a new album wo n't take so long . <p> " It would be good to do another one , sooner rather than later this time , we 're all getting on of course " . <p> He tells me that " music is its own reward " and that it is important to " give back " . <p> So would he give Jon Anderson his old job back ? <p> " Well , we 're still friends . We still keep in touch - and if he was able to perform with us again then that is something we could look at , sure " . <p> Squire says the current Yes show takes in every stop a fan could expect - including that hit single , Owner Of A Lonely Heart ( " well , it went the way it went " says Squire , evidently still surprised that it is the band 's biggest success ; the graze against the mainstream ) . <p> The current show is a two-hour tour of career highlights . From the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horn returned to work on the new album ) . <p> " You never think you 're going to be at something like this for 40 years . But then , here I am now " . <p> Squire worked hard to plug the new album and singer . And lip-service to the golden years was swift ; somewhat token . <p> I hope fans get close enough to what they want this weekend . It was deeply uninspiring speaking to this Yes man on the telephone . He seemed detached from any passion that might once have been there . <p> Will you be going to see this version of Yes ? <p> Were you tempted to go ? Or is it not Yes without Anderson - or for that matter Rick Wakeman ? And are you a Yes man or woman ? What album/s do you like from the band ? Or are you like Lester Bangs when it comes to Yes ? Do you just say no instead ? <p> Postscript : I 'm sorry if you feel cheated by this interview . Imagine how I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late 80s when I was sixteen , in my Pink Floyd phase . I 'd heard of Yes but they were n't well known in New Zealand . I loved prog rock , started with Tormato which still has enjoyable songs . The fact that they were such good musicians appealed to me , although Wakeman 's endless noodly keyboard riffs did annoy at times . Close to the Edge and Fragile would probably be my favourite albums . I did enjoy 90210 even though the sound and style was completely different to their older stuff . Sadly , I ca n't afford the trip up to Auckland and the ticket . <p> Russell #2 12:49 pm Mar 27 2012 <p> I 'll be there . Squire 's mercenary attitude is clear in much of their recent work , but I must say a couple of new members in the group has breathed a little more life into the latest album . Still neo-prog rather than classic prog rock , though . I do n't have a problem with Squire treating touring as a job , as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be said : Squire was just about the most important bassist of his time . <p> Barrie #3 01:02 pm Mar 27 2012 <p> I saw Rick Wakeman in Sydney a few years ago and it was by far the best concert I have seen ( I went to both shows ) .

This is the 3rd interview I have read in NZ publications over the past week ; each a different interviewer . It must get tiring for him too . I am going to the concert . The line up might not include Anderson , and Wakeman , but the opportunity to see Squire , and one of the world 's premier guitarists , in Steve Howe , is not to be missed . Close to the Edge is my favourite album . <p> Chris1 #6 02:03 pm Mar 27 2012 <p> Some great albums but I ca n't go to the show as we have a wedding in Chch ... why could n't you get an interview with Roger Waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worlds apart but magic in their own way ... and the artists themselves would have a lot to say I 'm sure ! <p> Simon Sweetman #7 02:26 pm Mar 27 2012 <p> @Chris1 - I did try .

Collins has been granted rare access to Dacre 's office , and eloquently tells the story of the Mail 's bumpy history , the extraordinary Dacre editorial machine , and the remarkable growth of Mail Online -- to the point that it has by most counts overtaken the New York Times as the world 's most read online newspaper . <p> There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a certain mind : <p> The Mail 's editor , Paul Dacre , considers it a compliment when critics accuse the paper of moralizing .

( AP Photo/Lee Jin-man ) <p> A satellite launch North Korea had hailed as a moment of national pride ended in failure yesterday when the rocket disintegrated over the Yellow Sea , earning Pyongyang embarrassment as well as condemnation from a host of nations that deemed it a covert test of missile technology . <p> The launch is a setback for new leader Kim Jong Un , whose government had projected the satellite as a show of strength amid North Korea 's persistent economic hardship . Kim is solidifying power following the death of his father , longtime leader Kim Jong Il , four months ago . <p> The U.N . Security Council said it deplores the launch , saying it violated two council resolutions . <p> In a rare move , Pyongyang acknowledged that the rocket did not deliver a satellite , but it also pressed ahead with grandiose propaganda in praise of the ruling Kim family . <p> The United States and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rocket shot out from the North 's west coast . North Korea acknowledged that some four hours later in an announcement broadcast on state TV , saying the satellite that the rocket was carrying did not enter orbit . <p> North Korea had held up the launch as a scientific achievement and even a gift for its late founder , Kim Il Sung , two days before the 100th anniversary of his birth . It pressed ahead even as world leaders vowed to take action in the U.N . Security Council against what they called a flagrant violation of international resolutions prohibiting North Korea from developing its nuclear and missile programs . <p> The rocket 's destruction suggests the country has yet to master the technology needed to build long-range missiles that could threaten the United States . Still , worries remain about North Korea 's nuclear program amid reports that it may be planning an atomic test soon . <p> Kim Jong Un has been given several important titles intended to strengthen his rule this week . Hours after the failed launch , state media said he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a meeting of the Supreme People 's Assembly . <p> Kim Jong Il , who ruled the country in his capacity as chairman of the commission , was given the title of " chairman for eternity . " <p> Outsiders , meanwhile , focused on the launch , which was condemned by the foreign ministers of the Group of Eight industrialized nations meeting in Washington , including Russia . <p> The U.N . ' s most powerful body , the Security Council , said in a brief press statement after a closed meeting on Friday that members agreed to continue consultations " on an appropriate response . " <p> U.S. Ambassador Susan Rice , the current council president , refused to speculate on whether a response might include new sanctions against North Korea . The council imposed sanctions against North Korea after its first nuclear test in 2006 and stepped up sanctions after its second test in 2009 . <p> " We think a credible reaction is important , " Rice said . <p> Washington said it was suspending plans to contribute food aid to the North in exchange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spokesman Jay Carney also said on Thursday before the launch that " the clear violation of U.N .

Bush , said the next step would be to watch whether North Korea conducts a third nuclear test , as has been speculated by the South Korean intelligence community . <p> State media said the Kwangmyongsong-3 satellite was fired from the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in the hamlet of Tongchang-ri but " failed to enter its preset orbit .

In Pyongyang , dozens of foreign journalists invited to cover the launch were not allowed to view the liftoff live . <p> " The failure , which was impossible to hide from the North Korean people given the advance publicity and presence of international media , will be a major source of domestic and international embarrassment for the Kim Jong Un regime , " said Ralph Cossa , president of Pacific Forum CSIS , a Hawaii-based think tank . <p> Attempts to put satellites into orbit often pose problems even for developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a climate observation satellite exploded 137 seconds into its flight .

Photo by Getty . <p> During the glory days of Hurricanes rugby in the mid-to-late 2000s they impressed crowds and pundits alike with their dazzling backline play . <p> From Jonah Lomu to Ma'a Nonu the flashy men in yellow ran in tries a plenty and held little regard for how many points they conceded with the belief they would rack up more . <p> This year - particularly in the past month - despite the look of the Hurricanes squad being wildly different from the sides of years ago , they have scored their own share of sublime tries through their backs . <p> Young halfback and first-five combination TJ Perenara and Beauden Barrett have laid the platform while exciting outsides Cory Jane , Julian Savea and Andre Taylor have cashed in and crossed the chalk regularly for five-pointers . <p> In fact , in their past three games - two of which they 've won - the Hurricanes have scored 14 tries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sharks in New Plymouth and backs coach Alama Ieremia said there were no secret ingredients to what had made the side tick this year but it was a case of hard working coming to fruition . <p> " I suppose it 's just going week by week and it 's a progression from the week before with the work-ons everybody 's doing ; their individual work-ons and their training plans that they have , ' ' the former All Black said . <p> " I think combination-wise they 've just all come together and there 's a lot of hard work that 's done away from the field as well .

@@876233 <h> The Barry Saunders Interview <p> Last updated 11:28 26/04/2012 <p> There is a new Warratahs collection - timed to celebrate the band 's 25th anniversary . I caught up with Barry Saunders , or " Barry Warratah " as he put it ( " that 's what I get called " ) , to discuss the upcoming tour , the band , the occasional threat of his solo career , country music , rock'n'roll and life as a songwriter in New Zealand . <p> " In some ways , and it 's a bit of a clich ? and it might sound trite , but it 's gone quickly - 25 years . " This is Saunders ' opening reflection . " It 's meant a lot of things but it has meant a canvas for my songs and voice and I 'm extremely grateful . It 's been a ticket to ride as John Lennon said . It 's been perfect for us . " <p> The Warratahs formed in the late 1980s , Saunders laughs thinking back to the initial plan , possibly wondering if there ever was one beyond " playing a few songs " . " I 'd had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the ground so we got together here as The Warratahs and decided to play some covers , amuse ourselves and maybe chuck in a couple of originals . " <p> From there the band 's original bassist , John Donahue , booked two nights at The Cricketer 's Arms . Saunders remembers , " it was very clear then that there was something - these songs wanted to live , wanted to carry on and we found a vibe , we found something that we just had to continue . It really just went from there . " A residency at the same venue and word spread , from there the band started to visit New Zealand towns to spread its music . <p> In 1987 the debut album was released , The Only Game in Town . It features the band 's biggest hits , Maureenand Hands of My Heart . Saunders says , " I still play them , every gig . I would n't not play them - band and solo , they 're in there . But I 'm pleased that they have n't turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes it worthwhile , keeps them fresh for me . That makes them worth doing . " <p> Saunders is known now as the band 's voice - both vocally and as the songwriter - but when The Warratahs formed he shared songwriting duties with Wayne Mason . Mason had been a member of The Fourmyula and Rockinghorse ( Saunders had joined Rockinghorse as it was settling up . ) Mason was ultimately unhappy at sharing the songwriting with Saunders and decided to move on from the band . <p> " We never wrote together , " Saunders explains . " But we showed each other the songs . And we would add things . He might have three-quarters of a song and I 'd add my bit or make a suggestion and sometimes the other way around but we never wrote together . " He carries on , " I think Wayne did n't expect that I would have songs too - and perhaps he saw the band as his songwriting vehicle but I had these songs I 'd been stockpiling . Also , Wayne wanted to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted . He left over difficulty relating to the songs . " <p> Mason 's leaving caused the first hiatus . " And I was very sick , " Saunders picks up . " I was sick with hepatitis - which I did n't know at the time . And I did n't know what I wanted to do . I recorded my solo album , Weatherman , and then the band decided to do another record . Then we got Sam Hunt on board for some touring and Alan Norman was in the band keys and accordion and we carried on up and down the country . " <p> The Warratahs might be more of a part-time thing these days , the members picking and choosing when to reconvene , solo albums and side-projects filling in the space between recording and touring , but Barry says " we are still very connected . We all talk and songs are bandied about often . We are still creative too and there are new songs and ideas for songs to cover - which is why the new collection comes with an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> And as far as Saunders is concerned the songs continue to come . <p> " It used to be from moving - from touring up and down and being on the road , movement brought songs with it . Now it 's the complete opposite , being solitary and being alone and I get those moments to create and the songs still arrive . " <p> He was raised on Chuck Berry and rock'n'roll as well as the commercial country music that was , as Saunders puts it , " the pop music of the day " - he namechecks Don Gibson and Johnny Cash and Jim Reeves - but one of the big ones for Barry was Hank Williams . " It 's obvious and everyone knows who he is and what he did but he took hold of this simple form of the blues and he made it his own , so he was one of the big ones for me . " <p> But Saunders was also a rock'n'roller and continues to be a fan of the early Who and Stones , of Chuck Berry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and from working in Australia in the early 1980s he picked up a love and respect for the Australian bands of the 1970s and 80s . <p> " I think the big thing I got there was the work ethic - but there were some really great bands there . The country music in Australia was never an influence but these rock bands were great workers , great showmen and they worked hard . So I learned how to handle a crowd there , how to do the time . " <p> He also served an apprenticeship in the UK and Ireland where he played " the folk scene " for two years . " The music got into me , it was there genetically too of course and so that informed my views on country music when I returned to New Zealand and when I was in Australia . " <p> In England he began " writing notes on paper , not songs as such but ideas , just thoughts , really . " These were worked on in Sydney and that is where he started " putting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was simple , I was pretty broke . That allowed me to do it . " <p> The Warratahs have been part of the country clique and then existed outside of it . The band has worked through a time when there was very little interest in country music - or at least in the country music that they were performing . And has carried on now , through the alt-country years , finding a younger audience as well as keeping the old fans ; " we were accepted by the country fans and part of the circle , then we were n't , I think some people do n't quite know what country music is but it 's a form of blues , it 's the white man 's blues and we are always happy to have an audience . We 've had audiences of country fans only and then audiences that might not listen to other country music . " <p> Saunders says that at the end of a tour he will often think about how hard it is to keep it going . <p> " You wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder that right as a tour is ending ; I wonder if that 'll ever happen again , what we just did . And it 's not insecurity , but it 's the idea that you 'll never quite repeat what you did and whether you 'll get that feeling . " I suggest that it 's almost an instant blast of nostalgia as it happens . " Yeah , that 's it . It 's something like that . Exactly . And the best thing is that you do find a way to just go out there and play and you try for it again . And you know when it 's at its best it 's joyous , and there are just so many good aspects . So that gives you reason to want to try again . <p> " And , " he continues , " I realise that only songs can keep it going . We wo n't go out if we do n't have something new , so we 'll always work up a new song even if it 's a cover . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warratahs but only " if they suit the band . Some of them are n't right . Some are . " He says he writes a lot " for better or worse " but he always has his ear out for a cover version . <p> " Well it 's a great song " , Saunders says simply enough . " It was a song that got under my skin . Songs do that . And one of the wonders of music is that people keep coming up with new ways to say something with the same notes - this supposedly finite set of ideas . You find something new . So with that song it just resonated , I loved the line ' done with all this thinking ' and that was the hook for me . I knew that I could do something with that song . So I gave it a go . " <p> And Saunders ' own writing displays an almost unique ability to celebrate the New Zealand landscape without sounding cloying or desperate , without the song losing its way for the sake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country idiom , of where country music comes from , of what it is meant to be . Saunders manages this and gets to put his spin on it , putting his voice out there . He is , to my ear , one of our greatest writers of songs about New Zealand . <p> " When I returned from England I just noticed how poetic some of the names are in New Zealand . A place like Taranaki - it just felt right to me to write about it . The first eight years of The Warratahs ' life we travelled so much , we worked hard , the road was our home so a lot of the songs come from there . Well , they did then . " <p> Sam Hunt has called Saunders one of New Zealand 's great poets . <p> " Well first of all , " Barry takes a pause , " Sam is just one of those people that is very generous . " He leaves it there . I prompt him to pick up the thread . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

That sort of thing . " <p> And speaking of 25-year friendships , the other founding Warratah who has lasted the distance is Nik Brown ( fiddle player ) . <p> " In many ways he is The Warratahs , " Saunders proudly states . " I mean it 's my voice but in as much as it 's my voice it 's his voice too and Nik deserves the spotlight when he takes it .

It was n't always that way , but that 's what 's happened , we 've played together for so long . " <p> Saunders says he 's " really proud " of the 25-year mark , of making it the distance . <p> So after this tour what happens ? <p> " Well , I really do n't know . There might be another solo album . There might be more from the band . But there 'll be more , I hope . There 'll be more songs . I do n't tend to think too far ahead .

@@876235 <p> International researchers have found that children who experience violence appear to be aging at a faster rate . <p> DNA of 236 British 10 year-olds exposed to violence during their childhood shows " erosion " of the special sequences at the tips of their chromosomes , the telomeres . <p> Such wear-and-tear is normally associated with ageing , and it limits the number of years that a given cell can go on dividing , the scientists say in a paper published in Molecular Psychiatry on April 24 . <p> Children who experienced multiple forms of violence at a young age -- such as domestic violence , frequent bullying or physical maltreatment by an adult -- had the fastest telomere erosion rate , regardless of other factors such as the child 's gender , poverty , weight or health . <p> Now the researchers plan to extend their study to over 1000 people born in Dunedin and now entering their 40s , in a bid to find what mechanism links childhood stress to accelerated aging , even at a young age at the fundamental level of their cells .

That cohort was established as a sister study to the group in Dunedin , where the children were all born in 1972-1973 . <p> Professor Moffit said , in responsed to questions from the SMC : . <p> " In this new paper , we report that the British children who gave DNA samples at age 5 ( in 2000 ) and again at age 10 ( in 2005 ) showed more erosion of their telomeres , if the child had been exposed to stressful violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ends of chromosomes that are related to a cell 's age ) . <p> " The violence included observing domestic violence between their mum and her partners , or the child being frequently bullied , or maltreated .

The shelves are indicated by the rainbow colour ; red is thicker ( greater than 550 metres ) , while blue is thinner ( less than 200 metres ) . <h> Related Links <h> Relevant offers <p> Antarctica 's massive ice shelves are shrinking because they are being eaten away from below by warm water , a new study finds . That suggests that future sea levels could rise faster than many scientists have been predicting . <p> The western chunk of Antarctica is losing seven metres of its floating ice sheet each year . Until now , scientists were n't exactly sure how it was happening and whether or how man-made global warming might be a factor . The answer , according to a study published early today ( NZ time ) in the journal Nature , is that climate change plays an indirect role -- but one that has larger repercussions than if Antarctic ice were merely melting from warmer air . <p> Hamish Pritchard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using an ice-gazing Nasa satellite showed that warmer air alone could n't explain what was happening to Antarctica . A more detailed examination found a chain of events that explained the shrinking ice shelves . <p> Twenty ice shelves showed signs that they were melting from warm water below . Changes in wind currents pushed that relatively warmer water closer to and beneath the floating ice shelves . The wind change is likely caused by a combination of factors , including natural weather variation , the ozone hole and man-made greenhouse gases , Pritchard said in a phone interview . <p> As the floating ice shelves melt and thin , that in turn triggers snow and ice on land glaciers to slide down to the floating shelves and eventually into the sea , causing sea level rise , Pritchard said . Thicker floating ice shelves usually keep much of the land snow and ice from shedding to sea , but that 's not happening now . <p> " It means the ice sheets are highly sensitive to relatively subtle changes in climate through the effects of the wind , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may have already triggered a period of unstable glacier retreat , " the study concludes . If the entire Western Antarctic Ice Sheet were to melt -- something that would take many decades if not centuries -- scientists have estimated it would lift global sea levels by about 16 feet . <p> Nasa chief scientist Waleed Abdalati , an expert in Earth 's ice systems who was n't involved in the research , said Pritchard 's study " makes an important advance " and provides key information about how Antarctica will contribute to global sea level rise . <p> Another outside expert , Ted Scambos of the National Snow and Ice Data Center , said the paper will change the way scientists think about melt in Antarctica . Seeing more warm water encircling the continent , he worries that with " a further push from the wind " newer areas could start shrinking .

The programme is a nationwide one , run independently from region to region . <p> Locally , it 's been running for nine years , but in 2009 suffered a blow when the Government withdrew funding , eventually forcing the number of part-time co-ordinators to drop from three to one . <p> District councils still support it . New Plymouth contributes $15,000 and Stratford chips in with $4500 , although at both councils the money varies from year to year . South Taranaki district pulled its funding two years ago . <p> Now there 's a new funding partner . Taranaki Maori organisation Parininihi ki Waitotara Incorporation ( PKW ) has announced a $20,000 boost to the project , saying it has a vision for Taranaki 's future land managers and it 's enlisting Enviroschools to help . <p> Enviroschools co-ordinator Rachel Eckersley , stretched among the region 's 20 schools , can now spend more time at each one , feeding ideas to teachers , helping inspire students and spreading the message of sustainability . <p> She will have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support both Enviroschools and a related Maori initiative , Te Aho Tu Roa , designed for situations where learning is in te reo . <p> South Taranaki schools will welcome the news , for they have missed out because of the funding shortfall , Eckersley says , and a third of the money will go to facilitating work there . <p> Jess Brocas started teaching at Matapu a year ago with a background in environmental education working in Christchurch .

" <p> Opunake High School joined Enviroschools some time ago , although teacher Andrea Hooper , like Brocas , became involved a year ago . She and colleague Peter Clement take 25 students once a fortnight for an Envirofit class , which is an optional subject . <p> There , the students explore a range of issues and learning associated with the environment , but Enviroschools is also integrated into other subjects in the school such as social studies , maths and English . <p> That 's the beauty of the programme and one emphasised by schools that Taranaki Daily News spoke to . It 's developed so it fits the curriculum , rather than being a laborious add-on . <p> " The Enviroschool guys we work with are the experts .

" <p> In addition , being part of the programme means schools that are involved link with other like- minded teachers . <p> Regional days are held for students to share , brainstorm and undertake activities . It means that , if one school is interested in a project , it feeds off the experience of another , rather than muddling along in isolation . <p> Long term it makes the programme more sustainable or less " token " , says Hooper . " If we are going to make a better world , we have to work together to encourage long-term change .

" <p> Professional development for the teachers is particularly valued , Stark says , and it 's low- cost , no-frills upskilling , with teachers more likely to sit down to pizzas cooked in an earth oven than catered lunches . <p> Teaching Toko 's students about the environment is a reflection of the time we live in . <p> " Children need to learn about sustainability , " she says .

@@1114234 <h> Bill brings church views into focus <p> Old Testament scholar and Anglican priest The Rev Dr James Harding at his parish , All Saints Church , North Dunedin . <p> Same-sex marriage in New Zealand has become a near certainty after legislation to allow it passed its first reading in Parliament on Wednesday by 80 votes to 40 . Labour MP Louisa Wall , who is sponsoring the Marriage ( Definition of Marriage ) Amendment Bill , says the legislation will not force church priests or ministers to conduct same-sex marriages . So why has the Bill attracted so much opposition from church leaders ? Reporter Allison Rudd investigates . <p> For Neill Ballantyne , who is gay and a Christian , the likelihood same-sex couples will be able to marry is something to be celebrated . <p> New Zealand introduced civil union ceremonies in 2005 and since then 2152 couples - 1685 same-sex couples and 467 opposite-sex couples - have opted for civil unions . To all intents and purposes , civil unions are almost identical to marriage . But they are not marriage . <p> Neil Ballantyne <p> Mr Ballantyne , the Otago University Students Association queer support officer and national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the legislation would be an important symbolic change , allowing couples of all sexual orientations to finally be treated equally . <p> " The institution of marriage holds a lot of cultural value and acceptance and it is important for same-sex couples to have that right . <p> A separate civil union ceremony , even if such a ceremony is available to opposite-sex couples , is degrading . <p> It 's not about the numbers , it is about rights and choices . " <p> If the legislation is passed , it is not clear whether ministers and priests will be able to opt out of marrying gay couples . <p> While Ms Wall says they will , a legal opinion obtained by Family First NZ from barrister Ian Bassett says marriage celebrants , including church ministers , will be in breach of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act and the Human Rights Act 1993 if they refuse to perform their public function because a couple seeking to be married is gay . <p> It is also not clear how many same-sex couples will want a church wedding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are conducted by priests or ministers and have any religious content . <p> Mr Ballantyne knows some conservative churches and Christians strongly oppose the legislation , believing homosexuality is a sin and allowing same-sex couples to marry strikes at the heart of their theological belief that marriage is the preserve of one man and one woman . <p> New Zealand 's mainstream churches have been grappling with those issues for years . <p> Some , like the Catholic Church , have definite views and seem in no hurry to review them . <p> Other denominations have started or completed the debate . <p> In 1990 , Dr David Bromell , of Dunedin , was ordained as the first openly gay Methodist minister in the country , sparking a furore which eventually split the church . <p> Many members , some ministers and several entire congregations left in protest and established the breakaway Wesleyan Methodist Church in 2000 . <p> The Presbyterian Church , which had allowed the ordination of gay ministers , banned similar appointments in 2004 and went further . <p> It issued a moratorium saying no-one " in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a woman " could be ordained or a church leader , effectively ruling out gay people and those in de facto relationships . <p> The Anglican Church also has a moratorium against the ordination of people living in openly gay relationships . Now it is tackling the issue head-on , establishing a commission to summarise the biblical and theological work done by the church on the ordination of gay priests and same-sex civil unions during the past 30 years . <p> The commission 's report on options and implications of change will be discussed at the 2014 Anglican general synod . <p> The Rev Dr James Harding , assistant priest at All Saints Anglican Church , North Dunedin , and a senior lecturer in Old Testament studies at the University of Otago , said the debate going on in Parliament was unlikely to influence the views of anyone in the church . <p> While most church leaders agreed that the Bible was the authority on marriage , they disagreed on how to interpret scripture , he said . <p> " On one hand , we have conservatives who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one woman , and very attached to the thought that that is the only way to read the Bible . <p> Liberals , on the other hand , would prefer to look at the quality of relationship that two people have , regardless of the gender they happen to be . " <p> The concept of marriage in scripture developed over 2000 years into " a rich and complicated idea " , he said . <p> " The gay marriage debate raises the point that it is very difficult from scripture to decide , 2000 years after the texts were written and 10,000 miles from where they were written , exactly how to apply them now . " <p> In Old Testament times , 3000-5000 years ago , there was a deeply patriarchal society . <p> A daughter was part of her father 's household and another man paid a bride price for the right to take that daughter as his woman .
