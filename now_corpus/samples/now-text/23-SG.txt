The jubilant parties and celebrations and bouquets after bouquets of congratulatory flowers that welcomed the birth of Hsieh Ling-ling 's first-born son are now , quietly , an empty room .

I was n't allowed to have long hair . " <p> To wit , the deep-rooted preference for sons hangs heavily in Chinese culture , be it a long-held response to the country 's agrarian economy -- and with it , a need for strong , therefore male bodies -- or a keenly felt desire to uphold family bloodlines . It 's an inequitable preference that 's since cast a long , looming shadow over the country 's gender ratio , skewed copiously male , as the now-defunct one-child policy once -- and most probably still -- made having girls an unfortunate problem that must be dealt with in ways both horrific and horrifically quotidian . <p> Old traditions , it seems , die astonishingly hard . <p> Shirt , Jay BaekJewellery , Chaumet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hsieh explains .

The same applies to running up a hill , it may be better to go downhill instead . <h> Why Walking Down the Stairs is better ? <p> In a report by BBC Science magazine , a biomechanics professor at the University of Northampton , Tony Kay , says all forms of exercise create microscopic damage to the muscles .

The group who walked down rather than up resulted in greater improvements in resting heart rate .

FAB recently completed due diligence on the London-based lender , the sources said , asking not to be identified because the matter is private . Any deal would be dependent on market conditions and the performance of StanChart 's share price , they said . <p> FAB -- which is worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-cash bid in the range of US$30 billion to US$35 billion , the sources said . Any acquisition would be funded by its backers , which include Abu Dhabi 's sovereign fund Mubadala Investment , and the emirate 's ruling Al Nahyan family , they said . FAB 's chairperson Sheikh Tahnoon bin Zayed Al Nahyan is a powerful royal , and has in recent years taken on a more prominent role to spearhead the emirate 's political and economic goals . <p> After a period of higher crude prices , Abu Dhabi is keen to use its oil windfall to transform the city 's financial sector , which has lagged many of its other key industries such as energy , tourism and logistics . Such an attempt would represent a step beyond the moves that other wealthy Gulf nations have made to take minority stakes in firms such as Barclays and Credit Suisse . <p> FAB last month said that it had explored a bid for StanChart , but that it was no longer considering an offer .

Other bankers working on the plans are frequently shuttling between New York and the UAE capital , one source said . <h> Stay updated with BT Newsletters <p> Still , getting a deal done would be complicated and ambitious , given the hurdles and the differences in the scale of the two banks .

A successful outcome would catapult FAB into becoming an emerging-markets banking giant with more than US$1 trillion in assets -- and likely into the club of 30 banks that global regulators consider systemically important . It would also mark a turning point in chief executive officer Hana Al Rostamani 's two-year reign . <p> A representative for FAB referred to its Jan 5 statement which said that it had evaluated a possible offer for StanChart , but was no longer doing so . The representative also said that the bank is bound by takeover rules in the UK and Hong Kong .

" The state 's goal of acquiring a reputable multinational bank is also linked to a desire to gain greater legitimacy in global financial circles , while strengthening control over the storage and movement of funds . " <p> As well as continuing to pursue either a majority stake or minority holding in StanChart , FAB is also looking at acquiring specific assets from the British lender , or forming a joint venture to help it expand internationally , some of the sources said . FAB is also looking at other banks , including one in Asia , and investment bankers are also pitching a number of possible targets to FAB , other sources said . <p> There has been open speculation over the future of StanChart for years .

The key to this strategy is providing verifiable and transparent proof of the renewable energy generated at source . <p> To date , almost 1,000 companies from various industries have committed to emissions reductions or climate neutrality goals . In order to meet these goals , green energy procurement has emerged as an important lever for companies to decarbonise . <p> In their efforts to source renewable energy , companies are requiring transparent and granular data to not only identify shortfalls in their green energy procurement strategy but also to build credibility for their renewable energy claims . <p> This demand for improved transparency and traceability is driving innovation in the energy sector . <p> Employing digital ledger technology , renewable energy can now be tokenised at source and tracked through its life cycle .

@@97055236 <p> WASHINGTON -- This past week , President Joe Biden announced that Ms Lael Brainard , the vice chair of the United States Federal Reserve who is known for citing the financial risks posed by climate change , would become his top economic adviser . <p> Her appointment follows that of Mr Richard Revesz , an environmental lawyer and an academic who is known for defending climate regulations , who last month became head of the White House 's top regulatory office -- a place that has historically been viewed as the place where environmental controls go to die . <p> The appointments to two of the most powerful posts in the White House underscore how Mr Biden has pursued an " all-of-government " approach to climate change , appointing people with backgrounds in climate policy to senior positions across federal agencies . <p> It also illustrates his intent to use executive action to address global warming in the last two years of this term . <p> " This is a new thing that we 've seen from the Biden White House as they have made climate central to their economic recovery and regulatory agenda , " said Mr @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Action . <p> " Putting people in positions of power that are not traditionally climate positions who deeply understand the climate crisis and the need to act on it . " <p> The White House did not respond to requests to interview Ms Brainard or Mr Revesz . <p> The timing of their appointments is not a coincidence . <p> While Democrats in Congress passed the nation 's first major climate law last year , the midterm Republican takeover of the House of Representatives means it is unlikely that new environmental legislation will be enacted in the remainder of Biden 's first term . <p> That leaves the President with executive authority as a way to push through the rest of his climate agenda . <p> That will entail the oversight of about US$370 billion ( S$494 billion ) in new spending on climate and clean energy programmes provided by last year 's Inflation Reduction Act . <p> It will also mean writing new climate regulations , intended to ratchet down emissions from cars , lorries , power plants and oil and gas wells . <p> In some ways , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's National Economic Council , where she is expected to play a key role in the implementation of the Inflation Reduction Act , is a continuation of the way in which Mr Biden views climate change as central to economic policy . <p> Her predecessor on the council , Mr Brian Deese , was previously a senior climate change adviser to former President Barack Obama . <p> The appointment of Mr Revesz to his new post , however , is pathbreaking . <p> The Office of Internal and Regulatory Affairs , an obscure but powerful agency within the White House , is designed to vet all proposed federal regulations and balance the demands of protecting health , safety and the environment against the cost to industries . <p> In his new role , Mr Revesz becomes the effective gatekeeper for all new federal regulations -- including any new climate rules , many of which he has spent his career supporting . <p> That is exactly what opponents of Mr Biden 's climate agenda fear . <p> " For folks who want to litigate against the Biden administration , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law professor at Case Western Reserve University . <p> Mr Frank Macchiarola , senior vice-president for policy and regulatory affairs at the American Petroleum Institute , which lobbies for oil and gas companies , said he feared that Mr Revesz " will approach this through the lens of an advocate , as he did in his prior work , and not as an objective regulator " . <p> Mr Revesz , who grew up in Argentina and who is known as Ricky to everyone from his law students to his legal opponents , came to the White House from his role as an environmental law professor and dean emeritus at New York University ( NYU ) Law School . <p> He is also the co-founder of an NYU-affiliated think-tank , the Institute for Policy Integrity , which is known for its innovative approach to analysing the costs and benefits of environmental regulations . <p> He played a key behind-the-scenes role in legal challenges to former president Donald Trump 's dismantling of clean air and water rules . <p> Historically , such cost-benefit analyses of regulations have been based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Revesz has argued that regulations -- particularly those related to climate change -- should also take into account the cost of pollution on future generations . <p> That approach can be used to justify strong climate regulations . <p> Mr Revesz , 64 , may be the first head of the White House regulatory office who is steeped in both the nation 's premier scientific assessment on climate change and its potent legal power for defending environmental regulations . <p> When the Trump administration , despite its zeal for rolling back environmental regulations , was forced to release the 2018 National Climate Assessment , a sweeping report by 13 federal agencies that describes the devastating impact of climate change on the nation 's economy , Mr Revesz spotted the legal implications of the document . <p> " This report will be used in court in significant ways , " he said in an interview at the time . <p> " I can imagine a lawyer for the Trump administration being asked by a federal judge , ' How can the federal government acknowledge the seriousness of the problem , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the problem ?

Infrastructure is at varying quality , and so is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs to encompass affordability , sustainability and access to electricity . <p> I 'm open to further discussion on what more needs to be included , beyond electricity provision . <p> What do you think Peter , and also , are all these grounds covered in the JET-P deal as it stands ? <p> Godfrey : I think number one on the list within Asia , not just Indonesia , is energy security , not just affordability and sustainability . <p> This is where Indonesia continues to have an inbuilt advantage -- clearly there is a vast amount of energy resources that could be used , including massive geothermal capabilities . <p> But the issue of justness is terribly important . The fundamental issue around the energy transition is electrification and in a country like Indonesia , unlike America or Europe , electricity demand is forecast to double by 2050 , whereas if you look at the Western countries , energy demand does n't go up very much because of energy efficiency and newer technology . <p> So to me the justness is very much recognising that countries like Indonesia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy systems of the future , with that vast amount of additional energy that is required to power economic growth in the future . <p> Now as we move to electrification , there are loads of questions on whether the regulatory frameworks that are currently set up in Indonesia , which today are based around the oil and gas industry , can be fit for purpose in tomorrow . <p> To stay on the social aspect , Siwage , how should the consideration of which parts of the Indonesian society pay , or not pay , for the energy transition reflect in national policies , perhaps even beyond the purview of the JET-P deal ? <p> Negara : There will be parts of the community that will be adversely affected if Indonesia decides to embark on green energy programmes . For example , those relying on coal -- like the mining and electricity sector , may face significant impacts . <p> What I see is that policymaking involves picking the winners for certain sectors , through what they incentivise . The other sectors will get disadvantaged . So it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including communities that are affected , and how to push them towards greener businesses . <p> For those leaving coal , what can they do ? When you force them to use other types of energy it would affect their profitability . <p> There are people struggling to get electricity in the remote islands outside Java too . How do you help these people get access to electricity through the green programmes , who should pay for the infrastructure , should it all be borned by the government , or can there be partnerships with the private sector ? <p> I am still thinking about how Indonesia can shoulder the cost of this passive programme in a fair manner . <p> At the same time , how do we make sure that the word " just " does not become an euphemism for a slower energy transition ? <p> Negara : Well , that 's a very difficult question . I think there is scepticism among analysts on whether Indonesia will be able to quickly transition towards green energy and achieve its net-zero target as fast as 2060 , based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fossil fuel industry , like coal miners and other industries , there will be huge challenges . <p> We need the political will from the government in terms of regulating these areas . Regulation is important in providing business certainty , to give assurances that Indonesia is really serious about pushing this green energy transition . <p> Peter mentioned that regulations today are mainly relevant to the oil and gas sector . We need to see if the government can quickly come up with new regulations for renewable energy . <p> But like I said , I do n't know how fast the Indonesia government can pass such laws given the strong lobby from the coal industry , and other oil and gas players . <p> Godfrey : The lobby groups from coal oil and gas clearly see the whole transition as a threat . In order to make the transition a success , we need to see the energy transition not as a threat , but as an opportunity . <p> Liang you mentioned the concept of externalities and the question of who should pay . We should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I talk about carrots , sticks and hugs . <p> We need to dangle carrots -- we need to create the opportunities that communities and industries can see . <p> We need some sticks , which predominantly will go for those that are holding back the transition , such as the coal , oil and gas lobbies . They need to feel the pain if they want to continue business as usual . <p> Today , Indonesia still subsidises its oil and gas , and its coal industries . The problem here is that the subsidies are going very much to the wrong places . The carrots are not being directed at where they really can make a difference , and that is part of the regulatory changes needed . <p> And then there are hugs . Hugs are all about embracing change , about making people feel good about what they do , so that is about communications and social interactions around these issues . <p> So a whole range of policies are needed , and the issue also is that , at the moment , a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managed by the Ministry of Mine and Energy Resources or the Ministry of Environment . If we really believe in carrots , sticks and hugs , the issues need to be resolved at the level of the finance ministry , or higher . <p> This is a fundamental change in the way the economy needs to be managed today . If you go to the ministry of finance , whether it is in Indonesia or Malaysia or Vietnam , and you talk about the energy transition , they 'll say , " That 's not our problem . It 's a problem for the Ministry of Mines and Energy " . <p> Negara : I think current subsidies are actually the biggest challenge in pushing for renewable energy development in Indonesia . Those benefiting from the subsidies are not the poor , yet it is politically difficult to remove them . <p> In a national survey that we did in Indonesia , over 80 per cent of respondents agreed that Indonesia should continue the subsidies . At the same time , 70 per cent of the same respondents also agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solar , wind or hydropower . <p> This is a dilemma and leaders will have to explain why Indonesia can not afford to continue fossil fuel subsidies . Still , when we say we have to move faster , who should get the stick and carrot , that is the challenge . <p> How does the JET-P deal come in to solve the dilemma of people wanting both a green transition and a continuation of the current fossil fuel subsidies , as Siwage mentioned ? Is it about the US$20 billion that is to come , or the policies that need to change ? Could there be any conflicts between these two , since there is private money coming in ? <p> Godfrey : A large chunk of JET-P is geared towards electrification and creating renewable electricity . But I 'll also say that if we were to change the regulations tomorrow , there would be a revolution on our hands in Indonesia because too many people would be affected by too much change , too quickly . <p> The key question here is how do we change regulations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overnight ? Probably not . What is now beginning to be looked at quite seriously in places like Europe and the US is this concept of regulatory sandboxes . <p> Do n't change everything overnight , but recognise that you could take , for example in Indonesia , a group of islands or a region , and do something completely different with a new set of regulations to act as an experiment , so that the country learns , people hopefully see the opportunities and threats , and that I think should be where discussions should be for the JET-P . <p> What I 'll also say is that gone are the times where infrastructure was managed entirely by national money , by a state-controlled budget . We are in a world where private-public partnerships ( PPPs ) are going to take over and there has to be private capital as well as public capital put into those investments . So you do need to create a framework for the types of investments we are talking about today . <p> With infrastructure , the only way to keep the rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them regulatory certainty for a reasonably long period of time . <p> That 's another reason why regulatory sandboxes may be the way forward , in a way where people see , maybe this works , maybe this is an opportunity , it was not as bad as we thought . <p> And that 's the kind of attitude we need to see adopted in a country like Indonesia . <p> Negara : I agree . There is no guarantee that certain models will be successful whenever we try them . We may have to deal with several trials before we come up with a good model for the JET-P . Some sectors may see more progress . In fact different plans for different sectors and communities are important . <p> What do you think are some of the sectors or industries that Indonesia should focus on in its JET-P implementation plan ? For example , South Africa , the first country to ink a JET-P deal , chose to focus on the energy sector , electric vehicles and green hydrogen . <p> Godfrey : Electrification is one major part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ energy system of the future boils down to an in into a number of areas . <p> There is also a massive opportunity in Indonesia to reduce energy demand . Limiting wasted energy is a quick and easy win that Indonesia should be looking at . <p> The third area , in addition to renewables , is low carbon solutions . Not everything can be achieved by just moving to renewables , because even with a fast-paced renewables buildout , including geothermal energy , we will still be burning oil and gas . We will still need the high-emitting industries . We will still be emitting methane from farming et cetera . <p> In this context , there is hydrogen . <p> And then the two final areas are carbon abatement , for example carbon capture , utilisation and storage , or possibly even other forms of engineering carbon solutions . Those are technologies that are now developing rapidly in Europe and the United States . They need to very quickly start developing in this part of the world . <p> So Indonesia needs to create a vision and say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do about it ? How do we scale these things up ? There are big opportunities . <p> Negara : In terms of electrification , we need to focus more on the eastern part of Indonesia which has a lower electrification ratio . <p> But we know that carbon emissions do not only come from electricity generation . There are also transport and household sources . <p> In Indonesia we know that a lot of people rely on motorcycles to get anywhere , be it in cities or rual areas . Perhaps we should be thinking of electrifying the motorcycle fleet as part of JET-P . <p> Another aspect is that a lot of people are still not quite aware of the importance of the energy transition . It is important that we educate the people , communicate what the benefits are for the whole country when we transition to clean energy . <p> There is a greater chance that JET-P will be more successful with support from the people . Indonesia is still developing , and it is not like the UK or Europe , where people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the environment and ecosystems . <p> Godfrey : Liang you mentioned South Africa as the first JET-P country , now we also have Vietnam as well , which is another interesting parallel . I think what is important is to recognise that all JET-Ps basically consist of a mix of concessional loans , market-based locals , grants and guarantees from public and private entities . <p> By definition , the money is not free , and I think the barrier to the JET-P now is actually creating the space for the money to be effectively used . It requires clear and transparent returns on the capital that satisfies the owners of the money . <p> Again , are we going to turn around and say , in five years all motorbikes need to be electric ? That 's pretty challenging . We need to go back to the idea of sandboxes . <p> That 's the challenge for Indonesia . It is very good at saying , " we 're so big and complex that we ca n't do anything " , and then nothing happens . We need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other experts that private investors in Indonesia 's JET-P programme could be interested in a bigger stake in the country 's nickel and battery production aspirations . Should these sectors feature as part of the JET-P deal , in your opinion ? What are the risks and benefits ? <p> Negara : Ideally this sector needs to be included because they contribute significantly to carbon emissions . We should get these players , who are considered the dirty industry , to be willing to change their way of doing business . <p> The challenge will be the types of compensation that the government can offer to this industry in order to change . The production relies heavily on coal , and if we force them to change to renewables it will significantly affect their productivity and economic viability . <p> So again , whether investors that have committed to develop smelters in Indonesia will be happy to change their energy source from coal to clean energy , it will reply on government support and the other partners . <p> We need to discuss this with the industry , and transparently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view . I 'm not saying we should exclude it , but when it comes to mining , decarbonisation is important , but so is the move to a more circular use of the resources . <p> So I think JET-P needs to provide support to make sure that the nickel , when mined , is used appropriately , returned and recycled appropriately , and that miners take responsibility for their own value chain . <p> These two elements , I think , should be covered within the JET-P as absolutely fundamental . Not giving money to mine nickel with the " yes , buts " , but with the carrots and sticks built in . <p> Overall , what should be the key considerations as Indonesia 's JET-P secretariat develops its implementation plan for the next few years ? <p> Godfrey : I will put them into three basic buckets . <p> The first one is regulatory . Indonesia needs to create regulatory inertia , in not just talking but actually doing things to set the right sort of direction . <p> The second bucket is really about technological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in terms of resources and supply chains . There needs to be capacity building as well . <p> The last one is obviously investment and financing -- people need to recognise the PPP model , and are willing to give it a try . <p> These three buckets all need inertia , and as I say , there needs to be less talk and more action . <p> Negara : I agree regulation is important . If Indonesia can come up with the new law on renewable energy , then that will provide the legal basis for this program . Of course after that , the journey is still quite long because the law itself is not operational without the ministerial regulation and the operational regulation . <p> Often in Indonesia the derivative rules are not in line with the other regulations . So coordination is important , and so is harmonisation across the different agencies . <p> Secondly , better communication to the public is also needed , it is relatively poor at the moment . In recent years , when Indonesia was preparing its omnibus law , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of public opposition . We do n't want that to happen with JET-P . <p> The ideal way is to include the stakeholders that will be affected by the programme , both local communities and industry . We need strong partnerships from the industry , without which , it will be very difficult to push this forward .

But a lack of snow put a stop to the trek , high winds cancelled the boat trip and the dinner was called off because there were not enough other customers . <p> But at least one plan remained intact . I had booked a night in a " glass igloo " at the edge of town and was looking forward to the private hot tub and sauna -- with views of the nearby bay and mountains -- on its deck . <p> When I arrived in a taxi from the airport a few hours late , I found the place shut . It was frigid , the paths slick and treacherous . As the taxi sped away , I tried to call the hostel .

No capital loss will be incurred , and you can always get your investment amounts back . The SSB is a long-term bond offering step-up interest , meaning that the longer one invests in it , the higher the interest income . It is also flexible , and one can exit the SSB anytime without penalty . <p> The SSB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate gets progressively higher for each year of funds invested in the bond . This means that the longer you remain invested in the SSB , the higher interest rates and average yearly returns you will enjoy . For a better understanding of step-up interest , head over to Dr Wealth for a comprehensive explanation of SSB 's interest system . <h> Features of the SSB <p> 1 . Very Minimal Risk <p> The Singapore Government 's credit rating by Moody 's , S&amp;P , Fitch and R&amp;I are Aaa , AAA , AAA and AAA , respectively , which means that the Singapore Government 's investment offerings of SGS bonds , T-bills and Savings Bonds are some of the safest investments to hold , with a very low risk of default , and high creditworthiness . <p> With near-zero risks of losing money , the SSB can be a good way for Singaporean investors to diversify their investment portfolios to manage overall risk . It is also a good investment to hold for more conservative investors with its provision of relatively good returns considering its low risk . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the difference between SSB and fixed deposits is since both are low risks . Well , here is where the shining point of the SSB comes through -- investors can exit the SSB without any penalty for early redemption ! <p> Unlike fixed deposits , where a penalty fee is usually charged for premature withdrawal , the SSB allows investors to extract their funds anytime , with a waiting period of 1 month . At the initial stage of investing , there is also no need for you to decide on the intended period and duration you wish to invest for . This allows you to use the SSB investments as a rainy-day fund , as the money invested can always be taken out anytime should unforeseen circumstances occur . <p> 3 . Ease of Investing in SSB <p> The SSB is also one of the easiest and most accessible investment bonds .

I had the privilege of joining the company very early on , in 2001 . <p> Jensen 's vision for the growth of NVIDIA resonated with my own beliefs that parallel computing and graphics processors were going to be needed in the future for applications well beyond gaming and graphics . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it fundamentally harder and harder for central processing units made by Intel and AMD to continue to scale to meet the workloads of the future . I also foresaw that high-performance computing was going to take up more and more of the data center architecture and budget than ever before . But I did n't exactly know that artificial intelligence would become the killer application for high-performance computing . <p> I was very fortunate to have joined NVIDIA at the beginning of this huge AI technology trend . Now , the entire ecosystem that I helped build , along with my colleagues , remains accessible to me as part of GFT ventures . I had the opportunity to look at thousands of startup companies , most of which were doing Visual Computing and AI , and recognize the patterns that made the best of those successful . As a member of NVIDIA 's executive staff , I also learned valuable operations skills , especially as we began to scale our revenues exponentially . There were some gloomy moments and fears of failure . But we had unwavering faith that what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the industry . When you believe deeply in the mission , and you work your tail off , good things will happen . That 's what I now bring to my startups . <p> How did GFT Ventures originate and what are your areas of focus ? You have a rich background in AI investments . Tell us more about it . <p> Jeff Herbst : Our collaboration investing in SoundHound was one of the reasons Jay and I became very good friends . It came out of discussions that we had over a long period , many of which occurred at a boxing gym in San Carlos , California , which we both used to frequent . We spent a lot of time there and subsequently began to work together more closely when I was at NVIDIA and he was at Translink . We built our relationship from there , ultimately culminating in us starting this fund together . <p> With AI and data science being the most disruptive trends in technology today , we 've built the fund to focus primarily on that and other frontier technologies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies , namely Seed or Series A companies located in North America and selectively in Israel . Many of our valued investors ( i.e.LPs ) come from the Asia Pacific region , not only because they invest , but also because they help connect us to the ecosystem . <p> Jay and I fully expect GFT to become a powerful VC franchise as we move into the next decades of this disruptive trend . We 've entered a new and extremely disruptive era of technology , and GFT Ventures is right in the heart of it . We are really excited to invest in these groundbreaking AI companies in collaboration with our limited partners around the world , and specifically in the Asia Pacific region . <p> How do you differentiate yourself from other VCs in the AI space ? What is your X-factor ? <p> Jeff Herbst : There are other VCs indicating in their business plans that they are focused on AI . The question you should ask is : Do they have even a fraction of the AI experience and the pattern recognition skills possessed by GFT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the person at NVIDIA that helped build the startup ecosystem around AI before anyone was thinking about AI . So , we were very early to the party , we have a lot of experience and knowledge behind us , and we have built a large ecosystem of entrepreneurs , start-ups and other partners who look at us as recognized thought leaders and experts in AI . Our expertise , pattern recognition and deal flow are better , which gives us a huge advantage . <p> We also have a huge network of global corporate partners that are there to assist us . We are the AI Co-chairs of Global Corporate Venturing , a network of 800 global corporations . In fact , Global Corporate Venturing is an LP in our fund . We are really proud of this , and it is a major differentiator for us . <p> Beyond that , we are an at-scale venture capital fund with one hundred million dollars of dry powder and the ability to quickly make investments in the best companies . We will still be accepting new investors in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you walk us through some of your success stories from the AI startups that you 've been investing in ? <p> Jeff Herbst : GFT is a relatively new fund , so our investments are quite early . But Jay and I have previously invested in many successful startups . At NVIDIA I invested in TuSimple , a self-driving truck company based in China that nobody was paying any attention to at the time since everyone was focused on self-driving cars and robotaxis . I was actually one of the first to identify that self-driving trucks were going to be quicker to market , and had more potential than cars , because there 's an existing freight ecosystem that can generate revenue by eliminating or supplementing a driver in a truck . Freight industries are hundreds of billions of dollars large , and trucks generally spend most of their time driving on highways instead of city streets . So , there was an immediate application there . <p> Since TuSimple went public , everyone began crowding into the self-driving truck space , including GFT Ventures . We made a subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that looks very well positioned to own the Korean freight market . Korea is a great market because it only has three major highways which are fairly efficiently mapped . As far as we know , Mars Auto is the market leader , and in fact , one of the only autonomous trucking companies focused out of Korea , which we estimate to be about a $30 billion trucking and freight market . <p> Another company called SoundHound which both Jay and I invested in about a decade ago , became a public company within the last year . They were one of the first conversational AI companies , much before anyone heard of OpenAI and ChatGPT . <p> Can you tell us about the valuations of some of the startups that you are focused on ? Is it a good time to invest ? <p> Jeff Herbst : Out of our $120 million raised to date , we 've deployed only around $20 million , which is a relatively small amount . We 've been very careful and we always look for reasonable valuations . We are not the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuations , or being the quickest to write the check . On the contrary , companies choose us because they value our operational experience and domain excellence . In fact , they know that we understand their businesses and their technologies better than other VCs . <p> *I think it is also an extremely good time to be starting a venture capital fund . If we had started investing 2 years ago when valuations were arguably quite inflated based on historical standards , some of those companies might be challenged to achieve the returns venture capitalists need to sustain their businesses and please their investors . Because we just started most of our money is yet to be deployed , so we are in a very great position . Now that the bubble valuations that we saw a couple of years back have finally normalized , this is likely the best time in the cycle to begin investing . <p> What are your expansion plans for Asia ? <p> Jeff Herbst : North America and Israel are our primary places of focus because that 's where our team is currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard for smaller venture capital funds to invest thoughtfully in multiple markets at the same time . Over time though , I believe the GFT Ventures franchise has a great opportunity to expand in size and invest in additional markets . In the meantime , for our investors from Asia , we will help them understand and learn about the ecosystems that we are currently investing in . For example , a lot of our portfolio companies will be able to take their technologies and their solutions and reproduce them in other regions like the Asia Pacific , the Middle East , as well as other parts of the world . We will be ambassadors of the expertise that we have in AI and data science and help bring it to the attention of our investors , wherever they might be located . And ultimately , we are excited about opportunities to reproduce the GFT franchise in Asia . <p> What do you look for in startups before investing ? <p> Jeff Herbst : In general , we look for companies that are solving very hard technology problems for very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can explain their solutions to us quite elegantly and easily . If they describe something hard to do yet simple to explain , in my view that 's kind of the best-case scenario . <p> On the contrary , if something is easy to do but hard to explain , that 's usually the worst-case scenario for us . No one will buy that product , and no one will invest in it . In terms of areas of focus , we 're somewhat horizontally focused , becausewe 're looking for businesses where AI and data science can be disruptive to the existing cadence of the business . <p> One of the things I learned at NVIDIA is that most of the AI companies that succeeded had common attributes . In particular , very strong vertical expertise and often some proprietary access to data . That means either you have original access to your own data , or the ability to create data over time before your competitors . Modern AI is mainly focused on pattern recognition from massive amounts of data . So , the data often becomes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technology itself . Ultimately the AI technology itself , that is the algorithms , will become very widespread . Not necessarily ubiquitous , but more easily deployed , and generally accessible through open-source models . It 's the data that feeds the algorithms that could be harder to obtain . <p> Why do we feel like Asia LPs are interested in the GFT ventures fund ? What do you think draws them to your thesis and into what you 're doing ? <p> Jeff Herbst : Our fund was originally anchored by Mirae Asset , the largest financial institution headquartered in Korea . Naver Corporation , also based in Korea , is also one of our original LPs . Beyond that , we 've partnered with several family offices and prominent individuals in the US , Singapore , Indonesia , and India . <p> We believe that the AI being developed in the West is going to ultimately make its way to the East , giving massive exposure to GFT Ventures . We can essentially be the " AI Ambassadors " for our Asia-based LPs . We 'll help them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to leverage our established thought leadership . A lot of LPs we speak with are simply interested in learning more about what 's going on in the US . They want to understand the deal flow and gain knowledge from people that have been practicing AI for a while . It 's not just about monetary returns , which will be fantastic by the way -- the fact is though , there 's a lot more beyond that . We will act as a gateway to the future , allowing them to learn about AI from the West . <p> There will also be opportunities for our LPs to co-invest in our portfolio companies as they mature as well . And ultimately , we hope to help our LPsin the East establish their own venture capital operations as well . <p> What is your outlook for your company in the coming years ? <p> Jeff Herbst : We 've literally just started and have raised $120 million now . We 'd like to be at $150 million before our final close . We are going to stay focused on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 to 20 very successful companies out of Fund I. Once we do that , we 'll think about potentially building more and bigger funds in the future . We have very strong relationships with our limited partners , and we are laser-focused on making GFT Ventures Fund I extremely successful . Once we do that , it will propel GFT ventures to even bigger things in the future .

These freehold developments are built primarily for tenants , who want a fuss-free location on the city fringe . <p> To be blunt , many Treasures projects may be uncomfortably close to Geylang 's vice areas for certain buyers and residents . Families are definitely out , as are those looking at resale gains . Unless the red-light area moves in the future , projects in such vice vicinities will naturally have small prospective buyer pools . <p> The main attraction here is rental . To focus on Treasures @ G19 , for instance , average prices for one-bedders can range between $1,215 to just over $1,300 psf . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in an area chock full of small convenience stores and eateries -- many of which are open till late if not 24/7 . The area is also extremely well connected by bus , with about a dozen bus services at the Before Lor 18 stop , right outside Treasures @ G19 . <p> It also only has 27 one-bedroom units from a tiny 388 sq . ft. to 517 sq . ft. so it is one-dimensional in terms of the unit mix -- but it does at least have a small rooftop pool . <p> Overall , this is a project that may not be pretty ( unless you 're attracted to the gritty urban feel ) -- but it is highly convenient and rentable . If you need accessibility on a budget , or your strategy is to focus on pure rental yield , Treasures may be viable ; otherwise , look elsewhere . <p> One additional downside we need to highlight : the Geylang Lorongs are notoriously congested . As any motorist can tell you , driving within the alleys of Geylang is a test of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off just walking to the MRT. <h> 2 . The Hillford <p> Location : 178 Jalan Jurong Kechil ( District 21 ) <p> Developer : World Class Developments ( North ) Pte . Ltd . <p> Lease : 60-years <p> TOP : 2016 <p> Number of units : 281 <p> Highlights : <p> The Hillford is not for resale gain or legacy planning , given its short lease ( this condo is on a 60-year lease which started in 2013 ) . <p> The Hillford is an oddity among condos , as it was initially built with the elderly in mind . It was a trial run at allowing a developer to build a private retirement housing project , with lower-cost housing ( due to the shorter lease ) , and elder-friendly facilities like medical clinics on the condo grounds . Regulations that cap the number of shoebox units were lifted for The Hillford , thus allowing for the larger number of one-bedders . <p> Contrary to initial intentions , The Hillford sold out on day one , with many buyers even in their 30s and 40s rushing to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hillford is about 750 metres from Beauty World MRT ( DTL ) , which some consider walkable ( it 's roughly a 10 to 12 minutes walk ) . It was then -- and still is -- one of the most affordable condos on the market . Recent resale transactions show prices at $1,359 to $1,400+ psf ; and given the 60-year lease , we expect prices to dip faster than usual in the long run . <p> Nonetheless , for single retirees looking for a private forever-home , or landlords focused on yield rather than resale gains , this is a viable city fringe project . <h> 3 . Skies Miltonia <p> Location : 3 Miltonia Close ( District 27 ) <p> Developer : TG Master Pte . Ltd . <p> Lease : 99-years <p> TOP : 2016 <p> Number of units : 420 <p> Highlights : <p> Skies Miltonia may be of interest if you want a shoebox for own-stay purposes . Notice that it has the largest one-bedder on this particular list , going up to 527 sq . ft .

There is also the possibility of a future MRT station near here ( in 2019 LTA conducted a feasibility study to see if a new line is needed ) . <p> Currently , though , the location of Skies Miltonia may not be for everyone . Free shuttle service or not , most will demand quicker access to town or an MRT station . The other issue is the proximity of condos like Signature at Yishun and The Criterion , which are ECs may threaten to have even more competitive pricing at the time of resale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this is a somewhat underrated condo for the price . <h> 4 . Oceanfront Suites <p> Location : 173 Jalan Loyang Besar ( District 17 ) <p> Developer : Regal Realty Pte . Ltd . <p> Lease : 946-years <p> TOP : 2016 <p> Number of units : 58 <p> Highlights : <p> While Oceanfront Suites is near the sea , you probably wo n't get much of a view , if any at all given its low-rise nature . This is a small project with just 58 units , so there 's a high degree of privacy ; and it 's relatively close ( about 750 metres ) to Downtown East , which has a good amount of retail and eateries . <p> The park area facing Pasir Ris Beach is also great for cyclists and those who like long walks , and this is one of the more tranquil stretches in Singapore . There are also some aquatic sports facilities here , so outdoorsy or sporting types will get the most out of it . <p> The drawback to Oceanfront Suites is accessibility . The affordable sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station ( Pasir Ris MRT station is the nearest ) , and bus services in the area also tend to be a bit limited . This is primarily a condo for those who drive , and it 's likely to be a choice for own-stay use ( most tenants will find it too inaccessible ) . <p> You do have the upcoming Pasir Ris 8 development to look forward to , as additional dining and shopping outlets to complement the existing White Sands . <h> 5 . Heritage East <p> Location : 451 East Coast Road ( District 15 ) <p> Developer : World Class Property ( East Coast ) Pte . Ltd . <p> Lease : Freehold <p> TOP : 2012 <p> Number of units : 65 <p> Highlights : <p> This is a small project of just 65 units , which is in keeping with an area known for boutique projects . However , this is a good way to have access to the lifestyle stretch along East Coast Road , with an added bonus : the Marine Terrace MRT station ( TEL ) is expected to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes walk of Heritage East , fixing its longstanding accessibility issue . <p> nid:618826 <p> The East Coast stretch with i12 Katong , along with family-friendly pubs and eateries , is only about four minutes ' drive from this project ( or just take one of the busses right outside the condo ) . Meanwhile , the stretch of road outside Heritage East is dotted with various artisanal cafes . <p> This is an affordable way to get into a high-demand neighbourhood -- our only worry would be the sheer number of boutique condos already in the area , which make for tough competition . Also , note the freehold status is n't very exceptional for this location , which is chock-full of other small freehold projects . <p> As for tenants , we 're 50-50 on this : it could go either way . The Katong area nearby is an ex-pat enclave , but there are other projects much closer to i12 or Parkway Parade , or near international schools . Again , competition is a problem for investors . <p> This location is nonetheless good for solo retirees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diners , wineries , and other aspects of east-side living . <p> If you can stretch , the bigger units here do come with a private pool each , which is pretty unique . 
@@98201231 <p> As a landlord , if you had the choice between a short and a long lease -- which would you choose ? <p> On the surface , it seems like such an obvious answer . Who would n't want to have a longer lease ? <p> But over the last year or so as the rental rates have been increasing , that answer might not have been as straightforward anymore . With rental rates soaring , it may be more ideal to go for shorter leases if possible : it was likely that , at the end of six months to a year , a tenant could be found who would likely pay more . <p> As we enter Q2 2023 , however , we 're less certain -- and there may be a good reason to lock in a longer lease again . Here 's what to consider ( and it 's also useful to know if you 're a tenant ) : <h> Rising resistance among tenants <p> SRX flash estimates show private non-landed rental rates rising 3.5 per cent for February 2023 , while HDB rental rates went up 1.2 per cent in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condo leasing volume dropped by over 18 per cent , while HDB rental volumes were down over seven per cent . <p> Besides this , some realtors noted that the supply crunch in housing is coming to an end due to the number of completed new launch projects this year . Especially for mega launches where there are many units that will come on the market at one go ( plus the pressure to get it rented out immediately because of the high mortgage rates ) . One realtor explains that : <p> " Based on URA estimates from 2022 , around 28,800 units including ECs will be completed between 2022 and 2023 . This is three times more than the number of units completed in the two years prior . <p> This surge is due to many projects that were delayed during the pandemic , but are now all coming to completion . So I would say the recent spike in rental prices was an aftermath of the pandemic , which is gradually being normalised . " <p> Another realtor also explained why rental rates may seem to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rental rates are not high just because of demand , it is also the age and location of the project . If we just look at average rental rates it can seem it 's still going up , but a lot of the rental may be coming from recently completed projects , where tenants may pay more as facilities are newer . " <p> As such , the rising rental rates on paper may disguise the reality on the ground . Tenants have been increasingly vocal about rate increases , and realtors say there will be fewer compulsions against moving , as more options enter the market . <h> Some arguments over the role of recently completed housing <p> While most realtors we spoke to said that completed housing would moderate rental supply , there were some opinions to the contrary . Some realtors believe that most completed projects will go toward homeowners , rather than the rental market . One realtor from this camp told us : <p> " In the HDB market , those who rent out their flats are the small minority . Most HDB flats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand from homeowners is so high , HDB even had to ramp up the supply . <p> Even with more HDB flats completed , there is no significant increase in the supply of flats to rent out . New flats still need to finish their MOP* before they contribute to rental supply , and you can see from resale flat prices that homeowners are eager to take up what 's available . So we are actually maintaining a pretty tight supply , when it comes to rental stock . " <p> Another realtor argued that we may be overstating the impact of completed housing , on the condo side of the market : <p> " There 's no definite numbers on how many of the completed homes are for owner-occupiers , or how many are for landlords looking to rent out . But in the past two years , we 've seen the demand has been strong from owner-occupiers ; and among the completed condos in the Outside Central Region , most are likely for families and not for rental . " <p> ( You can check out this list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . <p> The realtor is referring to the fact that most purely rental assets are found in the Core Central Region or Rest of Central Region , where landlords seek affluent expatriate tenants . <p> *Note that flats of three-room or larger sizes can have individual rooms rented out , if the owner is a Singapore Citizen . <h> Tenants trending toward resale and two-bedders in 2023 <p> From word on the ground , realtors say they have seen more limited demand from tenants , regarding new launches . One realtor says the tendency is to search for older condos : <p> " New launch condos can reach rental rates of over $5,000 a month , even just for a two-bedder . At this point , we are seeing more tenants skirt the new projects , and ask about resale condos within the same general area . <p> This is good for landlords with older properties , as in the long run , it will help to push up rental rates for resale condos as well . But it 's tough for investors who bought new launch condos , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 're already paying near-peak market prices . " <p> The realtor gave an example of a tenant who , quite recently , informed him of finding a resale two-bedder within 600 metres of a new launch . <p> " The tenant showed me the unit was over 700 square feet , and yet almost the same cost as my client 's new 520 square feet unit . It 's tough to compete with the resale side right now , so I would be wary of buying new launch shoebox units . " <p> Another realtor says he notices a trend toward two-bedder units , which is surprising as these larger units cost more . This realtor says : <p> " Although the overall rental is more , it 's still more affordable if a tenant is willing to take on a roommate . Among student tenants or foreigners on a tighter budget , I have seen a preference for sharing a two-bedder , compared to renting out a whole shoebox on their own . " <h> In conclusion , landlords may want to consider longer leases again <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market , despite the apparent numbers . Along with the surge in completed properties , there 's another development to consider : the war in Europe , plus recent troubles in the banking sector , points toward a volatile year 's end in 2023 . <p> If larger companies are affected , this could shrink expat housing allowances or the prospective pool of tenants . <p> As such , most realtors we spoke to agreed that " locking in " a good tenant -- even at some opportunity cost for higher rental later -- is n't a bad idea anymore . Many also pointed out that rental rates probably have little room to grow from here : one relator quipped that , at $5,000+ per month , some of the tenants may be paying less if they took a mortgage on where they lived .

Some cars are more than just the sum of its parts , and the premium-looking and feeling offerings from this German-owned British marque achieves just that ! <h> What 's different ? <p> Well , not a lot .

Probably to remind the other motorists around you about the brand 's proud heritage . <h> In the cockpit <p> There 's no doubt that this is a premium product . Equipment levels are the same as any of the previous Mini cars we 've tested , so you get nice squidgy materials throughout the cabin , and a reskinned BMW iDrive system , dubbed as Mini Connected . <p> This means plenty of native apps , and the option for wireless Apple CarPlay .

Solid-feeling and properly tactile switchgear , along with the generally premium-feeling materials complete the interior . <h> How does it drive ? <p> Temper your expectations here -- this is no fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that 's what you are looking for . Without a spicy powerplant under the bonnet , it definitely feels like the car has been built for those seeking the Mini style , without the need for ludicrous performance . <p> Though that is n't to say that it lacks power . Sure , 101 bhp does n't sound like a lot today , but it manages to feel more spritely than its power figure suggests as a result of having torque in the correct bits of the powerband . <p> When combined with its dinky dimensions , the car is properly darty , and it has little trouble fitting into even the smallest of gaps in traffic . There 's sufficient feedback through the wheel , with decent heft creating a sense of athleticism too . Grip levels are decent even in the torrential rain I found myself in throughout the duration of this test drive . <h> Is this the one for you ? <p> In all honesty , the performance of the JCW Cooper can not realistically be exploited on a regular basis locally .

And in five-door guise , the added practicality means your family members are spared from having to crawl in and out of the back seat through the front door apertures -- a proper win in our books !

It will also stop financing upstream oil and gas projects that were approved after 2021 . <p> In addition to the oil and gas sector , OCBC also announced decarbonisation targets for five other sectors -- power , real estate , steel , aviation and shipping -- as part of its wider net-zero commitments by 2050 . <p> These six sectors make up about 67 per cent of OCBC 's corporate and commercial banking loan portfolio . But the targets themselves account for 42 per cent of the portfolio , as the bank focuses on parts of the value chains that make up the bulk of emissions . <p> Out of these six sectors , real estate is the largest contributor to the bank 's revenue . <p> OCBC is the last of the three Singapore banks to announce its net-zero targets , as it joins a wave of global financial institutions facing pressure to cut financing of " dirty " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their portfolios .

So there will definitely be some revenue forgone because you 're changing your portfolio . But in a way , we 're actually rebuilding our portfolio in a less carbon-emitting manner . " <p> In contrast to the oil and gas sector , where decarbonisation targets are set based on absolute emissions , other sectors are guided by emission intensity targets .

These targets will also be reviewed at least once every five years as climate science evolves and more data from clients become more available . <p> Tan said that the bank is looking to focus on the agricultural sector next and will soon begin collecting data .

So if you fancy a premium German midsize SUV and want the cheapest ( relatively speaking ) one on the market , the Q5 is the one to go for . <p> What do you get for the money though ? Well the most obvious one is the engine . It remains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this iteration it now puts out 204hp and 320Nm of torque , down from the 249hp and 370Nm of torque of the previously-more powerful model . <p> Before you think that it 's a major downgrade , bear in mind that the equivalent BMW X3 xDrive20i puts out a mere 180 or so horsepower , and is significantly more expensive to boot . <p> Truthfully though , in Singapore , 200 horsepower is more than enough for daily driving , and the Q5 demonstrates that by being adequate and up to the task , without really setting any records on fire . <p> The unit pulls smoothly , although it does strain a little at the upper end when pushed , but if you 're just going about in urban traffic , the Q5 is more than capable of getting you around without much fuss . <p> The other benefit of the less powerful engine come in the form of emissions , or more specifically , taxation .

@@98869238 <p> Property investments do n't always go smoothly , but it 's often the success stories you hear about . In reality , not everyone manages to sell for a record gain after five years and upgrade ; and not every rental property ends up being worth its initial capital . We spoke to some property investors about their biggest regrets and the lessons they learned in the process : <h> 1 . Buying a property while under-capitalised <p> Our reader TT says he dived into the property market before he was properly capitalised , and learned a painful lesson from a forced sale : <p> " In 2007 I became fascinated with the property market after one of my old school friends made his first million in property investment , " TT says , " I was so eager to follow suit that I bought a 920+ sq . ft. unit at Botannia , at the time at $850+ psf . I had to stretch the loan to the max to cover it . " <p> TT says that this was in fact the very first property he had bought , and he decided to forego an HDB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Total Debt Servicing Ratio ( TDSR ) was not yet introduced at the time , and TT estimates that almost 70 per cent of his monthly income was sunk into the monthly repayment -- this was before even adding maintenance fees . <p> Then in 2010 , the ongoing Global Financial Crisis took its toll on TT 's employer , which closed its Singapore branch . While TT found another job within weeks , his income had declined by about a third ; and this meant the monthly loan repayment would consume almost his entire pay cheque . <p> TT says that : " While I had savings , I realised I had to sell the unit quickly ; and at the time the economy was bad , so finding a buyer would be difficult . " <p> Ironically , we must point out TT was mistaken : the period from 2009 to 2013 would see one of the biggest rises in property prices , largely due to rock-bottom interest rates . <p> However , TT was in urgent need and forced to sell . This means he reaped few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent delivered what he wanted : an urgent sale , that was transacted in under a month . <p> However , TT says he sold the unit at about $850,000 , over its purchase price of $782,000 . <p> " After deducting the stamp duty , maintenance fees , and agent commissions , it was not a very impressive return . And according to my old realtor , today the units can sell for more than $1.3 million . " <p> TT chalks up the issue of being under-capitalised and rushing to buy the first property he could before he was financially prepared . And as we 've mentioned before , having the holding power . <h> 2 . Trying to wait out the " temporary " cooling measures <p> Our reader Eliza was in a position to buy a private property while retaining her flat , back in 2014 . The Minimum Occupancy Period ( MOP ) on her 5-room flat had just ended , and Eliza had a " nest egg " that came from selling her share of her late father 's business . <p> While Eliza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convinced her to wait before buying . <p> " My friend said the cooling measures were temporary and the market was at a peak ; so it was better not to buy a second property , at a time when the prices would be so high . As my friend was quite a sophisticated investor , I decided to trust her opinion . " <p> The prediction turned out to be half-right . Property prices did indeed decline for a short while , but what did n't fall was the ABSD rate . Instead , it rose even higher ; and property prices managed to rise again despite this . <p> Eliza did eventually buy a second property for the rental income ; but she acted only after waiting till 2018 , by which time ABSD rates had risen to 17 per cent . She also bought at a higher price , as home prices had recovered by then . <p> " I would have saved hundreds of thousands of dollars if I was n't so na ? ve as to think ABSD would just vanish one day . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so we should remember that being slow also has a steep cost . " <p> On the plus side , at least she did n't pay the current rate of 20 per cent ( as of May 2023 ) . <h> 3 . Buying old walk-ups for rental <p> In 2012 , JT and his father-in-law purchased two walk-up units in the Geylang area . While he wo n't disclose the price , JT said that it was low enough for the two of them to buy without the need for a loan . <p> This was due to the age and condition of the walk-ups , which only had about 51 years of their lease remaining . <p> JT 's father-in-law was a contractor by trade , so restoring the properties would have been cheaper ; plus , JT already had some potential tenants lined up . He says that : <p> " If all went well , we expected to recoup our costs within the first 15 years , then after that it would just be cash-generating . We only spent about $200,000 to renovate both units @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work himself . " <p> JT says the renovations were extensive , enough to bring the units to the same level as many co-living spaces today . <p> Unfortunately , the maintenance issues with the walk-ups soon got out of hand . From constantly choked toilets , to ceiling leaks and termites , JT says his father-in-law ended up spending more on their shared project than on any property he 'd worked on before . <p> " I think after the first five years , we spent about another $60,000 to $70,000 , and many of the problems were still recurring , " JT says , " On top of that the rental market started to soften . I soon found out that , despite our place looking a lot nicer than many old Geylang walk-ups , the tenants in this area mostly just want the cheapest option . So there 's a tight ceiling on rental rates here . " <p> By 2019 , JT and his in-law had thrown in the proverbial towel and sold the two units to other investors . JT says after all the costs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : " For the amount of trouble we went through , it was definitely not worth it . Total waste of time . " <p> JT says his mistake was focusing just on the numbers , and not looking past the spreadsheet . He also adds that they were fortunate to be able to sell the properties , given the age and issues . <h> 4 . Investing with someone who has entirely different aims <p> George ( not his real name ) bought a two-bedder condo unit along Robinson Road , together with one of his cousins . He notes that neither of them owned a property ( so there was no ABSD ) , and he was resolved to stay with his parents for a long time to come : <p> " I live with my parents in a landed home , " George says , " And there 's room even if I do get married and want to settle down . My cousin said at the time he was in the same situation , where he would n't need a place of his own for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unit , and split the rental income and costs . " <p> George had made it clear to his cousin that his intent was to hold on for the long term and collect rent -- the property would be cash-flow positive from the start , as together they had the means to purchase it in full . <p> " Unfortunately I ignored the first red flags , " George says , " When my cousin could n't give me a clear answer on what he expected . He just kept saying he was happy with anything , he just wanted the rental income , and he did n't have any preference of what to do with the property later . " <p> This became a problem around six years down the road when George 's cousin wanted to get married and settle down . <p> " Suddenly he told me he needed a place of his own to stay , " George says , " Even though earlier on he had said he did n't need one . " <p> nid:630086 <p> Because the cousin co-owned a private property with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incurring the ABSD . As such , he insisted that George buy over his share of the property . <p> " I was not in a financial position to do that , " George says , " And not when he told me on such short notice . He wanted me to buy over his share in the next two or three months . " <p> When George was unable to buy over his share , the cousin began to harass him constantly about selling the property , which was tenanted and generating a healthy yield . However , rushing to sell the property in a month or two would likely mean a loss . <p> " I was constantly being berated by him and his wife , " George says , " And eventually the news got to my parents , who were quite upset . My dad also tried to persuade me to sell the property , to prevent bad blood . " <p> Ultimately , George 's father bought over the cousin 's share -- but this was only possible after liquidating other investments . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off a lot of his other assets to buy over my cousin 's share , " George says , " And I do feel responsible for it , as I realise I rushed into this without bothering to know who I was getting into bed with . " <p> George 's advice to upcoming investors ? <p> " Look out for wishy-washy types . If you own the house with anyone , even your own spouse , make sure to agree on topics like what is the house for , when will you sell the house , what rental or resale price is acceptable , and so forth . <p> You should also have a contingency plan , in case life situations or money situations force one side to give up the house .

@@99260234 <p> SINGAPORE -- The logistics industry is a prime mover in employing brain power to meet the complex challenges of moving items from A to B as fast as possible , but its greatest challenge now is to overcome the sector 's own image problem . <p> The problem in essence is that for many people , especially young people , logistics conjures up unappealing images of harried workers unloading cartons from the back of a van in the blazing sun . Try selling that to a young job seeker . <p> Yet supply-chain management -- industry-speak for logistics -- requires people and leaders with the very traits the young possess : Nimbleness , innovativeness and IT savviness . <p> The need is ever greater now as firms navigate the constant disruptions to global trade that have stemmed from the pandemic . <p> Singapore is on the front line when it comes to meeting this challenge , given that 23 out of the top 25 global logistics companies have operations in the country , with many of them basing their regional headquarters in the city-state . <p> Mr Eddie Lim , an executive director at the Singapore Logistics Association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manpower across logistics , but the problem is more acute among the " rank and file " . <p> " This is a constant problem .

It expects to reap more money from the sale of its freehold commercial property than from its core operations . <p> Dr Faizal Yahya , a senior research fellow in the Governance and Economy Department at the Institute of Policy Studies , said there is a need to engage with Gen Z -- those born between 1997 and 2012 -- as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near future . <p> Human resource experts said young people need to know that logistics and supply-chain management are expansive fields that go beyond shipping and basic goods handling . <p> This once-overlooked segment of the economy actually offers a wide range of career paths and opportunities , ranging from sourcing and procurement to merchandising , supply-chain planning and sales and operations . <p> There are also opportunities in sustainability , such as carbon-footprint management and environmental protection management issues many young people are passionate about . <p> As the sector evolves , new skills are required , focusing on technology such as artificial intelligence-driven predictive analytics , digital enablers and intelligent automation . Companies will have to invest in these skills and educational providers will need to offer these training requirements , Dr Faizal said . <p> This is crucial for an economy like Singapore 's , which relies heavily on trade . <p> Dr Faizal said : " Any shortage of supply-chain talent such as the middle managers would disrupt supply-chain operations .

" , and you 'll realise that there are actually many different types of stress . <p> Stress occurs when you perceive a condition , whether real or imagined , to be a threat to your well-being . There are different types of stress , namely acute , episodic , and chronic stress . <p> Acute stress is common and usually does not pose any health issues . This type of stress is typically triggered by a sudden change of plans or environment , but it generally eases once the person finds a solution to their problem . <p> On the other hand , frequent episodes of acute stress can lead to acute episodic stress , which can have physical and psychological effects and exacerbate existing health issues such as high blood pressure , digestive problems , panic attacks or headaches . <p> Chronic stress , which arises from multiple stressors , can be caused by various factors such as family issues , personal health problems , and conflicts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like divorce or death of a loved one can increase the risk of chronic stress . This type of stress persists over a long period and can have severe physical and psychological effects on a person . <h> How to manage stress effectively ? <p> Since stress is inevitable , let 's see what we can do to effectively prevent and manage our stress levels , without resorting to medication : <h> 1 . Have sufficient sleep <p> Getting enough sleep is essential for maintaining good health as it allows the body and brain to rest . <p> Furthermore , during the hours of 1.00 to 3.00 AM , restful sleep enables the liver meridian to supply qi actively to the liver system , which manages stress and emotions , facilitating the elimination of toxins from the blood . <p> Subsequently , between 3.00 and 5.00 AM , the purified blood and qi are transported to various organ systems for optimal functioning . <p> Sour dates have the potential to aid individuals with insomnia by nourishing the heart and liver , promoting restful sleep . Additionally , a herbal tonic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be consumed to enhance sleep quality by soothing both the mind and body . <h> 2 . Drink flower teas <p> Prolonged stress can increase the risk of developing mental health disorders . However , there are herbal remedies that may help alleviate stress . These include chamomile , mint leaves , and rosebuds . <p> Chamomile is a medicinal herb with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties used to treat various health issues . When consumed in the form of tea , it can help calm the nerves , and alleviate symptoms of stress such as insomnia . <p> Rosebuds and mint leaves can also be infused in hot water to make a tea that can alleviate stress . These herbal remedies are safe for consumption by children , although in lower doses . <h> 3 . Perform acupuncture or acupressure massages <p> Acupuncture is a form of Traditional Chinese Medicine ( TCM ) that involves the use of disposable needles inserted into specific points on the body by a licensed TCM physician . <p> Acupressure , on the other hand , involves applying pressure to acupuncture points to restore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and can be self-administered . <p> To alleviate stress , some of the pressure points that can be pressed include point LI-4 of the large intestine meridian ( He Gu ) and LR-3 of the liver meridian ( Tai Chong ) . <p> He Gu is located between the first and second fingers , in a V-shape at the indentation of the second finger bone . <p> Tai Chong is located in the depression between the big toe and the second toe . Another simple exercise that can help relieve stress involves placing both palms on the chest and sliding them downward from the collarbone to the stomach , repeating this 15 to 20 times . <h> 4 . Try meditation and breathing exercises <p> Engaging in meditational breathing can be a helpful practice in reducing stress levels .

@@99574234 <h> Fast and Futurious : Test Driving the Mercedes AMG EQE 53 <p> The new EQE 53 4MATIC+ is the first fully electric and future-ready super saloon from Mercedes ' high-performance AMG division . Prestige takes it for a drive . <p> When in the late 1960s a pair of former Mercedes-Benz engineers named Hans Aufrecht and Erhard Melcher set up AMG , an independent engine-tuning operation , it was initially with the aim of making the products of their erstwhile employer more competitive in the worlds of motor racing and rallying . Later , like so many other tuning businesses , they also began modifying the company 's road cars , slotting in bigger and more powerful engines , adjusting chassis , suspension and braking systems to handle the increased outputs and speeds , and -- possibly with the occasional nod and wink of encouragement from Mercedes itself -- turning the conservative conveyances of Germany 's post-war bourgeoisie into machines that were exhilaratingly raw and raucous . <p> Evidently the halo appeal resulting from AMG 's activities was n't lost on the powers-that-be at Daimler-Benz . By the early ' 90s , the board in Stuttgart had agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the acquisition of a controlling interest and ultimately , in 2005 , a full takeover by the bigger of the two . Mercifully for lovers of fast cars , however , that final step in the relationship hardly changed the nature of the automobiles on which the high-performance operation worked its magic . <p> A tiny tail spoiler indicates this is an AMG <p> In fact , Mercedes ' AMG-badged variants remained as gloriously characterful and rowdy as ever , with big , rumbling multi-cylinder engines that propelled them to enormous speeds , and exhaust systems that would crackle , pop and , now and again , even spit out a lick of flame -- mighty machines such as the CLK 63 , the gullwing SLS coupe , various C 63s , the supercar-fast E 63 S saloon and the AMG GT R coupe ( the latter especially in its unmistakable Green Hell Magno paint job ) . <p> And that was pretty much the standard recipe within the sub-brand that had come to be known as Mercedes-AMG -- until , that is , around 2015 , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the industry that the future of the motor car had very little to do with noisy , gas-guzzling V8s and everything to do with clean and quiet electricity . Whether or not this was an existential moment for them , it certainly meant the folks in Mercedes ' high-performance division needed to reflect upon -- and possibly redefine -- almost every attribute their brand had stood for in order to transition convincingly into the age of the electron . And now , some eight years on , I 've been able to sample the first fruits of that re-examination in the form of the fully electric AMG EQE 53 4MATIC+ , which arrived on these shores only recently . <p> Details on the Mercedes-AMG EQE 53 <p> As it happens , AMG does have previous form with EVs , having produced in tiny numbers the wildly costly Electric Drive SLS coupe of 2014 , which for a time was the world 's fastest production electric car . <p> It 's also been able to draw upon a long and admirable track record of transforming unexciting automobiles into ones that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its attentions to the first of Mercedes ' current crop of future-ready , clean-air saloons -- for while the standard mid-size EQE is undeniably electric , even its most ardent fans would be hard pressed to call it electrifying -- than it was with those solid , stolid sedans of 60 years ago . <p> Granted the 53 model shares the same bland silhouette with its less-performative EQE siblings ( though that teardrop shape is slippery enough for an impressive drag coefficient of just 0.22 ) , but I will concede that AMG 's distinctively aggressive Panamericana front " grille " , a discreet rear spoiler and chunky 21-inch Y-spoke alloys shod with bespoke Michelin Pilot Sport tyres do add more than a suggestion of muscularity . A further clue to its abilities comes from the small " 4MATIC+ " badges ahead of the front doors , which indicate not only all-wheel drive but also the presence of twin " permanently excited " synchronous electric motors -- they 're exclusive to AMG models -- that feed power to the front and rear axles in a constantly varying split of torque @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 950Nm respectively , with a temporary " overboost " provided by the AMG Dynamic Plus Package 's Race Start setting that raises both figures to 677 and 1,000 . To put those numbers into context , Mercedes-AMG 's outgoing petrol-powered E 63 S saloon -- a fire-breathing , tarmac-consuming monster if ever there was one -- provides 603bhp and 850Nm , so even without driving it you know this new electric contender is going to be ridiculously fast . <p> A Panamericana- style " grille " is an AMG signature <p> Closer inspection of the specs inspires further optimism : air suspension with adaptive damping , active rear-wheel steering , variable-rate steering and no fewer than five driving modes , each with its own power ceiling , all sound like boons in a car that weighs more than 2.5 tonnes and measures just a few centimetres shy of 5 metres . Should you require even greater stopping power than is provided by the standard high-performance brake system , you can even option carbon-composite rotors . <p> Seated behind the small three-spoke wheel , the EQE 53 feels just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dial on the virtual instrument display even mimics a traditional rev-counter , while the column stalks and buttons are almost identical to those on a combustion-engine Merc . <p> All that 's missing on start-up -- and it 's a big miss -- is the engine noise , a welcome aural intrusion promising thrills aplenty that was ever integral to the AMG experience . As a form of compensation , a quick fiddle with the settings generates a spacey soundtrack in Sport and Sport+ modes whose volume and intensity rise and fall according to speed , and which can even be heard outside of the car . It is n't authentic and surely wo n't appeal to everyone , but as the notion of accelerating to -- and hurtling along at -- quite unfeasible velocities in almost total silence seems beyond weird , these sonic simulacra kind of work . Or at least they do for me . <p> The discreet flank badge indicate all-wheel drive <p> As for hurtling , that 's exactly what the EQE 53 does , with acceleration so immediate , sustained and rapid it threatens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it reaches 100km/h from a standstill in just 3.5 seconds , with Race Start shaving off a couple of extra tenths , while Dynamic Plus raises the maximum speed to an autobahn-only 240 ( though when tanking along at velocities such as those you can wave goodbye to achieving anything like the claimed range of 525km ) . Short bursts of overtaking acceleration are quite simply phenomenal , with the ESP software doing a fine job of keeping the car in a straight line as you flash past the slowcoaches . <p> Handling is , quite simply , staggering for what by any standards is a big and heavy car , partly thanks to the steerable rear wheels and partly because it feels so planted and stable on the road , with superb body control . The ride is excellent , too , even if you 've selected one of the firmer chassis settings , and the steering seems ideally weighted , neither too light nor heavy , perfectly direct and surprisingly communicative given the oodles of electronic mediation . It 's far more enjoyable to drive than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fun and involvement . <p> Inside the EQE 53 , expect the usual Mercedes standards of luxury and finish <p> Hilariously fast , hugely competent and as refined , comfortable and luxurious as anyone would expect a Mercedes to be , the AMG EQE 53 4MATIC+ is undoubtedly among the best EVs you can buy -- and , purely as a driver 's car , it 's way better than the same company 's EQS 450 that I raved about early last year . Whether its superlative performance and sparkling dynamic qualities mean it 's an echt AMG , though , is another matter entirely . Although loving almost every minute behind the wheel -- to the extent of grinning stupidly throughout most of the experience -- I still find myself missing the full-throated roar of a V8 , which no amount of digital trickery can make up for , and the feeling I 'm in charge of a beast that will never be completely trainable . <p> If it 's visceral old-world thrills you 're after , AMG still has those aplenty in other models .

@@99574236 <h> Homme Couture : The Role of Menswear in High Fashion <p> At a time when glamour is a near- universal aspiration , what 's the role of menswear in high fashion ? Prestige finds out from two couturiers and a collector . <p> When Jordan-born Canadian fashion designer Rad Hourani presented the first-ever unisex collection at Paris haute couture week in 2013 , it was received with great scepticism . Austere in black and white , the suits , coats and functional blazers could be deconstructed and reconstructed into 14 different outfits , and were the antithesis of the " sweet confectionary " so typical of haute couture . " Rebellion , " was the general response , while Lauren Cochrane of The Guardian wrote : " Unisex is the logical conclusion of the ' boyfriend fit ' trend , even if a mainstream acceptance of men borrowing their partner 's clothes -- ' girlfriend fit ' , anyone ? -- is probably a long way off . " <p> What Cochrane probably did n't know was that in the late 1980s , when Tom Ford was working at Perry Ellis America ( most of whose clothes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on womenswear while visiting this city . Ford was so skinny at the time that he 'd fit a women 's size 8 perfectly and was thus able to instruct Perry Ellis 's suppliers on the adjustments they needed to make . ( Fast forward to today 's saturation of videos on Tik Tok of young men trying on dresses or posing in maid uniforms , though never quite matching the imagined elegance of Ford in a tight frock . ) <p> Twelve years later , when some 90 percent of haute couture garments are made for women , one wonders why Hourani 's iconoclastic collection did n't serve as a catalyst for couture houses to embrace menswear with a similar passion . And no , this is n't some Joe Rogan-esque rant about men or masculinity being under attack or the lack of male representation in fashion , but surely there 's a market for exquisite , made-to-order menswear that is n't a Savile Row suit ? <p> According to the Lebanese fashion designer and venerated bridal couturier Elie Saab , such a niche exists . " We officially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ autumn/winter 2022-23 fashion show , " he says . " It was the first time for the brand that haute couture pieces for men were shown on the catwalk , but it was n't the first time that I created menswear . I 've had male clients for a long time -- the demand is high and men also have a strong interest in haute couture . " Saab believes men want to feel sophisticated and make a statement too . <p> Haute couture , as we know , is also all about the experience : fittings , an opportunity to work closely with revered designers and unrivalled access to the industry 's most prestigious happenings . Swedish style sensation , couture collector and self- proclaimed creative dictator Fredrik Robertsson ( who was mistaken for Jared Leto at the 2022 Met Gala ) knows a thing or two about the expansive possibilities of couture ownership . " I love couture -- it 's wearable art , " he told Vogue , " and discussing ideas with my fashion idols who are creating cool looks for me is magical . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ male client for several haute couture brands , a rumour he 's since put to rest . He notes , though , that some houses are more progressive than others : for example , Jean Paul Gaultier , Viktor &amp; Rolf and Alexis Mabille all welcome him with open arms , while some more conservative brands are n't especially warm to the notion of , say , a man buying a dress . <p> Glamour , after all , knows no gender . Dolce &amp; Gabbana has included menswear in its made-to-order Alta Sartoria line since its launch in 2015 . Then there 's Balenciaga , whose recent return to the haute couture catwalk featured T-shirts , rubbery catsuits ( for gents as well as ladies ) , bomber jackets and hoodies , with approximately 50 percent of the collection being menswear -- and full credit to creative director Demna Gvasalia 's marketing prowess and , frankly , nerve , for introducing streetwear into the highest echelons of fashion .

( It was partly thanks to Piccioli , too , that fashionistas and fashionistos discovered Robertsson after he was spotted at a Valentino haute couture show in 2019 . ) <p> " I could n't have imagined a fashion house which did n't include all genres , " says Piccioli . " Having menswear collections was the least we could do at the time ; our challenge today is even more interesting , but it would n't have been possible without the richness coming from both imaginary scenarios . " <p> Although the designer does n't believe in gender separation in couture , nor does he think that the philosophy warrants the total abandonment of exquisite poet shirts and tailored-to-the-T trousers . The very idea of haute couture stretches beyond textiles . " The rituals and the process of haute couture are an exaltation of the human being -- they 're timeless , " he says . " And this non-belonging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a limitation , but instead an added value . Inclusivity and equality are n't just words , but actions that must be taken . I think that to cross gender borders , it 's a natural evolution of what we do through our job . " <p> Saab , who wo n't consider introducing a gender-fluid range , does n't find the notion of blurring genders all that enticing . " I like the difference between the male and female universes , " he says . " I prefer to separate them to make sure the outfits are n't too alike . I like to have a rhythm in a collection , otherwise , I find it boring . " Witness his spring 2023 haute couture range , the personification of sunshine itself , which features six menswear looks , each one shaped around tailoring and executed in alluring hues of champagne . A regal lace mantle strewn with golden threads and glitter , for instance , is like the partner of a sleeveless gown with a lattice- like corset and a gossamer skirt . <p> Not all themes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saab . " I 'm very careful when designing men 's pieces , " he says . " I do n't want them to look too feminine . The spirit of men must remain , and I always make sure to treat each menswear garment as if it 's to be worn by men . " <p> As fashion evolves , the need to make a statement remains a constant -- and haute couture is a means of communication beyond measure .

@@99597236 <h> How to end the Korean War forever <h> Kim Seong-Kon <p> SEOUL -- This year commemorates the 70th anniversary of the truce of the Korean War . Technically , the Korean War has not ended yet , and therefore the Korean people have been living in a state of suspension for the past 70 years . In the eyes of the electronic generation , it is as if the screen were stuck on " pause , " and could resume anytime when someone presses the " play " button again . Strangely , however , many Korean people seem to be oblivious of their precarious situation . <p> Such ignorance is dangerous and can lull us into a false sense of security . It is therefore of paramount importance that the tragic Korean War must end forever . For that purpose , two things are imperative . One is that we should end the still-ongoing scuffle between the left and the right in South Korea . Foreigners wonder how a country like South Korea , which faces the threat of North Korea directly , could have so many left-wing people . <p> Experts have pointed out that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment in South Korea . According to Cha Yun , Chairman of Chayun Public Relations , among the approximately 900,000 civilian casualties during the Korean War , 300,000 or 400,000 were executed under the charge of being communist collaborators . Some of them might be communist sympathizers , However , others might be innocent victims swept up by the ideological frenzy during the wartime . <p> Cha writes that the descendants of executed people , who have long harbored grudges and enmities as a family legacy , have naturally become pro-North Korea left-wing people . On the other side of the fence , there are descendants of those who were killed by the communists during the Korean War . Unsurprisingly , they have become anti-North Korea right-wing people . Chairman Cha worries that unless South Koreans put down the past rancor derived from the ideological clash of the 1950s , the Korean War would never end . <p> In order to end the Korean War permanently , therefore , we should bury the hatchet and stop the chronic ideological warfare in South Korea . This means that we should seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with conservatives , and Marxists with capitalists . Otherwise , we will be vulnerable to the aggressions of North Korea that has armed itself with nuclear missiles . If divided internally , we are likely to end up conquered by outside forces . <p> Second , we should have a strong military to defend our country from any foreign aggression . For example , we should have the capability of not only shooting down incoming missiles , but also striking the missile bases even before our enemy launches one . With the help of US nuclear powered submarines and aircraft with cutting-edge technology , we should prove that we are an invincible military power , whether on air , sea , or land . Only then can we end the Korean War for good . <p> Some people naively believe that simply declaring the end of the war would literally end it . However , this is nothing but hollow rhetoric meant to be used as a pretext to pull out US troops from South Korea , and that is why our enemies want it so badly . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much . War can resume anytime , regardless of the official declaration of the end of war . It is as if you promised not to watch TV anymore , and then turn it on again later . <p> We should also remember that the situation of Ukraine or Taiwan is strikingly similar to ours . Consider that these two countries are each confronting a claim from a bigger country that they formerly belonged to it . South Korea , too , is likely to face a similar claim by her aggressive neighboring countries , especially if the international community validates such claims on Ukraine and Taiwan . It would therefore be naive and wrong to assume that the crisis in Ukraine and Taiwan has nothing to do with us . <p> We should also remember that when the Korean War broke out , 21 countries sent troops and medical units to a country most of their citizens had barely heard of . <p> Thanks to their invaluable and timely help , we were able to overcome unprecedented ordeals and build an affluent country . Likewise , we , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> We have the obligation to return the favor we received during and after the Korean War . <p> We no longer want to live a suspended life under the name of a " truce " that can be shattered at any time . We do not want the hollow declaration of the end of war , either . In order to end the Korea War , we need things that are more substantial . <p> For that purpose , we should stop ideological battles and political vengeance in our society . We also should build a strong military power so no countries would dare to provoke us . Only then , can we put an end to the Korean War for good . <p> Kim Seong-kon is a professor emeritus of English at Seoul National University and a visiting scholar at Dartmouth College .

Even after setting , the sun lingers below the horizon , casting a glow over the rocky coastal landscape . On sun-drenched days , when the skies are as blue as the ocean , one can admire Greenland 's striking mountains . Their jagged summits contrast with the smoothness of their lower slopes , fjords shaped by the relentless force of ancient ice sheets .

In 2022 , Greenland marked its 25th consecutive year of ice loss , accompanied by " unprecedented late-season melt events . " On September 3 , more than a third of the ice sheet 's surface -- including Summit Station , a research camp near the ice sheet 's apex -- experienced melting conditions . A year before , in August 2021 , Summit Station documented its first-ever recorded rainfall , although it was impossible to say exactly how much it received , owing to the absence of rain gauges at such high altitudes . <p> Greenland 's accelerating rate of ice loss is projected to exceed that of any period during the Holocene , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is compelling evidence that the western portion of the Greenland Ice Sheet is growing increasingly unstable , edging toward a tipping point beyond which its dynamics and structure fundamentally and irreversibly shift . <p> In fact , scientists may have underestimated how sensitive glaciers are to global warming , which means that the tipping point may be reached sooner than we think . My own research shows that ice loss has been reshaping the ice sheet 's margins and the Greenland coast , altering glacier speeds and rerouting the flows of ice , water , and sediment . These changes , in turn , influence the ice sheet 's response to future temperature increases . <h> " <p> The message from Greenland is clear : ice will not negotiate . <p> On my recent visit to Nuuk , I continued work on the QGreenland project , building a geospatial data tool for researchers and educators interested in exploring Greenland and learning about the scientific research taking place there .

If temperatures rise by 2-3 ? C , the Greenland and West Antarctic Ice Sheets could be lost " almost completely and irreversibly over multiple millennia , " causing several meters of sea-level rise .

The stand off centred on a refusal by developing nations to accept a proposal by the European Union to include an agenda item on the so-called " mitigation work programme " ( MWP ) , which had been agreed at COP26 in recognition that mitigation needed to be scaled up . <p> MWP discussions at Bonn were supposed to focus on the just transition , but a meeting held ahead of the talks saw no mention of fossil fuels , only renewable energy , energy efficiency and electrical grids , according to Tom Evans , policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effectively saw this as a lack of focus on the just transition . <p> In return , developed countries refused to include a proposal put forward by Bolivia , on behalf of the Like-Minded Developing Countries ( LMDC ) negotiating bloc , to urgently scale up financial support from developed country parties , without which they argued they could not pay for the fight against climate change , for example , by installing renewable energy . <p> Days of dispute led to a desperate plea by Nabeel Munir , the Pakistani co-chair of the conference , who begged negotiators to " please , wake up " to the climate impacts under way , reminding them of the devastating floods in Pakistan in 2022 , which saw one-third of the country inundated . <p> " I know that not one of you is willing to go back to your country and tell your people that while everything is happening as it is , you were fighting over an agenda for two weeks , " he said , comparing delegates to " primary school children " . <h> " <p> The lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much they have mobilised in just the last few years to support Ukraine and respond to Covid-19 . When they really want to , they can deliver billions . <p> Mohamed Adow , director , Power Shift Africa <p> The agenda was only adopted after both requested additions to it were dropped , and negotiators agreed that the co-chairs would produce a note on the discussions to inform COP28 , where both finance issues and the mitigation work programme will formally be on the agenda . <p> At COP27 , countries including India , the EU and US were pushing for a fossil fuel phase down , while others wanted a commitment to a total phase out . Though this ultimately failed , many want discussions at COP28 to pick up where these left off . <p> The fight over the agenda was a response to pressure from campaigners and countries to have a clear outcome on fossil fuel phase out at COP28 , Evans said . <p> " We have n't had enough space in Bonn to be able to move that forward . With six months to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel phase out are one-nil down . There are a lot of questions as to how we turn this round on the road to COP28 , " he said . <h> Vision lacking <p> Many had hoped that the incoming United Arab Emirates COP28 presidency would use Bonn to set out its vision for the outcome of COP28 . The summit 's president Sultan Al Jaber , who is also chief executive of Dubai 's state-owned Abu Dhabi National Oil Company ( ADNOC ) , was in Bonn for two days , and gave neither a speech to the plenary nor a press conference . He did meet with several groups in private , according to Alden Meyer , senior associate at E3G . <p> Al Jaber 's lack of visible engagement in Bonn was a " missed opportunity " , Meyer said . " Traditionally , the session in Bonn is when the new presidency starts to take the reins . <p> " We 're calling on the presidency to shift out of listening mode and into action -- share a vision and share some objectives , try to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell a meeting of the heads of delegations that a fossil fuel phase down was " inevitable " . Though his statement lacked any deadlines or plans , his words contrasted with those at the Petersberg Climate Dialogue in May , where he said that the world needed to reduce " fossil fuel emissions " , which was interpreted by many including former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres as an endorsement of carbon capture and storage . <h> Taking stock <p> Bonn also saw the final of three sets of technical talks on the Global Stocktake . The talks are intended to feed into a report in early September , which will detail progress on dealing with climate change in terms of mitigation , adaptation and finance . This will inform the political phase of the stocktake at COP28 . <p> The final format of the outcome of the stocktake is yet to be decided , but could comprise an official " cover decision " of the COP , negotiated by all parties , to set out how the findings of the stocktake will be taken forward . There could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming out of the G7 and G20 meetings . <p> However , countries failed to agree on how to frame issues around finance and support in the report , which means waiting until COP28 to agree on the final structure and political outcome . <p> David Waskow , international climate director at the World Resources Institute , said : " With the Global Stocktake now formally shifting from the technical to political phase , the UAE COP Presidency must play a central role in building trust , bridging differences , and spurring ambition so that COP28 delivers what is needed -- a rapid response plan to tackle the climate crisis . This opportunity at Dubai can not be squandered . " <p> Mohamed Adow , director of think-tank Power Shift Africa , took to Twitter to lambast rich nation 's broken promises on climate finance , saying that poor countries had signed up to the Paris Agreement " in good faith " after the rich world promised to fund the transition . <p> He posted : " The lack of finance from rich countries is particularly shameful considering how much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support Ukraine and respond to Covid-19 .

@@99741238 <h> Accelerating the energy transition might be high on the agendas of Asian governments , but at this week 's Energy Asia conference held in Malaysia 's capital , oil majors are outrightly saying the world needs more of the fossil fuel . <p> The oil industry faces chronic underinvestment due to a combination of industry downturns , the pandemic and an increasing focus on environmental , social and governance , said Haitham Al Ghais , secretary general of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries . Image : Energy Asia <p> It was to meant be a three-day conference bringing together policymakers and industry professionals to discuss how Asia can drive the energy transition , but conversations at Energy Asia 2023 have so far been dominated by oil majors who are defending their plans to expand investments in the upstream production of fossil fuels . <p> Setting the tone was the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries ( OPEC ) . " The world needs more oil , not less , alongside reducing emissions , " said Haithan Al Ghais , secretary general of the price-setting cartel in his opening remarks at the conference held in Kuala Lumpur from Monday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " significantly investing " in renewable energy , oil will remain " an integral part " of the energy mix , said Al Ghais . " Every data-based forecast that I have seen shows that oil is irreplaceable for the foreseeable future . " <p> The organisation expects oil to represent the largest share of the global energy mix by 2045 at 29 per cent , which would require a " massive energy expansion , " said Al Ghais . According to OPEC data , this would involve an increase of oil production to 100.6 million barrels of oil equivalent a day ( mobe/d ) compared to 88.3 mobe/d in 2021 . <p> This view was echoed by Saudi Arabian state oil producer Saudi Aramco , whose president and chief executive officer Amin H Nasser pointed to continued healthy demand for oil from developing countries . Oil demand growth is at more than 2 million barrels per day , which is " high by historical standards , " he said . <p> The comments stand in stark contrast to warnings against further fossil fuel expansion . In March , United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuel firms to stop all licensing or funding of new oil and gas as well as any expansion of existing oil and gas reserves . It echoes previous statements made by the International Energy Agency , which said that huge declines in the use of coal , oil and gas are required in order for the world to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 , and to prevent a climate catastrophe . <p> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change ( IPCC ) , in its latest report , said that greenhouse gases produced by existing oil and gas infrastructure is more than enough to push the world beyond the 1.5 degree Celsius tipping point for global warming . <p> At the conference , industry leaders representing fossil fuel interests say Asia is witnessing rapid economic growth and its population is booming -- trends that will drive energy demand in the coming years . There is , hence , a disproportionate need for developing countries in the region to rely on oil as a secure and affordable energy source , they say . <p> Daniel Yergin , vice chairman at commodities market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue to be a major part of global energy sypply , even as the overall energy mix changes . <p> Prime minister of Malaysia Anwar Ibrahim , in his keynote speech , said : " Affordability remains a key concern , particularly for parts of developing Asia , where people are not looking too far into the future , but might simply be struggling to pay the bills or put food on the table daily . " <p> He added that lowering carbon emissions should not come at the expense of economic growth , or vice versa . Alongside the need to transition to clean energy , Malaysia must also ensure that its existing policies of alleviating poverty and providing quality education , healthcare and infrastructure are not compromised , said Anwar . The country is the second largest producer of oil and gas in Southeast Asia . <p> Anwar also stressed the importance of natural gas in Malaysia 's energy mix as the country transitions towards less carbon-intensive sources of energy . Gas remains Malaysia 's most significant energy feedstock and will act as a " stabilising factor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cleaner alternative fuels such as hydrogen and ammonia , at least over the next 20 to 25 years , said Malaysian economy minister Rafizi Ramli . <p> Coal-dependent Indonesia is exploring a similar pathway towards renewable energy that is first supported by liquified natural gas , prior to transitioning to renewable energies , said its minister of energy and natural resources Arifin Tasrif . He estimated that Indonesia has the potential to produce some 3,000 gigawatts of renewable energy , mostly via solar , but it requires mining of minerals and cooperation from financial institution and businesses to produce the relevant infrastructure . <p> " Countries in Asia are not climate deniers . In fact , we are showing positive signs of embracing the energy transition . But we need to move at a different pace , " Anwar said . <h> ' Energy chaos ' <p> " For oil , we have heard appeals over the last year or so for producing countries to play a key role in ensuring stable and sustainable global energy supplies . At the same time , however , we have also constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences simply do not fit together , " he said . <p> " Talk of no new investments in oil projects will only lead to energy chaos . We need energy clarity , not energy chaos . " <h> " <p> We do n't want to create energy chaos , but we also do n't want to create climate chaos . <p> Peter Bakker , president and chief executive officer of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development <p> Malaysia 's national oil company Petronas has seen financial institutions reject even their requests to fund research and development efforts into emissions reduction , said its chief executive officer Tengku Muhammad Taufik . <p> For instance , banks have turned away from financing carbon capture and storage solutions , calling it the industry 's " excuse to legitimise continuing the production of fossil fuels , " said Taufik , voicing frustration at fossil fuel companies being seen as " the root cause of all evil when it comes to emissions reduction " . <p> " We heard as early as the 26th UN Conference of Parties ( COP26 ) that US$130 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero ( GFANZ ) . Not much has been heard since by way of disbursement , " he said . <p> " Conversely , redirecting that money to renewables , a space where policy frameworks are n't mature , face a risk premium in emerging economies where there is no track record . So where does that leave us ? " asked Taufik . " I hazard a guess that national oil companies will be forced to make a choice between energy security and affordability , and we will make sure it 's affordable and secure first , rather than ( focus on ) the energy transition . " <p> Taufik called on financial institutions including multilateral development banks to reconsider their role in financing the energy transition and explore opportunities for blended finance . " The central discourse is dominated by idealists without energy literacy , and that 's stopping the financial reform , " he said . <p> National oil companies are likely to choose energy security and affordability over the transition if investments continue to dwindle , said Tengku Muhammad Taufik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm Petronas ( second from left ) . Image : Energy Asia <p> Oil companies have chosen instead to reinvest in their own businesses . Saudi Aramco is continuing to invest in its upstream business to " help respond to the worrying global underinvestment in oil and gas , " said Nasser . At the same time , the company is intensifying efforts to reduce its relatively low upstream carbon intensity and looking into low-carbon energy products including hydrogen , ammonia and methanol . <p> " Our strategies ... also acknowledge the need for a material transition , including non-combustible uses of oil and gas in more sustainable materials that are the building blocks of modern life , " he said . <p> French energy giant TotalEnergies pours US$12 billion a year into oil and gas , including new greenfield projects . " In this industry , if we do n't invest ( in new assets ) there is a natural decline of 4 per cent a year ( in production ) , " he said . <p> At the same time , it invests US$5 billion every year in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " given the priority now is to find the right assets and talents to grow the industry . <p> " There is no way we can stop investing in our existing ( fossil fuel-driven ) system as long as we have n't built up the new ( renewable energy ) system , " he said . On top of that , continued investments into oil production are necessary to stabilise prices and avert consumer anger , said Pouyanne . <p> But the fossil fuels industry can not run from its responsibility to decarbonise , said Peter Bakker , president and chief executive officer of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development . In response to Al Ghais ' comment on energy chaos , he said " We do n't want to create energy chaos , but we also do n't want to create climate chaos . " <p> In developing regions such as Asia where infrastructure is being installed at a slower pace compared to developed markets , the innovation opportunity for new technologies should be much bigger , said Bakker . <p> " If oil and gas comes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( which include direct and indirect emissions ) , it 's going to be disqualified as not ambitious enough , " he said . " They have to engage in Scope 3 emissions ( those not controlled or owned by the company ) , which is the demand side of the equation , particularly the hard-to-abate emissions . " <p> The COP28 conference will convene world leaders to work towards global climate goals , including addressing greenhouse emissions , in December this year . It is being held in oil-rich United Arab Emirates and the conference 's president , who also heads the country 's state-owned oil company ADNOC , has been criticised for failing to prepare for meaningful climate action at the conference . <p> Another important step for fossil fuel producers and businesses is the adoption of international standards for climate-related disclosures , in particular the newly launched standards by the International Sustainability Standards Board ( ISSB ) , added Bakker . This would improve the availability of comparable , materiality-based data points that capital markets and credit ratings agencies can use to assess companies , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barsky 's appointment comes three months after StanChart revealed it would be drawing up new targets to reduce its emissions from the oil and gas sector , driven by new chief sustainability officer Marisa Drew .

She is based in Singapore and will report to the bank 's chief sustainability officer Marisa Drew . <p> In 2021 , StanChart , which has a strong focus on emerging markets , had committed to cutting the emissions from its lending portfolio to net-zero by 2050 , with interim targets to reduce financed emissions for thermal coal mining , oil and gas , and power by 2030 and mobilise US$300 billion in green finance by the end of the decade . <p> The bank , however , faced scrutiny in January last year for undermining its decarbonisation commitments by financing fossil fuels projects , including a fossil gas plant in Western Australia . <p> Barsky 's role will involve overseeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustainability integration across the group , building relationships across the public and private sectors , and boosting engagement with civic society .

@@102785230 <p> The art of storytelling in video games has come a long way since the days of text adventures ; there 's just something about a gripping tale that lasts long in the memories , helped by the fact that modern games can often augment great writing with visuals that match . Insomniac Games ' latest Marvel 's Spider-Man 2 is the latest example , delivering a riveting story from start to finish , matched by its exemplary animation throughout gameplay and cinematics . <p> To find out just how that was made possible , Geek Culture sat down with two integral members of the team to talk all things animation , and we came away more impressed than before . <p> " I think video games are the area of media right now that is taking huge , huge leaps in terms of technology and quality . On the cinematics team , we 're making multiple movies . And we approach it in the same way that we would approach storytelling in film and that 's why the quality of our games is so good , in my opinion , " said Lindsay Thompson , Associate Animation Director @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , video games have always been a thing that I played to see the next level , to see the arts , to see how it was progressing ; we want to get people to the point where they cry . It 's so much more meaningful to care about what you are swinging for . We did n't start out great at it , and I feel like we 're earning our place in storytelling in this medium , and we 're very proud and we 're determined to get better , " added Robert Coddington , Senior Director of Animation . <p> All of that belief and hard work are evident in every moment of Marvel 's Spider-Man 2 , be it with Peter Parker and Miles Morales , the likes of Venom and Kraven , or even the living , breathing city of New York . But first , let 's talk about the Friendly Neighbourhood Spider-Men , the stars of the show essentially . <p> What makes either Spider-Man who they are in this world ? For starters , " even though they 're on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they 're going to be next , " said Coddington . Peter might be more experienced , but he is still struggling with life post-Aunt May , and the growing Miles may be more assured , but he is still a teenager moving on to the next stage of life . It makes relating to the pair much easier for players in those same scenarios , something that the team wants you to feel more naturally . <p> " I think the most important thing was telling the human story that I think we can all see a little bit of ourselves in both of the heroes . Even though I 'm not a man , I 'm not a spider or superhero , all these things , but I still relate to Miles ' struggles and I still relate to Pete 's because that 's the point of playing a game . You 're Spider-Man , " Thompson chimed in . <p> That same kind of love and attention to detail also extend to the villains , with Kraven and Venom being the standout characters that players will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While the team had the benefit of researching actual lizard movement to make that character more lifelike , it 's not the same when it 's an alien lifeform or big-game hunter . <p> The latter was born of two complementary parts , the excellent writing , as well as the acting chops of Jim Pirri , who simply " came in and showed up as Kraven . " Having all that knowledge of the backstory , emotions , and motivations involved made it easier for Pirri to embody the character , and in turn , allow the animation team to truly bring the villain to life . <p> " As animators , cinematographers , and editors , we want to bring the power of that storytelling , show it in the best light possible , and make sure that the emotional moments are connecting . Our job is a lot easier when the performance is that good , " Coddington said . <p> As for the symbiote , it all started with the combat team trying to map out how it works in conflict , and subsequently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything coalesced together in harmony , be it for gameplay or storytelling . It 's one thing working with actors to form a character , but it 's harder when it 's a unique lifeform that does n't necessarily play by natural rules . Thank goodness for a seasoned team at the helm . <p> " As animators , our job is how do we make this more human ? How do we make this more animalistic ? The cool thing about being an animator is you 're forever a student of motion , existence , emotion and observing everything around you . We came into this project , knowing somewhat what we 're doing , but also having the cast that 's been with us for so long , they embody the character , " shared Thompson . <p> " So we 're getting to jump into deeper emotions than we did in the first game where we were more just discovering who the characters are , even though there was a ton of emotion in that game . It feels like we were able to hit the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all of this storytelling and animation goodness in Spider-Man 2 will unfold in a revamped New York City of sorts , a game world that is now two times bigger than before , which presents another challenge for the team to immerse players from moment to moment . <p> " The cool thing about video games is storytelling is everywhere . You can walk anywhere ; you can go anywhere in an open-world game like ours ; there are stories to be told . On the streets , there are interactions to be had . You can kind of know what part of town you are in based on the activities that are happening there or what 's going on . " <p> " And that 's the kind of stuff that was building off of Spider-Man and Miles Morales and now this game , we could just expand and it 's really fun for us who are kind of maybe stuck in cinematics world , this whole game to then go in and play the game and discover all this stuff ourselves . And it 's just bringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And so bringing that city to life takes a whole team ; it 's a massive endeavour . " <p> As for Coddington , he explained that " in this game , we really tried to level things up . Whether it 's people actually being inside those glass skyscrapers , or if you go into a place like Emily-May Foundation and it 's alive and there are lots of vignettes of people living in that space . We really tried to take it seriously and make you believe it . " <p> Needless to say , the effort of the Insomniac team has certainly paid off , with Marvel 's Spider-Man 2 receiving critical acclaim from the gaming media . We definitely loved our time with Peter Parker , Miles Morales , and everyone else in the adventure , and players will be able to as well now that the game has officially launched .

@@102785231 <h> Geek Review : Killers of the Flower Moon <p> The exploration of the human psyche has been the foundation of director Martin Scorsese cinematic repertoire , and while it can be often times masked in tales of crime and the mafia , the Italian auteur 's brand of drama comes from studying greed , guilt and possibly , redemption against the backdrop of violence , corruption and more decay . <p> His 25th feature , Killers of the Flower Moonembraces these themes wholeheartedly as Scorsese turns journalist David Grann 's nonfiction book Killers of the Flower Moon : The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI into a masterful and intimate film that peers into America 's dark history filled with greed , serial murder and racial injustice . <p> For those unaware of American history , the Osage Native Americans in Osage County were awarded land , only to discover oil and the period in the 1920s saw dozens of Osage Natives get murdered over the rights of the land they were legally owners of . Few were prosecuted for the murders and the few who were are depicted in this tale of greed , anchored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Lily Gladstone ) and William " King " Hale ( Robert De Niro ) . <p> Ernest is an infantry chef who comes to Fairfax to become a cab driver , where he lives with his Uncle King , a powerful local rancher with a longstanding connection and friendship with the Osage community . Mollie Brown is a wealthy Osage woman who , since the death of her father , is taking care of her sick elderly mother Lizzie Q ( Tantoo Cardinal ) and her sisters Anne ( Cara Jade Myers ) , Minnie ( Jillian Dion ) and Reta ( Janae Collins ) . <p> Ernest is a complex character who , despite his love for Mollie , enacts violence against members of the Osage community out of greed . Just like his uncle , he puts on the front of an ally whilst still holding onto racist ideas and beliefs . His allyship -- meaning his genuine love for his wife -- is the only redeeming quality , but his actions time and time again cause massive amounts of grief for his unknowing wife . Ernest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interesting line to tow that DiCaprio does so with ease . <p> De Niro , a frequent collaborator of Scorsese , is not a presence you can ignore . His King takes on the nickname quite literally , as he becomes an evil authoritarian and uses people as pawns to achieve his own goals -- including the people who call his family and friends . King knows no limit when it comes to greed . Regardless of his misdeeds and his evilness , King gets away easily thanks to his privilege as a white man and it 's frustrating to watch , particularly if you 're a non-White person watching Killers of the Flower Moon , because this is a reality all too familiar that has lasted the test of time . <p> Out of the three characters , Gladstone 's Mollie is a force to be reckoned with . Her portrayal of Mollie is beautifully haunting , where she 's smart , observant , strong and loyal both to her Osage heritage and to her husband . The epitome of a strong woman , Gladstone perhaps has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but delivers every word and sentence with great and lasting impact . With Mollie in a constant state of fear and grief , Gladstone 's wails and portrayal of a woman who has been wronged time and time again , is one that will ring in your ears even after the movie comes to an end . <p> But that 's also due to the presence of the soon-to-be 81-year-old director , who delivered classics including 1976 's Taxi Driver , 1990 's Goodfellas , and 2013 's Wolf of Wall Street . While every outing by Scorsese is fairly unique , this three-hour and 26-minute epic never lets go of the evils that permeated society in the US then . <p> Scorsese explores these difficult themes of violence and injustice of a marginalised group of people with great sensitivity . Not only do viewers get to feel and see the perspective of an Osage person , Scorsese does n't participate in voyeurism when it comes to depicting their deaths . When an Osage person is murdered , there is no room for any sort of interpretation as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence . These acts are incredibly difficult to watch and they happen ever so often ( as they really did in the 1920s ) , and he keeps focusing on so many , but is able to prevent us from feeling desensitised each time , and when an Osage native is killed , there 's the shock of how it continues to happen . <p> Killers of the Flower Moon is definitely directed at White audiences to sit and reflect on the violent history of the land they call home , and is a rather informational piece of media for those living outside of America . Rodrigo Prieto 's cinematography of the sweeping Osage land and close-ups of the characters ' bit of sweat , hair out of place , and even the various designs of the blankets Osage women wear on the back complement the storytelling and the impressive performance of the cast . <p> Perhaps , the only complaint would be Killers of the Flower Moon 's extensive runtime , which is both a reflection of the massive tale that Scorsese is trying to adapt , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violence in one seating that prevents you from taking a break . <p> Still , Killers of the Flower Moon does not disappoint and fans of Scorsese have more bragging rights for what a brilliant filmmaker he is . The cast 's performance is nomination worthy and the cinematography alone is breathtaking . But what will truly leave with viewers once they exit the theatres is the overwhelming sense of grief and enlightenment -- having learnt the truth of the Osage people , knowing that their stories will no longer be forgotten , even if we 'll never know who has benefitted from the violence over 100 years later <h> GEEK REVIEW SCORE <p> Summary <p> Martin Scorsese 's latest film , Killers of the Flower Moon , is a masterful and intimate film that peers into America 's dark history filled with greed , serial murder and racial injustice -- with a talented cast to back . <h> We 're geeks , &amp; proud of it ! <p> We are a collective bunch of geeks who love to share our passion with the rest of the world .

@@103793235 <p> SINGAPORE : Singapore , with its bustling population of over three million daily MRT commuters , is gearing up for a significant upgrade in its rail system . Singaporeans should look forward to more reliable MRT train rides from 2025 onwards with the upcoming Singapore Rail Testing Centre ( SRTC ) , set to be fully operational in 2025 . <p> On Friday , Nov 24 the Land Transport Authority ( LTA ) shared updates on the new Singapore Rail Testing Centre on their latest issue on CONNECT and on their Facebook page . The driving force behind the SRTC is the need for enhanced maintenance and testing protocols as the 260km rail network continues to expand . The current challenge is the limited time window for testing , given that trains run from 5.30 am to almost midnight . Additionally , the evaluation of new train models , often tested overseas , can take several years before reaching Singapore . The SRTC is poised to revolutionize this landscape . <p> One of the key advantages of the SRTC is its ability to conduct train testing around the clock , replicating actual operational conditions . This is made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more comprehensive testing away from main routes at any time of the day . <p> These tracks are designed to accommodate all types of signalling and communication systems , ensuring a seamless testing environment for new trains . <p> Phase 1 of the SRTC , featuring the completion of the high-speed test track ( HSTT ) , concluded in November . The first two Circle Line 6 ( CCL6 ) trains are already undergoing testing and commissioning on the HSTT . Phase 2 is set to follow and will include the construction of two additional test tracks and essential infrastructure , further expanding the testing capabilities of the centre . <p> A unique advantage of the SRTC is its ability to troubleshoot and rectify faults locally , not just for new lines and trains but also for existing MRT lines simultaneously . The comprehensive capabilities of the centre , coupled with a dedicated workshop for mid-life upgrading of trains , aim to keep the entire fleet in optimal condition . <p> The SRTC also serves as a collaborative hub for engineers , rail operators , and original equipment manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is anticipated to foster innovation and efficiency , particularly as more OEMs establish a presence in Singapore . <p> Sustainability is also a key focus of the SRTC , evident in its recent Green Mark Platinum certification from the Building and Construction Authority ( BCA ) .

@@103793237 <p> SINGAPORE : The option to make credit card minimum payments may seem like a financial lifeline , especially during times of temporary cash flow challenges . This alternative allows cardholders to maintain their privileges by settling a small upfront payment , along with interest charges on the outstanding balance , to be paid the following month . While this can help avoid late payment fees if paid promptly , there 's a critical downside that many may overlook . <p> According to SingSaver , paying just the minimum amount each month can quickly turn into a financial difficulty , particularly when it comes to the Total Debt Servicing Ratio ( TDSR ) . This ratio , affecting one 's ability to secure a mortgage or car loan , takes a hit when credit card minimum payments enter the picture . <h> What is TDSR ? <p> For those unfamiliar with TDSR , it 's a percentage of your monthly income , usually capped at 55% , allocated for repaying debts . When you carry a balance on your credit card , the minimum payment is subtracted from your TDSR .

However , the tricky part is in the details , as different banks employ distinct formulas for calculating this minimum . Referencing your credit card statement for the latest information is crucial . <h> Credit Card Minimum Payments in Singapore <p> The repercussions of paying only the minimum amount each month become clearer when delving into the mechanics of credit card interest . Credit cards typically charge around 28% per annum in interest , compounded daily . With a minimum payment of just 3% , this often means you 're primarily covering the interest charges , barely making a dent in the actual debt . <p> Here 's a list of the minimum credit card payments from various banks in Singapore according to SingSaver : <h> 1 . American Express <p> 3% of the outstanding amount or S$50 , whichever is greater . This includes overdue minimum payments , late payment charges , and any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For CIMB Visa Infinite/Signature and CIMB World/Platinum Mastercard cards , it 's the higher of 3% of the outstanding balance or S$50 , plus any outstanding overdue amount from the previous statement . <p> For AWSM card , it 's the higher of 3% of the outstanding balance or S$15 , plus any outstanding overdue amount from the previous statement . <h> 3 .

Duterte is also witnessing several of his contentious moves backfire against him , and even haunt him . <p> First , the flagship policy of the Duterte administration was its promise to rid the country of the drug menace through its war on drugs . The Philippine National Police acknowledged that 6,000 died in its hands , but human rights organizations estimate that up to 27,000 to 30,000 fell victim to state-sponsored extrajudicial killings . Hundreds of thousands suffered from various forms of human rights violations such as illegal arrests and unlawful detention . Word on the ground is that the drug menace is back with a vengeance , showing that the war on drugs merely provided a band-aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drug menace . While drug-related killings still persist under President Marcos , there has been a pivot from the savage violence and vicious rhetoric of Duterte . <p> Second , under the Duterte administration , our country made a major foreign policy pivot by spurning our long-time ally , the United States , and we embraced instead the Asian hegemon , China . The turnaround was supposedly taken to mollify and befriend China , in order for the latter to pour in huge investments in our country , allow our fishermen to fish in our exclusive economic zone , and tone down China 's hostile behavior against us in the West Philippine Sea . None of the objectives was attained . In particular , we received a pittance from the promised Chinese investments . Under the new administration , we have shifted back to our old alliance with the US . <p> Third , the Duterte administration trained its guns on activist and leftist groups , after its war on drugs sputtered . Extrajudicial killings , illegal arrests and detention , and threats of persecution intensified against activists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were spent in anti-communists initiatives . Just recently , however , the Marcos administration has issued an amnesty to communist rebels , and has signed an agreement with the communist movement for the resumption of peace talks . This is a complete change of course from the Duterte administration 's scorched-earth policy against the communist movement . This also pulls the rug under Vice President Sara Duterte 's flagship anti-communist initiatives . <p> Fourth , Duterte persecuted the opposition and the independent media . He deprived then Vice President Leni Robredo of reasonable funds for her office and intermittently mistreated her . Then Sen. Leila De Lima was imprisoned on trumped-up charges . Rappler and the Philippine Daily Inquirer were harassed . The opposition was silenced with threats or its members were co-opted . Now , facing hostile moves from the Marcos administration , Duterte now complains of the absence of opposition forces with a tone of yearning for help from the opposition forces he mistreated . <p> Fifth , Duterte spoiled military and police forces with extravagant salaries and retirement benefits . It was viewed as Duterte 's insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the military coup he has allegedly stirred up , nipped in the bud , Duterte 's pampering of the military has failed to yield the security dividends he had expected . <p> Sixth , Duterte caused our country 's withdrawal from the International Criminal Court ( ICC ) . It was a scheme to shield himself from ICC prosecution . But the withdrawal has not stopped the ICC investigation , and the current administration has turned around by announcing that it 's open to consider cooperation with the ICC . The Marcos administration is now even mulling over the possibility of rejoining the ICC . <p> Seventh , the Duterte administration allowed the remains of the late president Ferdinand Marcos Sr. to be buried in the Libingan ng mga Bayani . Despite protests , Duterte allowed the old man 's remains to be buried in our cemetery for our heroes . It was a long wish finally granted to the Marcos family . But the debt of gratitude engendered was canceled out by Duterte 's open contempt for the younger Marcos whom he belittled with scornful names . Unfortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet under the ground , while the young Marcos he belittled now sits in Malaca ? ang . <p> The Duterte administration 's policies and advocacies which are now being reversed or ignored by the Marcos administration share one thing in common .
