Teachers in Los Angeles , whose 640,000 students make it the nation 's second-largest school district , are ready to strike Thursday , Jan. 10 , over a contract dispute that follows teacher walkouts in other states that emboldened organized labor after a critical defeat at the U.S. Supreme Court . ( AP Photo/Jae C. Hong ) <p> United Teachers Los Angeles said its 35,000 members would walk off the job for the first time in 30 years if a deal is n't reached on higher pay and smaller class sizes . The Los Angeles Unified School District says the union 's demands could bankrupt the school system , which is projecting a half-billion-dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments and health coverage for retired teachers . <p> Negotiations are continuing , but little progress is evident . The two sides rejected Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti 's offer to broker a deal . <p> Thousands of teachers took to the streets of downtown Los Angeles last month to demand a new contract . They wore red shirts , banged drums and carried signs that read " Stand With LA Teachers ! " as they marched . <p> They are hoping to build on the " Red4Ed " movement that began last year in West Virginia , where a strike resulted in a raise . It moved to Oklahoma , Kentucky , Arizona , Colorado and Washington state , spreading from conservative states with " right to work " laws that limit the ability to strike to the more liberal West Coast with strong unions . <p> " What you 're seeing with unions is real enthusiasm and a belief that you can actually be successful , " said Robert Bruno , a professor of labor and employment relations at the University of Illinois . " The educational sector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's now a sense that you can actually win . " <p> " Each state is different , but the commonality across all states is teachers , and parents are sick of schools not being invested in , " he said . <p> But unlike other states , schools will stay open if a strike happens . The district has hired hundreds of substitutes to replace teachers and others who leave for picket lines . The union said it 's " irresponsible " to hire substitutes and called on parents to consider keeping students home or join the marchers if a strike goes forward . <p> It comes as unions are stinging from a Supreme Court ruling last year that said government workers ca n't be required to join unions and pay dues . <p> Larry Sand , a retired Los Angeles and New York City teacher who heads the California Teachers Empowerment Network , said he believes the Los Angeles union sees its showdown with the district as a public " sales pitch " for organized labor now that teachers have a choice about joining . <p> Sand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers and the public , said overly generous benefits for teachers in the past have overburdened the district . <p> Teachers earn between $44,000 and $86,000 a year depending on their education and experience , according to the Los Angeles County Office of Education . The district says the average teacher salary is $75,000 , which reflects the older , more experienced workforce . <p> The district has offered a 6 percent raise over the first two years of a three-year contract . The union wants a 6.5 percent hike at the start of a two-year contract . Health care fully paid by the district and a pension plan would be unchanged under both proposals . <p> The union also wants significantly smaller class sizes , which routinely top 30 students , and more nurses , librarians and counselors to " fully staff " the district 's campuses in Los Angeles and all or parts of 31 smaller cities , plus several unincorporated areas . <p> The union argues that the district is hoarding reserves of $1.8 billion that could be used to fund the pay and staffing hikes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits and other expenses . <p> Schools Superintendent Austin Beutner , an investment banker and former Los Angeles deputy mayor without experience in education , has become a lightning rod in negotiations . <p> The union says Beutner and school board members who voted him in are trying to privatize the district , encouraging school closures and flipping public schools into charters . Charter schools are privately operated public schools that compete for students and the funds they bring in . <p> Beutner , who attended public school , has said his plan to reorganize the district would improve services to students and families . He and his supporters on the board envision an education system with a " portfolio approach " -- public and charter schools under the same leadership . <p> Sand of the California Teachers Empowerment Network said Beutner is " the right man for the job " because his business background gives him an understanding that " there 's a bottom line that has to be acknowledged . " <p> Both sides say they do n't want a strike , but John Rogers , a professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , said one seems inevitable . <p> " I would be surprised if a strike does n't come about , because I think each side has a real interest in demonstrating the dominance of their positions , " Rogers said .

Rappler comes from the root words " rap " ( to discuss ) + " ripple " ( to make waves ) . <p> Since everybody including their mothers weighed in on Foreign Secretary Teddyboy Locsin 's rather colorful statement that the past passport contractor has " made off " with our passport data , I could not help but join the fray myself to help make sense of the issue . <p> I will focus on these points : ( 1 ) what we know ; ( 2 ) what we do n't know ; ( 3 ) what could be problematic ; and ( 4 ) what can be done in relation to the Department of Foreign Affairs ( DFA ) data fiasco . <p> First off , I am calling this a fiasco because it is not a leak -- at least not yet . In the world of data and information management , a leak happens when somebody who has no access authority gains access to data . <p> It does not seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passport contractor was precisely that : an entity that was -- for a particular period -- contractually allowed to access and process data on behalf of the DFA . <p> In fact , Locsin himself said the data is " useless " to the contractor . <p> I am hoping that this means there is a clause at least in the contract between the DFA and that contractor which restricts the latter 's use of that data purely to the purpose they were contracted for . <p> If that is the case , people who applied for passports during the period they were working with DFA are at least protected from having their personal data suddenly peddled in the black market , where the voter registration data also reportedly ended . <p> Further , if you are a self-respecting professionally-managed private IT organization that thinks strategically , you will not want a data leak on your record . Not if you want other contracts in the future . <p> So , I may be wrong , but I am guessing that the contractor here probably has at least some legal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The only reason why this became an issue , to begin with , is because people who applied for passports under the old systems will need to bring their birth certificates again to apply for passport renewal . <p> This means that while the contractor can not legally use the data for other purposes , DFA unfortunately also could not use the data the contractor collected . <p> This could be because ( a ) there is no clause in the contract that obliges that entity to turn over the data ; or ( b ) the data is sitting in a defunct server somewhere but nothing requires the contractor to make it available to the DFA in a format that allows importing to another system . <p> I am not a lawyer but I have examined quite a number of contracts involving use of data . And " made off with the data " is not a term you usually use in data contracts . It is also not something IT persons would generally use when describing the status of data sets . <p> I would be interested to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say about what actually happened and what the status of affairs are . It is entirely possible that they do have the data in some format in some defunct systems or servers but it is probably in a proprietary format . <p> In my quest for various public interest-imbued data sets from various government agencies , I have come across instances when this precisely happened . <p> Why does it happen ? Lack of foresight for one . Some negotiator on government 's behalf failed to consider exit scenarios . People forget all the time na walang forever ( there is no forever ) . You may be happy with a service now but at some point you may want a better system , or a cheaper one . <p> If you fail to prepare for that eventuality , you 're screwed . <p> It 's like putting all your eggs ( data and workflows ) in Apple 's proprietary systems and realizing later that this means you are stuck with outdated technology . ( Or closed systems that Apple controls so that they can sell you more products . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How do you prevent these things from happening again ? <p> First off , if this has not happened yet , key agencies seriously need to come together to come up with standards . The Department of Information and Communications Technology ( DICT ) should be leading this effort . By the way , this is also why you need to make sure that the DICT secretary has expertise on the latest information technologies . ( READ : DICT no more ? Sotto hints Honasan may be appointed to another agency ) <p> This is essential because it is not just the DFA that houses data about the public . There 's Philhealth , SSS , GSIS , PSA . The list goes on . Heaven help us if our pension records get hostaged in a defunct , unusable system somewhere or stuck in litigation over contractual disputes . <p> Provisions for exit scenarios should be in the bid requirements for outsourced data services from the get go . <p> If it is not , maybe this is something legislators will need to consider legislating about -- just so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost sure will happen because of the uproar over this fiasco , will come up with something useful . <p> Government lawyers will need to work closely with experts in the IT sector to craft standard clauses that are required of contracts for government information systems . <p> Finally , this major oversight is bound to happen in government entities . It is almost inevitable . Why ? Because this is a question of competence . I would not go to the point of calling this a corruption case yet . <p> There are a lot of well-meaning and dedicated people in government . I consider myself fortunate to have met some of them . But dedicated or not , well-meaning or not , many IT people in government lack the skills necessary to implement and negotiate professional IT systems . And I do not mean to say this to disparage them . <p> Unfortunately , salary structures make it hard for government to retain talent . Ability to do due diligence and appreciate contracts , particularly IT contracts , is a skill . Ability to foresee and plan for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , would be competent in assessing or drafting contracts that involve data , IT systems , copyright , etc .

@@70423238 <h> Conflict on the irrevocability rule <h> Taxwise Or Otherwise <p> By Archie D. Guevarra <p> One of the well-established doctrines in the legal practice is stare decisis -- a Latin term for " to stand by things decided " . It is based on the principle that once a question of law has been examined and decided , it should be deemed settled and closed from further argument . As aptly discussed by then Chief Justice Reynato Puno , there are two types of stare decisis : vertical and horizontal . The first pertains to the duty of lower courts to apply the decisions of the higher courts to cases involving the same facts , while the second requires that the high court must follow its own precedents . The application of stare decisis is a bar to any attempt to re-litigate the same issues , necessary for two simple reasons , i.e. economy and stability . <p> On March 7 , 2018 , the Supreme Court 's Third Division , through the ponencia of Justice Samuel Martires , settled a novel issue on the irrevocability of the option to refund by the taxpayer . The Court held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tax Code only applies to the carryover option and not to the refund option . Although the taxpayer initially elected the refund option in its annual income tax return ( ITR ) , the subsequent carryover it made the following year effectively abandoned its refund claim from the government . The Court explained that the last sentence of Section 76 of the Tax Code unmistakably discloses that the irrevocable option refers only to the carryover option . <p> In a complete turnaround in a separate case on Aug. 1 , 2018 , the same division of the Supreme Court rendered a new ruling that appears to contradict its earlier pronouncement . Through the ponencia of incumbent Chief Justice Lucas Bersamin , the Court took the position that once elected , the option to refund is already irrevocable regardless of the subsequent carryover by the taxpayer . The Court held that the Court of Tax Appeals misappreciated the fact that the taxpayer already exercised the option to refund its unutilized creditable withholding tax for the year 2005 when it filed its annual ITR . It went on to explain that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxpayer , which are : ( 1 ) the refund must be filed within the two-year reglementary period ; ( 2 ) the income is declared on the ITR ; and ( 3 ) the fact of withholding is established by a copy of the withholding tax statement . <p> Given the conflicting decisions of the Supreme Court , how should we interpret the two decisions ? <p> The application or interpretation placed by the Supreme Court upon a law is part of the law as of the date of its enactment since the Court 's application or interpretation merely establishes the contemporaneous legislative intent that the construed law purports to carry into effect . Following the 1987 Philippine Constitution , no doctrine or principle of law laid down by the Supreme Court in a decision rendered En Banc or in Division may be modified or reversed except by the Court sitting En Banc . <p> This is not the first instance where the Supreme Court had conflicting positions in its decisions . Based on the precedent decisions , the Supreme Court would tend to uphold the validity of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its previous ruling on the matter . This is irrespective of whether the later decision was decided by the Court sitting En Banc or in Division . <p> In dealing with inconsistencies , there are two approaches applied by the Supreme Court -- either to harmonize the varying positions or to abandon one of the rulings . <p> As the highest tribunal , never in its history has the Supreme Court declared any decision rendered by its divisions as invalid . Based on a survey of decided cases , the Supreme Court tends to harmonize decisions rendered by its divisions by reconciling conflicting points , treating the latest decision as a mere clarification and not an abandonment of earlier rulings . <p> In certain cases , however , the Supreme Court 's latest decision on the matter serves as an abandonment of its previous decisions . Nonetheless , the Supreme Court recognizes the prospective application of such decisions , hence , upholding the validity of its earlier ruling . It should not apply to parties who had relied on the old doctrine . <p> A good example of the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the two-year prescriptive period for input VAT refund . Following the Atlas doctrine promulgated on June 8 , 2007 , the two-year prescriptive period for filing a claim for refund/credit of input VAT on zero-rated sales should be reckoned from the date of filing of the return and payment of the tax due . However , this was reversed by the Mirant doctrine on Sept. 12 , 2008 , where the Court held that the two-year period is reckoned from the close of the taxable quarter when the relevant sales were made . In resolving the two doctrines in the San Roque case , the Supreme Court En Banc held that the Atlas doctrine is only effective from its promulgation on June 8 , 2007 until its abandonment on Sept. 12 , 2008 by the Mirant doctrine . <p> Of the two approaches , which one did the Supreme Court take on the irrevocability rule ? <p> It may be inferred that the March decision was abandoned and superseded by the August decision of Chief Justice Bersamin . However , it would be good if the Court En Banc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like what it did in the San Roque case . <p> The views or opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of Isla Lipana &amp; Co .

Consider basketball : Over the course of a basketball game , the foot can expand almost a half-size during play . A level of fit that feels comfortable at one point might feel constrictive just 24 minutes later . Because the needs of the foot change at any given time based on the sport , its duration and on specific movements , like a slashing cut to the basket , " perfect fit " is a floating target . <p> The effort to refine fit has yielded a number of innovative platforms through Nike 's history -- Huarache , Flywire and Flyknit , to name a few . Perhaps none was more critical to advancing custom fit than the 2016 introduction of the Nike HyperAdapt 1.0 , the first Nike multipurpose performance shoe to feature power lacing . <p> Now , Nike has found its most advanced fit solution to date : Nike Adapt , a platform that creates a truly custom fit by combining an advanced power-lacing system , an app and continually updated firmware , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We picked basketball as the first sport for Nike Adapt intentionally because of the demands that athletes put on their shoes , " says Eric Avar , Nike VP Creative Director of Innovation .

It 's no bluff that the institution 's biblical metaphor was " rock . " <p> And then there is that other trash talk , one that 's rather refreshing . This year 's post-Sinulog garbage haul was cut dramatically to 110 tons . That 's the smallest in three years . In 2017 , the City collected 160 tons . The heap hit its worst in 2018 at 219 tons , at a time when it was the Cebu City Environmental and Natural Resources Office that was , well , on top of the heap with the help of 221 barangay environmental officers and volunteers .

@@70450238 <h> Pe ? a : Balloons problems <p> ONE interesting environmental story last year was the planned record -- breaking balloon dropping event at Cove Manila involving 130,000 pieces of balloons during the New Year 's Eve countdown . It did not push through because the Department of Environment and Natural Resources ordered the organizers to stop the balloon drop because of the huge amount of solid waste that the event would generate . <p> Okada Manila justified the event by saying that it will not harm the environment because it will be held indoors and the balloons will not be released in the air . They also said that the balloons are made of biodegradable latex materials and will be recycled properly after the event . Is this claim true ? According to ballonsblow.org , natural latex may be biodegradable , but it contains chemical additives like plasticizers and artificial dyes . It may degrade after several years , but it 's surely not " biodegradable " like ordinary organic materials . <p> Since burst latex balloons stay long in the environment , they pose danger to wildlife .

As in the past years , our activities for 2019 will be guided by a theme . For this year , it is " SHAPING A COMPETITIVE FUTURE . " <p> Our theme is a nod to our mission , but it also recognizes the power of the business community to impact and , indeed , help shape the country 's future . In line with this , MAP will focus on the following priority programs for 2019 in order to help shape a competitive future for the country : <p> Ease of doing business <p> Human capital development <p> Inclusive growth and sustainability <p> The first priority for 2019 will be advocacies to improve ease of doing business and Philippine competitiveness . <p> MAP will continue working with the government to improve the ease of doing business in the Philippines so that we can attract more local and foreign investments , create more jobs , and ensure inclusive growth . <p> This is not to say that the government has been idle . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , from reducing the number of steps and turnaround times in various processes , to implementing online transaction processing in many areas , to improving our infrastructure . <p> The implementation of the Ease of Doing Business Act , which President Duterte signed in May 2018 , will hopefully further contribute to improving our ranking in the coming years . But much remains to be done , particularly on simplifying regulatory processes and building infrastructure . For the latter , there are the more obvious ones of roads , bridges and airports . <p> Then there 's the digital world , a key area for future competitiveness , where laws and regulations are lagging the advancement in technology , and our infrastructure and capabilities are sorely behind those of other nations . In the 2018 World Digital Competitiveness Ranking , by the International Institute for Management Development , we ranked 56th out of 63 countries , dropping 10 places from 2017 's 46th spot . We remain one of the worst-ranked in the Asia-Pacific , ranking 12th of 14 . In the vital areas of communications technology and internet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost dead last . <p> Implementing and improving digital services and ensuring that the laws and regulations governing them facilitate their growth not only contribute to ease of doing business , but are also vital in keeping our businesses , and our country as a whole , competitive . <p> Our second priority for 2019 will be programs to help develop human capital in the country . <p> Prior to 2012 , the Philippines was one of only three countries in the world and the only one in Asia that had only 10 years of basic education . The K-12 program and the increased focus on STEM subjects brought us more in line with world standards , but we must do our part as corporate citizens by creating opportunities for K-12 graduates to be hired into the workplace . <p> Development of digital capabilities is critical . The World Economic Forum estimates that as of 2018 humans accounted for 71% of the total work hours done by humans and machines . By 2022 , that is expected to decline to 58% , and by 2025 , only 48% of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is only 6 years away ! <p> Not only is it imperative that we transform our business models for the digital world , but perhaps more importantly , how do we prepare our workforce for that new world ? Automation is expected to displace 75 million jobs worldwide by 2022 , but it will also create an estimated 133 million new jobs . But these are not the jobs we know -- these are jobs in areas such as data science and analytics and artificial intelligence , jobs which did n't even exist a few years ago . <p> Digital competitiveness is measured in terms of knowledge , technology , and future-readiness . <p> While the government needs to do its part to develop our human capital through improving our educational system , providing support for science , technology and innovation , and upskilling our teachers , we also need to do ours . <p> It is estimated that more than half our workforce will need significant re-skilling and upskilling , requiring anywhere from 3 months to a year . Indeed , even the skills of executive leadership and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not just new technical skills that may be needed but also a different management mindset , one that is attuned to a far more diverse workforce and open to new management models such as part-time workers , work-from-home , and partnering to get the skills required . <p> Our third priority will be initiatives to promote inclusive growth and sustainability . <p> I am a firm believer that growth is not sustainable if we can not help the lower demographic segments of the population achieve prosperity . Creating the clients of the future requires bringing them above that line . <p> Poverty reduction requires sustained effort from all sectors -- creating more jobs for both skilled and unskilled workers , continuing to boost the quality of basic education , improving natural disaster risk management and protection , and improving productivity , especially in agriculture . <p> I would also like to mention a subject close to my heart .

It ca n't be done by government alone , or business alone . Indeed , it needs the work of all sectors of society , and none of us will likely ever know what everyone else is doing . But if each of us pitches in and does our part as best we can , we CAN get to that future to which we all aspire ! <p> This article was lifted from the Inaugural Speech delivered by the author as the President of the Management Association of the Philippines for 2019. 
@@70482234 <h> Rice tariffication is good for our rice farmers , our country <h> Introspective <p> By Ramon L. Clarete <p> DA Undersecretary Fred Serrano threw his support to groups urging President Duterte to veto the rice tariffication law in Friday 's issue of Business Mirror . <p> Blaming the senators for their version of tariffication or SB 1998 , Serrano maintains that rice tariffication , which converts the quantity restriction on imported rice ( QR ) into tariff protection rates , is not about removing the " regulatory power of the NFA to control the entry of imported rice in the country . " <p> That is not entirely correct . Rice tariffication should remove the power of NFA to regulate rice imports . Article 4.2 of the WTO Agreement on Agriculture prohibits the use of restrictions on agricultural imports other than tariffs -- and that includes non-tariff measures maintained through state-trading enterprises such as the NFA . <p> The enrolled rice bill sent to Malaca ? ang hits the bull 's eye on rice tariffication . The rice import monopoly of NFA is removed by the proposed law , and is replaced with tariff protection .

Opponents ( e.g. founding Chairman Robert Hernandez of Alyansa ng Industriya ng Bigas ) disagree . He contends that " deregulating the NFA would mean unregulated entry of imported rice , which would flood the market and depress palay prices . " <p> Let us check the data . Once the President enacts rice tariffication , we should expect that private sector importers would import rice from ASEAN member states particularly Vietnam or Thailand , since the import tariff and freight cost are lowest . The tariff on imported rice from ASEAN would raise the price that rice consumers in our country pay by 35% . This is called the implicit tariff ( IT ) . <p> If the implicit tariff is entirely passed on to farmers , a 35% IT will result in a 35% nominal protection rate ( NPR ) . But under current trading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . In 2017 for example , only 23% of the potential protection was passed on to farmers ( Table 1 ) . That is , roughly three fourths of what consumers pay above free trade price for rice does not go to rice farmers . Instead it goes to rice traders and to inefficiencies in the domestic rice marketing system ( Dawe et al. , 2008 ; Mataia , et al. , 2018 ) . <p> Rice consumers in Metro Manila in 2017 paid on average 41% more than the landed price of rice imported freely from Vietnam or Thailand . But our rice farmers sold their rice at only 9% above this free trade price . The difference or 32% went to rice traders , millers , and/or simply lost to market inefficiencies in the rice value chain . <p> A compelling argument why President Duterte should sign this bill into law is that in doing so he kicks off the process of substantially reducing the inefficiencies and collusion in the rice market system , which for nearly half a century had made rice farmers poor . Farmers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade protection of the law from rice traders in collusion with corrupt NFA agents . <p> The tariff rate on imported rice could be lowered in the future without harming the vast majority of farmers . The current proposed tariff level of 35% is a maximum rate . If it is lowered , most of the rice farmers who are rice consumers during most part of the year can be made better off , along with non-rice farmers in rural areas , fisherfolk , workers and residents in urban areas .

That means only 14 respondents came from the socioeconomic class AB , 130 from Class C , and 1,296 from among those belonging to the socioeconomic classes D and E. <p> SWS refers to the D class as the Lower Class who have some comfort and means but basically thrive on a hand-to-mouth existence , and the E class as the Extremely Lower Class who face great difficulties in meeting their survival needs . Maybe it can be safely said that based on their circumstances in life , the highest educational attainment of the 1,350 respondents from the Lower Classes would be 2nd year high school . <p> Their access to information pertaining to governance can not be through the print media as they would rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information regarding the national and local government must be the broadcast media . They may not own a TV set or a radio , but there is always someone in their neighborhood who has his TV set or radio turned on at high volume for everybody to hear what is being aired . <p> The survey showed that the Supreme Court 's net satisfaction rating stayed good among Class DE people , rural folks , and elementary graduates . Likewise , the Cabinet 's net satisfaction rating was good among the same clusters -- Class DE people , rural folks , and elementary graduates . <p> Random interviews of ordinary folks by broadcast journalists regarding senatorial candidates reflect a strong bias on the part of ordinary folks towards candidates perceived to be likely padrinos or senators who can be relied on to extend help or do the folks a favor . That is probably why movie actors like Ramon Revilla and son Bong , Joseph Estrada , and Lito Lapid were elected senators because they are perceived as champions of the downtrodden and the poor , even if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those random interviews of ordinary people was a preference for candidates who are competent in the making of laws , the primary role of senators .

The respondents were asked this question : <p> Based on their overall performance , how do you feel about the performance of the following government institutions ? Are you Very satisfied , Somewhat satisfied , Undecided if satisfied or not , Somewhat dissatisfied , Very dissatisfied or You have never heard or read anything about ( institution ) ? You may indicate your answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rating board . <p> The results of the survey show the majority of the citizens belonging to the poorest economic class , folks in the countryside , and adults with only elementary education are satisfied with the Supreme Court and the Cabinet . It is highly probable the uninformed or poorly informed people from the lowest economic classes and the countryside could have just chosen any one of the possible responses presented him so as not to appear clueless to the interviewer . Are survey results that are no more than a collection of guesses reflective of the true sentiments of the respondents ? <p> I tend to think if the same 1,440 respondents were asked how they feel about the performance of Victoria Court and Ofix Cabinet and presented the same possible responses of " Very satisfied , Somewhat satisfied , Undecided if satisfied or not , Somewhat dissatisfied , Very dissatisfied " , they would be satisfied with the performance of the two establishments as they were with the two government institutions . <p> It should be noted that 29% of the respondents were undecided if satisfied or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Cabinet . I wonder how many would have been undecided about their feelings about the two government institutions if the respondents were asked an open-end question , " How do you feel about the performance of ( the institution ) ?

Such a response would be more reflective of what the respondent feels about the two government institutions than a " guided " or " prompted " answer . <p> Information regarding the extent of the ignorance of citizens about the issues of national import would be more useful . Such information is actionable .

Now , you do know how contagious mirror neurons can be . Soon they began to make the gel-mustached face also go up in a smile . It is like through his turban he was able to scan and smell the oxytocin that began to release itself in my brain .

Like letting someone else take in a completely neutral and objective view of the problem . <p> In my case , at the lobby of that five-star hotel in New Delhi , I watched myself lose my cool through the eyes of a journalist from a local tabloid , Abante , and visualized his headlines for the next day , " Leadership Trainer from Philippines heats up in India !

This , by their under-23 charges , was about as emphatic as it gets . <p> You 'd think a North London derby would arouse passions whatever the level but Spurs clearly did n't agree . But it meant something to the young Gunners , who thoroughly outplayed their rivals , their speed and movement superior throughout.Two goals by Joe Willock inbetween a Charlie Gilmour penalty and cool Eddie Nketiah finish perhaps gave Emery some food for thought.He has played all three scorers at one point or another this season , however briefly , but , let 's be honest , they could hardly do much worse than the shower humbled in the Europa League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't carry too much significance . Freddie Ljungberg 's Arsenal remain mid-table in the Premier League 2 while Spurs , shorn of many of their best players through loan moves , remain the division 's lowest scorers.It took Arsenal no time at all to stamp their authority on this contest . While Spurs ' back line were trying and failing to pass the ball out from defence , Arsenal swamped them with early pressure.And it took just four minutes to make it count . Bukayo Saka was afforded far too much time and space down the left and his ball across goal found Xavier Amaechi . <p> He was definitely trying to score , but got his feet tangled up and scuffed the shot . Luckily it fell to Willock just a few yards from goal and he was n't going to miss.Arsenal continued to press regularly , looking stronger in all department as Spurs struggled to make much of an impression.MATCH FACTS TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR U23:Austin ; Hinds , Tanganga ( c ) , Eyoma , Cirkin ; Marsh , Oakley-Boothe ; Maghoma , Roles ( Shashoua 73 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , **28;1643;TOOLONG U23:Iliev ( Smith 77 ) ; Osei-Tutu , Pleguezuelo ( c ) ( John-Jules 66 ) , Ballard , Mavropanos ; Thompson , Gilmour ; Willock , Amaechi ( Zelalem 86 ) , Nketiah ; SakaSUBS NOT USED:Coyle , MedleySCORERS:Willock 4 , 31 ; Gilmour 25 pen ; Nketiah 47BOOKED:Pleguezuelo , SmithREFEREE:Josh SmithThe Gunners won a penalty midway through the half when Amaechi reached a cross fractionally ahead of George Marsh and played the ball off the midfielder 's hand .

Cards played in conjunction with other cards can have big , game-warping effects . Some even go so far as to " break " the game . <p> To play Magic , players build decks using cards from their collections .

You could , in theory , buy a bunch of packs and still not get the cards you need . So the most cost-efficient way to get specific cards is by buying singles . And now it 's time to discuss the secondary market . <p> The Secondary Market <p> Being a collectible card game , cards that are sold as singles are subject to secondary market prices .

Decks are made up of 60 cards , and can have up to 4 copies of each spell . <p> Commander : Commander decks are comprised of 99 cards with no duplicates , plus one creature designated as the deck 's commander . The deck 's overall strategy is hinged on its commander . <p> Limited : Players open sealed packs , and have to create a deck on the spot .

@@70519234 <p> Politically speaking , midterm elections act as a barometer for the popularity of the incumbent president , a referendum on his policies and programs . President Rodrigo Duterte seems to have taken a keen involvement in the senatorial race , and understandably so . <p> The president and the senators are both elected at large , making their constituents the same and making the perceived association between the ratings of the president and the chance of victory of his candidates higher and tighter . <p> By the end of 2018 , based on the Pulse Asia Ulat ng Bayan survey , Duterte 's net approval rating improved to 74 percent compared to 65 percent the previous quarter . His net trust ratings have also improved by year end to 70 percent from 63 percent in the previous quarter , which translates to more Filipino adults trusting him and fewer distrusting him . <p> Similarly , Duterte 's net satisfaction rating improved to 59 percent by the end of 2018 , compared to 54 percent in the previous quarter , based on the social weather survey results from the Social Weather Station . <p> Depending on which political and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be something to crow about . As they currently stand , the net approval and trust ratings should make Duterte happy given the upward movement from the previous results . <p> On the other hand , these numbers may also mean that the president has lost some political capital , considering that his net approval and net trust ratings have not recovered to what they were at their highest , at 85 percent by the end of June 2018 . <p> Undoubtedly , his defenders will quickly point out that the current levels still surpass the highest received by any of the past three presidents ( Estrada , Arroyo and Aquino ) , except for Aquino 's first quarter , which registered a net approval rating of 76 percent , compared to Duterte 's current rating of 74 percent . <p> These numbers matter because they gauge the general mood of the country towards the president ; they measure public opinion . But politicians and -- more likely -- their strategists and advisers look at these to determine which direction their relationship with the incumbent president should go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satisfaction -- should mean a continued association with the president from those who are exposed as allies . For the more seasoned politicians , the high ratings of the president signal that an unfettered alliance with the president must be forged visibly , loudly , and immediately . The president , on the other hand , should look at these numbers as his political capital that would allow him to exact support for his programs and agenda . <p> During an election year , this shrewd calculation matters even more . It would seem that for as long as the numbers are sustained -- even better if improved -- candidates , like opportunistic pathogens taking advantage of a depressed immune system , will mouth the presidential line in exchange for riding on the president 's coat tails . <p> In such cases , a presidential endorsement of their election bid is an assumed quid pro quo . After all , getting his allies elected speaks volumes about the president 's political skills . <p> Can the president 's popularity rub off on the candidates he endorses ? The latest senatoriable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates . What gives ? Are we finally witnessing signs of political maturity where voters are more discerning and circumspect than to readily support candidates merely on the basis of a presidential endorsement ? If yes , there is hope after all . <p> However , we should be extra wary and cautious . Given that a presidential endorsement may have lost its punch , how do we expect the candidates to woo the voters ? Perhaps , alongside the traditional guns , goons and gold , they are going to engage the voters using the same political approach used by Duterte -- populism . <p> Duterte and Estrada were included among the world leaders named in the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change among the " Populists in Power : 1990-2018 , " released in November 2018 . Hardly an impressive distinction . <p> The underlying narrative of populism is " us " versus " them , " or the conflict between the " people " ( us ) and the " elite " ( them ) . The term " people " can refer to a particular class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the collective anxieties of the people . They raise divisive issues to rile up fear and loathing . Estrada 's pro-poor stance struck a responsive chord from the masses , playing on their apprehensions that their economic conditions would get worse or that they would remain poor forever . <p> He ascribed this economic quagmire to the system that perpetuates a cycle of poverty , portraying himself as an anti-establishment hero . And because the establishment can not be trusted , a direct connection with the supporters is best , without the need for political parties , civil society groups or even the media . <p> Populists also promise fantastic solutions that are generally unfulfillable . Obviously , social conditions such as zero drugs , zero crime , and zero corruption belong to the realm of a perfect world . <p> But the use of these storylines is very effective especially during times when people watch , hear and read stories about their ubiquitous presence in our society . They continue to be potent in rallying people and making them elect candidates who project themselves as champions of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a national crisis -- and , therefore , to a state of national urgency -- allowing them to present themselves as the messiah -- the answer to the crisis -- who will provide strong leadership . To a large extent , this is what got Duterte elected . <p> According to the study , populists " dismantle democratic checks and balances and ruthlessly subjugate any opposition from the get-go . " <p> In the movie " The American President , " the forerunner to the popular political TV series " The West Wing , " the fictional president , in response to the constant attacks from his reelection challenger , said " whatever your particular problem is , I promise you , ( he ) is not the least bit interested in solving it . He is interested in two things , and two things only : making you afraid of it , and , telling you who 's to blame for it . That , ladies and gentlemen , is how you win elections . " <p> And if we continue to allow ourselves to be charmed with utopian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offer themselves as the solution , then , in the long run , we are harming our democratic ideals and institutions severely and , perhaps , permanently . <p> For the country 's sake , the elections should not be won that way . <p> Edwin Santiago is the executive director of Stratbase ADR Institute , a partner of Philstar.com . <p> Infracorp Development Inc. , the infrastructure arm of tycoon Andrew Tan 's Alliance Global Group Inc .

Ceritalah <p> Jabaraj and Semmalar met as social workers . The married couple now reside in Tambaran with their teenage son . Ceritalah <p> Semmalar is an academic . She is also a Dalit , formally known as an ' Untouchable ' . Ceritalah <p> Tamil Nadu is much more progressive than the North . It 's Human Development Index ( 0.708 ) falls under the ' high ' bracket . Ceritalah <p> The 2017 pro-jallikattu protests attracted regional media attention . But Jabaraj sees it as an upper-caste tradition . Dalits are banned from taking part in the activity . Srinivassa Balaji , indiangraffiti.com <p> Jabaraj is very critical of the ' Tamil Identity ' , arguing it represents the upper-caste experience . Silk saris , shirts , dhotis are not accessible to Dalits. avishya.com <p> Jabaraj and Semmalar work with schools in rural villages . In January , Team Ceritalah visited a Dalit school located on the outskirts of Pollachi . Ceritalah <p> Jabaraj was educated at an RSS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identity and nationalism . themanipaljournal.com <p> Jabaraj Selvaraj is Tamil . Unusually for a resident of the predominantly Hindu state of Tamil Nadu , he is also a Christian and deeply critical of caste . The 38-year-old social worker is an unassuming man -- sufficiently comfortable in his own skin to allow others -- in this case his wife , Semmalar , an academic and a Dalit ( previously known as " Untouchable " , though this term is now considered inappropriate ) -- to speak first . <p> They 're a young , attractive pair , especially when they both clamber onto his impressive-looking 350cc Royal Enfield Thunderbird motorbike . <p> They 're also a mixed-caste couple . <p> Winning his parents over to the match was n't easy . As Jabaraj explains , " Your caste origins follow you even when you convert . My own caste , the Nadar , were known for their anti-Dalit violence and my father , well , he was concerned about what his relatives would think : the pressures of what society is going to say . But urban life is different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , the couple lives in a 3-storey joint-family home in the bustling Chennai suburb of Tambaram . It 's a lively place . His married sisters live nearby and the house hums with activity : there are visitors all day long and into the early evening . <p> Jabaraj had n't always wanted to be a social worker . <p> " I was a nerd . When others were out playing , I 'd be on my computer . I just wanted to do statistics and computing . I never really had any other interests . However , I failed in my last semester at college . " <p> " Before that , I 'd believed in everything I 'd learnt at school and college . I went to an RSS ( the right-wing Hindu nationalist association that nurtured the BJP ) school . The principal was a friend of my father 's . They 'd teach us Hindu patriotic and devotional songs . I was also taught that I was an ' Hindu ' Christian . <p> " Nothing made me doubt the world around me . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberal religious views around the time I failed at college and that 's when I became a lot more aware of politics in India . I started experiencing things differently . " <p> Not long after , as Jabaraj explored the world of social work , he met his future wife , Semmalar . <p> " I had all these ideas . We were at a rural school , helping the kids . Semmalar was my partner in the field work . She was from a family where her father was an atheist . He was a union member in a high position . Semmalar and I talked about issues , about politics . She wanted to do psychology and help people . We built our relationship from there . " <p> Jabaraj 's calm , understated manner masks some firmly-held views . When asked if he was Indian first or Tamil first , he 's clear : " I 'm Tamil first . Otherwise , I do n't believe much in borders . " <p> Southern India -- the Dravidian heartland of Tamil Nadu , Kerala , Karnataka , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its more progressive ethos . In cultural terms , the South is also different . The Tamil language is far older than Hindi . Its written tradition stretches back thousands of years . The 3rd Century BCE poet Thiruvalluvar with his expansive moral philosophy enshrined in the Thirukkural remains mandatory reading for young Tamilians . <p> Indeed , Southern Indians are generally far better educated , healthier and richer than their counterparts in the north . Uttar Pradesh -- India 's largest state in the north -- has a Human Development Index ( or HDI ) of 0.583 , comparable to Cambodia . In contrast , Tamil Nadu 's HDI floats around 0.708 and neighbouring Kerala records an HDI of 0.784 , just shy of Malaysia according to the UNDP Human Development Report 2018 and the Indian Sub-national HDI Area Database of the Global Data Lab . <p> The social progressiveness has a positive impact on the state 's economic life . With a population of nearly 80 million , Tamil Nadu is an economic powerhouse with growth rates ( 12.3% ) considerably higher than national levels ( 7.2% ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just second after the Mumbai-centric state of Maharashtra . Certainly , Tamil Nadu is a magnet for foreign investment , emerging for example as India 's automotive manufacturing hub , with just over 30% of the republic 's overall capacity . <p> But Jabaraj remains critical of the way in which Tamil identity is refracted through an upper-caste lens : " When people visualise Tamil culture , they tend to think of silk shirts , silk saris and silk veshtis ( lunghis ) . But how accessible are any of these to the poor and how much of Dalit Tamil culture is included in this picture ? All that they are showing is dominant caste identity as Tamil culture . Other than language , we do n't have anything at all . " <p> He is similarly sceptical of the way that the Jallikattu controversy ( Jallikattu is a bull " taming " sport unique to Tamil Nadu ) was manipulated by activists back in 2017 . Banned by the Supreme Court , the ensuing protests became a lightning-rod for anti-Delhi/anti-Modi anger . However , for Jabaraj , Jallikattu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressly excludes Dalit participation . <p> With elections approaching , Jabaraj is concerned about attempts to polarise the population along caste lines . " Narendra Modi and the BJP are brilliant at social media . They propagate lies as though they 're the truth . Thankfully , the cynical manipulation does n't work as well in the cities . But social media is pushing in the name of culture . It 's all becoming more fanatic . " <p> Still , the state 's more open and independent ethos -- perhaps building on the discursive and humanist themes embodied in the Thirukkural -- has provided an important ballast to the strident Hindu revivalism that swept the BJP to power back in 2014 . There appears to be little evidence that in 2019 anything will be different . <p> Tamil Nadu will continue to plough its prosperous and progressive furrow whatever happens in Delhi . <p> Disclaimer:The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp .

Here are the most important things our team of experts saw in Charlotte , North Carolina : <h> Dirk and D-Wade 's last All-Star dance <p> Dirk Nowitzki made sure that commissioner Adam Silver 's decision to bring him and Dwyane Wade to Charlotte as special roster additions ended up more celebration than just ceremony . Nowitzki checked in for Team Giannis with less than a minute to go in the first quarter and stroked back-to-back 3s -- one from 29 feet , one from 33 feet -- before the horn sounded . <p> Wade started the second half for Team LeBron alongside LeBron James and threw a vintage alley-oop off the backboard for James to finish with a slam to bring back some Miami memories for the pair that won two rings together . Before the fourth quarter , Nowitzki and Wade were honored at center court and presented with framed All-Star jerseys by the team captains . <p> " The game is in good hands so it 's easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- Dave McMenamin <p> play <p> 0:28 <h> Wade , LeBron exchange alley-oops <p> LeBron James lobs one up to Dwyane Wade , then Wade returns the favor off the backboard for a big LeBron slam . <h> LeBron 's team-building exercise <p> Nine years ago , LeBron James chose to leave Cleveland and team up with Dwyane Wade and Chris Bosh on the shores of Biscayne Bay , creating a team that won two championships and reached four straight NBA Finals . This summer , James needs to find someone to do what he did back then : choose to come play with him and turn his team into a championship contender . <p> He needs to find his next Dwyane Wade . <p> That was what made this weekend so compelling .

Nonetheless , two small tweaks could produce a more satisfying dunk contest . <p> 1 . Carry first-round scores forward <p> One of the most frustrating parts of the dunk contest is that the best dunks -- including the very best of Saturday night , Hamidou Diallo scaling Mt . Shaq -- do n't count toward the final result because first-round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That makes no sense . <p> When you praise Vince Carter 's historic 2000 dunk contest , odds are you 're remembering two of his first-round dunks ( a 360 windmill that prompted TNT commentator Kenny Smith to yell " Let 's go home ! " and a between-the-legs dunk off a bounce pass by then-teammate Tracy McGrady that Carter capped with his famous point to the sky ) rather than his final dunk , a two-hander from just inside the free-throw line that earned his lowest score all night ( 48 ) . <p> So why should n't Diallo 's perfect 50 have counted toward winning the actual competition ? At a minimum , we should carry scores from the first round over to the final . Better yet , I 'd suggest letting all four dunkers have three or four dunks and picking the winner among them rather than having two separate rounds . <p> 2 . Eliminate the minimum score <p> More aggressive adjustments to the scoring have been suggested , but in the name of simplicity I think an easy tweak would be taking out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ punish players harshly enough for missing dunks , since they 'll still score at least a 30 ( and both Miles Bridges and Dennis Smith Jr . scored better than that when they ran out of attempts Saturday night ) . <p> Additionally , utilizing all 11 scores from 0-10 would give judges more room to properly reward the very best dunks . When the scores are condensed , there 's little variation . Half of the 10 completed dunks Saturday scored a 50 . Back in the 1980s , a score of 50 was rare . In their famous 1985 dunk contest , Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins received a combined three 50s out of 18 dunks in the three-round format used at the time . Making 50s less common will also make them more meaningful . <p> -- Kevin Pelton <p> play <p> 1:54 <h> Diallo downs DSJ to win dunk contest <p> Hamidou Diallo and Dennis Smith Jr . each took turns dunking over guests like Shaq and J.

Davis ' trade request from before the trade deadline , and the ensuing fallout from it , still hung over the franchise . Davis had left New Orleans ' final game before the All-Star break before it ended to get an MRI on his shoulder . His coach , Alvin Gentry , stormed off after his postgame interview when he was asked a second time about Davis leaving . Friday afternoon , New Orleans fired its general manager , Dell Demps . <p> All of it made what happened after Davis did , in fact , come to the podium all the more amazing to witness . Not only did he speak about everything that had happened over the past few weeks , he did so openly and honestly . He refuted the one major roadblock to his going to the Boston Celtics -- the team with the most assets to trade for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his list of preferred teams . He spoke openly of what he liked about the New York Knicks . He said he would become a free agent in 2020 no matter where he played . <h> Davis : ' I never said Boston was n't on my list ' <p> Anthony Davis speaks about his desire to play and explains that he never said the Celtics were n't on his list of teams that he wanted to be traded to . <h> Kyle Kuzma , the late-first round Rising Star <p> Looking at the Rising Stars rosters before tipoff was a great reminder of how imperfect the science is of projecting the NBA draft . Watching the game 's MVP Kyle Kuzma throw down windmills and hit step-back 3-pointers was easily the most vivid example of that . Kuzma elected to redshirt his freshman year in college and proceeded to play only eight minutes per game his second .

But the atmosphere inside Charlotte 's Spectrum Center throughout this weekend was particularly lacking in energy and enthusiasm . <p> Some of that was aided by what happened on the court . The dunk contest -- which is supposed to be Saturday night 's signature event -- was marred by strange grading and several dunk attempts that took multiple attempts to pull off ( or , in a couple of instances , failed to work at all ) . <p> Then came Sunday 's All-Star Game , which was virtually void of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a few nice moments -- like when LeBron James caught an alley-oop from Dwyane Wade , or when Dirk Nowitzki hit a pair of 3-pointers to end the first quarter , or when hometown hero Stephen Curry pulled off a 4-point play when he was fouled while making a 3-pointer by Warriors teammate Klay Thompson . <p> For large stretches of the game , though , you could hear a pin drop .

@@70539240 <p> Millennials , beware : Your grandparents are about to start calling you for help downloading the new Medicare smartphone app.The iPhone and Android app , which launched Feb. 6 , is called ' What 's Covered , ' and true to its name , it mostly answers one simple , yes-or-no question : Is this medical procedure covered by traditional Medicare ? Milt Roney , a 71-year-old retired government worker in a well-to-do suburb of Washington , D.C. , agreed to check out the app with me , though he was skeptical from the outset . <p> ' I would n't use an app like that , ' Roney said . ' My procedures are going to be covered , and I 'm not going to worry about it . ' Still , the app , available free from the Google Play and Apple App stores , is part of a broader Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services initiative , called eMedicare , to put more tools and information about Medicare online . ( CMS declined a request for an interview . ) But much like the medicare.gov website , it does n't delve into individual beneficiaries ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have , so it ca n't take into account supplementary insurance , deductibles , coinsurance or other factors that determine cost . ' While usable and good for general information , it does n't provide personalized information that might be more helpful in making treatment or access decisions , ' said Casey Schwarz , senior counsel for the Medicare Rights Center , a nonprofit organization.Milt 's wife , Lisa Roney , 70 , joined him to participate in my own ' expert panel , ' to download the app and try it out.It 's worth noting that these experts were my backup plan . The first couple I approached told me they 'd love to help , but they had ' dumb phones ' and could n't download anything . <p> This highlights perhaps a more fundamental problem . Many people of Medicare age do n't have a smartphone , and are n't familiar with apps or comfortable manipulating screens.According to a reportfrom AARP , 46 percent of people in their 60s do not have smartphones . Only 29 percent of the 70-and-older crowd do . The report suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans owning mobile technology each year.The Roneys both have Medicare Parts A and B , which cover hospitalizations and doctor visits . They both have smartphones . As retired government workers , they also have insurance from GEHA , the Government Employees Health Association , which covers their dental care , prescription drugs and some other expenses . Milt Roney gets some money from GEHA to hand out brochures at health fairs.They consider themselves pretty tech-savvy . They have iPads , personal computers and iPhones . Lisa Roney wears a Fitbit.But they immediately questioned the necessity of the app . ' I 'd just pick up the phone and call if I had a question about what was covered , ' Milt Roney said . ' I 'd probably just look it up in the Medicare book , ' Lisa Roney said , pulling the 2-inch manual from a drawer in her office.Then came the first hurdle : downloading the app.Searching ' Medicare ' in the Google app store , which is where Android users go , yielded many results . ' What 's Covered ' was first on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ app on the platform . Same experience in the Apple app store , where it took the Roneys a few minutes to sort out exactly which one was the CMS tool . ( It 's the one that says ' Official Medicare coverage app , ' made by the ' Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services . ' ) Having completed this part of the process , we moved on.Opening the app immediately gave each of us a search bar to type in a product or service . ( I was experimenting , too , though still 40 years shy of Medicare eligibility . ) There 's also an option to browse all items and services to see what is covered.A note to readers : I would n't recommend telling your friends you have a fun new game on your phone and then ask them to call out medical procedures to see if they 're covered by Medicare . I can say from experience , it will not make you the most popular 20-something at brunch.The Roneys ' next challenge : figuring out the ' search ' function.Lisa Roney typed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recommended she , like many women her age , undergo to check for osteoporosis.It yielded no results . To find it , Lisa had to browse through the list of covered procedures and go to ' bone mass measurements . ' There , she found out that Part B covers such tests once every two years , but nowhere in the information did the word ' dexa scan ' -- the term her doctor used -- appear.Along the way , she checked her coverage manual and found no additional information . And , in the time it took her to go through these steps , her husband , Milt , got fed up and just Googled it . He found the answer immediately.Such problems with search specificity may be common . One reviewer on the Apple Store lodged a similar complaint . ' You have to know the correct terms or browse the entire alphabetical index and select likely candidates , ' the user wrote . ' For instance ' knee brace ' comes up with nothing ( you have to know to search for generic term ' brace ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for beneficiaries , their families and providers to find the same information available on the website and printed in the old-fashioned paper manual they receive by mail . It even uses the same fonts and little apple icons that denote which procedures count as ' preventive . ' <p> Schwarz , from the Medicare Rights Center , said a lot of beneficiaries will use the electronic resources to figure out coverage , but they also get help from social workers , volunteers at nonprofits and family members in their research . The app might help those people access information when they do n't want to use the mobile medicare.gov site , which Schwarz called ' not particularly great . ' There is also no information about how to choose a prescription drug plan , or other supplemental insurance like Medicare Advantage or Medigap plans , which are the real and complicated decisions beneficiaries must contend with . But those decisions require more personal information , which the app ca n't support right now.It 's also important to remember , Schwarz said , that Medicare does n't cover only seniors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Medicare for health coverage , and they might find the app easier to use than the traditional website.The Roneys were unimpressed . ' I 'm probably going to delete it right after you leave , ' Lisa Roney concluded .

@@70540240 <h> These new ' Avengers : Endgame ' theories explain what 's happening to Hulk <p> When push came to shove in Avengers : Infinity War , Hulk failed to show up after taking a monster beating from Thanos early in the movie , the kind he usually delivers to bad guys . As much as Bruce Banner wanted Hulk to take over in New York and Wakanda , the green monster wanted none of it . However , we do know from toy leaks that not only will Hulk appear in Endgame , but he 'll do so as a much better , smarter version of what we 've seen so far -- a mix between the monster and Banner , Professor Hulk . Endgame <p> will surely explain everything come April 26th , but until then we 've got a couple of interesting theories about Hulk for you to consider.It 's rare that we mix different fan theories for Avengers 4 , but it turns out that two Redditors focused on two different aspects of the Hulk , and they make even more sense when you connect them . We 'll begin with Hulk 's absence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strange.I 've said over and over that Doctor Strange is the architect of the MCU timelinewe 're about to see play out , and I told you everything that happened in Infinity Waris because Strange wanted it to happen that way . Strange did n't stop Star-Lord from waking Thanos up just as they were removing his gauntlet , and he gave up his life to make sure Iron Man survives Ant-Man goes to the Quantum Realm . And Strange may have caused other things to happen in the past for the Avengers to arrive at this particular point in time . With that in mind , it makes perfect sense to assume Strange interfered with Hulk , too . <p> The Redditor says that Strange did n't want Hulk affecting the outcome of any of the battles he may have been a part of . So Strange may have gone to Sakaar while Hulk was there and convinced him not to show up if he were ever to return to Earth:Evidence -- while it 's not hard evidence , Ragnarokmakes it clear that when Hulk is driving , Banner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hulk 's strategic importance to the mission and tees up the situation while Hulk was on his two-year run . Also , it 's possible that he told Loki while on Sakaar to take the Tesseract and hand it over . The way Strange and Loki gave up the stone was very similar.Remember that Hulk is practically a kid in Thor : Ragnarok , and Strange would be able to manipulate him with ease . The theory also says that while on Sakaar , Strange may have told Loki to grab the Tesseract . And that 's because Strange needed to make sure Thanos grabbed all the stones so that he could eventually be defeated.Let 's not forget that in Infinity War , Heimdall sent Hulk back to the Sanctum Sanctorum in New York of all places , which is where Strange was . Was that an accident or Doctor Strange made it happen ? Was it some trigger for Hulk ? That 's something the theory does n't say.Image Source : TwitterBut there 's a second Redditor , StripplefitzParty , who thinks it 's a different magician who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's The Ancient One , of course , whom Banner might get to meet as he goes back in time . Mark Ruffalo already confirmed that he worked with Tilda Swinton on the set . Whenever they end up when they go back in time , it 's likely that The Ancient One will be the Sorcerer Supreme:Almost every single theory/leak about A4 has indicated that time travel will occur , and one really interesting one is Bruce going back in time with other Avengers , and while the others attempt to perform some time-travel espionage Bruce goes to the Sanctum Santorum to talk with Doctor Strange because he fell through his roof the first time they met in Infinity War . However , because at the time of the Battle of New York , Doctor Strange had not started his magical journey at Kamar Taj , so the Sanctum would be guarded by another sorcerer and would likely take Bruce to the Ancient One upon hearing his knowledge.It would be here that the Ancient One learns not only about Thanos ' actions and the mission the Avengers are on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therapy to bind the two spiritual forms of Hulk and Bruce together so they can cooperate as one physically.It would make perfect sense for two sorcerers to affect the evolution of both Banner and Hulk , but we 'll have to wait until April 26th to see if either of these theories pan out .

Still , it remains to be seen if the Galaxy Fold will spearhead a new trajectory of smartphone innovation or simply be nothing more than a laughable novelty a'la Google Glass . <p> Naturally , the Galaxy Fold has prompted some pundits to heap praise upon Samsung for innovating while simultaneously blasting Apple for being boring . Interestingly enough , Apple , believe it or not , has published patents pertaining to foldable iPhone designs . What 's more , a Bank of America analyst last year said that Apple has been busy working on a foldable iPhone that could see the light of day as early as 2020 . Apple files patents for products that it never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a good idea to read too much into that . Still , one ca n't help but wonder what a foldable iPhone might bring to the market.Well , wonder no more . The folks over at ConceptsiPhonerecently put together a concept video depicting what a foldable iPhone might bring to the table . A lot of it looks cool , but if we 're being honest , some of the ideas either seem pointless or so ambitious as to not even seem realistic for the time being . Then again , there 's nothing wrong with a nice concept video , so enjoy the madness below . 
@@70541238 <p> The news that notorious film critic Philbert Dy is now on YouTube is a little confusing . <p> " He still reviews films , " my editor explains . " Except he now apparently does it in front of a camera . " We have a laugh about it , right before he asks me to write a review about Phil 's new web series . I 'm not even told its name , but I find Phil on Films pretty easily nonetheless . I give it a click . <p> The first video opens in exactly the sort of place some people would expect Philbert Dy to dwell : an empty bar dimly lit in red , local craft beer on tap , more beer posters plastered on the wall . Perfect for getting into the mood to argue with someone on the internet . <p> " Nobody reads anymore " is something you 'd hear Phil toss out every other week , back when we both worked in Rogue ( rest in peace ) . This is especially true when you happened to share a desk with him for a full year , like I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office , clad in his signature blazer and shirt ( to see him in anything else was the equivalent of a cryptid sighting ) . We 'd say hello , and he 'd go write at frankly ridiculous ( and unfair ) speeds . <p> Phil on Films is the hybrid of things we read from him at Rogue : his in-depth film reviews and This Week in Cinemas , which -- as its name implies -- gave an overview of what would be coming out in cinemas that week . The only real difference is that it 's on video and that you can actually see him now . As a result , each review is quick and bite-sized , and strangely , feels a lot more like a conversation . It 's as it says on the tin : It 's Phil talking about films . Simple camera-work , clear sound , with cuts from the films themselves to drive his points . <p> It 's not quite the way we 're used to people talking about them , be it on on half-baked blogs or overheard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the films are actually about : what they were trying to achieve ( such as Bato trying to make Bato dela Rosa look like an action star ) , whether they managed ( it did n't ) , and where they fit in the greater scheme of things ( take a look at the country you live in ) . About Antoinette Jadaone 's Alone/Together , he discusses " Christine and the death of her ideals . " And in describing Peter Farrelly 's Green Book , he describes a film " that is ostensibly about addressing racial inequality in the United States is told so much from the perspective of its comedically reductive white guy main character . " <p> It 's intelligent , matter-of-fact opinion that can be borderline assholic . And you know what ? In this format , it really works . What may be jarring to some is that Phil sounds exactly as he does in his articles . ( Given that he has a funny habit of reading his sentences aloud as he writes , I can confirm . ) He does n't pander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't care what you think about what he thinks . The unflinching honesty can be both refreshing and grating , and your mileage may vary . <p> If you 're after meaty , bite-sized reviews , you 're in luck .

With key indicators , especially inflation and the exchange rate , starting to stabilize , Mr. Duterte can better focus on the agenda at hand , create more jobs through " Build , Build , Build , " and significantly reduce the country 's poverty incidence . <p> President Duterte emerged as the most trusted government official in the latest survey conducted by Pulse Asia in December 2018 . The President 's trust rating was at 76 percent , a 4-percentage-point increase from his previous 72 percent in September 2018 . His approval rating , according to the survey , stood at 81 percent , up by 6 percentage points from his previous mark of 75 percent in September 2018 . <p> Nearly halfway through his six-year term , President Duterte is still solidly popular among Filipinos . I think the confidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high . He received a 96 percent approval rating and a 91 percent trust rating in Mindanao ; an 86 percent approval rating and 82 percent trust rating in Visayas ; and a 74 percent approval rating and 69 percent trust rating in Luzon . <p> The survey shows that the Filipino people , as noted by the President 's spokesman Salvador Panelo , fully believe in the way the President is running the bureaucracy and the nation . <p> The Pulse Asia survey is , therefore , another repudiation of the critics and detractors of the President , Panelo says . " Their loud hysterical harping and assaulting the administration with their accusations and condemnation are in sharp contrast to the clamor of the Filipinos for genuine and transparent change , " he adds . <p> I believe President Duterte achieved the higher trust and approval rating because of , among other things , the way he and his economic managers handled the temporary imbalances in the local economy .

The peso has settled to 52 against the greenback since then , and even the stock market is recovering with the Philippine Stock Exchange Index closing above 8,000 points . <p> It is safe to say that the Philippine economy survived the brewing worldwide economic crisis in 2018 that was precipitated by the tit-for-tat tariff impositions of the United States and China , surging oil prices and the political and economic turmoils in Turkey and Argentina . <p> With a resilient economy , I believe the Philippines will perform much better this year .

Remember , this is just the ' neutral case . " <p> NSW stands out as the state with the biggest transformation , given the impending retirement of its main coal generators , but in South Australia fossil fuels are all but eliminated , with just a small amount of gas generation continuing.Ironically , the technical studies behind the Coalition government 's support for the Snowy 2.0 and Tasmania pumped hydro schemes make clear that these multi-billion dollar investment only make sense if the exit of coal is accelerated rather than slowed.This is what the current exit looks like , a reduction of 60 per cent of the coal capacity over the next 20 years , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accelerated.The feasibility studies for Tasmania says the economics of fast tracking that project depend on bringing forward the closure of at least 5,000MW of coal generation , and Snowy 2.0 would also depend on it.In the meantime , Transgrid says it is already connecting 20 large scale projects in NSW .

@@70550240 <h> Coalition throws another $1.4 billion to try and make Snowy 2.0 stack up <p> Prime minister Scott Morrison has given the go-ahead to the Snowy 2.0 pumped hydro scheme , but it has needed an extra $1.4 billion of taxpayer 's money to get the pet project of predecessor Malcolm Turnbull- the man the Coalition dumped because they did n't trust him on climate and energy policy - over the line.Morrison and energy minister Angus Taylor rushed to the Snowy Mountains on Tuesday to make the announcement , the latest in a series to try and diffuse climate and energy policy as an election issue . <p> It follows the modest extension of the discredited Direct Action scheme , now rebranded as " Climate Solutions " fund , and a stream of other measures that will focus on energy efficiency , the vague promise of an electric vehicle strategy , and $56 million to " fast-track " Tasmania 's rival to Snowy 2.0 - the " Battery of the Nation " pumped hydro schemeand links to the mainland.But here 's the thing . Like the Tasmania scheme , Snowy 2.0 only makes financial sense if the exit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the market for these schemes if . The Coalition and its wholly owned Snowy Hydro are refusing to release the financial models that support the scheme.The federal government has already spent $6 billion buying out the stake held by the NSW and Victoria governments , but the new $1.4 billion cash injection into Snowy Hydro from federal taxpayers funds bodes ill . It suggests that Snowy Hydro is struggling to make the numbers for Snowy 2.0 add up . <p> There is no doubt Snowy Hydro itself sees Snowy 2.0 as essential to its own survival , because it has relatively little of its own capacity compared to its retail and business market share , and is a victim to market trends . It hopes that the complex contracting it will be able to enter into with Snowy 2.0 will give it more control of its finances.But will it make money ? Snowy 2.0 is being sold on the basis that you " buy low " and use cheap excess power ( either coal , or more hopefully wind and solar ) to pump water up hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the price is high and demand is peaking . But that has n't worked out so well over the last year . Data from the Australian Energy Market shows that the pumped hydro schemes that currently exist made virtually no margins from this activity . In the last quarter , they actually lost money and over the previous four quarters made virtually no money , AEMO data shows.It underlines the fact that what such schemes need is more volatility - and it will unlikely get that unless there is a big increase in the share of renewables , the sort of increase that the Coalition says would be " economy wrecking " if it takes place . Contracting will also play a critical role.Paul Hyslop , from ACIL Allen , wrote a detailed analysis last year questioning the financial metrics of the Snowy scheme , which will deliver 2,000MW of pumped hydro capacity and 175 hours of storage . Hyslop said Snowy 2.0 would deliver a " fraction " of the assumed market benefits to its owner , and such a huge scheme could struggle against competing technologies.Hyslop is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Snowy 2.0 , or its impact on emissions . Last year , Marsden mascons observed that the result of Snowy 2.0 would likely be to ' improve the economics of coal-fired generation " without a significant increase in renewables.ITK analyst and RenewEconomy contributor David Leitch observed in this piece , that the project would likely cause an increase in emissions unless there was a rapid increase in wind and solar.Snowy Hydro sought to downplay those concerns , and insist that their goal was to increase wind and solar.True , they announced late last year contracts with more than 930MW of wind and solar capacity that with firming from hydro would beat coal and gas on baseload costs.But in keeping with the information blackout , they would n't even reveal which projects had been contracted.Thanks to some detective work , we found out eventually.The decision - with little explanation - to inject an extra $1.4 billion suggests that the concern about the economics of the project is justified and is shared by the Snowy board and the governmentThe total cost , as far as we know , will be around $4.5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this.And that does not include the around $2 billion required for new transmission to deliver the scheme to where it 's needed . That will also be paid by electricity consumers , and not by Snowy Hydro.So , all up , taxpayers and consumers will foot at least half the bill , the government-owned utility the other half . Yet some suggest the overall bill could be significantly higher , up to $8 billion.There is no doubt storage is needed in a high renewables grid , but neither the government nor Snowy Hydro have made the case that their 's is the best option , over competing pumped hydro and battery storage projects.Yet they have sought to demonise batteries with some pretty silly modelling assumptions , repeated by Taylor on Tuesday of Snowy costing 50 times less than battery alternatives . <p> It 's a dubious claim to hang a multi-billion dollar investment on , but the impact of the government approval may be to make the market less interesting for battery investments , which was the general thrust of what was revealed in the first feasibility study.This is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 50-year investment will hold up against all the technology changes that might occur in the coming decades . The power grab may work for a decade or so , but beyond that there is the risk of this being a white elephant.So there are two themes worth thinking about.The support for Snowy 2.0 and Tasmania 's hydro " battery " underlines the bizarre nature of what the Coalition is proposing - professing to support coal fired generation and demonise wind and solar on one hand , and yet support vast multi-billion dollar budgets on the other hand that are based on the assumption that coal must be retired early.The $56 million funding to fast track the Tasmania project is looking particularly bizarre as its financials depend on a ) rapid exit of coal and high emissions targets , which the Coalition rejects , and b ) assumes the government does no ahead with Snowy 2.0 , but it now says that it will.It also underlines that this government is about yet more state intervention in the market . Both the big pumped hydro schemes are from government owned generators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at least in the short term.Many other pumped hydro projects will now likely re-assess and delay their investment , at least until after the next election and if and until a proper energy transition policy is put into place.Meanwhile , the government is persisting with mandated pricing caps , would like to impose strict " big stick " and forced divestiture policies to those private players that do not toe its line , and is pushing to underwrite new 24/7 generation that appears to be an attempt to fund more coal investment.That underwriting scheme - known as Fungi , or Federal Underwriting New Generation Investment , is now likely to fall by the wayside . with Taylor admitting on Tuesday that the government was unlikely to be able to complete contractsbefore the election campaign swings into action . <p> Giles ParkinsonGiles Parkinson is founder and editor of Renew Economy , and is also the founder of One Step Off The Gridand founder/editor of The Driven .

But the committee agreed to take on the analysis at the urging of coaches who want to minimize chances of clear and obvious mistakes going uncorrected . <p> The impetus , Vincent acknowledged , was a missed pass interference call that should have been called against Los Angeles Rams cornerback Nickell Robey-Coleman in the fourth quarter of the NFC Championship Game . <p> Rams defensive back Nickell Robey-Coleman 's ( 23 ) apparent pass interference against the Saints Tommylee Lewis in the NFC Championship game has spurred talk about adding a ' sky judge ' to officiating crews .

" <p> Speaking earlier in the week , multiple members of the committee reacted with skepticism when asked about expanding replay in response to the missed call on Robey-Coleman .

@@70581238 <h> 7 Apps That Can Give You Extra Cash <h> Aneth Ng-Lim <p> Most people need to be reminded to make their money work harder for them . Do n't leave your hard earned cash sitting in a savings account that hardly pays any interest . Instead , look at investment options with returns that will at least beat inflation and put the magic of compounding interest work for you . <p> But I recently discovered that you can also make your smart phone work harder for you . Use that gadget that may have cost you an arm and a leg to earn you some extra cash , by simply downloading a few choice apps that can give you more bang for the buck . It goes without saying that the rule here is to still only buy or pay for what you really plan on getting anyway . <p> SHOPBACK . I remember ignoring so many email invites from friends to try this but once I started using it , I was hooked . Shopback is essentially a cashback reward program and it 's available across Asia Pacific . They have more than 300 online partner stores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so relevant for me . Members can earn up to 30 percent cashback depending on the offered deal . Some stores confirm your cashback as soon as 48 hours after transaction while some will take weeks . But it 's money you can get through a bank account or credit to PayPal . <p> Now if I have to buy or book anything online , my starting point is Shopback . Books ? Groceries ? Hotels ? Airplane tickets ? I make sure to check if I can get cashback , and what do you know , sometimes I get lucky with discounts too . <p> EATIGO . We all dine out , and some more often than others . With Eatigo , you can book a table with a few clicks , and get up to 50 percent off in their featured restaurants . Yes , that 's not a typo -- I have used this app and paid half the cost of the food we enjoyed . Booking is free and you do not need to pay a subscription fee to become and stay a member . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just in Metro Manila . I 've used it in Laguna and Tagaytay , and there are thousands more I have yet to check out . <p> On top of the discount , Eatigo also runs promotions that rewards users with vouchers . You can claim these cash vouchers ( once , I was able to use P400 ) on top of the discount . What a steal , right ? Oh , and I earn Shopback too with every reservation . <p> METRODEAL . I was one of those who went crazy for Metrodeal when it was introduced in the Philippines , and when I started buying things I did n't really need , I stopped subscribing to the emails and also deleted the app . Now that I have ( I think ) better control on my spending impulses , I downloaded the app anew but no to getting the email offers . This way , I check the site only to see if they an offer for something I really plan on getting -- say unlimited Korean BBQ at Jin Joo Korean Grill . Our party of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and discovered a half price off through Metrodeal . And I clicked thru from Shopback . Metrodeal promises savings up to 90 percent on 1000s of great deals at nearby restaurants , spas , activities , shopping , travel and more in the Philippines and also in Thailand . <p> My word of caution though -- buy only vouchers you plan to use soon . If you see a great deal and think I can use this someday ... stop ! That path lies to unnecessary spending , not savings . <p> GRAB FOOD . Food delivery apps are also becoming more popular and sometimes it is cheaper to use them than for you to go and buy the food yourself . Strange right ? But these apps are trying to build their customer base so they are " rewarding " you to try them out and hoping you will like them enough to keep using them even when you have to start paying full price . I have tried several and right now I am loving Grab Food . As a new user , I got a voucher that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first 3 orders . After that , I would take advantage of promotions when available . What I like about Grab Food is that you can chat directly with the rider getting your food -- in case one dish is not available , or you want to add to your order . Plus the estimated delivery time is usually right , though you can only pay with cash . <p> HONESTBEE . Honestbee is also a good option for food delivery , and if you use Shopback , they 're partners so you earn cash rebate when you click thru from there . They have discount offers too and accept cash and credit card payments . I use Honestbee more often for grocery though , but I noticed that whether for food or grocery items , sometimes the online price is different from what 's on the physical stores . Maybe I have too much time in my hands but I like to be told that there is a premium being charged on top of the delivery fee and concierge fee . So buyer beware and stick to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's another food delivery service that I tried and disappointed me 8 times out of 10 . That 's because they handle mass orders , so one rider will sometimes have to wait out several orders in the same mall so their delivery time is nearly always late . You 're hangry ( hungry and angry ) by the time their pink uniformed rider comes around ... heavily pedaling on a bicycle . <p> AGODA . There are many online sites that offer travel deals and I have tried most of them but I find myself returning to Agoda often . They also offer Shopback or on certain dates dangle irresistible discounts from my credit card company . On top of the cashback and credit card deal , they also offer discounted rates -- plus a rebate if I go through with the booking . And anticipating that my plans may change , I always choose the free cancellation option . <p> BOOK DEPOSITORY . As a lifelong bookworm , my list wo n't be complete without an online bookstore . When I need hard-to-find books , or hardbound copies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My wish list is never empty , and so is my shopping cart . <p> Book Depository is also a partner of Shopback , so there 's the rebate and then most books are on sale or generally cheaper than local bookstore prices . Maybe I shop too much because I also regularly receive discount vouchers . But the reason this site beats Amazon for me is they offer free delivery ! <p> You may be wondering just how much extra cash we are talking about here . In my case , Shopback has paid me rebates of more than P50,000 in the two years or so I 've been a member . That 's money I would not have received despite being a loyal customer to the stores I frequent . So let your fingers do the saving .

Acme 's plan : Buy the plant " at a very low cost , " invest in carbon capture technology to lower its emissions , and then sell the captured CO2 to oil companies , said Larry Heller , a principal at the holding group . <p> By doing this , Acme " believes we can generate an acceptable rate of return , " Heller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's majority owner , PNM Resources Inc. , offers a distinctly different view .

At the same time , it imposes an emissions cap that 's 60 percent lower than San Juan 's current levels . <p> In response , Acme plans to spend $400 million to $800 million to retrofit the facility with carbon capture and sequestration technology that would collect carbon dioxide before it 's released into the atmosphere , Heller said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent , and the captured gas could be sold to oil companies , which uses it to enhance well recovery .

Additionally , to make it work at the San Juan plant , the company would need to figure out how to deliver the CO2 to customers since the nearest pipeline is about 20 miles ( 32 kilometers ) away . <h> Reducing Costs <p> Acme is also evaluating ways to reduce costs at San Juan , Heller said , including negotiating a cheaper coal-supply contract and qualifying for subsidies . <p> The deal comes amid a steady decline in the use of coal .

Additionally , any historical reference to the " first round " relates to the round of 64 , and " second round " is the same as the round of 32 . The First Four stands on its own for the purposes of this column to avoid confusion . <h> Quickie to mention off the top <p> Let 's get this one out of the way . No team has ever won a national championship after losing its first game in the conference tournament . Last year , only one top-four seed ( Auburn ) lost in its conference tourney opener . The Tigers were blown out in the second round by Clemson . This year , a trio of top-four seeds lost their conference tourney opener : LSU , Texas Tech and Purdue . Other notable tourney teams that also did so are Baylor , Ole Miss , VCU , UCF and Temple . <h> Why you should pay attention to the First Four games <p> Most bracket contests do n't count the Tuesday and Wednesday night NCAA tourney games , but there is data from the past eight years that may help identify an early upset candidate . <p> Exactly one team from the First Four has advanced to the second round each year since its inception in 2011 . But what 's more interesting is that , in seven of the eight years , it has been the team that won Wednesday 's non-16-seed game . In all , Tuesday night winners have won just one additional game in the tourney ( Wichita State in 2016 ) , while Wednesday 's winners have won 13 additional games in those eight years . Last year , it was Syracuse winning two more games to reach the Sweet 16 . <p> So , who plays in the late game on Wednesday , you ask ? Arizona State and St. John 's .

Houston just missed qualifying for this note , as the Cougars are ranked 11th . <h> Top-3 seed &amp; Top 10 in AP pollAfter entering season unranked <p> Lost in first round <p> 4 <p> Lost in second round <p> 20 <p> Lost in Sweet 16 <p> 16 <p> Lost in Elite Eight <p> 11 <p> Reached Final Four <p> 2 <p> Since 1985 <p> History has not been kind to the 53 teams fitting that profile in the modern tournament era . Of those 53 teams , only two reached the Final Four ( 2011 national champion UConn and 2018 runner-up Michigan ) . In other words , highly successful regular-season teams from completely off the radar do n't typically emerge as national title contenders . <p> Nearly half of those 53 teams ( 24 ) did n't even make it out of the first weekend , with the majority of those bowing out in the second round . <p> While Nos. 1 and 2 seeds that fit this profile have never reached the Final Four , at least the news is n't so bad for No. 3 seeds . Connecticut was a national champion in 2011 , Michigan reached the title game last year , and overall , 15 of the 21 No. 3 seeds with this profile reached the Sweet 16 , with six advancing to the Elite Eight . Only two were bounced in the first round ( New Mexico in 2013 , West Virginia in 2016 ) . <p> This year 's No. 1 and No. 2 seeds were all ranked in the preseason AP top 20 , so they are " safe " from the potential wrath of this trend . <h> Is there any advantage to being the No. 1 overall seed ? <p> Since 2017 , the No. 1 overall seed has had the right to choose one of the eight early-round sites to start its tourney journey . Unfortunately for the first two teams to earn that right , their journey also ended where it started . Last year , Virginia suffered the **26;1705;TOOLONG upset loss to UMBC in Charlotte . And two years ago in Buffalo , Villanova 's defense of its national title ended in the second round at the hands of Wisconsin . <p> Duke is the overall No. 1 seed this year . Since 2004 , when the selection committee began announcing the overall No. 1 seed , that team has reached the Final Four 46.7 percent of the time ( seven out of 15 ) , and that 's despite failing to get that far each of the past three years . Meanwhile , the other three No. 1 seeds have combined to reach the Final Four just 35.6 percent of the time ( 16 of 45 ) . <p> In this 15-year span , the No. 1 overall seed has won the title three times ( 20 percent ) , but has failed to survive the first weekend four times . Meanwhile , the other No. 1 seeds have combined to win seven championships ( 15.6 percent ) . At best , there 's only a slight edge to earning top billing , it would appear . <p> The only other time Duke was the No. 1 overall seed ( 2006 ) , it lost in the Sweet 16 to fourth-seeded LSU , which had Glen " Big Baby " Davis and Tyrus Thomas in the frontcourt . <h> Overall No. 1 seeds in NCAA tournament <p> Year <p> Team <p> Result <p> 2018 <p> Virginia <p> First Round <p> 2017 <p> Villanova <p> Second Round <p> 2016 <p> Kansas <p> Elite Eight <p> 2015 <p> Kentucky <p> Final Four <p> 2014 <p> Florida <p> Final Four <p> 2013 <p> Louisville <p> Won title <p> 2012 <p> Kentucky <p> Won title <p> 2011 <p> Ohio State <p> Sweet 16 <p> 2010 <p> Kansas <p> Second Round <p> 2009 <p> Louisville <p> Elite Eight <p> 2008 <p> North Carolina <p> Final Four <p> 2007 <p> Florida <p> Won title <p> 2006 <p> Duke <p> Sweet 16 <p> 2005 <p> Illinois <p> Runner-up <p> 2004 <p> Kentucky <p> Second Round <h> Three No. 1 seeds from the same conference <p> Atlantic Coast Conference teams Duke , Virginia and North Carolina all grabbed No. 1 seeds this year . This is the 10-year anniversary of the other time that three top seeds came from the same conference . In 2009 , Louisville , Connecticut and Pittsburgh earned No. 1s out of the Big East . <p> That year , while all three made it to the Elite Eight , only UConn reached the Final Four and none of them made the title game . The other No. 1 seed that year : North Carolina , which went on to win the national championship . <h> At-large teams with losing conference records do n't last <p> For the second straight year , the bubble was considered extremely weak . There 's no greater evidence of that than seeing four at-large teams in the tournament that finished below .500 in conference play . Last year , an NCAA tournament-record five such teams made the field . <p> Of the 41 previous teams with losing conference records to get at-large bids since 1985 , nearly half ( 20 ) won their first-round game , but only six advanced to the Sweet 16 , including Syracuse last year . In the modern era , the only team with a sub-.500 conference record to win more than two games ( not counting the First Four ) was LSU in 1987 , when the Tigers reached the Elite Eight . <p> This year , Oklahoma , Minnesota , Ohio State and St. John 's fit this description . <p> The Buckeyes ( 8-12 in the Big Ten ) and Sooners ( 7-11 in the Big 12 ) became the third and fourth teams to earn an at-large bid despite being four games under .500 in conference play . The previous two teams to do it both won their first-round game before bowing out in the second round . <p> In 1992 , Iowa State was just 5-9 in the Big Eight , but got a No. 10 seed and beat Charlotte before falling to second-seeded Kentucky . In 1998 , Florida State went 6-10 in the ACC , received a No. 12 seed and knocked off TCU before losing to No. 13 seed Valparaiso in OT . <p> It 's not easy to repeat <p> Villanova is attempting to become the first repeat champion since 2006-07 Florida . Even getting back to the Final Four would be quite an accomplishment , and not just because the Wildcats are n't expected to do so , as their No. 6 seed would suggest . Just seven defending champs have returned to the Final Four since seeding began . <p> Taking it a step further ... <p> Forget about repeating , or following up a title with a Final Four appearance . It has been a challenge for defending champions to win more than a game or two . Since Florida 's repeat in 2007 , no defending champion has gotten past the Sweet 16 . Last year , defending-champion North Carolina lost in the second round , despite being a No. 2 seed . The year before that , Villanova was the No. 1 overall seed and could n't get past the second round , either . <h> First-round matchups <p> Filling out your bracket is a ton of fun , but picking the right upsets is hard . One thing that happens most years but is difficult to predict is a top-four seed losing its first game . Only once in the past 11 years have all of the top four seeds in each region survived the first round , and five times in 34 years ( 1994 , 2000 , 2004 , 2007 , 2017 ) . <p> Here 's a look at seed-versus-seed data for each of the first-round matchups and trends that have emerged in recent years . <p> 1 vs. 16 Finally , we have a reference point to say that No. 16 seeds do have a chance ... even if it 's a really small one . <p> UMBC 's shocking 20-point win against Virginia last year was the first by a 16-seed over No. 1 seeds in 136 all-time meetings . That large margin of victory is right in line with what No. 1s have done to No. 16s through the years . Dating back to 1998 , only four of 84 matchups have been decided by single digits , all of which came in a three-year span ( 2012-14 ) . One of this year 's top seeds , Gonzaga , played in one of those four games when it got a scare from Southern in 2013 before winning by six . <p> 2 vs. 15 Only eight times in 34 years has a No. 2 seed lost to a 15-seed . Three of those eight losses came in 2012 and 2013 , however . Since then , 18 of the 20 meetings have been decided by double figures ( average margin of 18.3 points ) . The only upset in the past five years was Middle Tennessee 's 90-81 decision over Michigan State in 2016 , when the Spartans were a popular pick to win the title . <p> Of the eight No. 15 seeds to win a game , seven of them finished in the top two in their standings . The only exception was Santa Clara in 1993 , which finished third in the West Coast Conference . <p> Among this year 's No. 15s , three of the four finished in the top two in their conference during the regular season : Abilene Christian , Colgate and Montana . Bradley tied for fifth place in the Missouri Valley Conference . <p> The last 14-seed to win in the tournament was Stephen F. Austin , led by Thomas Walkup , when it knocked off West Virginia in 2016 . Robert Deutsch-USA TODAY Sports <p> 3 vs. 14 No. 3 seeds have won 84.6 percent of all-time meetings with No. 14 seeds , and have swept all four tourney matchups in back-to-back years for the first time since 2011-12 . That 's noteworthy because 14-seeds enjoyed an impressive four-year run when they won five games from 2013-16 . The last time No. 14 seeds failed to win a game in three straight years ? A decade ago , from 2007 to 2009 . <p> Call it a coincidence , but the past three No. 3s to lose in the first round all came from the Big 12 : West Virginia ( 2016 ) , Baylor ( 2015 ) and Iowa State ( 2015 ) . Last year , Texas Tech was in danger of joining that group before coming back to beat Stephen F. Austin with a 13-2 run in the final four minutes to win by 10 . And the Red Raiders are No. 3 seeds again this year . They 'll face the Norse of Northern Kentucky on Friday in Tulsa . <p> 4 vs. 13 No. 13 seeds entered last year 's tournament in their worst drought ever . They had just one win in the previous four years , after winning at least one game in six straight tourneys from 2008 to 2013 . <p> Last year , No. 13s got their upset mojo back , as Buffalo throttled Arizona and Marshall knocked off Wichita State -- and the other two ( UNC Greensboro and Charleston ) lost by just four points . That marked just the fourth time in 34 years that two 13-seeds won a first-round game in the same tournament ( also 1987 , 2001 , 2008 ) . <p> Obviously picking the right 13-over-4 upset is n't easy , but more often than not it is something that happens at least once each year . A No. 13 seed has won at least one game in 24 of 34 years . <p> 5 vs. 12 For years , the first upset discussions once the bracket is revealed have centered around the 5-12 matchup , and the historical data explains why . <p> Only five times since 1985 has at least one No. 12 seed failed to defeat a 5-seed in a single tournament . However , two of those five instances have occurred in the past four years ( 2015 , 2018 ) . <p> Overall , No. 5 seeds have won 65.4 percent of matchups with No. 12s . The most recent 12-seed to win a game was Middle Tennessee in 2017 when the Blue Raiders knocked off Minnesota , but it was n't even an upset , as they were favored in the game . <p> For those of you into wagering , here 's a tidbit of note : Since 2000 , No. 5 seeds have lost straight up all three times they were n't favored against No. 12 seeds . <h> No. 5 seeds when not favored in first round <p> Yr/No. 5 Seed <p> Opponent <p> Spread <p> Result <p> 2017 Minnesota <p> Middle Tennessee <p> +1.5 <p> Lost by 9 <p> 2006 Syracuse <p> Texas A&amp;M <p> Even <p> Lost by 8 <p> 2001 Virginia <p> Gonzaga <p> +3.5 <p> Lost by 1 <p> Since 2000 <p> 6 vs. 11 No seed matchup has been turned on its head like this one . <p> From 1985 to 2009 , No. 6 seeds won 69 percent of the meetings , but in the past nine years , they have won just 44 percent . It has been decidedly worse for 6-seeds in the past three years , as they have lost eight of the 12 matchups . <p> The tide may have turned between these seeds , but one thing that has remained unlikely is a sweep . It has been 15 years since the No. 6 seeds swept all four meetings , and this year marks the 30th anniversary of the only time No. 11 seeds won all four meetings . <p> 7 vs. 10 The 7-10 pairing used to be much closer to a toss-up than it has been in recent years . <p> From 1985 to 2012 , No. 7 seeds won 59.8 percent of meetings with 10-seeds . But since 2013 , 7-seeds have won 71 percent of the matchups , winning three of the four first-round meetings in five of those six years . <p> By comparison , No. 10 seeds have done that just four times ever , even if you go back to when seeding began in 1979 . <p> But do n't let the recent dominance by 7-seeds fool you -- the games have still been extremely competitive . Since 2010 , no first-round seed pairing has had more games decided by single digits than this one ( 27 ) , including 12 decided by three points or fewer or in overtime . Last year , a pair of 7-10 matchups went to OT ( Nevada over Texas , Rhode Island over Oklahoma ) . <p> Not that it means anything , but we have seen a No. 7 Cincinnati versus No. 10 Iowa matchup in the South Region before , back in 2005 . In that one , the Bearcats beat the Hawkeyes 76-64 . <p> 8 vs. 9 You expect these to be 50-50 games , and historically they are exactly that , as they have split the 136 meetings in the modern era . If you 're looking for something recent to grab onto , No. 9 seeds have won three of the four meetings two times in the past three years . That 's something they did n't do even once from 2008 to 2015 . <h> Sweet 16/Elite Eight <p> How do the top 16 seeds generally fare ? <p> We already touched upon how unlikely it is that all of the top four seeds in each region will escape the first round , but here 's what history says about advancement to the second week of tourney play in the modern era : <p> * On average , 9.9 of the top 16 seeded teams advance to the Sweet 16 each year . Last year , only seven did so , which tied the record for the fewest in a single tournament ( it also happened in 1986 , 1990 and 2000 ) . Will these " protected seeds " do any better at avoiding early-round heartbreak this year ? <p> * The top four seeds in a region have reached the Sweet 16 in only 17 of 136 regions ( 12.5 percent ) since 1985 . Essentially , that means it happens in one region every two years on average . It did n't happen in last year 's tournament , for what that 's worth . <p> In case you need any more reasons to think outside the box , the top four seeds in two regions have advanced past the first weekend in the same tournament just three times ( 1989 , 1991 , 2009 ) , but only once in the past 27 years . <p> * Only once in the past 22 years have we had a Sweet 16 in which all the 2-seeds were still alive , and a total of just four times in the modern era ( 1989 , 1995 , 1996 , 2009 ) . <p> * Fewer than three No. 3 seeds have reached the Sweet 16 in seven of the past nine tournaments . Only twice have all four 3-seeds made it ( 2008 , 2009 ) and just once have they been shut out entirely ( 1997 ) . <p> * Last year , only one No. 4 seed made the Sweet 16 , ending a streak of seven straight tournaments in which multiple 4-seeds got that far . Included in that streak are the only two times in which all four No. 4s survived the first weekend ( 2014 , 2017 ) . <p> * Only three times have all Elite Eight participants been seeded fourth or better ( 1995 , 2007 , 2009 ) . In fact , there have been multiple teams seeded worse than fourth in the Elite Eight in 18 of 34 years . And in each of the past three years , and four of the past five , we 've had multiple teams seeded sixth or worse in the Elite Eight . <p> * There has never been an Elite Eight without a No. 1 seed present , and 31 of 34 Elite Eights have featured at least two top seeds ( 2000 , 2011 and 2013 are the only tourneys with just one No. 1 seed ) . In case you 're wondering , all four No. 1 seeds have reached the Elite Eight on eight occasions , although that has happened only once in the past nine years ( 2016 ) . <p> * In each of the past 11 tournaments , we have seen one or two No. 2 seeds reach the Elite Eight . Included in this span is a streak of eight straight years in which exactly two No. 2 seeds made it there from 2009 to 2016 . <p> How many double-digit seeds will make the Sweet 16 ? <p> You can expect at least one team seeded 10th or worse to advance to the second week of play . It has happened in 32 of the 34 years since the field expanded to 64 teams . Generally , you will see between one and three double-digit seeds reach the Sweet 16 . <h> Number of double-digit seeds in Sweet 16Single tournament , Since 1985 <p> No. of instances <p> Last time <p> Zero <p> 2 <p> 2007 <p> One <p> 8 <p> 2017 <p> Two <p> 9 <p> 2018 <p> Three <p> 12 <p> 2014 <p> Four <p> 2 <p> 2011 <p> Five <p> 1 <p> 1999 <p> Proof that 11 is the new 12 <p> One of the more interesting trends in the past handful of years has been the annual presence of an 11-seed in the Sweet 16 . As bracket numerologists can surely attest , this discussion used to be about the No. 12 seeds , but no longer ( more on that in a moment ) . <p> At least one No. 11 seed has reached the Sweet 16 in each of the past five tournaments , its longest such streak . By comparison , zero No. 12 seeds have made the Sweet 16 in the same span . <p> Looking at the past four years , No. 11s have won an impressive 18 games ( and that 's not counting the First Four games ) , while 12-seeds have just three wins . Only 15- and 16-seeds have fewer in that span . <p> This is n't just coincidence , though . Blame it on the expansion of the field to 68 teams , along with the addition of another higher-major automatic bid when the American Athletic Conference was formed . <p> In those past four years , all 22 teams seeded 12th or worse have been automatic qualifiers ( which is the case again this year ) . That means the final at-large teams in the tournament -- often major-conference teams with a mix of high-quality wins and puzzling losses , or dangerous mid-majors whose seeds may have been impacted by uninspiring strength of schedule -- have all been No. 11 seeds . This does n't mean you should shy away from No. 12s altogether , but the general quality of these teams has been altered some . <h> Sweet 16 appearances by seedSince 2010 <p> Seed <p> Appearances <p> No. 1 <p> 28 <p> No. 2 <p> 21 <p> No. 3 <p> 18 <p> No. 4 <p> 21 <p> No. 5 <p> 10 <p> No. 6 <p> 7 <p> No. 7 <p> 9 <p> No. 8 <p> 4 <p> No. 9 <p> 4 <p> No. 10 <p> 5 <p> No. 11 <p> 11 <p> No. 12 <p> 3 <p> No. 13 <p> 2 <p> No. 15 <p> 1 <p> Half of the instances ( 11 of 22 ) in which No. 11 seeds have made the Sweet 16 have come in just the past nine years . How good is that ? Other than the top four seeds , No. 11s have reached the second weekend more often than any other seed in this span . <p> Once there , No. 11 seeds have had a reasonable amount of success -- or at least more than you might expect from such a low seed . But , as you also might expect , it depends on the opposition . <p> They are 8-14 overall in Sweet 16 games , but just 2-13 when facing No. 2 seeds ( 4-0 versus No. 7s and 2-1 against No. 10s ) . Once again due to tough opposition , No. 12 seeds are just 1-19 in Sweet 16 games , with all 19 losses coming against No. 1 seeds ( the only win coming in 2002 when Missouri beat No. 8 seed UCLA ) . <p> No. 6s feeling the pinch <p> Naturally , the success of No. 11 seeds is affecting their first-round pairing partner . For just the second time ever , no 6-seeds have reached the Sweet 16 in back-to-back years ( also in 2008-09 ) . Will they avoid being shut out from advancing to the second week of play three years in a row for the first time ? <p> Elite Eight dry spells <p> The last time a No. 5 seed reached the Elite Eight was 2011 , when Arizona defeated Duke to get there . Since then , 5-seeds have lost seven straight Sweet 16 games , including three last year . <p> Yet another negative note on 6-seeds : They have just one Elite Eight appearance in the past eight years ( 2016 Notre Dame ) . In that span , No. 7 seeds have made four Elite Eights . ( Unfortunately , I 'm not done detailing the struggles for No. 6 seeds , as you 'll see in the Final Four section below . ) <h> Final Four <p> How many No. 1 seeds generally make the Final Four ? <p> The safe play is to pick one or two . <p> At least one No. 1 seed has reached the Final Four seven straight years and 11 of the past 12 . Multiple 1-seeds have made the Final Four three times in the past four years after it did n't happen at all from 2010 to 2014 . In 2011 , no 1- or 2-seeds made it , marking the only time that has ever happened . As you go through your bracket , it may be hard to eliminate a No. 1 seed , but remember that history shows it 's more likely that no top seeds reach the Final Four than it is that all four of them do . The only time all four No. 1s got there was 11 years ago . <p> Here is a breakdown of how many No. 1 seeds have reached the Final Four since the beginning of seeding in 1979 : <p> None -- 3 times One -- 15 times Two -- 17 times Three -- 4 times Four -- 1 time <p> Loyola-Chicago 's Cinderella story last year began with Donte Ingram 's game-winning 3-pointer to beat Miami . AP Photo/Tony Gutierrez <p> Will we see yet another surprise Final Four squad ? <p> It has been a pretty remarkable run for Cinderella in the Big Dance lately . Last year , the slipper fit for 11th-seeded Loyola-Chicago . There has been at least one Final Four team seeded seventh or worse each of the past six years , which is easily the longest such streak in NCAA tournament history ( more on a potential connection in the next note below ) . <p> Since seeding began in 1979 , only 17 teams seeded seventh or worse have reached the Final Four , but nine of those have come in the past eight years ! <h> Final Four participants seeded 7th or worseSince 2011 <p> Seed <p> 2018 Loyola-Chicago <p> 11 <p> 2017 South Carolina <p> 7 <p> 2016 Syracuse <p> 10 <p> 2015 Michigan State <p> 7 <p> 2014 Kentucky <p> 8 <p> 2014 Connecticut** <p> 7 <p> 2013 Wichita State <p> 9 <p> 2011 VCU <p> 11 <p> 2011 Butler <p> 8 <p> **Won championship <p> Finding Cinderella ... in Virginia 's bracket ? <p> I think this is one of the more interesting trends going . <p> Building off of the note above , each of the past five years the Final Four team to come from Virginia 's bracket has been seeded seventh or worse . In four of those five years , the Cavaliers were seeded a No. 1 or 2 ... which is again the case this year . In two of these years ( 2015 , 2016 ) UVA lost to the team that reached the Final Four . Will Virginia finally perform up to its seed ? If not , which surprise team would you pick to come out of the South region ? <h> Team to reach Final Four from Virginia 's regionPast 5 years <p> Year <p> UVA seed <p> When UVA lost <p> Final Four team ( Seed ) <p> 2018 <p> 1 <p> First round <p> Loyola-Chicago ( 11 ) <p> 2017 <p> 5 <p> Second round <p> South Carolina ( 7 ) <p> 2016 <p> 1 <p> Elite Eight <p> Syracuse ( 10 ) <p> 2015 <p> 2 <p> Second round <p> Michigan State ( 7 ) <p> 2014 <p> 1 <p> Sweet 16 <p> Connecticut ( 7 ) <p> Miscellaneous tidbits <p> * For just the fourth time ever -- and the first time since 1999-2000 -- back-to-back Final Fours were held without a No. 2 seed . It has never happened in three straight years . <p> * We have had consecutive Final Fours involving at least one No. 3 seed , only the third time that has happened . It occurred in three straight tournaments from 1989 to 1991 . <p> * The last Final Four appearance by a No. 4 seed came in 2013 , when both Michigan and Syracuse squared off in the national semis . The last Final Four trip for a No. 5 seed came in 2010 under similar circumstances , as Butler and Michigan State faced each other . Among the seeds that have reached the Final Four at least once -- think 11-seed or better -- the only seed experiencing a bigger drought is ... <p> * Guess who ? Only three No. 6 seeds have made it to the Final Four , but it has been 27 years since the last time it happened ( Michigan in 1992 , Kansas in 1988 and Providence in 1987 ) . <p> * When you 're looking for potential Final Four teams , your eyes do n't wander to the 7/10 matchups on the bracket . But last year was the first time in five years that neither a No. 7 nor a No. 10 was among the last four standing . Before UConn 's 2014 run to begin the streak , neither seed had gotten that far in the modern era . <p> * Last year , Loyola-Chicago became the fourth No. 11 seed to reach the Final Four ( joining LSU in 1986 , George Mason in 2006 and VCU in 2011 ) . Those four trips are more than the Nos. 6 , 7 , 9 and 10 seeds have in the modern era . <p> For what it 's worth , there are definitely some 7s and 10s with tournament pedigree this year , like Louisville , Cincinnati and Florida . <h> Championship game <p> They are No. 1s for a reason <p> Despite all the talk about upsets in this column , when it comes to picking a winner , going with a No. 1 seed is a strong percentage play . In the modern era , 62 percent of champions have been 1-seeds , but the No. 1 vibe is even stronger when we look at the past 20 years . <p> * No. 1s have won 14 titles in that span . The other six titles have been split by 3-seeds ( three ) , 2-seeds ( two ) and 7-seeds ( one ) . In the past 12 years , No. 1 seeds have won nine championships and no other seed has more than one . <p> * 1-seeds also have the most championship-game losses in the past two decades with seven . However , six of those seven losses came against other No. 1 seeds . The only exception came in 2016 , when No. 2 seed Villanova beat No. 1 seed North Carolina on Kris Jenkins ' buzzer-beater . <p> Common traits of recent champions <p> What do each of the past 10 champions have in common ? <p> * Top 35 in both adjusted offensive and defensive efficiency * Top 30 strength of schedule , according to KenPom.com * Member of a major conference * Had won a national championship previously * Had a player who was a first- , second- or third-team All-American <p> Which teams in this year 's field fit the bill ? <p> Since All-America teams wo n't be announced for another couple of weeks , we will replace that element with teams who have a first-team all-conference selection instead . Here are the teams we are left to choose from : <p> Here are other facts of note , related to cutting down the nets on April 8 : <p> * In the modern tournament era ( since the field expanded to 64 teams in 1985 ) , only two champions came from a conference that received fewer than four bids ... and none since 1990 . Louisville and " Never Nervous " Pervis Ellison won in 1986 from the three-bid Metro Conference , while Tark the Shark and the dynamic 1990 UNLV Runnin ' Rebels represented the Big West Conference , which also received three bids . This year , Gonzaga is the only top-four seed from a conference that received fewer than four bids . <p> * Much has been said in this column about the shortcomings of No. 6 seeds in the tournament , but they have won two championships . Which is two more than No. 5 seeds have . Three 5-seeds have reached the title game , but it has been nine years since that has happened ( Butler in 2010 , in addition to Indiana in 2002 and Florida in 2000 ) . No. 5s remain the only top-eight seed without a championship . <h> Conferences <p> NOTE : References are since 1985 , unless otherwise noted <p> Below is a little something on each of the 32 conferences . Some are known as underachievers , while others are perennial threats to pull a surprise . <p> The America East can forever lay claim as the conference that supplied the first No. 16 seed to beat a No. 1 . UMBC 's shocking blowout of Virginia was only the conference 's fourth win in the first round , and its first since 2005 . But do n't let the lack of wins cloud your view of how competitive America East teams have been against high seeds . Two years ago , Vermont hung around against No. 4 seed Purdue before falling by 10 , and Albany put up a good fight three years in a row , from 2013 to 2015 , against No. 2 Duke ( lost by 12 ) , No. 1 Florida ( lost by 12 ) and No. 3 Oklahoma ( lost by 9 ) . This year , Vermont got a 13-seed and will face Florida State on Thursday in Hartford . <p> Fans of the American Athletic Conference like to think back to simpler times , when things were fresh and new , because there have n't been many good memories since . In 2014 , four teams made the tournament , two made the Sweet 16 and one team , UConn , became the first No. 7 seed in the modern era to not only reach the Final Four but win the championship . In the four years since , no American team has made it past the first weekend , and the conference has a total of five wins in that span . The games have not lacked for drama , though , as six of the 10 first-round games in the past four years have been decided by one or two points . Last year , Houston suffered a heart-breaking loss to Michigan on Jordan Poole 's buzzer-beater in the second round , but the Cougars are back and even more dangerous this year , as a 3-seed . <p> When it comes to Atlantic 10 teams in the tourney , there is a lot to say , and it 's really about whether you are a glass-half-empty or glass-half-full person . <h> Conferences with most wins by double-digit seeds <p> Atlantic 10 <p> 25 <p> Big East <p> 24 <p> WCC <p> 20 <p> Missouri Valley <p> 19 <p> SEC <p> 19 <p> ACC <p> 18 <p> Colonial <p> 18 <p> Pac-12 <p> 18 <p> MAC <p> 17 <p> Since 1985 ( not including First Four games ) <p> If you are the former , you would say that no A-10 teams have reached the Sweet 16 in the past four years , the conference 's longest such dry spell . If you are the latter , you would point out that the league has n't had a team seeded higher than seventh in those four years , so they were n't expected to get that far . Then you would happily explain the following : <p> The A-10 had a double-digit seed win a first-round game seven straight years ( 2011-17 ) , a streak that came to an end last year . No other conference in NCAA tournament history has done that in more than four consecutive tournaments ( Pac-12 from 2012-15 and Conference USA from 2015-18 ) . And for good measure , you would add that the past four Sweet 16 teams from the Atlantic 10 have been seeded 10th or worse . <p> This is the first time in 12 years the conference failed to get at least three bids . However , if your glass is truly half full , Saint Louis is double-digit seed ( 13 ) . <p> No conference has been more prolific than the ACC in terms of sending teams to the tournament in recent years . This is the fourth straight year the league has sent at least seven teams to the Dance , the longest current streak in the nation . But getting through the first weekend has been problematic , even for the highest seeds . <p> Two years ago , just one of the ACC 's nine tourney teams reached the Sweet 16 ( national champion North Carolina ) , as two No. 2 seeds and a No. 3 lost in the second round . Last year , while four of the nine teams got to the Sweet 16 , No. 1 Virginia and No. 2 North Carolina were eliminated in the first two rounds , and no teams reached the Final Four for the first time in four years . <p> As mentioned earlier , the ACC received a trio of No. 1 seeds . Will they avoid the upset bug this time around ? <p> Atlantic Sun teams have been very competitive in recent years , including 14th-seeded Mercer 's upset of Duke in 2014 and FGCU becoming the first No. 15 seed to reach the Sweet 16 in 2013 . This year , Liberty received a No. 12 , the conference 's best seed since 2001 . <p> You could say the Big 12 has generally underachieved in the first 22 years of existence , when you consider it averages 5.7 bids per year ( 1.3 of which are top-two seeds ) . <p> Despite those numbers , the conference has totaled just nine Final Fours , three championship-game appearances and one title ( 2008 Kansas in 2008 ) . Getting over the hump has been hard for the league , as teams are just 3-10 in Elite Eight games over the past 10 years . <p> The past two years have provided some hope in the early rounds , though . After seeing seven top-five seeds eliminated in Round 1 between 2012 and 2016 , that did n't happen at all in 2017 and 2018 . And in the past three tournaments , Big 12 teams are 10-1 in the second round . <p> That said , it 's a greater challenge than usual this year , because the conference is without a top-two seed for the first time in 20 years , and just the second time ever . <p> The Big 12 received six bids , but there 's no powerhouse Kansas team to lean on this time around , as the Jayhawks are a No. 4 this year . Texas Tech is the highest-seeded Big 12 team this year , as a No. 3 in the West region . <p> It has truly been championship or bust for the " new " Big East , during its five years with the current membership . And when I say " Big East , " I really mean Villanova . The Wildcats have won two of the past three national championships , but other than that , it 's been pretty ugly . Despite receiving 28 bids in this five-year span -- 10 of which have been top-four seeds -- the conference has had just five teams reach the Sweet 16 ( they are 5-12 in second-round games ) . While Villanova has obviously carried the mail for the league , they have also failed to deliver by losing in the second round the three years they did n't win the title ... all as a top-two seed . To make matters worse this year , while the league was ultra-competitive , this year 's highest seed is Marquette , which got a No. 5 in the West region . The only other time the Big East 's best team did n't get a top-four seed was in the conference 's second year , back in 1981 , when Boston College was a 5-seed . Heck , this is the first time the Big East did n't have a top-two seed since 2001 ( also Boston College , as a 3-seed ) . <p> The Big Sky is just 3-34 in the NCAA tournament since 1985 and has just one win in the 2000s , when Montana defeated Nevada in 2006 as a 12-seed . The conference has not received a seed that high since then . This year , Montana is making its second straight appearance , as a No. 15 in the West region . The Grizzlies will get a rematch of their first-round game from last year , when they gave eventual national runner-up Michigan some trouble early before falling by 14 . <p> The Big South has n't had it easy in the NCAA tournament . This is the 18th time in 28 appearances that the conference 's representative got a 16-seed . That goes a long way toward explaining why the Big South has just one win in the round of 64 . That win came 12 years ago , and by the only conference team ever seeded better than 13th ( Winthrop , as a No. 11 seed , defeated Notre Dame ) . Gardner-Webb is making its NCAA tournament debut , and the Bulldogs will face a tall order by the name of Virginia on Friday . <p> Mateen Cleaves helped lead Michigan State to the championship in 2000 , the last time a Big Ten team hoisted the trophy . Jed Jacobsohn/Getty Images <p> It 's been a long wait for a championship for the Big Ten . It 's been 19 years since Mateen Cleaves , Morris Peterson and Charlie Bell took Michigan State all the way . Since then , the seven conference teams to reach the title game have come up short , including Michigan last year . Is this the year the Big Ten gets back in the winner 's circle ? Michigan State and Michigan are both 2-seeds , and Purdue is a No. 3 . <p> Big West Conference teams have just one win in the round of 64 in the past 13 years ( No. 13 seed Hawaii over Cal in 2016 ) . Simply put , Big West teams have n't been able to overcome the low seeds that have become a regular thing . That 2016 Hawaii team actually has the Big West 's only first-round win for teams seeded 13th or worse ( 1-19 ) . Interestingly , No. 12 seeds are 3-3 in the modern era , and only once in the past 26 years has the conference earned a better seed than that . This year , 13-seed UC Irvine enters the tournament with 16 straight wins . <p> The Colonial Athletic Association has been giving NCAA tournament opponents fits for years , but does n't have a ton of wins to show for it . The CAA has n't won a first-round game in each of the past six years , its longest such streak in the modern era . While 2006 George Mason and 2011 VCU were 11-seeds when they reached the Final Four , the last win by a CAA squad seeded 13th or worse came in 2002 , when Brett Blizzard and UNC Wilmington knocked off USC . That said , if you go back to 2001 , 18 of the past 22 first-round games involving CAA teams have ended in victory or a single-digit loss ( 14 by five points or less ) . Northeastern is this year 's rep , which should make Kansas nervous . <h> CAA teams in first round , Past 4 years <p> Year/Team ( Seed ) <p> Result <p> 2018 Charleston ( 13 ) <p> Lost to Auburn by 4 <p> 2017 UNC Wilmington ( 12 ) <p> Lost to Virginia by 5 <p> 2016 UNC Wilmington ( 12 ) <p> Lost to Duke by 8 <p> 2015 Northeastern ( 14 ) <p> Lost to Notre Dame by 4 <p> Despite receiving just one bid and getting no better than a 12-seed , Conference USA has won a game in each of the past four years . Last year , Jon Elmore led 13-seeded Marshall past Wichita State . The two years before that , Middle Tennessee took down a pair of Big Ten teams as a 12- and 15-seed , and in 2015 14th-seeded UAB upset Iowa State . Will 14th-seeded Old Dominion extend the streak this year ? The Monarchs will square off with Purdue on Thursday . <p> Things just have n't been the same for the Horizon League since Butler left . The league 's seven-year winless streak in the tournament win is its longest ever . Butler has 13 of the Horizon 's past 14 tourney wins ( Cleveland State has the other ) , which dates back to 2007 . Poor seeding has the Horizon swimming upstream , as this is the eighth straight year the conference representative has been seeded 13th or worse ( Northern Kentucky is a No. 14 seed in the West region ) . The lowest-seeded league team to win an NCAA tournament game was 14th-seeded Xavier in 1991 , when it was called the Midwestern Collegiate Conference . <p> The Ivy League champion has been a handful for first-round opponents in recent years . Ivy teams are 4-5 in the first round the past nine years , with the only double-digit loss coming last year from a No. 16 seed ( Penn lost by 16 to Kansas ) . Of the other four losses in that span , three have come by exactly two points . There has been a difference in competitiveness between 12- and 13- seeds and teams seeded 14th or worse , as you might expect . <p> Teams seeded 14th or worse are 1-13 with three single-digit losses . No. 13 seeds still have just one win ( 1-6 ) , but with a pair of two-point losses to bluebloods in 2011 ( Princeton vs . Kentucky ) and 2015 ( Harvard vs . North Carolina ) . No. 12s have had the most success ( 3-4 , with all losses by single digits ) . <p> This year , Yale is a 14-seed in the East , so LSU should expect a fight on Thursday . The Bulldogs won their first NCAA tournament game in 2016 when they beat Baylor as a No. 12 seed . <p> The MAAC has n't had a team win a game since 2009 , when Fran McCaffery was coaching No. 9 seed Siena to a double-OT victory over Ohio State . For the fourth straight year , Iona won the MAAC tournament , and the Gaels have had a different seed each of those years . They have lost by an average of 17 points in the first round as a 13- , 14- and 15- seed , and this year they will play North Carolina as a 16-seed . <p> Last year , the Mid-American Conference got a monkey off its back when Buffalo became the first MAC team to win an NCAA tournament game since 2012 , when it throttled Arizona by 21 . That was as a No. 13 seed . This year , it 's a completely different story , as the expectations sixth-seeded Buffalo carries into this year 's Big Dance are unlike any a MAC team has experienced in the modern era . Since 1985 , the highest seed the MAC had received until this year was a No. 9 , done on three occasions ( 1989 Ball State in 1989 , 1996 Eastern Michigan in 1996 , 2008 Kent State in 2008 ) . If you go back to 1979 , when seeding began and the field was smaller , Toledo was a No. 5 that year and won one game to reach the round of 16 . The MAC has had just one Sweet 16 team in the past 16 years ( Ohio in 2012 ) and one Elite Eight team in the modern era ( 2002 Kent State in 2002 ) . On the 20th anniversary of Wally Szczerbiak and Miami ( Ohio ) dashing to the Sweet 16 as a 10-seed , will Buffalo give the MAC something new to celebrate ? <p> The MEAC has n't played a first-round game since 2016 , as its teams have lost in the First Four the past two years . On the positive side , the conference does own three of the eight wins by No. 15 seeds in the first round ( the only conference with multiple wins as a 15-seed ) , the last coming when Norfolk State shocked Missouri in 2012 . On the contrary , all 25 of their losses in the first round have come by double digits ( an average of 23.8 points ) . The MEAC has never received anything better than a 14-seed , and even that has happened only twice in the past 35 years . For the fourth time in five years , the MEAC rep ( North Carolina Central ) will trek to Dayton for the First Four . If NCCU beats North Dakota State , it will face top-seeded Duke on Friday . <p> Missouri Valley Conference teams are on quite a run , with the latest hit being Loyola-Chicago 's fun ride to the Final Four last year as an 11-seed . But the conference has another feather in its cap , too . The Valley is the only conference to win a first-round game each of the past six years without a loss ( 9-0 ) , and has done so despite its teams being seeded fifth or worse in eight of those nine games , including four double-digit seeds the past three years . The MVC has at least one NCAA tourney win in seven straight years despite supplying no more than two teams in any of those years . This is the third straight year the conference has just one representative , as Bradley makes its first appearance since making a its surprising run to the Sweet 16 as a No. 13 seed in 2006 . The task is even taller this time around , as the Braves are the lowest-seeded Valley team ever , as a No. 15 in the East . They will face Michigan State in the first round . <p> To say the Mountain West Conference has struggled in the tournament would be an understatement . The conference is 22-47 overall ( .319 win pct. ) and just six teams have advanced to the Sweet 16 in the first 17 years of its existence . The MW has never had a team reach the Elite Eight , and No. 7 seed Nevada and No. 8 seed Utah State hope to be the first to do that . <p> The Northeast Conference is the only conference that has never won a first-round game ( 0-30 ) , and NEC teams have n't come close to that elusive victory very often , either . Only once in the past 20 years has an NEC team come within single digits of its opponent in the round of 64 ( Robert Morris lost to Villanova by 3 in overtime in 2010 ) . As is often the case , the inability to earn a better seed is a constant struggle . No. 16 seed Fairleigh Dickinson is this year 's automatic qualifier , making it 17 straight years the conference has gotten a 15- or 16-seed . Even worse , this is the seventh straight year the selection committee has sent the NEC rep to First Four , meaning a trip to the round of 64 is still a win away . Overall , NEC teams are just 2-4 in the First Four . <p> Ja Morant has been must-see TV this season . Will he lead Murray State to its first tourney victory in seven years ? Brian Spurlock-USA TODAY Sports <p> Since 1985 , the Ohio Valley Conference has won just six first-round games , all coming in a pair of three-year bunches ( one win each from 1987-89 and 2010-12 ) . In all other years , the conference is 0-28 in the first round , with each loss the past six years coming by double digits . Murray State is back as a 12-seed this year , but the real news is 11th-seeded Belmont making the field as an at-large . <p> The only other time the OVC placed multiple teams in the field was 1987 . That year , the automatic qualifier , No. 14 seed Austin Peay , shocked Illinois , making Dick Vitale deliver on his promise to stand on his head if the Govs won ( look it up ! ) , while the at-large entry , No. 12 seed Middle Tennessee , lost to Notre Dame by 13 . <p> Murray State is the last OVC team to win a game in the tourney , when they beat Colorado State as a No. 6 seed in 2012 . <p> Last year , the Pac-12 became the first power conference to go winless in an NCAA tournament since the SEC in 1989 . If the regular season is any indication , the conference 's outlook is n't any more positive this year . The Pac-12 received three bids , thanks to Oregon stealing one , and the highest seed is No. 9 Washington , making this the first time since 2012 that the conference did n't have a team seeded sixth or better . As far as Arizona State and Oregon are concerned , there is a positive spin to put on both being double-digit seeds . In the past 10 years , Pac-12 teams seeded 10th or worse are 9-2 in the first round . The Pac-12 has had four teams placed in the First Four in the past three years , including ASU each of the past two years . Overall , the conference is just 1-4 in the First Four . <p> The Patriot League has won just three first-round games in its history and just one in the past 12 years . The past two years , though , Bucknell has put up a good fight , losing by four to No. 3 Michigan State last year , and by six to No. 4 West Virginia in 2017 . This year , Colgate is making its first tournament appearance since 1996 , when Adonal Foyle was the big man on campus and the Raiders hung tough with top-seeded UConn . They are the No. 15 seed in the South and will face Tennessee on Friday . <p> Last year , the SEC received eight bids , its most ever , but only two teams reached the Sweet 16 , and none made the Elite Eight . That 's not the norm , though , as the conference has had at least one team reach the Elite Eight in 21 of the past 27 years . It 's been seven years since the conference 's last championship , but with seven teams in this year 's field , including high seeds like Tennessee ( 2 ) , Kentucky ( 2 ) and LSU ( 3 ) , the SEC is poised to make some noise . <p> The lack of NCAA tournament wins for the Southern Conference is rather surprising when you consider how competitive its teams have been over the years . Would you believe that the only wins the conference has in the past 21 years are the three that Stephen Curry and Davidson strung together on the way to the Elite Eight in 2010 ? Since 1985 , SoCon teams are just 3-31 in the first round . However , in six of the past nine years , the conference rep lost by eight points or fewer , despite being seeded 12th or worse in each game . Last year , UNC Greensboro just fell just short against fourth-seeded Gonzaga 68-64 . This season , Wofford ran the table in the SoCon and is in a position to end this dry spell as a No. 7 seed , the second-highest seed in conference history . The Terriers will face Seton Hall on Thursday . <p> Stephen F. Austin has represented the Southland Conference quite well over the past five years , with a pair of wins ( as a 12- and 14-seed ) and a pair of competitive losses ( also as a 12- and 14-seed ) in the first round . That was a refreshing change from the previous struggles for the conference . From 1986 to 2013 , Southland teams were 1-26 in the first round . Will NCAA tournament first-timer Abilene Christian be able to pull a surprise as a 15 seed ? <p> The SWAC has just one first-round win in its history . That was 26 years ago , when Southern upset Georgia Tech by 15 points . That Jaguars team was seeded 13th , which is the last time a SWAC team was n't a 15- or 16-seed in the tournament . Since then , the conference has lost 17 straight first-round games , 10 of which have been decided by more than 20 points . Prairie View A&amp;M will face Fairleigh Dickinson in the First Four , the eighth time in 11 years the SWAC has had a team in the First Four or opening-round game . The conference is just 2-8 in such games , dating back to 2002 . <p> This is the ninth straight year that either North Dakota State or South Dakota State has been the Summit League 's automatic qualifier . North Dakota State , which is a 16-seed this year , has the conference 's only first-round win in the past 20 years . The Bison upended No. 5 seed Oklahoma in overtime in 2014 . NDSU pushed No. 2 seed Gonzaga in its last trip to the Dance in 2015 . If they are to get a chance to give another high seed trouble , the Bison will have to take care of North Carolina Central in the First Four . <p> The Sun Belt has certainly had its share of moments in recent years . The conference has won four first-round games in the past 11 years , three as a 12-seed ( Little Rock in 2016 and Western Kentucky in 2008-09 ) and one as a 14- seed ( Georgia State in 2015 ) . This year , Ron Hunter and No. 14 seed Georgia State hope to provide another bracket-busting moment for the Sun Belt when the Panthers face Houston on Friday . <p> The West Coast Conference has won at least one first-round game 11 straight years and 15 of 16 . But let 's be real here : It 's almost entirely about Gonzaga putting the WCC on its back . The Zags have won their first-round game 10 straight years , while the rest of the conference has just five wins total in the past 22 years , not counting the First Four . Also , thanks to Gonzaga , the WCC has had a Sweet 16 team in a conference-record four straight years . This year , the conference has two teams in the field ( Gonzaga and Saint Mary 's ) . Only three times in conference history have two WCC teams won first-round games in the same year ( 2000 , 2010 , 2017 ) . <p> It 's been 12 years since a Western Athletic Conference team has won a game in the tourney . In each of the past four years , the losses have come by double digits . New Mexico State is making its seventh trip in the past eight years , as a 12-seed in the Midwest region . The Aggies will face Auburn on Thursday . <h> Teams/Coaches <p> Below are more notable facts about many ( but not all ) of the teams and coaches in this year 's field . They are listed in alphabetical order so that finding one that interests you is easier . <p> Facts are from the modern era ( since 1985 ) unless noted otherwise . <p> Arizona State Since seeding began 40 years ago , the Sun Devils have just six tournament wins and have won more than one game in a single tourney just once . In 1995 , they reached the Sweet 16 as a No. 5 seed , led by Mario Bennett and Ron Riley . ASU 's only win in the past 15 years came in 2009 over 11th-seeded Temple . <p> Auburn This is the first time the Tigers have been to back-to-back tournaments since 1999-2000 . Auburn has never lost a round of 64 game ( 8-0 ) , and that 's despite the fact that it was a 7-seed or worse in six of those eight games . Most of those first-round games have been nail-biters , too , with six of the eight decided by four points or less . Bruce Pearl is hoping to reach the Sweet 16 with his third different school ( Milwaukee , Tennessee ) . <p> Baylor For Scott Drew and his Bears , the second-round game has never been the problem . It 's just a matter of whether they get there . Under Drew , Baylor is 4-3 in the first round , with two of those losses coming as a No. 3 and No. 5 seed . But in the four years the Bears won their first-round matchup , they made a pair of Elite Eights ( 2010 , 2012 ) and a pair of Sweet 16s ( 2014 , 2017 ) . The degree of difficulty will be a bit higher this year , as this is the first time since 2008 they are worse than a 6-seed . <p> Belmont Rick Byrd and the Bruins are looking for their first NCAA tournament victory ( 0-7 ) . In their previous seven appearances , they lost by at least 12 points six times . The only exception was their near-upset of Duke back in 2008 , when they fell just short 71-70 . This ties for Belmont 's best seed , as they lost to Arizona as an 11-seed back in 2013 . <p> C.J. Massinburg is the engine for a veteran Buffalo team with designs on a deep tournament run . Douglas Stringer/Icon Sportswire <p> Buffalo The Bulls are in the tournament for the fourth time in five years , but the previous three trips came as Nos. 12 , 13 and 14 seeds . While they played well in each of those appearances , including an impressive 21-point win over fourth-seeded Arizona last year , the expectations will be completely different this time around . Interesting storyline alert : Nate Oats was an assistant under Bobby Hurley , who left for Arizona State after taking Buffalo to the 2015 tournament . The Bulls will face Hurley 's Sun Devils in the round of 64 if ASU beats St. John 's in the First Four . <p> Cincinnati This is the Bearcats ' ninth straight tournament appearance , all under Mick Cronin . Cincinnati has just one Sweet 16 appearance in the past 17 years ( 2012 as a No. 6 seed ) . <p> Duke <h> Duke as 1-seed , Past 20 years <p> Year <p> Result <p> 2015 <p> Won title <p> 2011 <p> Sweet 16 <p> 2010 <p> Won title <p> 2006 <p> Sweet 16 <p> 2005 <p> Sweet 16 <p> 2004 <p> National semis <p> 2002 <p> Sweet 16 <p> 2001 <p> Won title <p> 2000 <p> Sweet 16 <p> 1999 <p> Runner-up <p> Mike Krzyzewski has led the Blue Devils to 12 Final Fours in 34 tournament appearances , including five national championships ( four as a No. 1 seed , one as a No. 2 ) . This is just the second time in the past eight years that Duke earned a No. 1 seed . The importance of the Blue Devils ' ascension back into 1-seed territory in the season 's final week , which had everything to do with the return of Zion Williamson , can not be overstated . Why , you ask ? <p> Duke has not reached the Final Four in any of its past seven appearances as a No. 2 seed , dating back to 1997 . In that span , they have failed to survive the first weekend four times . <p> Meanwhile , the Blue Devils have won the championship two of the past three times they were a No. 1 seed . Essentially , it 's been title game or bust for them as a top seed . The past 10 times they have been a No. 1 -- dating back to 1999 -- Duke has reached the title game five times ( winning three championships ) and lost in the Sweet 16 the other five times . There has simply been no in between . <p> Florida This is just the third time the Gators have been seeded worse than seventh . The previous two times , they lost in the first round as a No. 10 seed in 1995 and 2010 . The Gators are once again a 10-seed this year . <p> Florida State Last year , the Seminoles reached the Elite Eight for the first time in 25 years , and did so as a No. 9 seed . This year , as a No. 4 seed , the road should n't be as difficult early on ... or so it would seem . The last two times they received a seed this high , they were bounced in the second round . In both 2012 and 2017 , they were 3-seeds , only to be eliminated by No. 6 Cincinnati and No. 11 Xavier , respectively . <p> Gonzaga The Zags are a tournament fixture , with this being their 21st consecutive appearance . That 's right , it 's the 20-year anniversary of their run to the Elite Eight as a 10-seed . Not only has Gonzaga won 10 straight first-round games , it is the only team to reach the Sweet 16 each of the past four years . This year marks their third appearance as a No. 1 seed . In 2013 , they were upset by Wichita State in the second round , but in 2017 they reached the title game before falling to North Carolina . <p> Houston Houston Cougars basketball is officially back ! Last year , they won their first tournament game since Phi Slama Jama made three straight Final Four trips from 1982 to 1984 . That was nice after a 34-year wait , but there is unfinished business to take care of after last year 's heartbreaking second-round defeat at the hands of No. 3 seed Michigan when Jordan Poole beat the buzzer . This year , the Cougars are a No. 3 seed . <p> Iowa Quirky stat alert : The Hawkeyes have just three NCAA tournament wins in the 2000s , all as a No. 7 seed in the first round ( 2001 , 2015 , 2016 ) . This year , their mission is to take down a No. 7 seed in the first round . <p> Kansas All good things must come to an end . And so it is that two amazing Jayhawks streaks came to an end this year : 14 straight years with at least a share of the Big 12 regular-season title and nine straight years as a No. 1 or 2 seed in the NCAA tournament . This year 's No. 4 seed is their lowest since 2006 , when they were also a No. 4 and lost to Bradley in the first round . KU , however , did extend its record of consecutive NCAA tournament appearances to 30 . <p> And there are more streaks to keep alive as well . KU has won 12 straight first-round games and , more impressively , has made three straight Elite Eight appearances . Never before have they made four Elite Eights in a row . <p> Kansas State The Wildcats ran all the way to the Elite Eight last year as a No. 9 seed . This year , they will try to be the first K-State team in the modern tournament era to reach the Sweet 16 in consecutive years . <p> Kentucky John Calipari 's teams have reached the Elite Eight in nine of his past 12 trips to the Dance ( six out of eight at Kentucky ) . This year , the Wildcats are a No. 2 seed , which has been good news for Big Blue Nation recently . In four trips as a top-two seed under Calipari , the ' Cats have reached the Elite Eight all four times , losing in the national semis twice and winning the title in 2012 . In Calipari 's past 10 tourney appearances as a top-two seed -- at Kentucky , Memphis and UMass -- he failed to get as far as the Elite Eight just once ( 2009 at Memphis , losing in the Sweet 16 ) . <p> LSU The Tigers earned their best seed since getting back-to-back No. 1 seeds in 1980 and 1981 . Despite four Final Four trips in school history , they have never made it to the championship game . In 2006 , John Brady coached LSU to the Final Four as a No. 4 seed , but the Tigers have just one NCAA tournament win since then , in 2009 as a No. 8 seed . Will this talented team be able to avoid distractions and make a run ? <p> Louisville Louisville has had plenty of tournament success through the years , but never when seeded worse than sixth , as is the case this year ( it is the No. 7 in the East region ) . The Cards have just one win in the six appearances in which they were seeded seventh or worse , and they lost by double digits in five of the six losses , as well . That win came in 1992 as a No. 8 seed over Wake Forest . <p> Marquette Head coach Steve Wojciechowski won four NCAA tournament games as a player at Duke in the late ' 90s . Now , he 's trying to win his first tourney game as a head coach . After the Golden Eagles missed the tournament three straight years from 2014 to 2016 , this is their second trip in the past three years under Wojciechowski . <p> Maryland The Terrapins have won 12 of their past 13 first-round games , dating back to 1998 . However , that success has n't carried over to the second round , at least not in recent years . The Terps have just one Sweet 16 appearance in the past 15 years ( 2016 ) ; they have lost five of their past six second-round games . <p> Michigan It 's not hard to appreciate what John Beilein has done in Ann Arbor . Back in 2012 , the Wolverines were upset in the first round by No. 13 seed Ohio in a disappointing end to a good season , one that put Michigan basketball back in the national conversation . <p> The sting from that loss did n't last long , and it 's worth noting how the Wolverines have fared the past three times they were a top-four seed . Last year , they lost in the championship game as a No. 3 seed . In 2014 , they reached the Elite Eight as a 2-seed . And in 2013 , they fell in the title game as a 4-seed . This year 's team is certainly talented enough to make another run , as a 2-seed in the West . <p> Michigan State The Spartans are in uncharted territory . They have failed to reach the Sweet 16 in three consecutive years for the first time during the Tom Izzo era . As the No. 2 seed in the East region , they are favored to end this mini-drought , but then again Michigan State has been a top-three seed twice in these past three years . It does n't hurt to have Big Ten Player of the Year , Cassius Winston , running the show for a Hall of Fame coach . <p> Minnesota Oh , how we long for the days of Bobby Jackson and Sam Jacobson . Since the Golden Gophers ' Final Four season in 1997 , they have just one NCAA tournament win . On a positive note , this is just the second time since then that they have qualified for the tourney in consecutive years . <p> Mississippi State The Bulldogs are back in the Dance for the first time in 10 years . The last time they advanced to the second week of play was 23 years ago , when Erick Dampier , Darryl Wilson , Dontae ' Jones &amp; Co. made a surprising run to the Final Four as a 5-seed . Maybe getting a No. 5 seed this year is a good omen . <p> The Martin twins , Caleb and Cody , hope to help Nevada advance even further than last year 's trip to the Sweet 16 . Christopher Hanewinckel-USA TODAY Sports <p> Nevada The Wolf Pack were this close to their first Elite Eight last year , but lost to Loyola-Chicago by one point . They are trying to win an NCAA tournament game in consecutive years for just the second time in school history ( 2004-05 ) . <p> New Mexico State It 's been 26 years since the Aggies won an NCAA tournament game . They 've lost their past 10 games since then , all as a No. 12 seed or worse . The seeding issues remain , as they are a 12-seed . They will face Auburn in the first round . <p> North Carolina <h> Best first-round win pct.Since 2000 <p> Team <p> W-L <p> Pct . <p> North Carolina <p> 16-0 <p> 1.000 <p> Kentucky <p> 16-1 <p> .941 <p> Maryland <p> 10-1 <p> .909 <p> Kansas <p> 17-2 <p> .985 <p> Texas A&amp;M <p> 7-1 <p> .875 <p> Minimum 4 first-round games played <p> When it comes to Roy Williams and the Tar Heels , you can count on a win in the first round . As drivers hope to do in the Daytona 500 each year , Williams has avoided " the big one " and is 28-0 in his career in the round of 64 . <p> Of the 115 teams to play at least four first-round games since 2000 , North Carolina is the only one not to lose . In fact , the Heels are 30-1 in the round of 64 all time . The only loss came in 1999 when the third-seeded Tar Heels were upset by Weber State , who were led by Harold " The Show " Arceneaux with 36 points . <p> Expectations are high once again in Chapel Hill , and Coach Williams ' UNC teams have handled them extremely well . In seven previous appearances as a No. 1 seed under Williams , North Carolina has reached at least the Elite Eight every time , and they won the title three times in five Final Four trips . <p> Purdue As a top-four seed , the Boilermakers have often disappointed and never exceeded the expectations related to their seed . In 12 appearances as a 4-seed or better , they have failed to reach the second weekend half the time and have advanced to the Elite Eight just once . Purdue 's history as a No. 3 -- which is what the Boilers are this year -- is particularly troubling .

But did you know the Johnnies have just five wins since legendary coach Lou Carnesecca retired following the 1992 tournament ? To make matters worse , three of those wins came during their 1999 trip to the Elite Eight . <p> Seton Hall Last year , the Pirates got their first tournament victory since 2004 . This year , they will try to do something they have n't done since 2000 -- win two games . That year , the Hall won a pair of overtime games as a No. 10 seed , before losing to Oklahoma State by two in the Sweet 16 without star point guard Shaheen Holloway , who was injured in the previous game . And guess what ? The Pirates are a 10-seed this year . Wofford awaits in Round 1 . <p> Syracuse The Orange have reached the Sweet 16 in four of their past five trips to the tourney , including an Elite Eight ( 2012 ) and two Final Fours ( 2013 and 2016 ) . They were seeded first , fourth , 10th and 11th in those trips , so being a No. 8 seed this year will not affect them one bit . <p> Temple Fran Dunphy , who will step away as head coach following the tournament , is 2-7 at Temple in the Big Dance . Those wins came as a No. 7 and 9 seed , but his only tourney win while at Penn ( his previous stop ) came as a No. 11 seed in 1994 over Nebraska . That 's exactly what the Owls are seeded this year , as they face Belmont in the First Four . <p> Tennessee This ties for the highest seed in school history . The previous two times the Vols earned a No. 2 seed , both under Bruce Pearl , the ending was rather disappointing . In 2008 , they lost to third-seeded Louisville in the Sweet 16 by 19 points , shooting 34 percent from the field . In 2006 , they were upset by No. 7 Wichita State in the second round . Last year , Tennessee suffered similar disappointment as a No. 3 seed , losing to 11th-seeded Loyola-Chicago when Clayton Custer 's shot bounced in with 3.6 seconds left . So , why should Vols fans have hope this year ? <p> Other than obviously having a talented team , Rick Barnes reached the Elite Eight each of his three previous NCAA tourney trips as a top-two seed -- all while at Texas -- including a Final Four trip as a No. 1 seed in 2003 . Tennessee is still looking for its first Final Four appearance in school history , and its only Elite Eight came in 2010 as a No. 6 seed . <p> Texas Tech For the second straight year , the Red Raiders are a No. 3 seed , this time despite losing their Big 12 tournament opener ( a bad omen for national title hopefuls , as discussed above ) . Last year , Chris Beard took them to their first Elite Eight , and he has a star in Jarrett Culver who can give them a chance to do it again . Tech will be looking to win a tournament game in back-to-back years for just the third time in school history . <p> Utah State It 's OK if you do n't remember the Aggies ' 1970 team that reached the West regional final . Unfortunately for Utah State fans , they are just 1-15 in the NCAA tournament since then . That win came in 2001 over Ohio State in overtime as a No. 12 seed . This year , the Aggies received their best seed ever , a No. 8 in the Midwest region . <p> Villanova In the past three years , Villanova has one fewer NCAA tournament win ( 13 ) than the Pac-12 has as an entire conference ( 14 ) . For the first time in six years , the Wildcats are not a top-two seed ( they are a No. 6 ) . They have been hit or miss in their past nine appearances , either reaching the Final Four ( including two titles in the past three years ) or failing to escape the first weekend . How will the defending champs fare without the pressure of being a high seed ? <p> Virginia Earlier in the column , we detailed how Virginia 's bracket has been home of the Cinderella the past five years . The Hoos have been eliminated by a team seeded at least five spots lower in three of the past four years , so is this the year the Cavaliers turn things around ? Their recent history as a No. 1 seed does n't paint a pretty picture . <p> In three previous trips as a No. 1 under Tony Bennett ( 2014 , 2016 , 2018 ) , they lost in the Sweet 16 , Elite Eight and first round , respectively . As the top seed in the South region , whether UVA can reach the Final Four for the first time in 35 years will be one of the top storylines to follow in this tournament . <p> Virginia Tech The only time the Hokies ever won more than one game in a single tournament was in their first appearance back in 1967 , when they won a pair of games to reach the Elite Eight . Since then , they have just one tourney win in four different decades ( ' 70s , ' 80s , ' 90s and ' 00s ) . Buzz Williams took Marquette to three consecutive Sweet 16s ( including one Elite Eight ) from 2011 to 2013 , but he 's still looking for his first tournament win in Blacksburg . The past two years , the Hokies were seeded eighth and ninth , but this year they are a No. 4 , the best seed in school history . <p> Washington In just his second season , Mike Hopkins has the Huskies in the tournament for the first time in eight years . They have won their first-round game in each of their past five appearances , dating back to 2005 . <p> Wisconsin The Badgers return to the tourney after they had their streak of 19 consecutive appearances snapped last year . Not only has Wisconsin won 10 of its past 11 first-round games , but it has reached the Sweet 16 in each of its past four appearances and six of the past seven . The true test of how tournament-tough the Badgers have been lies in the varying seeds they have had in those past four trips : 8 , 7 , 1 and 2 . This year , they are a No. 5 seed . <p> Thank you to Chris Fallica and Bryan Ives from ESPN Stats &amp; Information for their contributions to this column .

There were also activists who participated in similar egg-pelting actions at the State University against real fascist murderers or secret fascists masquerading as neoliberal technocrats that populate one corner of the campus with historical consistency . <p> These David and Goliath incidents are fantastic ways to performatively unmask the imbalance in power .

@@70635238 <p> The two-time defending champs are favorites once more , but the statistical view of the 2018-19 Warriors reveals some cracks in the foundation . Unless something changes , the Warriors look beatable . Check this out : <p> They are just 10-7 since the All-Star break <p> The Warriors rank 14th in net rating in that span <p> Their offense is scoring at below-average rates <p> What 's wrong ? Well , the numbers suggest that Boogie and the Dubs are n't jelling . <h> Editor 's Picks <p> DeMarcus Cousins has achieved what no opponent ever could : He has turned the Warriors into an average offensive team . When he has been on the court ( 623 minutes ) , Golden State 's offensive rating is just 109.1 . That is not only significantly below the Warriors ' overall average of 114.8 points per 100 possessions , it 's also below the NBA average . <p> Cousins ' on- and off-court numbers imply that he should be on the floor a lot less : <p> When Boogie is off the court , the Warriors ' offensive rating is 115.2 , and their net rating is plus-6.3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to plus-3.0 . <p> Since the All-Star break , six Warriors have played at least 300 minutes , but of that group only Cousins has a negative on/off differential ( minus-0.7 ) . <p> The past few weeks have not been good for Cousins or Golden State . Unless the Warriors flip a playoff switch , Boogie 's tenure in Oakland will be remembered as a massive disappointment . <p> Statistically , Denver seems to be the most stable of all the West playoff teams . It 's hard to find a major flaw or any troubling trends . But compared with the other top teams , these dudes are totally inexperienced in the postseason . While their regular-season statistical markers are all encouraging , it 's fair to question whether that success will translate to April and May basketball . <h> Total playoff games played by current roster <p> The Rockets almost made the Finals last year in part because they had a dominant offense paired with a strong defense that ranked seventh in the NBA . But following the departures of Trevor Ariza and Luc Mbah a Moute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul -- the Rockets just have n't been the same on D this year . <p> The team is allowing the fifth-easiest looks in the league , according to Second Spectrum shot-quality data . Houston 's defense has fallen all the way to 21st , and , generally speaking , mediocre defenses beget mediocre playoff runs . <p> The good news : The Rockets ' defense ranks third overall since the All-Star break . If they keep that up , they still represent the biggest threat to the Warriors . <p> Following Monday 's season-ending injury to Jusuf Nurkic , any Blazers prognostication has to account for his absence . This season , the Blazers built their brand around offense and rebounding , and the stats suggest that Nurkic was a huge factor . <p> Nurkic was having his best season , and the Blazers were at their best when he was in games . Portland 's net rating was plus-10.4 when Nurkic was on the floor and minus-5.0 when he was n't . In other words , Portland was a great team with Nurkic and a lottery-level team without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets in , Portland has to find ways to win without him . <p> Even with a healthy Nurk , Portland had the worst defensive rating since the break among the West playoff teams . Nurkic 's absence on the defensive glass is only going to challenge them further . Enes Kanter will help replace some of Nurkic 's minutes and rebounds , but if his first 16 games in Portland are any indication , the Blazers are simply a bad team when Kanter is in the game . <p> In his 299 minutes of play , Portland has a net rating of minus-5.8 . Kanter is an infamous liability on D , and Portland 's defensive rating rises from 106.7 to 110.7 when he 's out there . It 's hard to see Portland getting enough stops against the good West teams without Nurkic in the rotation . <p> The Clippers are a great story , but they are n't a great team . Through the lens of net rating , the Clippers are the weakest of these eight contenders . They have an average plus-1.3 net rating overall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foes . They wo n't scare anyone . <p> It 's just hard to imagine how LA could pull off a first-round upset . <p> At a time when 3-point offense is a prerequisite for deep runs , the Clippers enter the playoffs as one of the most anemic 3-point-shooting teams in the league . They rank 26th in the NBA in total 3-point makes , and no team in the NBA shoots fewer 3s per 100 possessions than the Clips ( 24.6 ) . Landry Shamet is their No. 1 3-point shooter , but he 's a rookie , and it 's unclear how he 'll fare in a series . <p> The Thunder have looked downright great at times , combining a suffocating defense with a dangerous offensive attack led by Paul George . But times have changed . OKC is trending downward -- and doing so quickly . The Thunder offense has fallen off a cliff . Unless something changes , it wo n't be good enough to get them out of Round 1 . <p> They are by far the worst shooting team of this group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 51.3 ranks 12th in the West , and no team in the NBA has shot worse since the All-Star break . The Thunder 's disastrous eFG% of 48.7 makes them the only team under 50 percent since the break . ( Keep in mind the league is full of tanking teams right now , and OKC is still stinking up the joint more than anyone else . ) <p> When you drill down to the player level , you see that three of the four top scorers are slumping , but nobody 's slumping more than George . He has gone from one of the league 's most efficient volume scorers before the break to this : <h> OKC efficiency : Before and after All-Star <p> Player <p> eFG% ( before Feb. 15 ) <p> eFG% ( after Feb. 15 ) <p> Paul George <p> 54.6 <p> 47.6 <p> Russell Westbrook <p> 44.7 <p> 50.9 <p> Steven Adams <p> 60.7 <p> 56.7 <p> Dennis Schroder <p> 48.0 <p> 42.6 <p> The Thunder 's putrid shooting numbers are costing them games . A 7-11 run since the break makes OKC the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Basketball Power Index ( 43 percent chance ) . Yikes . <p> George 's shoulder injury is a factor , and the schedule has been tough . But you know what else is tough ? The West playoffs . If these last 18 games are a preview of what this team looks like against stiff competition , then it will be another brief run for the Thunder this spring . <p> Once again , the Jazz are a defensive juggernaut , and once again , their offense might not be good enough to carry them very far . The Jazz are posting a below-average offensive efficiency , and only the brick-laying Thunder are scoring points at lower rates among these eight teams . <p> Donovan Mitchell -- a phenomenal second-year player -- is Utah 's leading scorer , but it 's unfair to expect a guard this young to carry such a heavy load . Simply put , many nights the Jazz do n't have enough offensive firepower behind Mitchell . The Jazz are 28-6 when Mitchell posts a true shooting percentage ( TS% ) higher than 54 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's a lot of pressure on one player when the other top scorers -- Rudy Gobert , Ricky Rubio , and Jae Crowder -- do n't scare anyone on offense . <p> But maybe they should seem a little scarier . Since the All-Star break , the Jazz lead the entire NBA in net rating , and their offense is looking competent . If they can keep it up , they 'll become a legitimate problem . With a defense as good as Utah 's , a competent offense is all it will take to make noise in the postseason . <p> The Spurs are great at home and awful on the road . Their 14-23 road record is the worst such mark of any of the West playoff squads , including a minus-4.0 net rating away from home . That 's bad news for a team that will not have home-court advantage in the first round . <p> San Antonio 's road defense ranks 26th in the NBA in part because opponents boast a juicy eFG% of 54.6 . Every other West playoff team is defending better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very strange thing to say about a Spurs team , but this is a strange Spurs team . <p> The Spurs also rank dead last in scoring at the rim . Their combination of a slower pace and a plethora of jump-shooting scorers means they visit the rim less than any other team , averaging just 15.4 shots per 100 possessions in the restricted area , per Second Spectrum data . The Warriors rank second-worst among these eight teams in that category ... but they feature three of the greatest jump-shooters ever . <p> If the Spurs are n't hitting jumpers , they 're in trouble .

@@70641232 <p> MILWAUKEE -- THERE IS a lot going on the sports world right now . The baseball season just kicked into high gear with its first full slate of games in 2019 . The NCAA basketball tournaments are in the midst of their most dramatic stretch . The NBA is nearing the end of its regular season , with several teams jockeying for playoff position and players vying for postseason awards . <p> With so much activity , those of you reading this from beyond the chilly-but-lovely environs of the Upper Midwest might have missed this : Thursday was one of the most memorable sports days in the history of one our most venerable sports towns . Brew Town . Cream City . Milwaukee , a city so gritty that Teddy Roosevelt once spoke for 90 minutes on one of its streets after he had been shot by a would-be assassin . <p> These are red-letter days for Milwaukee sports and , for once , that collective euphoria has nothing to do with the Green Bay Packers . Baseball 's Brewers are fresh off their first division title since 2011 , a season that left them just one win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Bucks are closing in on clinching the league 's best record and are bona fide title threats for the first time since the early 1980s . <h> Editor 's Picks <p> Can Jacob deGrom be even better than he was last year ? Was the Phillies ' best addition someone other than Bryce Harper ? Here are our first impressions . <p> " We 've had 98 percent of our season-ticket holders re-up , " effusive Brewers owner Mark Attanasio said . " That 's extraordinary . I also think , by the way , the success the Bucks are having helps in the community . To have us and the Bucks in the city both doing well just gets everybody excited . " <p> But this is even more seminal than that , because both the Brewers and Bucks are led by young superstars who have become the faces of their respective franchises , and who are quite likely the most popular current denizens of this old beer town . <p> " I think they should both win it , " LA Clippers coach Doc Rivers said of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having played his college ball at Marquette , but he did n't want to favor one star or the other . " Why not just make everyone happy ? " <p> If the NBA voting goes the Greek Freak 's way , Milwaukee would enjoy at least a half-year run with reigning MVPs in both baseball and basketball . And though it is one of the smallest markets in all of professional sports , believe it or not , Milwaukee seems to be more than big enough for both of them . <p> play <p> 2:10 <h> Giannis : MVP is for players who win <p> Giannis Antetokounmpo sits down with Adrian Wojnarowski to give his thoughts on his MVP race with James Harden , the criteria to win MVP and his minutes restrictions . <p> THE PACKERS STILL feature the most well-known athlete in Wisconsin in quarterback Aaron Rodgers , a two-time MVP in his own right . And while Wisconsinites will always bleed green and gold , Green Bay is coming off its first back-to-back losing seasons since 1990-91 , just before Brett Favre took over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Milwaukee , regardless of the calendar , if you see people wearing sports garb , there 's a good chance they are repping the Packers . <p> But the current vibe in the city was captured perfectly by one fan I saw perusing the names and faces of the Wisconsin Sports Walk of Fame , a collection of plaques affixed to concrete pillars on the sidewalk along Vel R. Phillips Avenue , a couple of blocks from the Fiserv Forum . He was wearing a Packers jersey , the first evidence of the NFL team I 'd seen all day . The number on it was " 34 , " which set me to wondering who wears or has worn that number for the Pack . But then the man turned around so I could see the name on the back of the jersey . <p> It said , " Greek Freak . " <p> Yelich and Antetokounmpo do n't know each other , though I suspect some enterprising marketing pro will figure out a way to pair them sometime soon . But they do know of , and admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' impressively renovated spring complex in Maryvale , Arizona , earlier this month , I was waiting around Yelich 's locker to chat with the MVP . Finally he appeared , wearing Brewers shorts , a Brewers sweatshirt and an incongruous pair of long , green Milwaukee Bucks socks emblazoned with Antetokounmpo 's No. 34 . <p> " They gave me some of these Giannis socks , " Yelich said , laughing and not saying who " they " were . " Obviously , I 'm pulling for him to win the MVP of the NBA . They 've had a great season , so hopefully they can finish that off . " <p> Meanwhile , Antetokounmpo talked about how Yelich 's breakout success last season was hard to miss . I first asked him if he even knew who Yelich was , being that he grew up in Greece and would n't have had much early exposure to baseball . Turns out , he does know quite a bit about Yelich , though they do n't yet know each other in real life , as the kids say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Phoenix , Christian Yelich took a break from spring training to see his fellow Milwaukee star in action . Christian Petersen/Getty Images <p> " Yeah , yeah . He 's the MVP , " he said . " He came to the Phoenix game . We did n't talk and do n't have a relationship , but I saw him there . Tried to look up who he was and I figured out he was the MVP . Then I started realizing he had like billboards all over Milwaukee . Tried to follow up a little bit learning about the Brewers . " <p> If Antetokounmpo lands his MVP award , it would n't be the first time a city has had reigning MVPs in both sports . Because the NBA announces its award during the middle of the baseball season , the definitions can get a little convoluted . So let 's focus on occurrences that would match this one . In other words , here are the instances in which the NBA gave its MVP award to a player from a city that also had a reigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calendar Year <p> City <p> League MVPs <p> 1980 <p> Los Angeles <p> ( Don Baylor , Angels ; Kareem Abdul-Jabbar , Lakers ) <p> 1981 <p> Philadelphia <p> ( Mike Schmidt , Phillies ; Julius Erving , 76ers ) <p> 1988 <p> Chicago <p> ( Andre Dawson , Cubs ; Michael Jordan , Bulls ) <p> 1989 <p> Los Angeles <p> ( Kirk Gibson , Dodgers ; Magic Johnson , Lakers ) <p> 2018 <p> Houston <p> ( Jose Altuve , Astros ; James Harden , Rockets ) <p> With Houston celebrating both Jose Altuve and Harden last season -- during the months between when Harden was honored by the NBA in June and Altuve relinquished his award to Boston 's Mookie Betts in November -- obviously it has n't been long at all since this has happened . Still , it 's a rare thing and , strangely enough , when it has happened before , it has happened in back-to-back years . That 's only a coincidence , but if you are the type to seek omens , that certainly has to help Antetokounmpo 's fortunes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty cool if that happened . <p> THE BREWERS AND Bucks have rarely been good at the same time . In fact , 2018 was the first calendar year in which both teams made the playoffs since it happened in back-to-back seasons in 1981-82 . Other than 1981 , 1982 and 2018 , it has never happened . There was a seven-year stretch from 1992 to 1998 when neither team made the postseason . <p> This history is well known around town in Milwaukee . I heard one bartender tell some Cardinals fans , " We are milking this while we can . " <p> Milk , though a staple of Wisconsin 's image , was nevertheless not much on display early Thursday morning in the parking lots around Miller Park . Much more common was a particular carbonated yellow beverage , one that has a long history in Milwaukee . Located a few miles west of downtown , Miller Park is in kind of an odd , isolated location . It 's also perfect for the Wisconsinite 's favorite activity : tailgating . This is invariably the explanation I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . People want to tailgate . Bud Selig used to say this , too , when he argued against putting Miller Park downtown . <h> MLB Power Rankings <p> Can the Red Sox repeat ? Can the Brewers top the Dodgers in the NL ? We break down all 30 teams ahead of the 2019 season . Power Rankings <p> Inside the park -- and , yes , it was inside , as the roof was closed -- the Opening Day ceremonies were familiar , as they should be , as the 149th season of big league baseball got underway . The Brewers ' employees , dressed up for the occasion , gathered for a group photo near home plate . The visiting St. Louis Cardinals and the Brewers were both introduced , with Yelich 's name easily drawing the loudest roar , before Attanasio 's sons sang the national anthem . Milwaukee 's four franchise MVPs -- Yelich , Ryan Braun , Rollie Fingers and Robin Yount -- teamed up for the first-pitch ritual , then posed together on the field . <p> " How many organizations have four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quipped . " And throw out a first pitch ? And catch them ? I think that 's pretty cool . " <p> The Cardinals broke out to an early 3-0 lead , before Mike Moustakas got the Brewers on the board with a homer to center . One inning later , with two men on base , Yelich flashed his MVP form by launching a homer to dead center , giving the Brewers a lead they never relinquished . But they almost did . <p> There were two out , none on , in the ninth . Vicious Brewers super-reliever Josh Hader had mowed down five consecutive Cardinals , almost exclusively with fastballs that were waved at feebly . So it was a shock when not only did pinch hitter Jose Martinez make contact , but sent a ball rocketing toward the fence in right-center . In the press box , someone cursed out loud -- it 's that reflexive reaction a scribe gets when he knows the game story he 's ready to send is about to become obsolete . <p> " I said a bad word , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his reaction when Martinez connected . <p> But Lorenzo Cain was tracking the ball from his position in center , closing in on it with his long strides . He reached the fence at the same time as the ball , leaped , and took the potential tying home run away from Martinez and the Cardinals . Yelich watched from nearby and thrust both arms into the air . Cain fired the ball skyward . Somehow , it ended up in the glove of Moustakas . <p> " It 's a great way to start the year , " Yelich said . " That game had a little bit of everything in it . I do n't know if there has a been an ending like that on Opening Day . I ca n't remember there being one . It was fun to watch . Gave our team a little bit of a jolt right there . " <p> Afterward , the Brewers all talked about how the storybook finish meant that the magic that propelled them so far in 2018 is alive and well . And perhaps it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baseball season is long . Because it is . Thursday was No. 1 of 162 . It 's one the players , and the fans , will remember , but it 's also kind of like 2018 never really ended . <p> " I was wrong , this looked like last year , " said Counsell , who all spring has been emphasizing that this is a new year and last year has no bearing on this one . On the other hand , Yelich says to a certain extent that this is simply who the Brewers are , especially since the club returned a vast majority of its 2018 roster . <p> " I think we know our identity as a team , how we win games , " Yelich said . " That seems to be our formula . It 's great to see us get down early , fight back , and find a way to win . " <p> WHEN THE POSTGAME interviews were finished , I collected my things and raced out to the parking lot to catch a rideshare downtown . It was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game , and my driver kept saying , " I did n't want to come out here . " We managed to break free from the throng and after that , I was soon back at my hotel , where I dropped off a few things , picked up my jacket and headed out across the Milwaukee River for the walk to see the Fiserv Forum for the first time . I passed by the old Bradley Center , which is in the early stages of being dismantled . <p> I used to cover the NBA and would traipse up to Milwaukee from Chicago semi-frequently during Antetokounmpo 's early seasons with the club . Once , during the Las Vegas Summer League , I spent a morning with him , tagging along with the TrueHoop crew to grab a little Q&amp;A . As we walked through the high corridors of some casino-hotel -- picture a small bunch of sports media schlubs tagging along with a lean , 7-foot , 20-year-old in basketball sweats -- I got a glimpse of what it 's like for an NBA player just to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We all had breakfast together at one of Vegas ' over-the-top buffets , and I remember several other guests asking me who Antetokounmpo was . I 'd practiced pronouncing his name , which is a bit of a mouthful , so I was able to articulate it easily enough . No one had heard of him . <p> Chances are , they know him now . <p> " I want to try do everything on the court , " Antetokounmpo told me back then . " I like Kobe Bryant , because he plays offense , but he plays defense , too . You can see the passion inside . I want to be that type of player . " <p> He has become that type of player . I always figured that whatever Antetokounmpo 's potential was , he would reach it . He worked harder than anyone , was humble , but also so fiercely competitive that after his team was eliminated from the playoffs by Chicago one season , when Antetokounmpo walked past I was worried about him . He was breathing heavily and was clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That , I thought , is what a competitor looks like . <p> Antetokounmpo 's potential was , of course , immense , as you 'd expect for someone with his combination of body type , athleticism and wide array of skills . And that combination is unmatched in today 's NBA . In a nutshell , no one can really guard Antetokounmpo and , on the other end , he can guard anyone . <p> " Every game to him is a competition , " Rivers said . " He competes . That 's what I really like about him . " <h> Giannis working on 3-point range <p> He has dominated in the 3-point era without a consistent shot from distance , but Giannis Antetokounmpo is working on finding his range and a degree of invincibility . Malika Andrews <p> Everything has changed for Antetokounmpo since the previous time I 'd seen him play in person . He is stronger and more explosive . He 's more outgoing . His skill set has gone almost off the charts . Even his 3-point shot is improving , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And the fans in Milwaukee have absolutely gone bonkers over him . The only time I 've heard fan reactions like Antetokounmpo 's during introductions was in Chicago , first for Michael Jordan and , later , when hometown hero Derrick Rose was at his best for the Bulls . <p> The Bucks were playing the Clippers and it was a so-so game . Antetokounmpo had a big first half , scoring 23 points , and Milwaukee pulled out to a big lead . The Clippers cut into the lead at times , but Milwaukee more or less cruised . Midway through the fourth quarter , Antetokounmpo had pushed his point total over 30 when suddenly he did something that took the air out of the arena . After turning to run down the court to play defense , with no one around him , Antetokounmpo crumbled to the floor . <p> " I have n't watched the tape yet , " Antetokounmpo said after the game , seeming as confused as anybody why he went down . " I 'm about to head to the training room to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashed back to a game in Chicago on April 28 , 2012 . That was the contest in which Rose simply jumped out of his knee late in a playoff win over Philadelphia . The atmosphere at the United Center was funereal . Neither he , nor the Bulls , nor the city of Chicago in some ways , have quite been the same since . Happily , in Antetokounmpo 's case , it was n't like that . He has been battling a sprained ankle and this was just the latest occurrence of that . He did n't go back to the locker room and even was going to check back into the game at one point , though a Milwaukee 3-pointer put the game out of reach and the Freak returned the bench . <p> " He was basically by himself going back down the court , " Bucks coach Mike Budenholzer said , describing his reaction when Antetokounmpo went down . " So you kind of hope it 's not anything too serious . But , yeah , it 's scary any time one of our guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lesson here for Milwaukee fans is an echo of that bartender I overheard : Milk this time for all it 's worth . Because while Antetokounmpo is young and under contract for two more years , and Yelich is young and under contract for three more years ( including a team option ) , all of this can be so fleeting . That 's why the city has never seen anything quite like this before . <p> Giannis Antetokounmpo has a drawn-out postgame routine before he will speak to reporters . Quinn Harris/Getty Images <p> IN THE LOCKER room after games , Antetokounmpo has a consistent routine that is none too popular among the media who covers him . He hangs out , gets treatment , showers , plays DJ with his phone . On Thursday , he blasted some Greek hip-hop through the locker room , singing along with lyrics only he could understand . His teammates dressed and gradually moved out into the night . But the Greek Freak was still there , taking his time , his impossibly long legs stuck in a big tub of ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only after everything else is done , and everyone else is gone . It 's not a great routine for those in deadline-driven professions . <p> But the thing is , Antetokounmpo is still so damned nice , it 's hard to hold it against him . After all , he does answer the questions . He even spoke sincerely to a Russian reporter who had traveled from far away for just that opportunity , telling young Russian hoopsters to work hard and follow their dreams . He even indulged a baseball writer who 'd dropped into the proceedings , followed him back near the training area and wanted to ask him only what he knew about Yelich . <p> Yelich , too , seems to have evolved as a media figure , perhaps best exemplified by his role in this raucous MLB promo . To me , Yelich is the funniest guy in the commercial because the sight of him leaning into a microphone and exclaiming , " I 'm gon na hit 50 home runs ! " is so completely unlike him . ( Alex Bregman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many organizations have four MVPs that are still able stand up ? And throw out a first pitch ? And catch them ? I think that 's pretty cool . " Robin Yount <p> Yelich now seems more at ease with all the attention he gets , which I suspect bothered him at first when he initially emerged as an MVP candidate . Still , he has n't walled himself off , just as Antetokounmpo has not , and perhaps it 's because they play in Milwaukee that they have n't had to . Yelich might be the most clubhouse-accessible star player in the game right now . Antetokounmpo , as long as you 're willing to wait him out , is much the same . <p> If Harden ends up outpointing Antetokounmpo in the NBA balloting , perhaps this Greek Freak/Yelich MVP combo will never happen . Perhaps Milwaukee will not stake claim to Green Bay 's moniker of Titletown , USA . That would n't change the fact that this too-often-overlooked city on the shores of Lake Michigan is currently home to a pair of the biggest stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll even meet . <h> 2019 MLB season preview <p> Which powerhouse will rule the AL ?

" The Brewers are starting and have the MVP . Milwaukee is excited about our new arena and new coaching staff . And we 're winning . It 's fun and exciting to be in Milwaukee right now . " <p> If there was one telling commonality between the two games in Milwaukee , on a late-March day in the midst the city 's salad days as a sports town , it was this : After Yelich homered , and every time he strode to the plate , the familiar chants of " MVP !

It is based on the top-spec Adventure variant , which means it gets a more menacing front grille , a skid plate mounted on the front bumper and differently designed foglights .

Available on the Hybrid X variant is the E-Four electric 4-wheel drive system . <p> Safety technology is also top notch on the RAV4 .

Thus the XE 's reboot has addressed some of the areas where it lagged behind the 3-Series , as well as the Audi A4 and the Mercedes-Benz C-Class . <p> PHOTO : Greg Pajo <p> Continue reading below ? <p> First up , sharpening up the slightly dowdy styling of before . It manages to be familiar yet oh-so-different , the appearance of an unflatteringly shrunken Jaguar XF replaced by some real vigor , all via thinner LED lights , reshaped bumpers , and an optional lip spoiler . Spec the 20-inch alloy wheels ( you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a car that 's fantastically handsome . <p> Next , plusher cabin materials and a wealth of new technology , with the option of up to four screens inside , one cleverly embedded within the rearview mirror to stream a wide-angle camera view that 's notably more informative than the narrow squint through a wiper-less rear screen most four-doors offer . Beneath that you 'll find the twin screens seen in the Jaguar I-Pace that can swap between nav , phone link-up , and climate controls at your whim . <p> PHOTO : Greg Pajo <p> Continue reading below ? <p> Finally , a much simpler engine and trim range , which does unfortunately mean you now must have a four-cylinder engine . The V6 has gone for good , and we suspect the ? 150,000 ( P10.16 million ) V8-powered Project 8 special wo n't live on beyond its initial 300-car run in the earlier XE shape . <p> All versions are 2.0-liter units , with a trio of diesels offering between 161hp and 237hp , and a trio of petrols generating between 197hp and 296hp . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elongated paddle shifters and a proper gear selector in the middle -- while they offer a mixture of rear- and all-wheel drive depending on how much money you spend . AWD is standard on the highest-powered petrol and diesel , and optional on selected variants elsewhere in the range . <p> There 's still no wagon version , which is perhaps a shame given just how purposeful it would look , but it 's probably understandable given the XE 's modest sales numbers and Jaguar 's increasing focus on SUVs . But how does the regular four-door fare against its seemingly insurmountable German foes ? <p> Continue reading below ? <h> On the road <p> PHOTO : Greg Pajo <p> Where the XE has never put a foot wrong is dynamically , and so it remains . The way Jag 's engineering folk find a way of balancing ride and handling -- in other words , comfort and fun -- is simply unmatched . <p> I 'm not sure a C-Class can ride this well , nor a 3=Series exhibit such fine balance , yet the XE manages to beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel for good measure . Whether you 've gone RWD or AWD , this is an exemplary car to drive . You can choose the biggest , prettiest alloys with no concern for how it 'll affect the ride , which is high ( and rare ) praise indeed . <p> Continue reading below ? <p> There 's no longer a manual gearbox , but we really do n't mind -- this auto 's a belter , and with longer , aluminum paddles exhibiting properly sharp responses , you really are inclined to use manual mode quite a lot of the time , especially when its eight ratios are so shortly stacked . <p> PHOTO : Greg Pajo <p> Continue reading below ? <p> What 's less satisfying is the bunch of engines it comes attached to . It 's a capable but uninspiring range of four-cylinders , and when the 296hp petrol in the range-topping P300 sounds uncannily like a diesel at low revs , you might as well have the cheaper to buy and run engine it accidentally imitates . <p> Happily , even the most powerful engines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the XE proves as refined as an XJ at a cruise . The gearbox is smooth and intelligent when left to make its own decisions , too , sharpening up sweetly when you prod it into Sport ( or take full control yourself ) . <p> In short , it 'll make the dull highway grind painless , but has a chassis so satisfying , you might genuinely avoid the 100kph slog and use a longer , more interesting route instead . <h> On the inside <p> PHOTO : Greg Pajo <p> Continue reading below ? <p> A facelift can fix just about everything except the XE 's chronic lack of space in the back or the absence of a wagon version . Thus it remains one of the less practical cars in its class , and by quite a margin . But if you regularly travel alone or with only sub-six-footers in the back , it should work well enough . <p> And up front , it feels fantastic . You can set the driving position nice and low , while the updated XE 's posher materials and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new technology welcome . <p> The upper and lower screens borrowed from the I-Pace both look great , respond well , and give the XE a genuine air of freshness inside . Same goes for the rear iew mirror that doubles as a screen , a feature that debuted on the Mk2 Range Rover Evoque . <p> PHOTO : Greg Pajo <p> Continue reading below ? <p> It takes some getting used to , but it offers a brilliantly wide angle view that 's far more informative than the sliver of rear screen you 'd traditionally get in a sedan . But boy , does it get warm when you 're on the go for a few hours . <p> Perhaps that 's a teething problem of this early car we 're driving . Though given the XE we ran back in 2016 suffered numerous electronic maladies , a question mark hangs over the long-term appeal of cramming in so much screen-based tech . There 's wow factor now , at least . <h> Verdict <p> PHOTO : Greg Pajo <p> Continue reading below ? <p> Love driving ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look no further , because this car -- for your needs -- is the best in its class . No small feat when that class is full of talent such as the BMW 3-Series , but Jag 's ability to make a car ride supply while slapping a big grin on your face borders on witchcraft . <p> If only there was more interior room and a greater array of engines -- some sonorous six-cylinders , basically -- and it might top the class without caveats or clauses . Smarter looks and more gob-smacking tech mean the updated XE is a very convincing compact sedan , but if you 're not a proper handling geek , you might not fully appreciate its charms when the standard of its rivals is so high , too . <p> PHOTO : Greg Pajo <p> Continue reading below ? <p> PHOTO : Greg Pajo <p> PHOTO : Greg Pajo <p> Continue reading below ? <p> PHOTO : Greg Pajo <p> PHOTO : Greg Pajo <p> Continue reading below ? <p> NOTE : This article first appeared on TopGear.com .

To keep that factor as part of the program is just a real positive for our fans and for everyone .

It has been remarkable to see it . It has been a thrill .

Clark has been the subject of trade rumors and has yet to sign his $17.128 million franchise tag . <p> Wilson is coming off arguably the best season of his seven-year career . He edged his previous career bests with 35 touchdown passes and a 110.9 passer rating while tying his career low of seven interceptions .

@@70690235 <h> Sabal : Is there a future for the Filipino Youth ? <p> IT 'S been a while since I wrote an article about Christmas Prices last December of 2018 . I have been thinking of plausible topics that I can passionately discuss . Few days back , I was invited to talk about the economic prospects of the Filipino Youth . While I was reflecting on what would be the substance of my talk , I asked several questions to myself , " Is there really an economic prospect for our youth ? Especially during the time of Duterte ? " <p> Let me answer that by explaining first the economic landscape of our country . As of 2018 , the Philippine grew at 6.2% ahead of Indonesia ( 5.2% ) and Thailand ( 4.3% ) but behind India ( 7.7% ) , Viet Nam ( 7.1% ) , and China ( 6.6% ) . Looking at recent trends , our country 's gross domestic product ( GDP ) is greatly influenced by the industrial sector and trade . We are a highly importing country in most years from 1960 to 2016 . <p> According to World Bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Indonesia and India . Malaysia , Thailand , and China are upper-middle income countries , while Brunei and Singapore are high-income countries . Our economic managers are optimistic that we 'll become an upper-middle income country by end of the year ! <p> Looking at the growth of our fellow lower-middle class countries , our growth is almost similar to Indonesia but behind India . Comparing to upper-middle income nations , we are at the bottom defying the classic growth theories that poorer countries should grow more than richer ones . Reasons to this include the massive investments of richer countries on total factor productivity ( TFP ) , education , research , technology , and innovation . <p> Our unemployment rate is just at 5.2% of the total 72.52 million labor force , which is around 2 million unemployed as of January of 2019 . The catch is , our unemployment rate is the highest among our neighbors ( particularly Malaysia , Thailand , Indonesia , and Viet Nam ) for the past years . <p> The silver lining to that , part two of my article , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one of the highest in the world . Our growing population is composed mostly of young people , in which , around 65% are at ages 15-64 . However , our Association of Southeast Asian Nations ( Asean ) neighbors have also a higher proportion of younger population in their labor force . Among ages 15-64 , Singapore and Thailand have 72% , around 70% for Malaysia and Viet Nam . <p> What are now the opportunities that our government can derive from a younger population ? <p> One is demographic transition , a shift from high-mortality and high-fertility to low-mortality and low-fertility . Developed economies like South Korea , Japan , and Canada experienced this phenomenon . This transition is driven primarily by having more women , who are educated , in the labor force . Some economists claim that the key to progress is to put women at work . Having more educated women lowers child mortality . <p> Likewise , women with higher economic opportunities tend to postpone their pregnancy since their trade-off of having a child is high . Giving the young , especially women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- an important indicator of progress . <p> Another opportunity is for the government to invest more in health , education , and innovation . The younger population should be provided with necessary skills to prepare our country to the fourth industrial revolution in 2020 . This is a new era of advanced robotics , autonomous transport , artificial intelligence and machine learning , biotechnology and genomics . With neighbors whose population is composed of younger groups , what is the edge of our youth to other Asean youth ? <p> Lastly , is to offset the unintended consequences of several landmark government policies . According to a study released by the Philippine Institute of Development Studies , our existing free-education program will reduce the quality of tertiary education as it will drive-out competition among universities . Most students will flock to state-owned institutions to take advantage of the free-tuition . Increasing minimum wage and endo are disadvantageous for the young , inexperienced , less-educated , and women . Firms will experience higher cost , which will lead to laying-off workers to maintain the existing level of production . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorer credentials . To reiterate , government should do something to offset the unintended consequences of these policies and protect the youth . <p> The Philippines will grow no matter who the President is , but the extent of growth depends on the strength of our institutions and quality of our policies . In 10-15 years , our labor force will likely remain to be young . How competitive will be the Filipino youth 's skills-set to the world ? Can we still catch-up to richer nations ? It all depends on how we develop our younger population ! <p> ( Jhon Louie B Sabal is the OIC-Chairperson of the Department of Economics of Xavier University-Ateneo de Cagayan .

@@70690236 <h> Ravanera : Why cooperativism is the answer ? <p> AS UNDERSECRETARY and Chairman of the Cooperative Development Authority in the country , I am so fired-up to advance cooperativism whose DNA is that of being MEMBERS-OWNED ( indeed , no one shall be left behind ) , VALUE-BASED ( debunking consumerism and materialism for the sublime ) and SUSTAINABLE ( based on the firm belief that life is sacred ) ) . <p> I firmly believe that cooperativism , not communism , is the long awaited paradigm , the liberating force to rectify social wrong , gross social inequities , social injustices that created the horrible contemporaneous scenarios of climate change and violent extremism . Such contention is well supported by newly published book on " Capitalism Versus Climate Change , " by Naomi Klein saying that carbon is not the problem but the inconvenient truth is that capitalism is causing climate change brought about by the growth-at-all-cost neo-liberalism paradigm that is sacrificing the people and mother earth to the altar of greed and profit . <p> In another very popular book , " Dangerous Years , " by David Orr , the author aptly described what capitalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , entertains , transports , employs , invests , disinvests , and showers all manner of things on those with money . It also poisons and pollutes while making some rich and many others poor and some fat while others starve . <p> It flattens mountains , destroys ecologies , acidifies oceans , destabilizes the climate , creates continentalsized gyres of trash in the oceans , and corrupts democracy . It is creating amazing new ways to displace humans in favor of robots and render our carbon-based minds obsolete in favor of those made of silicon . It provides a multitude of ways to communicate 24/7 while making it less likely that we can talk sensibly with our neighbors . It entertains and infantilizes , perhaps while " consuming itself . " Both bane and blessing , it is the global capitalist economy .

Social transformation can be had by empowering the people , by harnessing their collective potentials . Indeed , for those who have dreamt , struggled , advocated and even died for it , social change has been so elusive all these years despite 14 years of martial law and two people-powered revolutions .

" Federal law does not recognize the decriminalization of marijuana for any purpose , even in places where state or local law does .

" This now seems to instruct immigration officers to probe . " <p> Joseph said he prefers the transparency of the new guidance , but the unfortunate part is that " people are doing things that are perfectly legal under state law , but will make them permanently ineligible for a green card . " <p> According to USCIS , as long as marijuana remains illegal under federal law , the agency wo n't grant special considerations to individuals whose marijuana activities may be decriminalized under state or local law . <p> " Marijuana remains illegal under federal law as a Schedule I controlled substance regardless of any actions to decriminalize its possession , use , or sale at the state and local level , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law does not recognize the decriminalization of marijuana for any purpose , even in places where state or local law does .

For the reason that they all have in common - traffic . <p> Sometimes I tend to forget that I am in the City of Smiles because how can you smile when you face this everyday predicament ? Take note , I usually hear this reason with my students in my 7:30 a.m. class when they arrived late " sorry miss na trapik ko " or with my colleagues when they do errands " Wow ! Grabe ang trapik . " Why do we have to suffer like this ? Do we now accept the fact that we are becoming like Metro Manila ?

So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illegal parking . We do have road and bridge widening and that is great . This shows that there is an ease of access on the road for the moving vehicles . However , the road and bridge widening also meant an easy free parking space for the motorists . They just park their vehicles without being chastised . Even in the bike lane area , bikers can not anymore use this lane since drivers of cars , pedicabs and tricycles use it as their parking area . <p> Second , some drivers of motorcycles are not afraid to do the snake-like motion . They slither in and out of every moving vehicle to change lanes , other times they use the fast lane section and once they get bumped by other vehicles , boom ! Accident occurs and traffic comes . <p> Third , pedicabs and tricycles are like " hari ng kalsada " because they are not afraid to pass by the minor and major thoroughfares .

As I always pass by Lopez-Jaena Street going to B.S. Aquino Drive , there are vehicles who double park especially those near the furniture shops and hardware stores . Another is on the 6th Street near VSB building . The drivers just use their hazards to double park their vehicles . This makes me wonder if these drivers had undergone seminars before having their license . <p> Fifth , beating the red light and u-turn . We know for a fact that time is gold but so is our life . Some traffic enforces are actually visible but they do not do anything to reprimand those buzzer beater drivers and those drivers who take illegal u-turns such as in the Jollibee La Salle , Bangga Metal , and Bangga Cory . <p> Sixth , road constructions .

@@70715233 <h> Should we have meat import quotas after we tariffied the QR on rice ? <h> Introspective <p> By Ramon Clarete <p> Last week , BusinessWorld carried a report about a plan by Agriculture Secretary Pi ? ol to limit meat imports due to high inventory of meats and meat products in cold-chain facilities in the country . In his words , he wants to broker a deal among meat importers and meat processors , on the one hand , and meat producers , on the other , for the amount of meat imports to be allowed into the country . <p> I did text a member of a family in the hog-raising business in General Santos City about this . She confirmed this concern , texting me that her family is worried about meat imports , and " the farmers there are suffering . " <p> I have n't asked the opinion of owners of downstream businesses to the country 's piggeries or the chicken industry about the glut of meats in our country . <p> If his plan pushes through , Secretary Pi ? ol has to lower the quantity of imported meat that he would permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consider taking in doing that . One , he imposes a quantitative restriction on meat imports to protect livestock raisers . Two , he may just reduce the minimum access volumes ( MAV ) of imported meats and meat products . Or three , he may use sanitary and phytosanitary permits , reminiscent of the abuse of SPS rules in the case of garlic imports a few years back . <p> There may be other measures , but in my opinion , those would likely be derivatives of any of the above three . <p> The agriculture tariffication act of 1996 poses a legal hurdle to either of the first two options . Section 6 of that law provided that " in lieu of quantitative restrictions , the maximum bound rates committed under the Uruguay Round Final Act shall be imposed on the agricultural products whose quantitative restrictions ( QR ) are repealed by this Act . " Meats and meat products are among the products covered by the 1996 tariffication law . <p> It is the policy of the state to use tariff and not quantity measures to protect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making good our treaty obligation in the WTO , when Congress passed the law to tariffy the QR on rice imports . <p> The tariffication act may offer him the legal rule he needs to reduce the meats ' MAV , but on closer scrutiny not . " In case of shortages or abnormal price increases in agricultural products , whose quantitative restrictions are lifted under this Act , the President may propose to Congress , revisions , modifications , or adjustments of the Minimum Access Volume ( MAV ) ... " <p> The words are " revisions , modifications , or adjustments , " which changes could include reduction of the MAVs . However , the law requires that such changes are done in the context of a shortage or abnormal price increases of meats . These market situations require expanding rather than reducing the MAV . <p> However , an unvalidated information reached me about former agriculture secretary Alcala having offered higher meat MAV to get a principal supplier in meats in the world not to block the legal waiver which we applied for and obtained in 2014 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for another 3 years . <p> If true , here 's a case of a distortion causing another ! In the desire of the Aquino government to extend the rice QR , a distortion , it distorted the market of meats in the country . And that may have caused by now this glut that Secretary Pi ? ol is talking about . Again , the information I received could be fake . <p> On the third option , Secretary Pi ? ol can not use sanitary and phytosanitary ( SPS ) measures to restrict meat imports . A few Bureau of Plant Industry ( BPI ) officials during the administration of former President Aquino reportedly slowed down the issuance of SPS permits allegedly to raise prices of garlic in the country . Is n't there a case on this already in the Sandiganbayan ? <p> SPS permits are issued when the conditions for them are met by the applicant . If the applicant meets the country 's health and sanitary standards of meats and meat products , the BPI has no choice but to approve the application . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at a time when local garlic harvest was bad , causing prices to go up by more than 300% . Senate Agriculture Committee Chairperson , Senator Villar conducted several hearings on the problem , and because of what she did , eyes are focused now on SPS regulators to prevent a similar abuse in other industries . <p> The WTO rules may be the least of Secretary Pi ? ol 's concern . He announced his plan to issue quantity restrictions for imported meats , if in his judgment doing so serves the best interest of our agriculture sector . <p> WTO rules aside , let us talk about the cons and pros of restricting meat imports . I am for staying the course on liberalizing meat imports . The meat processing industry grew because of imported meats . They import meats because there is not just enough locally of the kinds of meats they need and at prices competitive with imported ones . <p> Livestock raisers may have another opinion , and they may be correct . But the rebuttal mirrors what they have been receiving from corn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and chicken . The raisers and feed millers have wanted to import corn , because in their words there is not enough corn in the country , or the corn price is higher than what they could get for in the world market . <p> Corn farmers shoot back saying there is enough corn in the country , but the transportation logistics is not good enough to make it available to the livestock raisers in the provinces surrounding Metro Manila . <p> Big hotels and restaurants can take care of their needs under a regime of reduced meat imports . But there are SMEs , who are likely to go under with reduced quotas of imported meats . I remember a friend of mine , Raymund Fabre , who was running a small restaurant as his other skill to his competence working in the development industry . It was ten years ago , when he invited me to his mobile diner in what used to be open spaces in the now uptown side of Bonifacio Global City . I am saying this not to remind Raymund to invite me again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the WTO Agreement on Agriculture , which led the way to tariffying the meat import quotas . He can survive paying the tariff on his imported meat , but he can not with a quota because of the uncertainty it brings to his business . <p> However , it takes the sector in the opposite direction of faster growth . Faster growing agriculture sectors in the rest of ASEAN 5 have significantly stronger farm trade capacity . Both their exports and imports of farm products are significantly higher . <p> Meat prices in the country should be in the neighborhood of landed cost of imported meats plus the tariff . If policy makers calibrate trade policy to make inefficient livestock raisers survive , i.e. those whose costs are unnecessarily high , whose technologies are out of date , or simply who ca n't offer their products at internationally competitive prices , they raise prices of meats and make investments in downstream industries less viable . They end up quashing the job and business opportunities in meat-using industries . <p> Efficient members of the industry support trade protection , because not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra profits , but also they shield them as well from intense competition from meat importers . <p> The growth of our agriculture sector has lagged behind the rest of the economy . Many have blamed extreme weather for that . Climate change can not be discounted as one of the important factors , but trade protection can be another . <p> The farm industry 's lackluster growth may be traced to these : its inefficient members survive ; the efficient ones are not compelled to be as competitive as their international competitors ; and their market is thin , with prices that make the country 's downstream industries less viable . <p> Reduced imported meat quota can do that to the livestock , meats , and downstream meat industries . However , if the Secretary decides not to push with his plan , that would be a move forward . <p> Some in the development industry , and this includes me , need to reflect and act on the need to complete the reform process : help displaced farmers transition to other sources of incomes in the least time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy reform leaves a scar in society 's fabric . After decades , the grievance fuels future leader to swing the policy reform cycle back to trade protection and slower growth . <p> Financial resources are needed to assist backyard livestock raisers who ca n't survive the competition with imported meats find other sources of income . In theory this should not be as difficult , since there is positive net benefit of the reform effort . <p> Taxing the winners to compensate the losers from a policy reform is a centuries-old idea attributed to an economist by the name of Kaldor . We need to operationalize Kaldor 's idea , and refrain from paying lip service to inclusive trade liberalization . <p> But there is reason to be hopeful . In the recent rice tariffication law , consumers of rice are taxed at the rate of 35% , the revenues of which are to be used to make rice farmers competitive , including assisting farmers diversify into other industries . Consumers still get their rice price lower than in the previous regime of a QR in rice . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enhancement fund , which rings a sourly familiar tune , like the Agriculture Competitiveness Enhancement Fund or ACEF . This was the fund created by the 1996 agriculture tariffication act from the revenues of the tariffs on MAVs Policy makers have regarded ACEF as a complete failure .

@@70729235 <p> Welcome to Rappler , a social news network where stories inspire community engagement and digitally fuelled actions for social change . Rappler comes from the root words " rap " ( to discuss ) + " ripple " ( to make waves ) . <p> MANILA , Philippines -- The sleepy town of Masinloc , Zambales was a flurry of activity late morning of April 8 . Cameras clicked away as a small crowd headed towards the sea and waved flags of the Philippines . Leading the pack were 4 Otso Diretso senatorial candidates still trailing in the pre-election surveys : Gary Alejano , Chel Diokno , Samira Gutoc , and Florin Hilbay . <p> Miles away , the Chinese Coast Guard still occupies Panatag Shoal in the West Philippine Sea , a part of the South China Sea that belongs to the Philippines , but which China is claiming as its own . <p> " WPS ( West Philippine Sea ) , atin ito ( this is ours ) ! " cried the senatorial bets flanked by some of their supporters . <p> The Otso Diretso candidates then posed beside a jet ski parked at the pier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his campaign promise to ride the watercraft to parts of Philippine territory with a Chinese presence . <p> They later boarded a fishing boat -- which remained anchored on the pier -- and raised the Philippine flag once more . Alejano and Diokno even took a dip in the water . <p> The next day , Presidential Spokesperson Salvador Panelo quickly dismissed Otso Diretso 's Masinloc visit as " childish gimmickry " and " cheap political propaganda " designed to get media mileage for the slate as they " lambast " Duterte 's foreign policy . <p> It did not help that the President 's supporters found reasons to nitpick the visit , including Gutoc 's obvious mistake of wearing her life vest backwards . <p> This is not the first time Otso Diretso has resorted to publicity stunts in the 2019 elections . There was Otso Diretso 's debate challenge against their opponents under the Hugpong ng Pagbabago ( HNP ) slate at the historic Plaza Miranda on February 25 , a date deliberately chosen as it was also the 33rd anniversary of the EDSA People Power Revolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fired a comeback against Otso Diretso -- presidential daughter and Davao City Mayor Sara Duterte Carpio said the candidates endorsed by her regional party are willing to debate with Otso Diretso , but not " palengke style . " <p> Buzz for a vote <p> Should political publicity stunts be frowned upon then ? The quick answer is no . The campaign period , after all , is a time when candidates are literally given the chance to make themselves stand out among the scores of other people running for the same seats . <p> " The objective is to create buzz or talk about the issue in the hope to gain votes , " said Severino Sarmenta , a former two-term chair of the Communication Department of the Ateneo de Manila University on the goal of political publicity stunts . <p> " Publicity attempts are all around during the campaign , from the time the candidate submits a certificate of candidacy to the campaign trail and all the way to the time he or she casts his or her vote . For example , United States presidential candidates often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Sarmenta , who was a practitioner and a professor in the fields of public relations and corporate communications for 3 decades . <p> But for political publicity stunts to work their magic , they have to be done right . Meaning , they should not only lead to headlines about the candidates , but the stunts must also convince more people to vote for the senatorial aspirants in May . <p> As far as raising voters ' awareness of Otso Diretso is concerned , their publicity stunts worked in their favor . <p> Sarmenta said a publicity stunt can be deemed a success if it achieves 3 things : <p> it gained mileage online and in traditional media formats <p> the public talked about the issue , whether online or offline <p> the stunt 's targeted candidates " find it difficult to deny the accusation or are unable to counter the issues raised by the ruse " <p> News reports were written and aired about the debate challenge and the Masinloc visit of Otso Diretso , as well as the administration officials ' and candidates ' responses to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- and opposing -- the publicity stunts . <p> " These publicity efforts are commendable given the disadvantage the Otso Diretso line-up has . The strongest and arguably most appealing for the news outlets was the Masinloc visit because there was a strong visual ( the jet ski ) and it came at a time where there was n't much news going along with the story , " said Sarmenta . <p> Otso Diretso 's challenge against HNP at Plaza Miranda also allowed the opposition bets to brand themselves as the ones brave enough to join debates . And rightly so , as all Otso Diretso candidates have participated in several debates organized by news organizations and the academe in the past weeks . <p> But one thing is glaring : even with the publicity stunts , there has been minimal movement in the Otso Diretso bets ' voter preference ratings -- the numbers that will play a bigger role come election day . The coveted spots in the so-called winners ' circle in the pre-election polls are still not within grasp of most of the Otso Diretso candidates . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slate , but did not necessarily make the candidates shine individually . <p> " What 's always bothering me about Otso Diretso 's campaign is that ' Otso Diretso ' is not in the ballot box . So it can be at the expense of the individuals , " former Ateneo School of Government dean Tony La Vi ? a told Rappler . <p> " They need to actually get out of there . In stunts like these , the individuals disappear behind the brand . But the people do n't vote for the brand , " said La Vi ? a . <p> As an example , La Vi ? a explained that when news outlets wrote about the Masinloc visit , the candidates were still lumped together as one slate that went there . He said Gutoc was highlighted , but only because she committed a faux pas using her life vest . <p> " In both cases , the candidates disappeared except about the negative thing about Samira getting called out over her life vest . But that 's okay , at least the media talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just Otso Diretso , " said La Vi ? a in Filipino . <p> WRONG SIDE . Marawi civic leader Samira Gutoc wears her life vest backwards as she posed for a photo while riding a jet ski in Masinloc , Zambales . Photo from Gutoc 's Facebook page <p> As for the debate challenge , its impact was limited because the Philippines has yet to embrace a culture of debate when it comes to politics . University of the Philippines political science assistant professor Jean Encinas Franco said this is why branding yourself as the candidate who willingly debates can only boost your campaign up to a certain extent . <p> " Media networks and some schools are really trying to sort of inculcate a culture of debate for the campaign . But it has not yet seeped into the Filipino psyche , kaya walang talo kung hindi makikipag-debate ( so you wo n't lose anything if you do n't join debates ) , " Franco told Rappler . <p> " Why would you agree to a debate when you are already having high survey ratings ? ... Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have resources to create good political ads , which you have control of in terms of what questions will be asked ? " she added . <p> For Franco , the challenge facing Otso Diretso in the last two weeks of the campaign is for them to find a way to " move the people 's collective imagination , " whether it be through another publicity stunt or through their usual door-to-door campaigning . <p> But it 's a race against time , a fight made even more difficult when Otso Diretso has " reluctant " supporters who got turned off by the Masinloc publicity stunt , like 25-year-old Manuel Angulo . <p> " That same fixation on the jet ski remark made by the President before and used by the Otso Diretso shows me , as a voter , that their positioning as an opposition is as an opposition relegated only to President Duterte and not to the longstanding political issues and exclusionary economic landscape that had brought President Duterte to power . It is a short-sighted opposition and this became more apparent through the stunt , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an alternative not only to the man but to the present situation , this had failed to meet what I had hoped to see from an opposition . It was petty , it did not give me and perhaps other voters anything to be excited about should these people come to power , " he added . <p> Can Otso Diretso change his and others ' minds ? -- Rappler.com <p> Photo of Otso Diretso beside the jet ski in Masinloc taken on April 8 , 2019 by Ben Nabong/Rappler <h> Beyond investigation <p> Newsbreak was built on the tradition of integrity-driven investigative reporting .

@@70746240 <h> School active-shooter drills : Helpful or harmful ? <p> The 360 is a feature designed to show you diverse perspectives on the day 's top stories . <h> Speed read <p> What 's happening : Active-shooter drills for students and teachers have become protocol amid the rise in school mass shootings . In recent years , up to 95 percent of schools in the U.S. held some sort of drill or lockdown to prepare them for the possibility of becoming the next Newtown or Parkland . <p> Why there 's debate : Critics say rather than preparing students ( most of whom will likely never experience an active shooter ) with potentially life-saving safety procedures , the training videos and exercises can instead cause trauma . Gun-control supporters say the programs unfairly place the responsibility for children 's safety on the children themselves . <p> Proponents of the drills say the potential negative effects are a worthy tradeoff , even if the statistical likelihood is low that kids who get the training will experience a shooting . <p> It 's difficult to quantify the effectiveness of the training , and most data is anecdotal , i.e. some survivors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , while other accounts suggest the drills actually put students in more danger . <p> What 's next : Pushback against the methods used in active-shooter drills has increased in recent years . News coverage of tactics some schools have utilized -- including mock executions , officers firing blanks and allowing students to believe the drill was a real shooting -- have led to calls for standardized guidelines for how the drills are carried out . Some drills have resulted in lawsuits . <p> The president has called active-shooter trainings " very bad for children " and instead endorses plans to " harden " schools , such as arming teachers and installing bulletproof doors . Some schools have begun to change their approaches to minimize the anxiety of students . <h> Perspectives <p> Active-shooter training saves lives <p> " My teachers are the light .

Every teacher should have training for a school shooting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting survivor , The New York Times <p> " We can not keep waiting around for something to change .

For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for others , it involves having guidance counselors or school psychologists available during and after the drills , " Elizabeth Chuck , NBC News <p> " Despite the statistical rarity , obsessing over the risk and frequent reminders that a Columbine-style shooting could happen anywhere do more to elevate fear than alleviate it .

Be it the exciting series between the Warriors and the Rockets in the NBA playoffs or the ultimate battle between the forces of good and evil in Avengers : Endgame , competition demands that both sides bring out their best performance , and most often , regardless of the outcome , the viewing public emerges as the winner . No one wants to spend hard-earned money and valuable time on a rigged match . <p> In the business arena , competition is equally important . It incentivizes companies to offer consumers the best quality products and services at the best prices in all instances , and to prioritize innovation to secure long-term operational sustainability . Competition among companies can be best illustrated in a bidding process where companies enter into the competing business arena set up by the prospective client as they try to outbid each other in terms of product quality and prices . In both government and private business procurement , biddings increase the likelihood that clients receive the best value in exchange for their scarce resources . <p> But what if the contending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manipulated the outcome of the bidding process for their own benefit ?

Companies and individuals who commit this type of violation may be held administratively and criminally liable , regardless of intent . <p> Common forms of bid rigging include cover bidding , bid suppression , bid rotation and market allocation . How do you know if bid riggers are ripping you off ?

These investigations may be motu propio -- on the PCC 's own initiative -- or upon the filing of a verified complaint by an interested party , or upon referral by a regulatory agency . <p> The PCC may impose fines and penalties up to P100 million for the first offense , between P100 million and P250 million for the second offense , and between P150 million and P250 million for succeeding offenses .

The fine will be tripled if the bid rigging involves basic necessities and prime commodities as defined by Republic Act 7581 or the Price Act . <p> Notwithstanding , however , the administrative and criminal penalties that may be imposed on erring entities for bid rigging , a participant may still be immune from prosecution or have the administrative fines reduced if said participant will avail himself of the PCC 's Leniency Program . <p> Thus , if anyone suspects that any of the above anticompetitive conducts may have been committed , you may report this to the PCC immediately .

@@70768235 <p> THE Energy Regulatory Commission ( ERC ) is set to deliberate on how to move forward in promoting greater competition in the retail electricity business as the licenses of those authorized to engage in it are about to expire by 2021 to 2022 while a court-issued temporary restraining order ( TRO ) remains unresolved . <p> " Really , we have to be very careful lest we may be , the action of the ERC , may be construed as something that would breach the line of the TRO . We 're very careful . But of course , we have studied this and it 's now ready for commission deliberations , " said Agnes VST Devanadera , ERC chairperson and chief executive officer . <p> The commission 's top official was reacting to questions on the agency 's next move amid the continuing impasse in the full implementation of rules governing retail competition and open access ( RCOA ) , a scheme that aims to increase the number of electricity suppliers thus lowering the cost of power . <p> On Feb. 21 , 2017 , the Supreme Court issued a TRO against a circular issued by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the ERC , less than a week before Feb. 26 , 2017 when power users consuming an average of at least 1 megawatt ( MW ) per month for the past year are required to source power from a licensed retail electricity supplier ( RES ) and away from distribution utilities . <p> In issuing the TRO , the high court noted that the petitioners -- entities that include schools and business groups -- had established " a clear , legal right " considering that Republic Act 9136 or the Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 ( EPIRA ) provides for the voluntary migration of end-users to the contestable market . <p> Among the provisions that were put on hold is the issuance of new RES licenses . The DoE has since issued a circular making the migration voluntary instead of mandatory , although the ERC opted to wait for the resolution of the case at the Supreme Court . <p> " We have seven expired licenses , and we have also received 12 applications to renew licenses , " said ERC Spokesperson Floresinda B.

Maceda said the pending RES license applications remain " active " while the agency studies the way forward amid the TRO . <p> Based on existing rules , a RES with an expired license stands to lose its license should it continue to operate . It can also be penalized . <p> " But there 's already a study done and meron na pong recommendation din na pag-uusapan ng ( there 's also a recommendation that will be discussed by the ) commission , " she said .

Borja <p> Just yesterday , millions of registered Filipino voters headed to their respective precincts to exercise their rights to suffrage . Leading up to Election Day , Filipinos were bombarded with countless campaign advertisements -- from catchy jingles and sponsored social media posts to political rallies and public debates -- all in the hope that candidates could influence and win the people 's vote . Now , candidates and voters alike are in limbo , hoping and praying that the election odds are in their favor . <p> For taxpayers , the election is not over yet . Other than voting during yesterday 's midterm elections , taxpayers have another selection to make , this time in their first quarter income tax returns ( ITR ) . For individual taxpayers who are required to file ITRs , the deadline for their first quarter ITR for 2019 is tomorrow , May 15 ; for corporate taxpayers , the deadline is May 30 . <p> INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS For individual taxpayers , certain sole proprietors engaged in business or those practicing their profession have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Specifically , they have to choose whether they will apply an 8% or a 0 to 35% graduated income tax rate . In addition , such individual taxpayers also have the option to choose how to deduct against their gross receipts/sales : itemized deduction or optional standard deduction ( OSD ) . <p> 8% PREFERENTIAL OR 0 TO 35% GRADUATED The 8% tax option is applicable to qualified individuals whose gross receipts or gross sales and other non-operating income for the taxable year do not exceed P3,000,000 . When the individual opts for the 8% tax , it will be a straightforward computation of their gross sales or receipts , less a P250,000 exemption , then multiplied by the 8% income tax rate . If the taxpayer opts for the 0 to 35% graduated income tax rates , on the other hand , they can subtract the allowable deductions against their gross receipts or gross sales to arrive at their net taxable income . <p> ITEMIZED DEDUCTION OR 40% OSD Individual taxpayers also have the power to choose the manner of deduction taken to arrive at their net taxable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business-related expenses , such as salaries , rentals , and depreciation expenses , among others . Note that the conditions of deductibility under the tax rules apply to such expenses . By choosing itemized deduction , there could be instances where the bottom line result is a net loss , rather than a net income . <p> OSD , on the other hand , is equivalent to 40% of the taxpayer 's gross sales or gross receipts . As its name suggests , the OSD is a fixed percentage of the taxpayer 's income . Under this method , there will always be a net taxable income , since only 40% is being deducted against the taxpayer 's income . <p> CORPORATE TAXPAYERS Corporate taxpayers can choose whether to adopt the itemized deduction or the OSD methods . <p> Under the itemized deduction method , corporate taxpayers will be allowed to deduct actual corporate business expenses ; likewise , the conditions for deductibility apply to each type of expense . In contrast , the OSD is computed in an amount not exceeding 40% of the corporate taxpayer 's gross income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the OSD for individuals is based on their gross sales or receipts , the OSD for corporations is based on gross income . <p> IRREVOCABILITY OF THE ELECTION The choice of tax regime ( whether 8% or graduated income tax rates for individuals ) or the option of method of deduction ( whether itemized deduction or OSD ) is irrevocable for the applicable taxable year . Once the selection is made , it can not be changed by any future amendment of the ITR . <p> For individual income taxpayers , what tax rate then should a home-based online consultant choose to compute their income taxes for the year ? Should they make the same decision as a financial adviser regularly earning commissions ? What about a businessman who owns and operates a gas station or a hardware store ? Should they take same option as a practicing doctor or lawyer ? The individual 's projected income for 2019 must be considered . <p> Similarly , for corporate taxpayers , budgeted or forecast income statements for the year are prepared . These budgets and forecasts should be carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more advantageous . A corporation with an expected low profit margin or incurring losses would more likely opt for itemized deduction ; while companies with a high profit margin could consider OSD . <p> These are just general reminders on the taxpayer 's election for the first quarter ITR . The details can be carefully read in Revenue Regulations No. 16-2008 , 08-2018 , and other related issuances . Additionally , taxpayers need to make a cautious analysis of their financial figures or projections and other circumstances . <p> So , the May 13 elections have ended , and it can be surmised that Filipino voters thought matters through before casting their ballots . In the same vein , it is obviously fitting that taxpayers make the same responsible evaluation when it comes to their choices related to filing their first quarter ITR .

@@70801237 <p> Welcome to Rappler , a social news network where stories inspire community engagement and digitally fuelled actions for social change . Rappler comes from the root words " rap " ( to discuss ) + " ripple " ( to make waves ) . <p> This was what then-budget chief Benjamin Diokno told reporters in a briefing late 2017 , when lawmakers critical of President Rodrigo Duterte complained that funds for their districts suffered deep cuts or had been completely removed under the 2018 budget . <p> Back when Davao del Norte 1st district Representative Pantaleon Alvarez was still House speaker , he repeatedly used the budget to sway districts to supporting Duterte 's pet bills . In January 2018 , he threatened lawmakers they would be getting a " zero budget " if they opposed federalism . <p> The budget for this year is the last fiscal plan to be prepared under the 17th Congress . <p> The 2019 national budget was prepared during Alvarez ' time as House speaker . And it was not spared from controversies that eventually led to budget delay -- starting with the new House leadership 's rejection of a cash-based budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Camarines Sur 1st district Rolando Andaya against Diokno . <p> The senators were n't happy with the congressmen 's conduct . The budget bill was not passed before the end of 2018 , due to the late transmission of the House-approved bill to the Senate . <p> This gave the Senate little time to scrutinize the budget . <p> To make matters worse , the controversy dragged on until April with senators accusing congressmen of itemizing infrastructure projects in the budget bill after bicameral conference committee talks , in such a way that these projects would " benefit " the localities of the House leadership and their allies . <p> ' Cholesterol-rich ' <p> In February , Senator Panfilo Lacson said in a privilege speech that Andaya " asserted " that congressmen formerly aligned with Alvarez benefitted from the controversial P75 billion worth of " insertions . " <p> Lacson called the budget bill " cholesterol-rich . " <p> " The new leadership ... mangled beyond recognition the Department of Public Works and Highways-proposed budget , specifically those projects that they believed were part of the P75 billion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparent pork insertions from the alleged connivance of the Department of Budget and Management and the old leadership of the House of Representatives were deliberately reallocated by the newly-assumed leadership as their own pork barrel , " he added . <p> Under the National Expenditure Program ( NEP ) , or the proposed budget from the DBM , the funds allocated for the DPWH stood at P555.67 billion or 113.85 billion more than its allocation from 2018 . The figure represents a 25.75% hike . <p> When the budget bill was transmitted to the Office of the President after bicam deliberations , it was trimmed down to P549.39 billion -- with a " strong reservation " note from the Senate . After the veto , DPWH is now only at P454.02 billion . <p> What could possibly be the source of corruption in infrastructure funds if these were not vetoed ? <p> More than half of what was removed from the DPWH 's budget fell under the local roads program . Under the 2019 NEP , the funds for local roads should only be at P33.84 billion , but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the veto came , the President removed a total of P40.27 billion worth of funds for local roads . <p> After local roads , about a fifth of what was removed came from the capital outlays for flood control facilities amounting to P22.05 billion . Next to it was the allocation for national roads at P15.89 billion and the funds for the construction of multipurpose buildings or facilities . <p> Share of the pie <p> Sorting through the list of the vetoed projects showed that the bulk of the funds were placed under Metro Manila . <p> The amount was a staggering P76.13 billion , followed by a far second , Davao Region with P4.54 billion . Third was Central Luzon at P4.24 billion . <p> Rappler found that 68 DPWH offices have a share in the P95.37 billion , with P74.07 billion , or more than a third , allocated under the Central Office . The document showed that this would have been implemented in various areas in the country . <p> It was followed by the Davao del Norte District Engineering Office ( DEO ) at P2.38 billion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DEO in Davao City would have received P1.41 billion . <p> The DEOs in Bulacan and Abra were the last DEOs to breach the P1-billion mark at P1.23 billion and P1.28 billion , respectively . <p> The rest of the DEOs received multimillion-peso funds each , ranging from P775 million to P2.8 million . <p> Luckiest provinces ? <p> One could think that because the capital region already has more than enough infrastructure , it would n't need a bulk of the funds , <p> The funds under the Central Office showed that 619 projects from 50 provinces would have benefitted from its P74.07 billion allocation . <p> Of the provinces , Agusan del Norte would have received the most allocation at P6.83 billion for 49 projects , with costs ranging from P88 million to P400 million . <p> The 5 provinces in the Davao Region all made it to the Top 10 , with a total share of at least P19.27 billion or more than a fourth of the total allocation for the Central Office : <p> Davao del Sur , where Davao City is located , ranked 2nd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davao Occidental ranked 4th at P4.4 billion <p> Davao Oriental ranked 6th at P3.85 billion <p> Davao del Norte ranked 8th at P2.58 billion <p> Compostela Valley ranked 9th at P2.5 billion <p> A total of 112 projects for the Davao Region were part of the vetoed list or about a fourth of the total projects . The amounts of the projects ranged from P14.85 million to P842.08 million . <p> At least 64 projects from the total were under local roads and bridges , 21 for the construction of multipurpose facilities , 15 for flood control facilities , 10 for national roads and bridges , a payment of right-of-way , and a feasibility study . <p> The most expensive project , which cost P842.08 billion , was for a bypass road at the junction of Davao-Cotabato Road and Matina-Aplaya Road to the junction of Tulip Drive in Davao City . The list did not include how long the bypass road was intended to be , but the estimated distance based on the map was about 3 kilometers . <p> Meanwhile , the non-Davao provinces that made it to Top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ billion , Batangas at P2.65 billion , and Bulacan at P2.4 billion . <p> At least 20 provinces would have received more than a billion each . The rest of the 30 provinces ranged from P960 million to P90 million , with Nueva Vizcaya having the least allocation . <p> Who would have the most share ? <p> As funds will not be coming from the DEOs solely , but from the Central Office as well , Rappler combined the total funds that congressional districts would have received under the vetoed P95.37 billion . <p> Of the legislative districts , Davao City would have gotten the most out of the vetoed funds for a total of P7.43 billion . Davao City was represented by Karlo Nograles , the former House committee on appropriations chairperson , before he left to be the Cabinet Secretary . <p> He was followed by Agusan del Norte 1st district Representative Lawrence Lemeul Fortun with P5.99 billion for the projects in his district , mostly in Butuan City . <p> The third district with the most funds allotted was represented by Davao Occidental Lone District Representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Alvarez with a total amount of P4.4 billion and then Albay 2nd district Representative Joey Salceda . <p> Arroyo ranked 6th only at P2.98 billion . Previously , Arroyo pointed at Alvarez for getting " bigger " budgets for their districts . She also said she felt she was " unfairly " accused of the alleged insertions . <p> The veto will result in P19.06 billion of savings in " pork commission " -- supposedly 20% of the vetoed funds , according to Lacson . <p> With the budget now passed , the Philippines is now operating on a fresh budget that will allow new programs and projects to be implemented . <p> The reenacted budget during the 1st quarter of the year has hurt the country 's growth prospects -- a 4-year low during the 1st quarter at 5.6% .

@@70811234 <h> Nobody deserves the NBA Finals more than ' Playoff Lowry ' <p> TORONTO -- Perhaps it was just a coping mechanism after all the years of failure , but the otherwise feisty Kyle Lowry had committed all season to Kawhi Leonard 's mantra of never getting too high , and never getting too low . <p> That is , until it dawned on Lowry that he was finally headed to the NBA Finals in his 13th season . A goofy grin washed over his face as he hugged the ball in the dying seconds of Game 6 , and in that moment he finally lost composure . Deafening chants of " LOW-RY " roared around Scotiabank Arena after the final buzzer , and the veteran guard was so giddy that it even corrupted the otherwise unshakable stoicism of Leonard , who could n't help but crack a smile . <p> Leonard grabbed all the headlines for his 29-point , 17-rebound , and seven-assist performance , but it took two All-Stars to come back from down 15 points to eliminate the Milwaukee Bucks . It was Lowry who drained back-to-back 3s to keep the Raptors close in the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Khris Middleton on skates before sneaking an impossible layup over Brook Lopez that bought the Raptors some breathing room in the fourth quarter . He picked off Middleton to set up Leonard 's poster on Giannis Antetokounmpo , while recording another four assists in the fourth that produced another 10 points . <p> Lowry also kept the coolest head under pressure . He was the only one in the building to recognize that the shot clock had malfunctioned , as he held onto the ball with 7.9 seconds left instead of throwing up a heave out of panic . Replays confirmed Lowry 's instincts -- Pascal Siakam grazed the rim on his layup attempt before kicking it out , and so the Raptors had possession with the shot clock turned off . After a few laborious attempts , the Raptors finally inbounded the ball , and Siakam stepped to the line to ice the series , thanks to a head 's up read by Lowry . <p> To casual observers that propagated the " Playoff Lowry " label , his clutch heroics and his 19-5-5 average in six games against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followers , this was just what Lowry had always done . Momentum-shifting 3s , daredevil drives , timely defensive stops , brilliant playmaking , and every hustle play imaginable -- Lowry not only delivered a win during the most important game in franchise history , but he changed the narrative about his career . <p> It was always unfair to Lowry that he became the punchline in any discussion of the Raptors ' shortcomings . Just as he did in the regular season , Lowry was a huge net positive and maximized the talent around him in the playoffs . He came up short when he was miscast as a No. 1 option , but that speaks more to DeMar DeRozan 's repeated inability to perform in his role . And yet it was Lowry who gained a reputation for choking , while others skated by the criticism . Now that Leonard is doing the job that DeRozan could n't , Lowry has settled into a more suitable secondary role , and his contributions are finally being appreciated . <p> This should be the official record of Lowry 's tenure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Raptors , and this run of six-straight postseason appearances would not be possible without him . The biggest break in Raptors history was James Dolan being too jaded by his previous dealings with Masai Ujiri to pull the trigger on a trade in 2013 . Lowry had his bags packed for New York , but instead he stuck around , blossomed into a star , and took the Raptors from the basement to the top . <p> Lowry always sacrificed for the sake of winning . He was first the little pitbull that somehow bum-rushed his way to the hoop , but Lowry eventually developed into one of the most prolific shooters in the league when he rounded into his 30s . When DeRozan emerged as a ball-dominant wing , Lowry learned to be effective playing off the ball . And when Leonard arrived along with Siakam 's breakout , Lowry again changed his role to become one of the best passers in the game . <p> There 's a reason why Lowry is the lone holdover from their first playoff run in 2014 . DeRozan gave way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was flipped for Serge Ibaka , and Dwane Casey was replaced by Nick Nurse , all because the Raptors needed upgrades at those positions to win at the highest level . Lowry stayed because the Raptors maintained that he could be the engine of a championship contender so long as they surrounded him with the right pieces , and now their faith in Lowry has been rewarded . <p> That 's why there was such an outpouring of emotion inside Scotiabank Arena when Lowry finally got his hands on that elusive Eastern Conference championship trophy . He was always a winner despite his reputation , and nobody deserved to be in the Finals more than " Playoff Lowry . "

@@70843230 <p> To the casual eye , it seems like a massive expense ; and it is , at least on the surface . That 's what 's on my mind when Nissan said that they 'd like to send me to the 2019 UEFA Champions League Final match in Madrid . I was honored , for sure , but I was a bit skeptical . <p> What was an automotive writer from a non-football country in Asia supposed to write about Nissan 's partnership with the final game of the UCL ? The answer would come after spending a few days in the capital of Spain , but the story begins in the air . <p> As fun as flying to Europe sounds , spending almost a whole day in transit is n't . The flight from Manila to Doha to Madrid is sixteen and a half hours long and winds back the clock 7 hours ; no , wait , it 's 6 because of DST . On the connection from Qatar , already the landscape of the plane changed . Quite a few guys , Brits I presume , were clad in either red for Liverpool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of expats from England in in the Middle East , and quite a few of them were flying into Spain for the final . UEFA is not a tournament of national football ( aka : soccer ) , but rather a competition of the top tier football clubs ( or FCs ) in Europe . <p> The final four teams were Tottenham Hotspur FC ( London , UK ) , AFC Ajax ( Amsterdam , Netherlands ) , FC Barcelona ( Barcelona , Spain ) , and Liverpool FC ( Liverpool , UK ) . The Spurs knocked out Ajax in the semifinal while Liverpool knocked out Barca , setting the stage for an all-English final in Madrid . Hence all the Brits on the plane and some of them , like my seatmate , did not have tickets for this sold-out game . They 'll take their chances with the scalpers at stadium or the peripheral events , I 've been told . <p> The moment we landed , we realized just how much football fever has come to Spain . The airport was full of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We do n't have numbers , but beer consumption per capita must have gone up thanks to the many tapas bars full with ladies and lads from the UK . <p> The city had been redecorated in UEFA colors , and there are pocket events happening in major public squares like Plaza Mayor and Puerta del Sol . They put up a small football pitch inside Plaza Mayor , together with booths from sponsors like Sony , complete with PlayStations . In Puerta del Sol , you can find a stage for performers , a Heineken bar with free-flowing beer ( as evidenced by the many inebriated fans stumbling around ) , a merchandise store with very long lines , and the Nissan booth where you can test your football skills on a 360-degree challenge . <p> Nissan had been a sponsor of the UEFA Champions League for the last 5 seasons , but this year is special : they 're making a big push for electric vehicles . It 's not surprising given that Nissan does have the number one EV in the world in the Leaf . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on pure electricity , they lent 363 vehicles to UEFA to shuttle people around , hence the many Leafs and eNV200s running around the city . <p> The next day , we actually took a few Leafs around for a drive outside of the city . This would be the first time we 've had our hands on a left-hand drive example of the 40 kilowatt-hour version of the Leaf , the same ( or similar ) version that we will get in the Philippine market sometime in 2020 . We got a good feel for the vehicle and you 'll get to read more about it in a feature in the next few days , but for now , we can say that the biggest advantage it has is that it 's a very fun and practical everyday car , and not a mere science experiment . Once Nissan gets it to the Philippines , we think it will reshape the way we think about automobiles in the market , especially in the city . The one I was really looking to try out in the future , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come game time , every one in our small group of Filipinos in Madrid really did n't know what to expect from a UEFA final with the exception of one : his name is Phil , and he plays with the Philippine Azkals . But we did n't need a Younghusband 's knowledge of the game to appreciate the football fever around us . The moment we marched into the stadium that was filled to capacity with almost 68,000 fans , we were in awe . <p> Interestingly enough , Spain 's capital is home to the top two ranked teams in UEFA : Real Madrid and Atletico Madrid , respectively . Neither were able to make it past the Round of 16 elimination stages though . I can only imagine what the stadium and the city would have been like if one of those two teams made it into the final , but there 's very something different about an all-British UCL final . <p> To our right were the supporters of Tottenham , all clad in white and/or blue . To our left were the fans of Liverpool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of red . All of them flew here from their towns or wherever in the world they were located . All of them had flags or banners of their respective clubs . All of them sang their club songs : You 'll Never Walk Alone and Allez Allez Allez for Liverpool and Glory Glory for Tottenham . You ca n't help but be in awe at what you just walked into . <p> This was the atmosphere brought out by passionate English football fans , something we do n't have on our islands . According to Phil , our football is n't anywhere near as supported by the government or by corporations , a sad fact given that Filipino teams can be competitive on a global stage given that height is n't really as big a requirement as quickness , speed and tenacity . In terms of atmosphere and passion , I 'm not so sure the local PBA games can compare because they 're named after corporations rather than locations , but perhaps the feel of watching UAAP or NCAA college basketball game at Araneta can . Minus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire stadium stand every time the ball gets close to the goal , and you can almost feel an earthquake when that ball goes in . Phil said the game itself was not an excellent one in terms of play , but it was the feel of being there that was getting to us . One of the Nissan executives behind me was livid when we thought the referee missed calling a handball , and was visibly inconsolable at the final whistle when Tottenham went down two goals to nothing . The other Nissan executive beside him was elated , and chanting Liverpool to the top of his lungs that I was worried the beer in his cup would get showered all over us . That 's what it feels like to be in a game like this . The raw emotions and the passion clearly goes through all , and we were just glad to have been there to witness Liverpool 's sixth UEFA Champions League win . <p> We were fortunate to have watched the game close enough that a ball could easily have been kicked our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did . But it also poses the question : Why is Nissan supplying 363 Leaf and eNV200 vehicles , flying people in from all over the world , and pumping in enough money to give the bean counters in Yokohama an aneurism in order to support a football tournament ? <p> The answer to my question came a day after the game when we made our way back to the Nissan booth over at Puerta del Sol . While the guys were out filming and shooting some photos , I stayed and watched as people lined up to try their hand at Nissan 's football lab . A kid came up and tried his foot at the game . He did n't do well and was upset , but in came his dad and they took turns getting the ball into the goals together , and took a snapshot together . That is perhaps the essence of this . <p> In events like the World Cup , national teams play against other national teams . But nations are very big units , drawing fans from all over their respective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up , it 's all about the clubs , and clubs are tied to a particular city , municipality , or even a community . These are units that are much closer to home because you 're cheering for the team that has your town 's name , and you 're doing it next to people who probably went to the same schools as you , lived on the same block or street as you , sat in the same church as you , or are directly related to you . You 're with family , quite literally . <p> Judging from what we 've seen with the passion in the stands at the stadium to this father spending time and bonding with his son inside the Nissan booth , that 's exactly who they are connecting with . That 's priceless and goes far beyond what Nissan may have spent to have their name shown all across the stadium , and what a sight it is to see .

@@70846239 <p> Ever since Mazda made any mention of their SkyActiv-X engine , the Japanese automaker has been claiming that it will be a revolution . It 's been almost two years since Mazda showed us how it works , but they have n't mentioned anything that 's probably been on everyone 's heads : what are the specs ? <p> We were expecting to see some figures when the all-new Mazda 3 made its world debut , but none surfaced . There were also no specs shown during its ASEAN premiere at the Singapore Motor Show , and still , nothing was revealed in its local preview . After a long wait , we finally know how much power this " revolutionary " engine makes . <p> The SkyActiv-X has a displacement of 2.0-liters , which sounds pretty normal these days . The horsepower figure is then rated at 180 PS , along with a torque figure of 224 Nm . Those are impressive , if not outstanding outputs .

Before you ask , the SkyActiv-X is a gas-fed engine . <p> With specs like that , it soundly trumps other naturally-aspirated 2.0-liter engines in its class . For example , the two-liter Corolla Altis has 145 PS and 187 Nm of torque , while the Hyundai Elantra makes 152 PS and 192 Nm of torque . This engine is also quite the leap from Mazda 's own 2.0-liter SkyActiv-G , which made 155 PS and 200 Nm of torque . <p> It is then paired to a mild-hybrid system , which shuts off the engine when the vehicle is stationary . Because of the new engine tech and the mild-hybrid system , Mazda is boasting about its high fuel economy figures . According to them , the SkyActiv-X engine in the Mazda 3 can do up to 25.6 kilometers per liter when fitted with a six-speed manual . With the automatic , that drops to 21.2 kilometers per liter . This is hugely impressive for a non-turbo , gas-fed 2.0-liter engine , especially one with 180 PS and 224 Nm of torque .

From 41,793 in 2018 , the number is now 27,721 as of May this year . <p> There are six resident breeding species of seabirds in the Tubbataha Reefs . They can be found in Bird Islet located in the North Atoll , as well as South Islet where a new lighthouse is being built . While these species of seabirds can be found around the world , they are experiencing a rapid decline in the Philippines -- and the ones in Tubbataha are some of the very few that exist in the country today . <p> A subspecies of the Black Noddy ( Anous Minutus ) -- Worcesteri -- - can only be found in the Philippines , and specifically in Tubbataha . <p> " The Black Noddy that we have here is a sub species that is not found elsewhere in the world , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to Cagayancillo , all the way down to Tawi-Tawi , they 're no longer there , " said Tubbataha Management Office ( TMO ) head , Angelique Songco . <p> Songco added that in 2017 , this Black Noddy sub species , A.

Worcesteri 's number decreased from 4,473 in 2018 to 2,072 in 2019 . <p> The sharp decline in Tubbataha 's seabirds is attributed to the loss of trees on the islets . <p> Some of the birds are tree breeders , the Red-Footed Booby and the Black Noddy ( A.M.

@@70849235 <h> The Only Exception -- A Look Into ' Five Feet Apart ' <p> Over the past few years , there has been an increase in literature and movies alike which revolve around the trials and tribulations of those unfortunately inflicted with a certain disease . There was John Green 's ' The Fault in Our Stars ' , Jodi Picoult 's ' My Sister 's Keeper ' and Nicholas Spark 's ' A Walk to Remember ' all depicting the bittersweet love stories of two youths faced with the horrible truth of a life-threatening disease . The thing is , even if movies like these tend to show a dramatized portrayal of certain diseases , one still can not deny the fact that there are those who are burdened by these actual illnesses all over the world every day . Cancer is real , kidney-failure is real and so is cystic fibrosis regardless of how these novels or movies add in a dash of teenage romance for greater audience appeal . <p> ' Five Feet Apart ' is a movie that was inspired by a CF'er ( cystic fibrosis patient ) and YouTuber named Claire Wineland . Claire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own foundation which provides both emotional support and financial support for other CF'ers and their family . She also became a TEDx speaker and operated her own YouTube account where , apart from making people more aware of cystic fibrosis , also showed her daily life living with CF which is not simply being bed-ridden all the time . Eventually , she crossed paths with American actor and director Justin Baldoni when the latter was directing a documentary about CF. The two struck a friendship which resulted in ' Five Feet Apart ' , a movie that showed the love story between two CF'ers , and ultimately the movie was dedicated to her when she passed away 6 months before the movie was released in March of 2019 . <p> The movie opens with a voice-over by leading lady Stella Grant ( played by Haley Lu Richardson ) talking about the importance of touch especially between two lovers . Her voice-over ends just as a shot of a boy 's back appears on screen and we , the viewers , are then shown Stella with her friends talking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to go . Although reassuring them that she still wants them to have fun , after they leave , we can see the sadness in Stella 's face in not being able to go with them and in generally not being able to do a lot of things a teenager should due to her illness -- cystic fibrosis . <p> The movie then goes on into showing her daily routines as a CF'er which includes her nurse and friend Barbara ( played by Kimberly H ? bert Gregory ) allowing her to visit the hospital nursery since Stella adores babies . This may also symbolize the fact that Stella only ever wishes a continuous healthy life to those ill-free . We are also introduced to her best friend and fellow CF'er Poe ( played by Mois ? s Arias ) who is one of the few able to truly know and understand Stella . Not too long after , another CF'er named Will ( played by Cole Sprouse ) ends up in the same hospital as Stella but two start off on the wrong foot . Irked by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CF regimen including the vital six feet apart rule all CF'ers must follow to avoid cross-infections , Stella finds herself visiting Will more and more just to make sure he sticks with the rules . Will , also budding cartoonist , promises to do as Stella wants if she allows him to sketch her . She agrees , albeit hesitantly , but the two eventually develop feelings for one another and ends up secretly dating . She also learns to loosen up and makes an exception with disregarding that one feet of the six feet rule whenever she 's with Will which is her way of finally showing that she is not going to let her disease dictate how she lives . <p> All things seem to go well , until Poe dies and Stella is forced to face the truth once again on how people like her can die anytime soon . She pushes Will away momentarily but the two later makeup and end up holding hands completely disregarding the six feet rule ( although Stella defends the act by saying how both are wearing gloves anyways ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is on is not working and is forced to face the reality that he may die soon . After Stella has a successful lung transplant , he visits her one last time and informs Stella of his condition . He then tells her how they have to part ways as he does not want her to go through another CF-related death with him and asks her to close her eyes as he walks away to make things less painful . After he leaves , Stella is handed Will 's sketchbook revealing how , despite only ever drawing cartoons , he ended up making life-like sketches of her . <p> The film closes with the audience hearing Stella 's voice-over from the start all-over again and we come to realize that she was making a YouTube video all along . The final shot is of the back of the boy who turns around smiling and is revealed to be Will . Stella closes off the movie with , " We need that touch from the one we love almost as much as we need air to breathe but I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't have it . So if you 're watching this , and you 're able , touch him . Touch her . Life 's too short to waste a second . " And if there is anything all of us , sick or not , can take from this , it is exactly how life is too short to live in hesitancies . <p> PAGEONE Media ? is a powerful portfolio of websites that serve over 10 million highly-engaged audience monthly .

For a moment , he crosses his elbows and stands still , like he 's drawing a charge in the Oracle Arena , almost 2,500 miles from Jurassic Park , outside the Scotiabank Arena , where Raptors fans gathered to watch the Raptors grab a 3-1 series lead Friday night . <p> The doomed attempt at achieving stillness passes . He shifts his weight from side to side , punching his fist against his palm until Serge Ibaka nails a three and offers a salve for a perpetually nervous fan base . Our hero , in fact , is not alone -- he just was n't in the mood to talk . His name is Roal , and now he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raptors fans since 2011 , when they moved from the Philippines , where they shot hoops on the playground and occasionally watched YouTube highlights . Do n't tell anyone , but he changed shifts at work to be here tonight . <p> At a timeout , Roal pulls out his phone and shows me a series of messages . Him and his sister , an American cheering for the Warriors , have been trading barbs all night . They bet $50 dollars on the series , although they never agreed on which currency . <p> Jurassic Park , traditionally known as Maple Leaf Square , entered the lexicon five playoffs ago , when president of basketball operations Masai Ujiri ensconced himself in the crowd , grabbed a microphone and exclaimed , among other things , " F--- Brooklyn ! " The energy of the fan base flowed and receded in the proceeding years , but now it has leaked outside of the Scotiabank Theatre , all the way down Bremner Boulevard to the Rogers Center , bleeding into Bay Street , the city 's financial core . Out of curiosity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guard where I could get in and watch the game .

Adam , 34 , grew up loving the Raptors amid a sea of Maple Leafs white and blue . " I remember shoveling snow to clear the court and shooting with my buddy , all winter and all summer . " <p> With what 's left of his voice , he reminisces fondly of the " Damon Stoudamire days , " and his first game at the Skydome , a loss to the Chicago Bulls .

Why ? The same reason that , four years ago , he never would have believed the Raptors could be in this position : " I thought ... nobody wants to come here . " <p> Ah , yeah . It 's Canada -- one twin pillar , alongside conspiracy theories , of the learned helplessness that has bound Raptors fans together for years : Stars wo n't play in Canada , and even if they could , the referees -- who do the bidding of a league that ca n't monetize international ratings -- would never allow them to reach the Finals .

They started seeing the Raptors as the team that could , and that self-belief has been enough to validate the trade . At times , it even feels like the rest of the NBA is more anxious about Leonard 's decision than Raptors fans . <p> " Hey , I still love DeMar , " said Adam , teeming with the inevitable internal conflict that comes from having to move on to move up -- " I got his jersey .

@@70854230 <h> OPINION : Why no one should buy PNP 's claim of " mistaken identity " in journo arrest <h> Inday Espina-Varona -- scaRRedcat <p> There are many what if 's -- most of them dreadful -- surrounding the Sunday ( June 9 ) arrest of veteran Mindanao journalist and development worker Fidelina Margarita " Gingging " Avellanosa-Valle . <p> A brief rundown of the case : Shortly past 11 a.m , journalists got an alert posted from Valle 's son , Rius , the Mindanao spokesperson of the Save Our Schools Network . He said police had nabbed his mother at the Laguindingan Airport as she was about to board a plane back to Davao City , after giving a writing workshop in Pagadian City for the Rural Missionaries of the Philippines ( RMP ) . <p> Rius said Margarita , a writer for community and national news outfits and author of books and research papers since the 1980s , had managed to call a religious sister . She identified the arresting officers as members of the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group ( CIDG ) . <p> Mindanews ' Carolyn Arguillas would later quote Sister Mila Gimeno of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's message and hearing the journalist arguing for her rights . From the sounds heard in the background , force was used , the nun said . <p> What if Margarita was n't so resourceful ? What if she did n't have the kind of goodwill earned from years of toil and the struggle to maintain friendships amid years of strife ? What if she were accosted on some stretch of road with poor signal ? What if it were in the dead of night and colleagues and church groups , and rights groups from all shades of the political spectrum 's progressive side -- Task Force Detainees , Karapatan -- were not able to swing into action ? <p> So many people calling up and down the police hierarchy , to legislators , local government officials , to various aid agencies and the Commission on Human Rights . Within a few hours the Philippine National Police ( PNP ) spokesman Col. Bernard Banac was releasing a report confirming Margarita 's arrest . <p> She was reportedly the subject of two warrants : one dating from 2006 for arson ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustrated murder . Under " who , " the report said : Elsa Renton @ Tina Maglaya/Fidelina Margarita Valle y Avellanosa . <p> There was some confusion : did the warrants really carry the name of Margarita or were cops claiming she and Elsa Renton were one and the same person ? <p> Hours after , on the defensive , the PNP let her go , claiming it was " a case of mistaken identity . " She had been held incommunicado for nine hours . <p> On Monday morning , PNP Director-General Oscar Albayalde waved off the case , claiming police had followed " protocol . " <p> It 's a lame , if typically brazen , excuse for what the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines calls an attempted abduction . <p> Let 's dissect it . <p> Who provided the " mistaken " information that Valle was the person named by the search warrants ? The Philippine Army 's 53rd infantry Battalion , which operates in the Zamboanga peninsula . It has been accused of hounding church groups there that provide aid to indigenous peoples battling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plantation developers . <p> Favorite targets are the Iglesia Filipina Independiente ( IFI ) , the RMP and other faith-based organizations that Valle has worked with through the years . <p> Those warrants were for very old crimes . And those warrants did not mention Valle . <p> How did they make a leap from Elsa Renton to Fidelina Margarita Valle y Avellanosa ? At the very least , " protocol " requires the CIDG first verify the antecedents of the case and check the veracity of identification before making out like the Gestapo . You do n't swoop down on an old woman in an airport on the basis of corner store gossip . <p> Valle has always been a legal personality . Until 2018 , she was a columnist for SunStar Davao . To this day , she is a regular writer for digital news outfit Davao Today . <p> She has criscrossed Mindanao for decades conducting research , interviews , workshops . She has written and spoken out openly for the Lumad , and for her son and other rights workers slapped with ridiculous human trafficking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2016 , in 2017 , in 2018 , and just a few days ago when she accompanied Rius in a hearing in Koronadal . <p> As social media savvy kids like to say , isang google lang yan . <p> Mindanews ' Arguillas also shared what by any angle , seems an impressive CV , all the way back to 2003 : monitoring projects for UN multi-donor programs , writing reports for international agencies , books written and published or co-edited -- the breath of service extending from migrant workers to medical NGOs and women 's groups , and the embattled Lumad schools . <p> This information is all out there on the Internet . <p> It 's not a failure of intelligence on the part of the military or the PNP . Rius calls the explanation " a cover up to save their faces . " <p> " They are trying to put the blame on the ' **32;329;TOOLONG ' , " he says . <p> State security forces have had a sterling record of throwing out lies , so fantastic these would be laughed out of a basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those lies have become more shameless in the last three years . <p> Had there not been a general outcry , Margarita Valle would be in really dire straits . Her case is also a warning : journalists and rights workers who continue to defy the powers face greater hounding in the remaining years of Rodrigo Duterte . <p> And they have n't even passed the new anti-terror law . <p> Disclaimer:The views in this blog are those of the blogger and do not necessarily reflect the views of ABS-CBN Corp .

Though it 's proven to be a source of inspiration for very young female viewers , we 'll give them that , to more discerning viewers it has served as an all-the-more condescending reminder that the franchise has spent the last decade putting its male heroes on a pedestal . <p> It 's really no wonder that the self-awareness of these moments have caused eyes to roll .

Other blockbusters have done this in an even more subtle way by just making their lead female and not looking at them through an objectifying male gaze . <p> The new Star Wars movies and the Transformers prequel Bumblebee do exactly that through Rey and Charlie , and even the latest Disney animations have moved on from the " Princess searching for love " trope by having the likes of Moana and Elsa searching for purpose instead . <p> They also prove that you do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuanced and empowering way as male screenwriters like J.J.

" <p> And so Hwang -- also known as Mel Inspired , or @melhwang -- made the decision to ditch her job and dedicate herself full-time to her personal social media account . With her nearly 50,000 Instagram followers behind her , 19,000 more on YouTube , plus those clicking on her blog , Hwang has managed to turn herself into a social media influencer . And even though she does n't have the following other so-called influencers have -- think Hailey Bieber or Gigi and Bella Hadid or any one of the Kardashian-Jenners -- she is supporting herself through her personal-content marketing . <p> And she 's not alone . <p> Influencers -- loosely defined as social media personalities -- are playing an increasingly significant role when it comes to marketing , especially in the retail industry , offering companies a new and direct way to reach customers . Retailers in a range of categories -- from apparel to technology manufacturers -- cite influencers on quarterly conference calls and credit them for successful marketing campaigns . <p> Just last month , Aritzia 's chief executive Brian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influencers have been an important part of pushing specific products to consumers . A campaign with Kendall Jenner promoting the $250 Super Puff coat stirred an online frenzy , and helped boost sales for Aritzia . <p> " I think being in the fashion business , you have to be looking at influencers , " Hill said . <p> It 's unclear the exact size and scope of the influencer social media marketing industry is in Canada , but a survey by IZEA Canada -- a company that connects marketers with content creators -- found that nearly 20 per cent of companies surveyed have a budget of between $1 million and $2.99 million for these kinds of promotions . In fact , IZEA Canada said 75 per cent of Canadian companies have dedicated budgets for influencer marketing . <p> The Aritzia store where Meghan Markle shopped according to local media is pictured in Toronto , Ontario , Canada , May 11 , 2018 . REUTERS/Carlo Allegri <p> Still , Canadian companies have been slower to turn to influencer-based marketing compared to those in the United States , says Tom Yawney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Influence Agency , a company that connects brands with influencers for campaigns . <p> But he 's seen demand in Canada for the influencer marketing -- as well as for intermediary companies like the Influence Agency -- explode over the last two years . <p> " When we first started out in 2017 , there were a lot of big companies dipping their toes in the water , still unsure if this was something that they wanted to commit to , " Yawney said in an interview . <p> " But what 's happened over the last two years is that our business has blown up ... Canadian companies are jumping in , because working with influencers is providing additional value in a lot of areas . " <h> So how does the influencer world work ? <p> Compensation depends on the brand , the influencer and the scope of the agreement reached between the two . When the influencer has fewer followers , companies will often simply offer a product for free in exchange for promotion .

But a campaign involving someone with around 40,000 followers could begin with a compensation of $500 per post , plus additional fees if the brand can own the content for a longer time or repost it in the future . <p> The fees can be enough for more people like Hwang to dedicate themselves to social media full-time . In some cases , it can be lucrative . ( Gossip magazines wrote that Aritzia paid Jenner $1 million to share the two posts about the Super Puff coat to her 100 million followers , although that figure has not been confirmed by the company . ) <p> Hwang herself has worked with a range of companies , from Nespresso to Hudson 's Bay to Best Buy .

Too many sponsored posts can feel disingenuous and insincere . Overly edited and filtered photos are falling out of fashion . <p> Hwang says she only works with brands and products that she fully endorses and that can relate to her audience , which she frequently refers to as a tight-knit community . <p> " Your audience is key , because if you do n't have your supply , you wo n't have demand , " she said . <p> It 's part of the reason why companies like the Influencer Agency have popped up in recent years , acting as the middle-man between brands searching for social media stars that can spur interest in their products , and the influencers themselves . <p> " That 's why a lot of these programs are really valuable to brands nowadays , " Yawney says . <p> " Historically , you would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then you would need to find a distribution network to share that content . Social media influencers produce the production , they distribute to their communities , and their communities engage with it . " <p> But Yawney warns that not everyone can gain tens of thousands of followers on Instagram and translate that into a full-time job . He says the influencers that are able to succeed are the ones making smart business decisions and treating their account as an individual production company . <p> " They 're not just content creators , but they choose the brands they work with wisely and they do n't oversaturate their feed with anybody that offers them some money , " he says . <p> " They tend to be the more shrewd business people . " <p> When Carly Bright first got her dog Dean four years ago , she was posting so many photos of the basset hound that she decided to create an Instagram account solely dedicated to her new puppy .

More than 40 per cent of the account 's audience is between the ages of 25 and 34 , and more than 75 per cent reside in the United States . <p> As a result , brands have been keen to take advantage of Dean 's popularity . The account has partnered with a range of brands , including Volkwagen , Mercedes , Nordstrom , Best Buy and Dyson . Last month , Dyson paid to have Dean promote the company 's vacuum cleaners and their booth at Toronto 's Woofstock event with several Instagram story posts . <p> " We 're seeing quite a bit of pickup from this , " Dyson 's brand manager Julie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something we know works and it 's great to have the data to accompany that .

Promoter Bob Arum said all but about 700 of the 11,000 or so tickets that were put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as a prominent figure in the fight game in the U.S. <p> Fury is the lineal champion , and a massive 40-1 favorite against Schwarz , an unbeaten 25-year-old with no notable victories who is perhaps best known for winning a wild disqualification victory over Senad Gashi . <p> At 6-foot-6 and 240 pounds , Schwarz looks the part and is n't overmatched against the 6-9 Fury . <p> There are few comparisons between Schwarz and Wilder , other than both have two arms and two legs . Wilder brings an unorthodox attack with fast hands and game-changing power . Schwarz is very traditional and uses the 1-2 to great effect , but he keeps his left hand low and lacks Wilder 's elite hand speed . <p> Tyson Fury and Tom Schwarz are scheduled to fight in a heavyweight bout Saturday in Las Vegas . ( AP Photo/John Locher ) <p> That low left is going to be an issue , because the one thing that Fury is better at than talking is pumping his jab . Fury likes to take the jab up and down and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He does n't look like the most fluid athlete until you see him for a while . He 's got quick feet and the ability to pivot and move his body far better than one might expect . <p> He 's kept many an opponent at bay by keeping them at the end of the jab , where they were well out of their own punching range , and Schwarz has nothing in his game that suggests he 's going to be able to find that middle range that would be the only place he could be effective . <p> Schwarz ca n't afford to smother Fury , because then he 'd take away his own ability to get his punches off . But he has to get past that jab and fight at a distance where he can work and Fury is more limited because his long arms are tied up . <p> Schwarz 's best hope is to mount a body assault on Fury . He has a nice hook to the body that he 'll need to land repeatedly on Fury . If he can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an uppercut and prevent Fury from tying him up . <p> Schwarz should also try to keep a quick pace and make Fury work . It has been unusually hot in Las Vegas and the impact could take its toll on Fury if Schwarz can make him work and slow him down . <p> While it 's not his first fight in the U.S. , it 's his first under the nine-figure contract he signed with Top Rank in Operation Conquer America . His belief is that he 'll make himself much more valuable if he can build a fanbase in the U.S. He 's already a massive star along the lines of ex-champion Anthony Joshua in his native United Kingdom . <p> It 's unlikely Schwarz will catch Fury looking ahead . And given that Schwarz is slow and an inviting target , Fury should be able to pepper him with a jab and slow him considerably after about four or five rounds . <p> In about the fifth , look for Fury to mix in his own right hand and stop Schwarz somewhere around the seventh .

But I was trying to look for a light-hearted way to view what 's happening with the Kabus Padatoon ( Kapa ) -Community Ministry International Inc. and all I could see was potential heartbreak . <p> Last Thursday , some 50,000 members of Kapa gathered in a gym in General Santos to listen to their founder , Pastor Joel Apolinario , who arrived in a maroon helicopter , according to a report by Rappler 's Bobby Lagsa . The same report stated that Kapa asks its members to hand over a minimum " donation or love gift " of P5,000 , for which it promises a return of 30 percent per month . For life . <p> How is Kapa able to afford such returns ? That 's what Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) Chairman Emilio Aquino has challenged Apolinario to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earnings of the top 1,000 corporations in the country , and that not one had managed to make the P108 billion per year that Kapa would need to deliver on its promises . <p> " It 's ridiculous , " the SEC chairman said . The other week , the Court of Appeals froze Kapa Ministry 's bank accounts and assets , as petitioned by the SEC and the Anti-Money Laundering Council . Aquino confirmed he received text messages from those claiming that they had received what Kapa had promised . " But where did you get that money ? That money came from somebody else ! " <p> Unless Kapa explains the activity that has allowed it pay some of its member-donors , one ca n't help but compare it with hundreds of Ponzi schemes that have been documented in the last 30 years . The most high-profile one involved Bernard Madoff , who was arrested nearly 11 years ago for defrauding investors of some $20 billion . <p> By now , the racket sounds familiar : investors are promised extremely generous returns , but only those who invested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ using funds poured in by those who signed up later , drawn by the promise of quick and large returns . Early-stage investors play a critical part , in that they provide the word-of-mouth promotion , if not do the actual recruiting that brings others into the scheme . <p> The scheme is named after Charles Ponzi , who was arrested in 1920 in the United States for mail fraud . At that time , he owed his investors some $7 million . His www.biography.com entry states that he had promised investors as much as 100 percent in 90 days but paid them " using money from other investors , rather than with actual profit , as in the criminal scheme of Bernie Madoff . " <p> What is not known is how many of the early-stage investors bother to find out just how exactly their money has grown so fast . I have heard anecdotes about how some wealthy members of society invest early in schemes like this , but then get out fast because they know that it 's bound to collapse . Why they choose to profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steer clear of them , is a matter for their conscience to grapple with . <p> On average , a Ponzi scheme runs for four years , an Emory University study observed . Most depended on commission-earning recruiters and referral rewards to reel their victims in , like unsuspecting fish . What makes the case of Kapa more painful is that it veils its activities with claims of faith . How can late-stage investors get their funds back once this scheme fails , as it certainly will , when they were clearly told they were giving " donations or love gifts " ? It 's a heartbreaking combination of gullibility and greed . <p> Talk of Kapa 's activities have also circulated in the church where my family belongs , as with most places these days . Last Sunday , our pastor cited a verse from Proverbs 13 as a reminder : " Dishonest money dwindles away , but he who gathers money little by little makes it grow .

Now , JuJu Smith-Schuster and James Conner ( the latter of whom already increased his fantasy value by taking over during Bell 's holdout ) are officially WR1 and RB1 in Pittsburgh , respectively . <p> This has long been a team with valuable fantasy assets , but can the holes left behind by Brown and Bell be filled completely ? <p> Steelers fantasy impact players <h> BOOM or BUST <h> Without Antonio Brown to shield him from double teams , will prolific bicycle rider and social media juggernaut JuJu Smith-Schuster BOOM or BUST at his current 16.4 ADP ( WR6 ) ? <p> Liz : BUST . My PIT #takes are all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subscribe button wherever you listen to audio content for the extended version of this opinion . The short of it is that JuJu will be taking on a whole new role as the Steelers ' No. 1 receiver ... and that 's no small task . <p> In fact , Keenan Allen recently described the leap ( and what it would mean for JuJu ) in an interview on UNDISPUTED . The Chargers WR said he believed that JuJu 's transition was going to be " life changing . " He explained , " It 's gon na be hard to sleep at night trying to find ways to get open . Different routes , different coverages you 've got to look at . Double teams , double pressures , just everything , man . The whole game changes . " <p> The #ReceptionPerception data is clear . Without an obvious outside option in Pittsburgh , JuJu will have to completely retool his game . And even if the Steelers do decide on an X and keep Smith-Schuster in the slot , the talent dip from AB to whoever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily as has in the past . Admittedly , this may all be moot . But I 'd prefer to roll with safer options like Michael Thomas and maybe even Antonio Brown around in the same spot . <p> Brad : BOOM . The narrative that JuJu will suddenly face more stringent coverage and will fail massively as a result is next-level dumb . He 's been in this situation before . Five times to be exact . In those contests , he averaged an elite 21.2 fantasy points per game in PPR formats . His 57 percent success rate led the team a season ago . He also baffled defenses in congested areas , posting the 11th-best contested catch rate of any wideout . Pull head from keister -- JuJu is good , really good . <p> With Brown 's 169 targets up for grabs , every fantasy manager should be asking JuJu to the prom . Yes , the expectation is to spread those looks among various options , but it 's quite conceivable that the slot man could set the targets pace this season . At a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to outpace his former teammate . <h> BUY or SELL <h> In early May , Steelers GM Kevin Colbert openly embraced the idea of his club implementing a committee approach at RB . With that in mind , do you BUY or SELL James Conner ( 13.5 ADP , RB9 ) as a trustworthy RB1 in 12-team .5 PPR formats ? <p> Liz : SELL . You looking for Benny Snell takes ? Then you 've come to the right place ! A determined powerhouse with a compact frame ( 5 ' 10 " and 224 lbs ) Snell has the girth and grit to dominate at the goal line , as evidenced by his 48 scores in just three collegiate campaigns . Also in possession of advanced vision and an abundance of patience , the rookie RB knows how to stick with his blocks . <p> That last bit figures to be particularly handy given Snell 's landing spot . Selected by the Steelers in the fourth round ( No. 122 overall ) of the 2019 NFL Draft , the Ohio native has a skillset that fits well with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line that Football Outsiders ranked among the top-five run-blocking units in power success , Snell 's ability to spot holes in tandem with his restraint should lead to some impressive gains . <p> The question , of course , is how Snell gets on the field with James Conner and Jaylen Samuels ahead of him . The answer may not be pleasant , but it is simple : Conner has to get hurt . While no one is rooting for that outcome , there 's no denying the ferocity of the sport , the volatility of the position , and the durability concerns surrounding the player ( 12 starts in 2018 ) . <p> Even if the haters are right and Snell 's lack of speed keeps him from achieving workhorse status , his short-yardage prowess could eat into Conner 's value just enough to depress the third-year back 's stock . It 's foolhardy to assume the Steelers are going to copy and paste their offense from previous seasons . Give me Nick Chubb instead . <p> Andy : Fully BUY . Simply put , there 's no other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featured potential . Jaylen Samuels had a single good game last season ; Conner had many . That said , I do think it 's entirely possible we 'll see Samuels and Conner on the field at the same time , with Jaylen used as a receiver ( similar to his collegiate usage ) . And maybe we 'll see fourth-rounder Benny Snell used as a rotational player in short-yardage situations . Conner , however , is the guy you want in this backfield . He 's a solid top-15 overall fantasy option . <h> GOOD , BAD , or UGLY <h> Given Pittsburgh 's evolving offensive makeup and his advanced age , will Ben Roethlisberger 's final numbers be GOOD , BAD or UGLY relative to his price point ( 127.1 ADP , QB13 ) ? <p> Andy : I actually think the fantasy community has done a decent job factoring Brown 's departure into Big Ben 's price , so I 'll say GOOD . Brown is simply a huge loss , but let 's recall that Roethlisberger put the ball in the air a ridiculous 675 times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a playable QB1 when healthy on volume alone . Even without AB , he has a few notable weapons at his disposal . No one should be surprised if he delivers 4500 yards and 30-plus touchdown passes . <p> Brad : BAD . By the context of the statement above this is n't a disparaging stance . Not at all . Big Ben should again finish at or near 600 attempts this season . Still , going from Brown to Moncrief or Washington is akin to trading in your luxury import vehicle for a grocery getter . The latter can get you from point A to point B , but sans the flair of the former . Regression seems inevitable , especially for a passer who ranked outside the top-25 in red-zone and deep-ball completion percentages last year . Mark me down for 4300 yards with 27-29 TDs . He 's my QB15 . <h> Best Ball Bargain Bin <p> Liz : DONTE MONCRIEF . The Steelers need a big body who can high-point and work as a legit red zone threat . That is what Moncrief does best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throw away last year in Jacksonville . Throw away his last year with the Colts , but without Andrew Luck . Remember the 7 TD season he had in 2016 when T.Y . Hilton was doing the dirty work in the slot . Earning praise from Big Ben and looking like a " slam-dunk No. 2 receiver " the buzz surrounding Moncrief is already mounting . He 's an exceptional value at his current ADP ( WR63 ) and figures to draw plenty of high-value targets as the season unfolds . <p> Brad : DONTE MONCRIEF . If the well-traveled veteran indeed locks in the No. 2 spot , which he reportedly has a leg up on doing , he 'll turn a considerable profit at his 163.2 ADP ( WR63 ) . Remember , he 's still just 26 and owns all the physical tools needed to succeed . Do n't knock him for his past two uneventful seasons catching passes from Jacoby Brissett and Blake Bortles . Recall in 2016 with Andrew Luck , he tallied WR3 per game production in 12-team leagues over nine contests . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a pass-heavy offense , a WR top-40 finish seems likely . <p> Liz : Without AB it 's hard to imagine this team matching their 2018 record . Even if they do hit a midseason stride , early season kinks will need to be worked out . A push is probable , but in wanting to be definitive , I 'll take the UNDER . <p> Andy : Nine sounds just about right , perhaps because it 's what the team did last season . The ascendance of the Browns is a huge divisional problem for Pittsburgh . Also , this team 's early season road schedule is a minefield ( at NE , at SF , at LAC ) . If I had to bet , I 'd take the UNDER .

@@70894239 <h> NFL draft : How much each team has invested in quarterbacks the past decade <p> Every NFL team has drafted at least one quarterback in the past decade . In fact , every team except for one ( the Atlanta Falcons ) has drafted more than one QB in that span . One team has drafted seven ( ! ) over that time , and no , it 's not the Cleveland Browns . <p> We looked ahead the other day to see which teams might be the early favorites to target quarterbacks in the 2020 NFL draft . But we also wanted to look back and track the investment depth at quarterback of all 32 teams in terms of NFL draft capital to see which ones have put the most resources toward the position -- and also which ones have received the most bang for their buck . <p> Naturally , investments can fail . The Cleveland Browns and New York Jets might have their saviors in Baker Mayfield and Sam Darnold , respectively , but it sure took a long time -- and some brutal seasons -- before they secured them . The Rams are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall picks on a QB , although they might have gotten it right with Jared Goff leading them to the Super Bowl this past season . <p> Teams such as the New Orleans Saints and Los Angeles Chargers ( going back to their San Diego days ) have had the luxury of longtime starters with excellent longevity and reliability to where they have n't had to spend major resources at the position . That has allowed each to build two of the more talented rosters in the entire league . But have they waited too long to find potential successors to Drew Brees and Philip Rivers ? We might not know for a few years . <p> And teams such as the New England Patriots and New York Giants have not taken the position for granted in the draft despite having Tom Brady and Eli Manning , respectively , starting for many years . The difference , of course , is that Brady is coming off a Super Bowl title and has n't seen his game fall off dramatically . Manning has regressed , despite what GM Dave Gettleman has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones gives us plenty of reason to roll our eyes a bit at Gettleman . <p> How NFL teams build through the draft is a fascinating process , and the varying levels of QB investment can speak volumes about how it needs to be prioritized . So we decided to tally up all the quarterback draft picks each team has made -- in a lot of cases with multiple GMs making the picks -- since the 2010 NFL draft to see which ones have sunk in the most draft cost at the position ... and which have gotten the most back from it . <p> One way of measuring it is through a weighted draft-pick formula , and we 've eschewed the long-popular Jimmy Johnson trade-value chart for one we 've actually favored for years . Chase Stuart has developed a more equitable pick-value system , we believe , that more accurately reflects what each draft pick is worth . His system only counts the first 224 picks , whereas most drafts last into the 250s . ( We assigned a value of 0.1 points for every QB draft pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highest collective draft-pick value to the lowest , of how all 32 teams stack up : <p> Skinny : It 's a story you know all too well . The Browns , despite drafting five QBs in their first 11 years after returning to Cleveland , were forced to keep investing relatively high picks in passers , hoping to find The One . There have been 61 first-round QBs since 1999 , and five were from the Browns ; the Redskins ( four ) are the only other NFL franchise to draft more than three first-round QBs in that span . <p> But now they might have found that special player in Mayfield . Was it all worth it ? We shall see . Still , as you work your way down this list , it 's hard not to look at just how much draft capital they 've sunk into empty investments along the way . <p> The 2.0 Browns have only used two Day 3 picks on QBs : Luke McCown in 2004 and Spergon Wynn in 2000 . McCown ended up being a serviceable backup for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down as the QB taken over Tom Brady . Wynn lasted two years , started three games and had a career 1-7 TD-Int ratio . <h> 2 .

Did you know Bradford was the NFL 's first $50 million man before he ever played a snap in the league ? In all , they paid him more than $65 million over five uninspiring seasons where he played 49 of a possible 80 regular-season games and never led his team to the playoffs . <p> Goff already has done that twice in his two full years of starting , helping the Rams reach the Super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized his potential under head coach Sean McVay . Although the Goff investment was made prior to McVay 's arrival , the coach has helped make it look like a smart one for now . <p> What 's not factored in is the trade cost the Rams incurred in moving up to No. 1 to get Goff . They traded four picks in 2016 ( one first , two seconds and a third ) as well as their 2017 first-rounder ( which turned out to be No. 5 overall ) and 2017 third-rounder ( No. 100 ) to the Tennessee Titans for Goff , plus 2016 fourth- and sixth-round picks . <p> If you throw in the fact that the Rams did n't get much return on the Mannion or Gilbert picks , they 've been incredibly spendthrift . It 's a bit like scoring a really solid Acura but paying sticker price in Beverly Hills versus talking it down a bit in Reseda . <p> Skinny : The Cardinals made strange history when they became the first team to select back-to-back high first-round quarterbacks since the 1982-1983 Baltimore Colts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elway that second year after taking him , which is basically the inverse of what Arizona did with Rosen and Murray . It just goes to show how a coach -- or an owner -- can influence a high draft pick , especially when quarterbacks are involved . <p> Prior to trading up ( sending third- and fifth-rounders to Oakland ) to take Rosen , the Cardinals had put themselves in a hole with some bad Day 3 picks who could n't help bridge the gap from Kurt Warner to Carson Palmer or provide a reasonable Palmer replacement . Thomas is now a tight end with the Lions , and Lindley and Skelton never panned out despite starting games . <p> So in dealing Rosen to the Miami Dolphins for dimes on the dollar and handing the keys to Murray , it puts even more pressure and more sunken cost on the head of the rookie . No pressure . <p> No team has spent more draft assets on quarterbacks lately than the Arizona Cardinals , taking quarterback Kyler Murray first overall this year .

Mariota has been consistently underwhelming to date , despite injuries affecting his performance and despite him leading the team to a road playoff upset two seasons ago . <p> Locker was retired by age 27 , and the three Day 3 picks amounted to little . Mettenberger stuck around for a bit and started 10 games , but the Titans lost every single one of them . This is a team that could be jumping into the Round 1 QB derby in 2020 or 2021 . <p> Skinny : After years of milling around in the middle rounds with provisional QB picks -- after failing to make Mark Sanchez work -- the Jets finally stepped up their draft investment a bit . Of course , we know how Smith and Hackenberg worked out . At least Smith proved to be low-end starter quality for a few years ... Hack could n't even get on the field ! <p> Neither of those picks were good , but we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Titans on this list if we included the trade-up cost : their first-round pick and two second-rounders in 2018 , along with a 2019 second-rounder . As if playing in New York was n't hard enough , Darnold also must break the trend of failed Jets QB picks and do so as an above-market cost player . <h> 6 . Washington Redskins <p> QBs drafted since 2010 : 4 <p> Day 1 picks : Robert Griffin ( 2nd , 2012 ) ; Dwayne Haskins ( 15th , 2019 ) <p> Day 2 : None <p> Day 3 : Kirk Cousins ( 102nd , 2012 ) ; Nate Sudfeld ( 187th , 2016 ) <p> Chase Stuart draft capital invested : 54.0 <p> Skinny : The Redskins did a wild thing in making a huge investment to land Griffin and then take Cousins 100 picks later in the same draft . It turned out to be a pretty shrewd move , but kicking the can on Cousins ' contract for years cost them in the end . Both are now gone , and the Redskins started a new generation by taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the team 's scouts over that span : All four picks remain in the league and in important spots , too , with Griffin backing up Lamar Jackson in Baltimore and Sudfeld backing up Carson Wentz in Philly . If the Haskins pick pans out , we 'll have to give Bruce Allen additional credit for not having to trade up to land the QB . <p> But overall , they 've paid a premium on QBs and received insufficient return on investment to date : two playoff appearances and two losses in this span . <p> Skinny : The level of investment feels higher , but perhaps that 's because neither Gabbert nor Bortles really worked out . The first- and second-round picks to move up for Gabbert , and taking Bortles at three was a shocker then -- just as it is now . You can understand why the team felt the need to dish out big money ( and perhaps bid against themselves ) in signing Nick Foles to solidify a trouble spot for the past several years . Dipping their toes in the Round 6 waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit yet , although Lee and Minshew ( and 2018 Seahawks seventh-rounder Alex McGough ) are dueling to be Foles ' backup . <p> The last time the Jaguars drafted a QB in Rounds 2 through 5 was back in 2002 .

Carolina Panthers <p> QBs drafted since 2010 : 3 <p> Day 1 picks : Cam Newton ( 1st pick , 2011 ) <p> Day 2 : Jimmy Clausen ( 48th , 2010 ) ; Will Grier ( 100th , 2019 ) <p> Day 3 : Tony Pike ( 204th , 2010 ) <p> Chase Stuart draft capital invested : 50.5 <p> Skinny : The Panthers drafted Clausen and Pike in 2010 , but it did n't stop them from taking Newton first the next year . And eight years passed from the Newton pick to taking Grier at the end of Round 3 this spring . Perhaps Newton 's balky shoulder prompted that move to a degree . <p> Newton 's good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much to play through . But for years , the Panthers did n't really have to worry about developing a young passer behind Newton as he missed only three games in his first seven seasons . <p> Skinny : The seven QBs drafted since 2010 are the most in the league , and six of those picks were made under John Elway 's watch over the past eight drafts . He 's gone in deep ( trading up for Lynch in Round 1 ) and scratched off a few cheap lottery tickets ( Dysert , Siemian and Kelly ) . And let 's be honest : Neither strategy has been that good . <p> But Elway 's best investments might have been on Day 2 . Say what you will about Osweiler , but he started seven games -- winning five -- during a Super Bowl-winning season and earned them a third-round compensatory pick in 2017 after signing with Houston . And the hope is that Drew Lock can sit for some length of time behind Joe Flacco ( and learn what not to do ? ) before taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elway 's rough record with QB evaluation can earn a silver lining to it . <p> Skinny : They 'd probably jump up a few spots on this list given what it cost to get Wentz . In essence , they traded Byron Maxwell , Kiko Alonso , their original 2016 first-round pick ( No. 13 ) , plus third- and fourth-rounders that year and a future first ( 2017 ) and second ( 2018 ) for Wentz and a 2017 fourth-rounder . He has 70 TD passes in 40 NFL starts and was the presumptive MVP before suffering a season-ending ACL injury in 2017 and watching Nick Foles go win it all with his team . <p> But even with Foles gone , there 's big pressure on Wentz to perform , especially following his lucrative recent extension . The Eagles for decades have placed a high premium on stocking the QB position , back to Andy Reid 's first year . But now that they 've paid Wentz , it is the most they 've ever invested -- money plus draft capital -- in a QB in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being the only NFL team since the 1970 merger to draft two Northwestern quarterbacks in any round , Kafka and Thorson .

They sent two second-rounders to the Buccaneers to get him , so the team 's QB investment has pretty high . Especially when you consider they only took Manuel -- who retired this offseason right after his 29th birthday -- only six years ago . <p> The Bills have a lot invested in QB Josh Allen ( Getty Images ) . <p> There 's pressure on every first-round QB to perform . But in this era of major trade-ups to land these prospects more often than not , players such as Allen face even steeper expectations . Or they should , anyway . <h> 12 .

But it still shows how vital nailing the first overall selection is in light of the fact that the Bucs have our 12th-heaviest investment at QB despite only selecting two over the past decade . <p> Winston , like Marcus Mariota in Tennessee , faces a flashpoint season for his future in Tampa . If he thrives under Bruce Arians -- and just as importantly stays out of trouble -- the pick will start to yield more return . So far , it has been a disappointment . Glennon actually outplayed his draft position as a rookie before fading ; he 's on his third team in as many years and his days of starting could be over , barring something unforeseen. <h> 13 .

The Giants have drafted quarterbacks each of the past three years , all of them in Days 1 and 2 , and Jones was a stunner at No. 6 this spring . Considering that Webb is gone and Lauletta might soon follow him , the need for Jones to develop into something is pretty darned high . <p> Eli Manning did n't miss a start for a stretch that spanned parts of 14 seasons , and he led the team to two Super Bowl victories , so you can understand why they invested so sparsely for years at the position . But even with the recent rash of QB selections , there is no guarantee that the Giants will enjoy a seamless transition from Manning to the next generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the trade for Jay Cutler , the Bears switched gears dramatically . For the first time in their history they traded up for a quarterback in the first round and took Trubisky second overall , the highest they had picked any player since 1951 . The comparisons of Trubisky to Patrick Mahomes and Deshaun Watson , we suspect , will always be there until the Bears win a Super Bowl . <h> 15 . Indianapolis Colts <p> QBs drafted since 2010 : 2 <p> Day 1 picks : Andrew Luck ( 1st , 2012 ) <p> Day 2 : None <p> Day 3 : Chandler Harnish ( 253rd , 2012 ) <p> Chase Stuart draft capital invested : 34.7 <p> Skinny : It 's a bit funny to think that both of the Colts ' drafted QBs came from the same draft , but the laughs end for Colts fans when they were saddled with games started by the likes of Josh Freeman , Scott Tolzien , a 40-year-old Matt Hasselbeck ( who actually won five of seven starts ) and Jacoby Brissett when Luck was injured . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be hoped in 2017 , but it was striking that the team did n't better protect its best asset . <p> Luck appears healthy now , and he 's still very much in his prime at 29 . The Colts have had a luxury few teams can relate to over the past few decades , with Manning followed by Luck . Even with each of them missing a full season to injury , that 's incredible QB fortune . The Colts theoretically could move on from Luck in the next few years , but that wo n't happen if he proves he can stay healthy . That might mean this franchise wo n't be drafting too many other quarterbacks -- at least not up high -- for years to come . <h> 16 . Minnesota Vikings <p> Skinny : The Vikings rate as close to the mean ( which is 32.2 ) for any team on our draft-value list , and that 's pretty interesting . That means , in essence , that spending one relatively early first-rounder and then the final pick of the first round is about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 10-year period . <p> We 're not exactly sure what that means beyond the idea of a team trading multiple first-rounders to draft one QB comes with some real risk . Or , if you take one with the first or second overall pick ( without trading up ) -- the 31.3 Stuart value comes in just between Nos. 1 and 2 overall . You 're essentially sinking 10 years ' worth of assets for the position into one pick . But then again , we know what happens when you do n't have a QB ... <p> The Ponder pick really did n't work out , and we 'll never know what might have been with Bridgewater . We suspect he always would have been just shy of being that untouchable-level quarterback who was n't vastly above replacement . And now the Vikings also have another big QB investment in Kirk Cousins that was strictly monetary but massive nonetheless . <p> Skinny : When the Chiefs traded up 17 spots to draft Mahomes two years ago , it was the team 's first first-round QB selection since Todd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yikes ) . The Chiefs ' recent **31;971;TOOLONG approach simply was n't working out , so Andy Reid and then GM John Dorsey took the aggressive approach . It appears to have paid off pretty well . <p> And it might have kick-started a mini-trend around the league . Deshaun Watson went two picks after Mahomes to the Houston Texans , and there were five first-round quarterbacks the following year in 2018 . All six of those QB selections went to teams that traded up into that spot . That trend did n't hold as much in 2019 , with two of the three first-round QBs going to teams originally holding that pick , but it also was viewed as something of a down year at the position this spring . <p> By the way , for you trivia buffs out there : The longest current first-round QB drought for a team is the New Orleans Saints at 48 years ! Yep , it was Archie Manning in 1971 . <p> Skinny : Only the Broncos have drafted more quarterbacks over the past 10 years , as the Patriots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Super Bowl twilight . The difference is that the Patriots have n't used high picks at the position ; taking Garoppolo at the end of Round 2 was a surprise at the time and actually fueled talk about the Brady succession plan before he went on to lead the team to three more titles . <p> Here 's a wild stat : Of the 674 Day 2 draft picks across the NFL since 2010 , only 23 of them were quarterbacks . But the Patriots have drafted three of them , and they 're one of six franchises combined that account for 14 of those 23 QB picks in that range . Quarterbacks are just far more likely to go early ( 10.7 percent of all of the first-rounders since 2010 ) or late , recent history shows us , than in Rounds 2 or 3 . <p> The Patriots have drafted 10 quarterbacks since Brady joined the team . Etling and Stidham are on the roster now . Matt Cassel might try play a 15th season somewhere but is currently unsigned . Brissett and Garoppolo are on other teams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the league . But three other QBs New England drafted are still in the NFL as coaches -- Kliff Kingsbury ( sixth round , 201st ) is head coach of the Cardinals ; Kevin O'Connell ( 94th , 2008 ) is the Redskins ' offensive coordinator ; and Robinson ( 250th , 2010 ) is the Rams ' new QB coach . <p> New England has made mostly smart investments with its QB picks , viewing them as assets and insurance for Brady , even if the team has n't been able to maximize those players ' trade values . They got a seventh back for Mallett , a second for Garoppolo and WR Phillip Dorsett for Brissett. <h> 19 . Houston Texans <p> QBs drafted since 2010 : 3 <p> Day 1 picks : Deshaun Watson ( 12th , 2017 ) <p> Day 2 : None <p> Day 3 : T.J. Yates ( 152nd , 2011 ) ; Tom Savage ( 135th , 2014 ) <p> Chase Stuart draft capital invested : 24.8 <p> Skinny : Similar to Kansas City , the Texans had tried the middle-round lottery approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 2002 , and that strategy just was n't paying off . Neither Yates ( who won a playoff game ) nor Savage were terrible , but they just were n't starter-grade . So the trade up two years ago for Watson was a departure from their previous approach , and like the Chiefs ' move for Mahomes , the Texans ' gamble has paid off thus far . <p> Are the Texans playing with fire with Watson the way the Colts did with Luck , not properly investing in their offensive line and allowing their prized QB take too many hits ? We 'll have to wait to see how their first- and second-round investments in linemen this year pay off , but it 's a question worth posing . And it almost makes you wonder if the Texans might not dip back into the QB pool next year to add a different layer of insurance . <h> 20 . Oakland Raiders <p> QBs drafted since 2010 : 3 <p> Day 1 picks : None <p> Day 2 : Derek Carr ( 36th , 2014 ) <p> Day 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cook ( 100th , 2016 ) <p> Chase Stuart draft capital invested : 21.7 <p> Skinny : The Raiders have had such a poor drafting history at quarterback that goes back generations , to the point where maybe Carr is a bit underappreciated at this point . He was a super value early in the second round , and you could make the argument that he 's the best QB pick they 've made since before the NFL merger . Who else you got ... Steve Beuerlein ? Marc Wilson ? Yeah , it definitely was n't JaMarcus Russell . <p> Carr was sandwiched around two fourth-round picks that were busts , so the Raiders have had to mine other teams ' flotsam and jetsam to find quality backups behind him . When we wrote our piece about the teams most likely to draft a QB in 2020 the way things stand now , we had the Raiders just outside the top 10 . But since writing that , we 've reconsidered a bit . It would n't shock us in the least to see Jon Gruden put some pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on how this season goes . <p> Can Derek Carr play well enough this season where the Oakland Raiders wo n't draft a QB in 2020 ? ( Getty Images ) <p> Carr 's contract allows them to break free if they want . Jon Gruden has been hunting that elusive star QB for years now . The Raiders have made huge investments in their offensive skill players , dealing Carr a better hand but also issuing some pressure along with it . With the team moving to Vegas , it would be a very Raiders-esque move to use one of their two first-rounders in 2020 to handpick the next QB . <h> 21 . Miami Dolphins <p> QBs drafted since 2010 : 2 <p> Day 1 picks : Ryan Tannehill ( 8th , 2012 ) <p> Day 2 : None <p> Day 3 : Brandon Doughty ( 223rd , 2016 ) <p> Chase Stuart draft capital invested : 21.6 <p> Skinny : Tannehill and Dan Marino are the franchise 's only two first-round QBs since the merger , but nearly everyone believes that could change next spring . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signing Ryan Fitzpatrick and trading two draft picks for Josh Rosen . We frankly should consider that in our equation , which might have bumped them up a spot or two . <p> If Rosen pans out this season , perhaps the Dolphins wo n't feel the urge to draft a quarterback high next spring . But by no means are they out of the mix for one , we suspect . If the Dolphins finish the season with a top-10 draft pick , they also will have two second-rounders and additional ammo ( compensatory picks are likely ) to move up for the right one . <p> This is going to be a fascinating season for the Dolphins under new head coach Brian Flores , even if the team is n't that great right now . We ca n't wait to see how they rebuild this thing . <p> Skinny : From 1992 to 2003 , the Bengals drafted three quarterbacks in the first round . They 've done so zero times since . Is 2020 the year we see that come to an end ? Dalton has outplayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if he 's perennially on the replaceable quarterback lists . <p> We wrote in our 2020 QB draft story that the Bengals might be one of the more likely teams to be in the mix for a first-round quarterback , depending on how things play out . Four of the past five and five of the past seven Bengals first-rounders have been offensive players , and the defense looks like it needs big reinforcements , but new head coach Zac Taylor is likely going to have a sizable say in who his next QB is after Dalton , we 'd assume . <p> 23 . San Francisco 49ers <p> QBs drafted since 2010 : 4 <p> Day 1 picks : None <p> Day 2 : Colin Kaepernick ( 36th , 2011 ) ; C.J. Beathard ( 104th , 2017 ) <p> Day 3 : B.J. Daniels ( 237th , 2013 ) ; Jeff Driskell ( 207th , 2016 ) <p> Chase Stuart draft capital invested : 17.5 <p> Skinny : Ever since the team parted ways with Kaepernick , its best QB acquisitions have come from outside of draft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed undrafted Nick Mullens , who might have the edge on Beathard in the battle for QB2 this coming season . Beathard felt like a reach at the time , just as it does now , and the Daniels and Driskel picks did n't work out ( even though Driskel was n't brutal with the Bengals last season ) . <p> Although the shine is off Garoppolo a bit , he still could prove to be a very good quarterback and perhaps worth the massive contract they signed him to . There 's a chance the 49ers do n't draft a QB high for a few years as they try to make him work with Kyle Shanahan , although all bets would be off if he gets put on the hot seat or Garoppolo ca n't stay healthy . <p> Skinny : The Ravens have actually had some Round 6 QB success , even if they did n't fully take advantage of it . They got Derek Anderson there in 2005 and Taylor in 2011 , although neither started a game for Baltimore . Instead , the team went with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed by Jackson , who is the new face of the franchise . They traded up into the 32nd pick to land him and now have built around him . <p> We wo n't know if that will prove to be the right move for the long term , but for right now it appears that the price was pretty smart . And they even have immediate plans for McSorley , who is working as a punt returner and could be on the field with Jackson in some two-QB formations ( which we hope will work better than the Flacco-Jackson failed experiments early last season ) . <p> Overall , the Ravens have received a pretty decent ROI on their QB draft investments over the past 15 years or so -- basically everything since the Kyle Boller disaster . Even if you 're not a Flacco fan , you 've got to admit that . <h> 25 . Pittsburgh Steelers <p> QBs drafted since 2010 : 3 <p> Day 1 picks : None <p> Day 2 : Mason Rudolph ( 76th , 2018 ) <p> Day 3 : Landry Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 2018 ) <p> Chase Stuart draft capital invested : 14.8 <p> Skinny : After taking Big Ben with the 11th pick in 2004 , the team 's pattern was to use a Day 3 pick on a QB with varying degrees of success -- Omar Jacobs , Dennis Dixon , Jones and Dobbs . Then they bumped it up a bit on Rudolph , perhaps a bit surprised he was still on the board at that point in 2018 . Of course , Roethlisberger was confused by the Rudolph pick at the time , saying that the Steelers could have helped their defense with that selection and that he had no intention of mentoring the rookie QB . <p> We 'll see if Rudolph can be Ben 's successor . The Steelers seem to like him . ( And looking at the defenders the Steelers passed on , maybe Da'Shawn Hand , Ronnie Harrison or Maurice Hurst could have helped in a more immediate way ) . But with Rudolph signed through 2021 , plus Dobbs still on the roster , the Steelers might not be QB draft buyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> QBs drafted since 2010 : 2 <p> Day 1 picks : None <p> Day 2 : Russell Wilson ( 75th , 2012 ) <p> Day 3 : Alex McGough ( 220th , 2018 ) <p> Chase Stuart draft capital invested : 7.4 <p> Skinny : Check out the Stuart draft-value dropoff here -- the Seahawks are exactly half the value of the Steelers , the next-highest team on the list . That 's pretty incredible , frankly , and underscores just how huge it is for them to have hit on Wilson where they did . If you want to argue that Seattle winning only one Super Bowl is disappointing , have at it . But the fact is that the Wilson pick was one of the best in all of football at any position over the past 15 or more years . <p> The Seahawks have played a little fast and loose with Wilson 's backups , finding undrafted free agents , late picks ( such as McGough , who is now with the Jaguars ) , waiver-wire claims or reclamation projects ( it 's Paxton Lynch vs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with as their main insurance policies . Maybe that changes at some point , but the likelihood of the Seahawks going high for a QB in the draft in the coming few years feels pretty low with Wilson just into a banner contract . <h> 27 . New Orleans Saints <p> QBs drafted since 2010 : 2 <p> Day 1 picks : None <p> Day 2 : Garrett Grayson ( 75th , 2015 ) <p> Day 3 : Sean Canfield ( 239th , 2010 ) <p> Chase Stuart draft capital invested : 7.2 <p> Skinny : If you missed our incredible trivia question up above , it 's worth repeating here : The Saints ' last first-round QB was ... Archie Manning ! He just turned 70 the other day . That 's an incredible streak -- the longest active Round 1 QB drought -- and we wonder when it might end . There were rumors the Saints were prepared to take Patrick Mahomes ( could you imagine ? ) two years ago before the Chiefs swooped in a pick ahead of New Orleans to do so . <p> Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Round 1 the next few years ? Will Sean Payton still be around to coach the next QB ? How many more years does Drew Brees have left ? All fascinating questions as we ponder the immediate and long-term futures of the franchise . <p> The Saints ' past two draft picks at the position did not pan out ; neither of them to date even attempted one NFL regular-season pass . And here 's one more fun Saints QB trivia : Canfield is the last lefty QB to be drafted by any NFL team . At least until Tua comes out ... <h> 28 . Dallas Cowboys <p> QBs drafted since 2010 : 3 <p> Day 1 picks : None <p> Day 2 : None <p> Day 3 : Dak Prescott ( 135th , 2016 ) ; Mike White ( 171st , 2018 ) <p> Chase Stuart draft capital invested : 5.3 <p> Skinny : Two picks , both in the mid-100s . Prescott is on the verge of a monster contract extension . White has yet to take an NFL snap but could be the backup ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agent . Without knowing how White or Rush would handle themselves , it 's safe to say that the Cowboys have gotten away with not going high on a QB in tremendous fashion . <p> Lucky ? Sure . Jerry Jones missed out on a big trade up for Paxton Lynch , and we all watched as Jones clutched a draft card with the name " Johnny Manziel " on it in the first round before the owner was chloroformed talked out of it . But credit where it 's due . They 've been able to play some high-level football without the need to use high draft picks at the position . It 's wild to think that Troy Aikman was their last first-round QB . <p> Skinny : They 've spent thriftily and received about as much as you might expect in return . None of the past four QBs the Chargers have drafted -- those three above , plus Charlie Whitehurst -- never attempted a regular-season pass for the franchise . That 's thanks to Philip Rivers ' incredible iron-man streak , which is 209 consecutive starts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and counting . <p> Actually , this draft nugget is just too good not to share : <p> Here 's a BONKERS piece of trivia : <p> The Chargers have drafted EIGHT quarterbacks the past 21 years , and only one -- Drew Brees -- has thrown a regular-season pass for the franchise <p> granted , it requires an * as they drafted Eli and swapped him for Rivers after the fact . BUT STILL ! <p> The Chargers have done their homework on draft QBs in recent years , and they took Stick in April . It appears they might try to employ his slot-receiver-type athleticism in other ways while he develops and Rivers remains in his prime years . But they certainly could jump back into the QB draft derby in higher rounds in the next few years . <p> It 's a catch-22 deal . They have a loaded roster and could be Super Bowl contenders , so they want as much immediate help as possible . But on the other hand , they ca n't afford to botch the transition whenever Rivers , who turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Green Bay Packers <p> QBs drafted since 2010 : 2 <p> Day 1 picks : None <p> Day 2 : None <p> Day 3 : B.J. Coleman ( 243rd , 2012 ) ; Brett Hundley ( 147th , 2015 ) <p> Chase Stuart draft capital invested : 2.9 <p> Skinny : Ron Wolf was the Packers ' general manager from 1991 to 2000 . In that decade , Wolf traded a first-round pick for Brett Favre after his disastrous rookie season in Atlanta . In addition , Wolf drafted in that span seven quarterbacks : Aaron Brooks , Matt Hasselbeck , Ronnie McAda , Kyle Wachholtz , Jay Barker , Mark Brunell and Ty Detmer . Brooks , Hasselbeck , Brunell and Detmer went on to start 426 NFL games , all for other teams . <p> Wolf turned those QB picks into bonus assets . Brooks and Lamont Hall were traded for a third-rounder . Hasselbeck was shipped to Seattle , allowing the Packers to move from the 17th pick overall up to No. 10 , and they also got a third-rounder in the deal . Brunell was sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who keep score -- for third- and fifth-round picks ( Nos. 66 and 170 overall ) . Wolf consistently churned out good QB prospects behind Favre and flipped them like fixer-upper houses . It was a beautiful model and one that few franchises have been able to mimic since . <p> Wolf 's replacement , Ted Thompson , largely chose to ignore the position after famously taking Aaron Rodgers in Round 1 two-plus years before he could get on the field as the starter . On the one hand , it 's somewhat understandable in that the Packers were building a Super Bowl-caliber team and needed the help elsewhere . But on the other , Rodgers ' backup spot became a sore one when he suffered some injuries and his replacements never could come close to replicating QB1 's success . <p> The Packers moved on from Coleman and Hundley relatively fast ; neither lasted more than two years with the franchise . DeShone Kizer was acquired for safety Damarious Randall , and it feels like the Packers lost that deal . Green Bay did have some interest in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him twice before watching him go off the board two selections before the Packers ' third pick in 2019 . <p> It will be interesting to see if the Packers are back in the QB draft market next spring , even with the strong possibility that Rodgers regains his all-world form this season with a change of coaching scenery and a new playbook and offensive approach . <h> 31 . Detroit Lions <p> QBs drafted since 2010 : 2 <p> Day 1 picks : None <p> Day 2 : None <p> Day 3 : Jake Rudock ( 191st , 2016 ) ; Brad Kaaya ( 215th , 2017 ) <p> Chase Stuart draft capital invested : 1.9 <p> Skinny : The Lions took Stafford first overall in 2009 and basically have let it ride since then . After a few major injuries his first two seasons , Stafford has started all 16 games for eight straight seasons -- a wild run of durability , especially when you hear about his reported broken back last season . <p> As we wrote the other day , we wonder how his tenure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or very solid at the very least . But with Matt Patricia in charge now -- and perhaps feeling some heat in Year 2 -- there 's no guarantee that Stafford will be a Lion for life . The team did some hard work on quarterbacks in this past draft cycle but ultimately passed on taking one or bringing in an undrafted free agent . To back up Stafford this year , they signed vets Tom Savage and David Fales , two former Day 3 picks of yore . Both Rudock and Kaaya are gone already . <p> So it would not at all be surprising to see Detroit reenter the QB draft mix in 2020 , as Stafford 's dead money drops from $26 million during the 2020 season to $10 million in 2021 . That might allow the team a more natural progression and not rush a rookie into the lineup down the road . <h> 32 . Atlanta Falcons <p> QBs drafted since 2010 : 1 <p> Day 1 picks : None <p> Day 2 : None <p> Day 3 : Sean Renfree ( 249th , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Skinny : You might be able to win some bar bets with this one : Who was the last QB the Falcons drafted ? Renfree was on the roster a few years , got into two games in mop-up time and was cut in 2016 . The Falcons currently have soon-to-be 39-year-old Matt Schaub and 2018 undrafted free agent Kurt Benkert behind starter Matt Ryan . <p> The beauty for the Falcons is that they have not had to cultivate and groom a young quarterback with Ryan being so durable ( his only time missing action in the NFL was a two-game stretch in December 2009 ) . But it 's almost shocking they have not taken more than one QB in the past 11 drafts . In fact , we had to round the Stuart value up ; his pick-value system only goes up to the 224th selection , so we just made it that same 0.1 number . <p> Ryan likely is n't going anywhere anytime soon . He 's still relatively young ( 34 this season ) , has major dead money left on his deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent completions , a 35-7 TD-INT ratio and 4,924 passing yards -- despite some OL issues and injuries all over the place .

Two of the messages attacked other Democrats and four were focused on Biden . <p> The missives from the Trump campaign highlighted Biden 's reliance on wealthy donors , how immigrants were treated at the border during the " Obama-Biden " administration , and comments Biden made indicating China was n't major competition for the U.S. , and accused him of repeatedly being wrong on national security issues . <p> The Biden campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story . <p> Biden is currently leading the crowded field of Democratic presidential candidates , so he makes a natural target for the Trump campaign . However , just last month , top members of Trump 's campaign team insisted they would n't be focusing on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homogenous group " to best capitalize on potential infighting during the primary . <p> Tim Murtaugh , the Trump campaign communications director , pushed back on the idea they were focused on Biden , pointing to the rapid response emails the campaign sent out during the Wednesday debate that did not feature Biden . Overall , Murtaugh predicted the debates would benefit Trump because they showcased the Democrats ' " crazy policy proposals . " <p> " At this moment there 's no way to know who President Trump 's opponent will be . Our mission for the Democrat debates was to promote and defend the president 's record , fact check the candidates in real time , and expose the truth about the candidates ' own records , " Murtaugh said . " Over the two days , we feel like we spread the love around pretty well . " <p> The Trump campaign sent out less than half as many rapid response emails during the debate that did not include Biden . <p> Trump was in Japan on Thursday for the annual G-20 summit and had meetings with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He still managed to fire off one tweet critiquing the Democratic field for supporting health care programs for undocumented immigrants . <p> The president 's son Donald Trump Jr . was far more active on Twitter as the debate unfolded -- and he clearly had his eye on Biden . Don Jr . tweeted and retweeted 29 times during the debate , and 16 of those posts were solely about Biden . <p> As the debate drew to a close , Trump 's allies seized on the idea that Biden had performed badly , particularly during a fiery exchange where Sen. Kamala Harris questioned his record on race . <p> Donald Trump Jr . shared footage of the Hindenburg blimp going down in flames .

@@71055231 <p> EL SEGUNDO , Calif. -- After Los Angeles Lakers general manager Rob Pelinka called Anthony Davis " the most dominant young basketball player in the world " at the forward/center 's introductory news conference Saturday , Davis made a declaration echoing the same confidence in his new team . <p> " I would put our roster up against anybody , " Davis said . " I feel like that in a seven-game series that we would come out victorious . " <p> With banners hanging above him commemorating all the NBA Finals series the franchise has won before -- 16 to be precise -- the addition of the former No. 1 pick and six-time All-Star in Davis , acquired in a trade with the New Orleans Pelicans , could be a major move back to prominence . <h> Editor 's Picks <p> " What we think about Anthony Davis is this : There 's no more complete basketball player in the game , " Pelinka said . " There is nothing he ca n't do . He can shoot . He can make plays . He can defend 1 through 5 . He can protect the rim . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craft is unparalleled . To sit here next to him and think he 's going to be on our team and that he 's going to be a pillar of this franchise for many years is just something we 're incredibly proud of . " <p> As Davis , Pelinka and Lakers coach Frank Vogel addressed reporters , another Lakers player 's presence was felt just as much : LeBron James . The four-time MVP stood in the back of the gym with a yellow sweatshirt on and black baseball cap pulled down snug on his head as he observed the momentous day for the team play out . <p> Davis said the chance to play with James -- whom he considers a friend , has been a teammate of in All-Star Games and an Olympics , and with whom he shares an agent , Rich Paul of Klutch Sports -- made the prospect of leaving the only NBA team he ever has played for easier to process . <p> " Obviously , it was tough for me to leave a city that I 've been playing for for seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was my time , " Davis said . " But when I found out I was getting traded to the Lakers , I realized it was an unbelievable opportunity for me to be here with a wonderful organization , and then to play alongside LeBron and obviously now the players that we have now ... to get the opportunity to do that and come here and play for an organization that 's all about winning -- forget winning , winning championships , and that 's the only goal -- I think that was the biggest thing for me . Just the relief there , of not knowing the unknown anymore and knowing where I was going to be next season . " <p> When the Lakers agreed to trade Lonzo Ball , Brandon Ingram , Josh Hart and a bevy of draft picks and pick-swap considerations to New Orleans for Davis in June , next season looked mighty promising with the trio of James , Davis and Kyle Kuzma on the books . <p> " Obviously , anytime you 're able to acquire a player like Kawhi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that , " Davis said . " Obviously , it did n't work out for him , but I still wanted to do whatever to help the team . That 4 million was to add more money to a player 's contract that they wanted or get another guy , then by all means , I was willing to do that . And I think we did a great job of using that throughout the entire team . " <p> Pelinka said he had countless phone calls with James and Davis to determine how to best split up the available cap space after Leonard chose the Clippers . <p> " It was like every day , " Davis detailed . " On the hour . " <p> That included accounting for the personal request from Davis to add capable centers so he would n't have to man that position as much . <p> " We want a decade of dominance out of him here , right ? So we got to do what 's best for his body , and having him bang against the biggest centers in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , " Pelinka said . <p> Other than Cousins , the Lakers brought JaVale McGee back on a one-year deal . <p> " I like playing the 4 , " Davis said . " I 'm not even going to sugarcoat it . I like playing the 4 . I do n't really like playing the 5 . If it comes down to it , Coach , and you need me to play the 5 , then I 'll play the 5 . But the game has become so positionless that you can put five guys on the floor and they just play . " <p> He also likes wearing No. 23 -- the digits on his uniform for the Pelicans and at Kentucky -- and it was given to him by James to wear next season until the number change proved too pricey for Nike , the league 's official outfitter , to pull off this late in the game without taking a financial hit because of unsold inventory featuring James in a No. 23 Lakers uniform , a source told ESPN . <p> " That was pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> He settled on No. 3 after seeing how the different uniform numbers available to him looked on his avatar in the video game NBA 2K . <p> " The first number that I ever wore was No. 3 , " he said . " When I saw that number was available , I wanted to take it all the way back to where it first started and put that number back on . " <p> Davis is on the final year of his contract , set to pay him $27.1 million this season . Although , according to sources , he intends to re-sign with the Lakers long term in the summer of 2020 , he did not commit to that publicly Saturday . <p> " Honestly , I 'm focused on this season , " he said . " When I got traded here , my goal is to bring a championship here with the team that we have . And when that time comes around next year , then you can ask me that question and we 'll revisit it . Right now , my focus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can help this team and help the organization become a championship team . " <p> A championship run would be a pleasant change of pace for Davis , who made the playoffs only twice in his time with the Pelicans . And it would be almost as dramatic a turn of events as when his lazy Saturday afternoon spent lying in a hotel bed in Malibu , California , watching a movie was interrupted by news of his being traded to the Lakers . <p> The movie 's title ? " Downsizing , " sources said . <p> His attention was pried from the television screen as he pondered the big life change in store .

" And honestly I do n't think there 's any rule change or anything that would have affected that play , I think it happened too fast to change anything .

" But he feels like the collision rule unfairly benefits baserunners . <p> " I think that at times , the rule benefits the runner , " McCann said . " In the sense that every other base , when a runner 's sliding into it , they have to stay on the base . Whereas at home , all they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an arm 's length away from the plate , and touch the tip of the plate with their finger and they 're safe , and for me as a catcher , I have to be in front of the plate and it 's hard to reach back and reach a guy like that .

Guys who run the bases and do no catching , like Whit Merrifield of the Kansas City Royals , feel like the rule is restrictive , and may be trying to remove something from the game that just ca n't be removed -- danger . <p> " When a play like that happens , it 's really hard for a baserunner , now with the rules , to know what he can and ca n't do , " Merrifield told Yahoo Sports .

And considering why the rule was enacted in the first place ( it 's informally called The Buster Posey Rule for a reason , his knee was severely injured in a home-plate collision ) , some players may be nervous that more home-plate collisions could lead to more rules . <p> " ... The game happens really fast . To slow it down and say it 's this guy 's fault or that guy 's fault is really tough , " Blackmon said .

" <p> Baseball is full of split-second decisions that can have lasting effects . And while Blackmon and players of his ilk do n't want any more rules , Kris Bryant of the Chicago Cubs had a slightly different take . He definitely does n't want more rules , but he wants the rules already on the books to be clear . Bryant feels like the home-plate collision rule is murky and confusing , and yearns for clarity so everyone knows for sure what they are and are not allowed to do . <p> " I honestly think the rule is not that clear , " Bryant said .

The NPA claimed that they were the " true government " , and that they will help not only fight for their advocacies , but also in educating the tribe 's youth . <p> And it took leaders and members of the tribe some time before they realized that something was amiss . Even Datu Awing himself , could not help but wonder how they were deceived by the NPA for almost 30 years . <p> ( They were starting to use our community as their guerrilla base . It was there that they chose to live , they encamped there , and the young ones , us , we could not refuse as to what they wanted to do with us , or what they wanted to teach us . ) <p> ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were the real government ) <p> Training of ' child warriors ' <p> In the Salugpungan school , Awing recalled there were more than 64 children , aged six to 17 , who were trained to become " child warriors " . <p> He was eager to learn how to read and write clearly . But they were thought other things , instead , such as leftist ideologies , and wielding , assembling , and disassembling of firearms . During recess , Awing said they had to crawl first on ground , as if they were soldiers , before they were allowed to eat their meals . On examination day , it meant they had to undergo target shooting . <p> For 10 years , Awing " studied " and stayed at the NPA camp . Another 10 years of stay made him memorize each and every teaching . <p> And it was the age of 15 , when he was tapped by the NPA commander to reach out to the youth of other sitios , that he came upon the realization that all the teachings at Salugpungan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Unti-unti ko na nalaman at naintindihan na ito ay parang hindi mabuti sa kabataan , " said Awing , who said he was even named squad leader at the time he was also tasked to teach . <p> But that was also the time that he realized that he needed to keep that sentiment to himself , lest he draws the ire of the NPA leaders . <p> Awing also recalled that there was an instance when they were poised to launch an ambush on government troops when some of his comrades got cold feet and refused to fire their guns . <p> Their commander insisted : " Kailangan mong gawin ito . Ito ang tanging paraan na mabago natin ang bayan natin . Ang tanging kaligtasan ay kailangan maghawak ng baril ( You have to do this . This is the only way we can change our country .

Some of them , however , remain with the NPA to this day . <p> Aside from the deadly encounters , Awing said , what prompted them to return to the fold of the law were the false promises made by the Communist rebels . Those empty pledges included the construction of roads , and more houses , as well as in the development of their communities ' agriculture welfare , and food security . <p> From left to right : Bae Chiary Balinan and Datu Nestor Apas during a courtesy call with the Manila Bulletin on Tuesday , Aug. 13 , 2019 .

In fact , the resulting bloodshed has killed at least a thousand of their people , according to Datu Nestor of the Langilan-Manobo tribe . <p> It was at this point that no less than Datu Gibang , the founding father of Salugpungan , asked his son Awing to seek government 's help to close the schools which he helped nurture .

Fortunately , she was rescued by the military . <p> Scholarship in disguise <p> Another victim was Bae Chiary of the Ata tribe of Davao City when she was offered a " scholarship " for a prestigious school in Mindanao . She " accepted " the grant knowing that this could be a chance for her to finish school . <p> To her surprise , there was not any entrance exam of some sort . Instead , they went to a secluded place and attended a " workshop " wherein she learned leftist ideologies , propaganda , and demonstrations . <p> It was 2016 , and she was 25 when she also realized that she must have joined the wrong group .

Anton Ignacio <p> Anton , just like any other teenager , loves to play different kinds of sports ; at first glance he seems very ordinary -- quiet but with a ready smile to everyone he knows , na ? ve yet curious about the things around him , simple but with his own fashion style , and most of all , is very courteous and respectful to everybody . <p> But Anton is not ordinary in a lot of ways . He is one of the kids you will rarely meet who will say no to any mobile games any time . He is one of the few kids who is not crazy about cell phones . Though he is into the Internet , Anton surfs the Web for more information about the sports he plays . <p> Bombet ( left ) and son Anton enjoy a moment together while waiting for the competition to commence . <p> Of course , one of the favorite sports of Anton is basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the La Salle Greenhills ' soccer team . For him , a regular day is all about school , sports trainings and moments with his mom and dad when he gets home . <p> And when the weekend comes , Anton transforms from a simple kid to a fearless jet ski racer who recently bagged the first place in the third leg of the Jet Ski Association of the Philippines ( JSAP ) National Tours held in Caliraya Lake in Laguna on August 10 and 11 . <p> And with this victory , he once again proved like father like son . <h> A chip of the old block <p> Anton is the only son of Bombet Ignacio , the national champion of the Petron National Jet Ski Tour 1996 who represented the country to the International Jet Ski Competition held in Lake Havasu in Arizona , USA , in 1997 . <p> Like his father , Anton 's love for the sea ignited his passion to be a part of this very dangerous sport . Both father and son find the sea very tempting for numerous water activities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 90s when his father bought a jet ski , which they can enjoy in their beach house in Calapan , Mindoro . <p> Father and son Bombet and Anton Ignacio together share the winner 's podium after they bagged the 1st Prize of the JSAP National Tours ( 3rd leg ) held at the Caliraya Lake in Laguna recently . <p> " Me and my brother , Bim , love the sea and when our dad bought us a jet ski , riding it just became a hobby until we got passionate about speed , about racing , " Bombet recalled . <p> For Bombet , Jet Ski racing came as an unexpected opportunity as this sport was just beginning to gain popularity and according to him their old jet ski was not even for racing . <p> " Whenever we were at our family beach house , my brother and I would ride the jet ski in full speed . We would ride for more than 10kms in the open sea , and that became our training , which led us to many competitions in Subic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was their innate skills in racing that brought them in the Petron National Jet Ski Tour , which etched their names as two of the most respected players of this sport in the country . <p> After a couple of years , Bombet had to say goodbye to his favorite sport as he was set to study in the United States to secure a good education . And since then , he never raced again until a few weeks ago . <p> The winners pose with their Networx Jetsport team <p> Anton on the other hand , almost had the same story on how he started with Jet Ski racing . Bombet who always wants the best for his only son suggested that Anton has to have a solo sport , which can help improve his personality and character . <p> " Anton loves to do various sports , he is not like the other kids who play crazy mobile games . He is already into basketball and soccer , which are both team sports . So I told him that he has to get a solo sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anton tried carting and it was then that his father saw his potential for racing . <p> " Anton was only 10 or 11 when he tried carting and I realized that he is very keen and compelling when he 's racing . And so I thought , maybe he could also do jet Ski , " the proud father narrated . <p> Some words of wisdom from the father who wishes the best for his son . Anton 's mom gives him a tight hug after finishing the race . <p> Two years ago , Bombet bought his own jet ski so he could once again enjoy the sea in their beach house in Mindoro , but at the time he bought it , he did n't realize that it was a sign that his son will follow his footsteps in doing the dangerous sports of jet ski racing . <p> " It was a cheap jet ski so we could just do some water activities while we are in Mindoro . And Anton loves to ride it . And it was until I saw Anton maneuvered in high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a potential in racing . He is fearless and moves swiftly in high speed . " <p> Knowing and trusting the potential and dexterity of Anton , Bombet entered his son together with his cousin to their first jet ski race competition . " A couple of months ago , we went to Tacloban for a competition . Anton 's very first race , and luckily he won the third prize , and not bad for a newbie . " <p> Without really setting his mind to register Anton to any competition , as his son is still really young to race , Bombet bought his son his first jet ski last year in Australia so he could start to learn , embrace and love the sport then eventually do races . <p> Proud parents Joyce and Bombet are always present in every training and races of their son , Anton . <p> Anton is only 13 years old , less than 5-feet tall , skinny and someone you would n't think has the courage to drive a jet ski 120 kilometers per hour .

I am grateful for his dedication and help to train these kids . I completely attribute the victory to him , " Bombet stressed . <h> Sharing victories together <p> Just recently , father and son Bombet and Anton won the first prize in their respective categories -- novice and expert during the third leg of the JSAP National Tours held in Caliraya Lake in Laguna on August 10 and 11 . <p> Their victories again were unexpected because for one , Bombet since he retired from racing in 1998 , had never joined nor trained for any competition . He only joined the race just to accompany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both share a triumphant moment in the No.1 podium . <p> And for Anton , though his sharpness in the race track has been proven already , it 's not a guarantee that he will bring home the bacon because it 's just his second race , he is the youngest player and too skinny to outdo everyone on the water . <p> But that day was a day of blessings for the Ignacios , Bombet who raced first came through the finish line first . " I was really surprised to have won in that race because I was competing with younger guys , most of them half my age . And while on the race , I was really pressured to win because my son in his first try in this sport won , " said Bombet . <p> Bombet attributes his victory to Ang , their team manager , and to his teammates who supported him all through out the competition -- Javi Ignacio , Bim Ignacio and Jeff Yeo . <p> Anton who was next to race , riding his Yamaha EX1100 tuned and modified by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried upon learning that his dad won , " I am sure they 're also expecting me to win . So when we were all lined up waiting for the go signal , I told myself that I must win and I must stay focused , " Anton shared . <p> And after several minutes of heart-pounding and thrilling moves and ploys , Anton was named the winner , making him the youngest jet ski racer winner in the country . <p> " I am so blessed that I got the chance to share the No.1 podium with my son . Who knows that I will share this moment with Anton . I actually can totally give up jet ski racing because I already had this moment with him , but as his dad I will always support him . My wife and I will be here to help and assist our son to realize all his dreams . " <h> A father 's wisdom and a son 's advocacy <p> Bombet knows exactly what his kid needs in doing jet ski racing . According to him , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also learned from his parents , other people and experiences to Anton , and he could buy all the safety gears and gadgets to guarantee that his son will be safe , but there is one thing can guarantee his safe ride and can ease his worries -- prayer . " Before and after our races , we always start with a prayer . I know Anton could easily learn what we are teaching him , but we also tell him the importance of prayer . Aside from prayer , we also tell him that building a good relationship with everyone in the competition is another rewarding perk of being in this sport . Camaraderie , sportsmanship are good in building a better character , " Bombet stressed . <p> For Anton , who at a very young age finds joy and contentment in doing meaningful hobbies and recreational activities , wants to influence other kids to focus on their studies and join any sports activities available in their schools or communities . <p> " I am very lucky to have loving and supportive parents . I adore my mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do , I am really lucky to have them and I hope to be the better person that they want me to be .

@@71164238 <h> Solon wants local agricultural functions reverted to DA <p> MANILA -- AAMBIS-Owa Party-list Rep. Sharon Garin on Thursday said she has filed a bill that seeks to revert the basic agricultural functions devolved to local government units ( LGUs ) to the national government in order to rationalize services for the benefit of poor and marginalized farmers . <p> Appearing before the regular Party-list Forum at the House of Representatives , Garin said she filed House Bill No. 4027 , or the Re-Nationalization of Basic Agricultural Functions Act , due to her concerns over a study made by Social Watch Philippines which supposedly showed that the devolution of agricultural extension services to LGUs has resulted in low agricultural productivity , hampered agricultural development , and food insecurity . <p> Basic agricultural functions and responsibilities are discharged to Local Government Units ( LGUs ) under Republic Act 7160 , also known as the Local Government Code of 1991 . <p> It is in line with the goal of the national government to achieve economic development at the regional and local levels by decentralizing their powers and responsibilities in favor of LGUs . <p> However , Garin said economic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions , much to the detriment of poor and marginalized farmers . <p> " Agricultural programs at the local level have been poorly implemented due to the glaring disconnect between the devolved responsibilities and the financial resources available . Local government officials are also expected to function both as economic managers and administrators to their localities . The lack of appreciation of the devolved tasks has resulted in the under-utilization of technical personnel , " she lamented . <p> " I filed the bill not because the municipal agriculture offices ( MAOs ) are ineffective , but agriculture needs a general direction . We are competing with other countries now , so we need a national policy , " Garin said , underscoring the need for local governments to have its role re-examined and redefined in light of community interest , needs , and demands . <p> She further maintained that reinstating the agricultural functions and responsibilities to the national level will address the problem of coordination between municipal and provincial agriculturist on the national programs that needed to be implemented , especially in a demand-driven and fast-changing environment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Agriculture ( It is hard to coordinate if the municipal agriculturist is separate from the DA ) . There should be a better system than devolve the whole DA function to the LGUs , " Garin said . <p> " We are not saying that LGUs are inefficient and incompetent as food czars , what we are saying is that mukhang napuputol hanggang regional offices ng DA ang programa ng ating gobyerno pagdating sa larangan ng agrikultura ( but it looks like government agriculture programs only reaches up to the DA regional offices ) , " Sangcopan said in the same press briefing . <p> She added that there is also the lack of a memorandum of agreement between the DA and the DILG over the devolution of agriculture functions to the LGUs . <p> " There should be a MOA to make it clear that DA has control and supervision over the provincial and municipal agriculturist . If the DA has no extent of authority over these workers , we can not expect that our programs from the DA will be felt there , " Sangcopan said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the DA would raise the morale of the municipal agriculturists . <p> Sangcopan noted that the salary of MAO personnel is based on the classification of the municipality they are in . <p> In contrast , the former regional secretary of the Department of Agrarian Reform ( DAR ) in the former Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao ( ARMM ) pointed out that salaries of personnel from the municipal agrarian reform office ( MARO ) are based on the salary standardization law . <p> " Whereas MAOs and MAROs basically have similar functions and serve the same constituents , the discrepancy in their salaries is big . Putting the MAO back to the DA will address that . It is one of the reasons that I fully support HB 4027 , " Sangcopan said . <p> If HB 4027 is enacted into law , all personnel , technicians , facilities , and properties previously transferred to the barangay , municipalities , provinces , and cities shall be returned to the national government . <p> In lieu of local agricultural offices , the bill mandates the creation of the Agriculture and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry under the re-nationalization set-up and recommend measures to enhance agriculture productivity . <p> The panel shall be chaired by Secretary of Agriculture , with the Secretary of the Interior and Local Government and President of the National Agriculture and Fishery Council as members . <p> The bill was referred to the Committee on Local Government on August 28 , 2019 .

Dar on Wednesday pointed to hoarding as the " major reason " retail prices of rice in the market have yet to further go down despite the fact that the price of palay or rough rice has been dropping . <p> Dar vowed that the government will apply the full force of the law on traders and millers found guilty of hoarding . <p> Farmers complained that the price of palay dropped to P7 to P11 a kilo due to a deluge of imported rice under the new tariff-based regime that replaced import quotas , a problem that has reached President Rodrigo Duterte , Dar said . <p> The agriculture chief said he is also wondering why rice prices still range from P37 to P41 despite imports reaching 2.2 to 2.5 million metric tons from March to July or August . <p> " Iyon nga nakakapagtaka bakit kaya minamanihar , they 're managing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kasama namin ang DTI ( Department of Trade and Industry ) to be sure that they are not managing for themselves only , " he said in a Palace briefing on Wednesday . <p> As of the second week of August 2019 , the prevailing price of regular milled rice is at P35 per kilo ; P40 per kilo for well-milled rice ; P46.50 for premium rice and P50 per kilo for special rice . <p> Meanwhile , National Food Authority rice prices remain pegged at P27 per kilo for regular-milled rice and P32 per kilo for well-milled rice . <p> Prior to the passage of the Rice Trade Liberalization Law , economic managers are expecting rice prices to go down as low as P27 per kilo . <p> While they have the list of hoarders , Dar said they will talk to them first to know their reason why they are hoarding . <p> " Well , we know who they are .

@@71187235 <h> Huge wealth gap in European soccer <p> Workers install a giant replica of the Champions League trophy ahead of the UEFA group stage draw outside the Grimaldi Forum , in Monaco , Thursday . <p> By Rob Harris / The Associated Press <p> A study commissioned by UEFA to aid in the debate over the future of the Champions League shows the financial and talent gap between the top 5 European leagues and the other 50 leagues on the continent is growing . <p> The destabilizing effect of the power of the " Big Five " leagues -- England , Spain , Germany , Italy and France -- is set out across a 50-page study by accounting firm Deloitte marked " private and confidential , " and obtained by The Associated Press after being presented to UEFA 's Professional Football Strategy Council in Monaco . <p> The data shared with key European soccer officials is certain to fuel the heated debate over the future of the Champions and Europa Leagues heading into key meetings of clubs next week in Switzerland . The divisiveness of the discussions led to UEFA , European soccer 's governing body , to call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving clubs and leagues . UEFA President Aleksander Ceferin believes they are not " ready for a meaningful discussion . " <p> The " Polarization in European Football " report was commissioned by UEFA in June during the increasingly fraught talks involving leagues and clubs over attempts to overhaul the format of European competitions from 2024 . UEFA initially presented the idea of reserving 24 places for clubs in the Champions League to return the following season , but it has since backed off the proposal because it has left some of the biggest leagues at odds with their best teams . <p> Changes to the format are being pursued by the top clubs to ensure them more games against each other and guarantee inclusion in lucrative annual tournaments without qualifying . One of the most powerful figures in the fight is Andrea Agnelli , who has wielded his power as head of the European Club Association and is chairman of Italian champion Juventus , Ronaldo 's team . <p> The biggest leagues have pushed back , saying changes that would limit the opportunities for teams to earn a place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their leagues . <p> The European Leagues group has worked to divide the elite , perennial trophy winning clubs from their less prosperous counterparts . <p> One of the most recent leagues to publicly denounce the ECA was the Czech Republic , which said their clubs agreed it was " inappropriate for European football bodies to create plans that would alter the structures , calendar and competitiveness of the domestic game . " <p> The wealthy Premier League clubs offered support with a rare joint statement in June that highlighted the " obligation to maintain the health and sustainability of domestic league football . " <p> Caught in the middle is UEFA , who is using the study to help support its claim that it is the only European soccer body that distributes funds across the continent . The report shows how the top leagues are monopolizing the best players and the cash of broadcasters . <h> Some key findings : <p> The Big Five accounts for 74 percent of the ? 19.7 billion ( $21.7 billion ) generated by leagues across the continent , up from the 68 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of the revenue generated by all 720 clubs in the 55 nations assessed by Deloitte . <p> The attractiveness of the Big Five league matches on television could at least partially account for a drop in stadium attendances this decade across the 45 lowest-ranked leagues by revenue . <p> " To meet broadcast demand , the Big Five match calendar has increasingly been spread to collectively cover the weekend from Friday through to Monday nights to ensure live Big Five games are always available to watch in non-Big Five markets , " the report said . " Meanwhile , most leagues in Europe have seen a decline or little or no growth in match day attendances . " <p> The Big Five leagues banked 97 percent of the ? 2.4 billion ( $2.6 billion ) generated in non-domestic broadcast revenue by all European leagues in the 2017-18 season . <p> Rights holders in the other 50 European nations paid ? 430 million ( $474.3 million ) to show matches from the Big Five , accounting for 18 percent of the Big Five 's international broadcast revenue . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federation President Razvan Burleanu recently told the AP , referring to money Romanian broadcasters pay to screen league games from abroad . " This can be an idea to contribute to decreasing the gap between top-5 leagues and the rest . " <p> UEFA argues it is doing just that , sharing the revenue from European competitions . <p> While generating ? 373 million ( $411.4 million ) from broadcasters in countries beyond the Big Five , UEFA distributed more than double that to clubs in the 50 bottom-ranked countries . <p> The Big Five also profited but to a lesser degree : UEFA gave them around ? 150 million ( $165 million ) on top of the fees those markets paid for Champions League and Europa League games , taking the total to around ? 1.3 billion ( $1.4 billion ) . <p> The Big Five redistributes some of their revenue domestically to lower divisions , but Deloitte highlights how they " do not make direct solidarity payments to other European leagues . " <p> The report also shows how the Big Five has increasingly been a magnet for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players in those leagues coming from the rest of the continent last season . <p> No country was impacted more than the Netherlands , which lost 50 players to the Big Five -- a rise of 61 percent since the 2007-08 campaign . European champion Portugal is next on the list , with 49 players lost . <p> The struggle keeping players at home is particularly acute for Belgium and Austria . They have experienced around a threefold increase in the number of players going to the Big Five in a decade . <p> The report does not touch on the players who benefit from Big Five salaries and the chance to win the biggest trophies . <p> Transfer fees are not significantly filtering across the European game , with 67 percent of transfer spending -- or ? 3.5 billion -- circulating within the Big Five last season compared to 56 percent -- or ? 1.4 billion -- in 2007-2008 . <p> Non-Big Five leagues only receive 18 percent of the transfer spend , down from 23 percent in 2007-2008 . <p> " Only the Big Five leagues in aggregate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Operating losses have increased across all other tiers , in aggregate , since 2007-2008 .

Joey Salceda , Deputy Speaker Raymund Villafuerte and Tarlac Rep. Victor Yap , was opposed by the Professional Regulation Commission ( PRC ) , which said the Constitution had deemed the practice of professions among those nationalist provisions that should be limited to Filipinos . <p> The JFC , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two amendments sought in HB 300 . " Having more foreign professionals practicing in the Philippines can bring new skills , ideas , connection and integration into global networks of service providers , and support sunrise sectors including creative industries , R&amp;D , medical travel and retirement , " the JFC said . <p> " The Philippine Constitution creates a policy bias in favor of Philippine citizens , but not a strict legal barrier to the participation of foreign nationals , " it noted . <p> Although Section 14 , Article 12 of the Constitution states that " the practice of all professions in the Philippines shall be limited to Filipino citizens , " the JFC said this statement is immediately followed by " save in cases prescribed by law . " <p> " Having more foreign professionals practicing in the Philippines can bring new skills , ideas , connection and integration into global networks of service providers , and support sunrise sectors including creative industries , R&amp;D , medical travel and retirement .

By working with professionals from more advanced countries , Filipinos gain fresh perspectives and new knowledge , broadening the skills set they may already have . " <p> House Committee on Economic Affairs Chairman Sharon Garin <p> Citing the OECD Foreign Domestic Investments ( FDI ) Regulatory Restrictiveness Index for 2018 , Gatchalian said the Philippines is one of the most restrictive countries in the world when it comes to FDI rules . <p> Quoting the World Bank , he said the restriction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for foreigners of approximately $200,000 is substantially greater than the minimum capital requirements imposed on foreigners by industrializing or newly industrialized countries such as China , Indonesia , India , and Russia , and Asean countries like Malaysia , Thailand and Vietnam . <p> " Ownership limitations as well as paid-up capital requirements effectively prevent smaller foreign entities with insufficiently large investments to open business in the Philippines . Given this existing regulation , foreign firms are always placed at a disadvantage , compelling them to partner with local firms , " he said . <p> Another bill author , Representative Yap , cited two provisions in the FIA deemed to be inconsistent with FIA objectives . First is the inclusion of " practice of professions " in the items listed in the FINL , and second , the high number of direct local hires required . <p> " While FIA allows foreign investors to establish small- and medium-sized enterprises with a minimum paid-in capital of $100,00 , they are required to employ at least 50 direct local hires .

Thus , there is a need to lower the threshold of employment requirement to 15 direct local hires , " he said . <h> PRC vs exclusion <p> " While we understand the intent of the proposed amendment , the PRC is of the view that practice of profession is still a partially nationalized activity given that under the Constitution , the same falls under National Economy and Patrimony albeit with exceptions , " said Pilando . <p> " To remove it absolutely in the negative list may not be transparent on the limitation to professional practice by foreigners , and may engender an impression that there exists no restriction at all to their practice , " he added . <p> Jovee Marie Dela Cruz is working as a reporter in the country 's leading business newspaper the BusinessMirror since 2013 .

Victor A. Yap said he will file a bill that will set a floor price scheme . Through this , Yap said both the government and the private sector will have a minimum buying price for unhusked rice . <p> " In a liberal or open market , there will be greedy players and there will be speculation .

We could easily address these problems if we have a mechanism to prevent prices from going down below production cost , " he added . <p> The lawmaker said he is still finalizing his proposal , but his initial assessment shows that the floor price could be set at P13.50 per kilogram , which may be cut by P0.50 annually if production costs will decline . Currently , farmers spend at least P12.70 per kilogram to produce a kilo of palay . <p> Quezon First District Rep. Wilfrido Mark M.

Government intervention is still necessary for the farmers , " he said . <p> " At least , if they sell to the NFA , farmers are assured that their produce will be bought at a higher price , " Enverga added . <p> The lawmaker , however , did not indicate the amount that Congress could set aside for the NFA . <p> " The NFA administrator said it would take about P31 billion to cover all farmers .

Aside from that , they 're looking for something that 's not too traditional , leaning towards the modern and contemporary . <p> Also , the global economy is slowing down , and it 's getting difficult to be noticed . Buyers do n't come to the Philippines anymore .

Also , a lot of these new designers have very little exposure , so they need to learn about what 's happening outside the country . There 's the Internet , but watching from a distance is different from experiencing it firsthand . Aside from that , you also need to learn about what 's happening within the country .

@@71215237 <h> When to say NO <p> IN the early part of my career , I said yes to almost anything . I took on new assignments and new responsibilities which I initially thought were small favors and but surprisingly became part of my daily tasks . I took on those new assignments knowing I would learn and acquire new skills and , hopefully , become promoted in the long run . But things changed when I noticed I was being asked to do more than I should and I had less and less time for my main tasks . I realized I was being given more tasks because I was faster at doing them . I slowly switched focus and said no more often to tasks which were not my main concerns . I learned to say no by becoming busier with those tasks which had a positive impact in my career than be caught in undertakings which had no direct bearing on my professional development . <p> Just like in most organizations , there is a tendency that the performers are the ones laden with more tasks because they can do more . You would know this because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet you are given more tasks and responsibilities without anything in return -- be it a promotion , a salary increase , or even just a pat on the back . And when you realize that you are given more than you should be taking , you have to learn how to say no . <p> To be able to say no , understand the motivation behind the request . They may be asking you to do it because they have to do a more urgent task , or they just want to get out of doing a paper-pushing work . Either way , you have to think in terms of what 's in it for you . That said , you also do not want to be perceived as someone who wants to do things for other people only for personal gain . Accept requests from time to time to develop good working relationships , but a big mistake would be to accept a task when it is clearly somebody else 's concern . You can offer to assist and possibly do a part of it but you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> This happened to me a few weeks ago when I was asked to do a project which was clearly beyond my scope . I raised the issue to my direct supervisor who then talked to the people involved , and we sat down and worked together to come up with a workable solution . My direct supervisor acknowledged it was beyond my scope but also made it clear to the other manager it was their task . I offered to assist and we were able to come up with a good approach for the project . I did not directly say no , but I provided a way where I can still help without being a major player in the project because I know it is not within my purview . <p> There are instances when you can say no without actually having to say the word , like what happened to me another time . But there are instances when you just have to flat-out say no because they fall short of the requirements for a viable project . I received recently a request for creating training materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be gamified and interactive , all of which would take roughly six to eight weeks to develop and involve two developers . I flatly denied the request because the cost of creating the material far outweighed the benefits for just 11 people . I had to deny the request and refer them to my supervisor for approval should they feel they have a business case to develop the content . Understanding what your job entails and your scope can greatly help you in being able to say no . <p> This , of course , becomes doubly more difficult when your supervisor asks you to do more than what you can actually do . One tip I learned from a good friend is to put the matter back to my supervisor . When inundated by tasks , talk to your supervisor and tell them the tasks you are doing and ask which one you should prioritize . And when they tell you which one , tell them the timeline for each of the tasks . This is to let them understand where you currently are in your tasks and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they give you new tasks , you can refer them back to your task lists and ask them to choose which one is more urgent . This way , you do not have to say no directly because you are simply making them prioritize your tasks . <p> Another way of saying no is to refer people to others who can also help . One time , we created an infomercial to promote a new process and it was so well-received that the president of the company asked us to create a video for a summit he was going to present to . We gladly took it as affirmation of our work and went on to create the video for him . It took a toll on two of my developers because of the revision requests from multiple stakeholders and the strict branding guidelines we had to follow . In the end , it took an additional two weeks to develop the content . We realized we could have avoided the entire thing had we engaged the branding team to create the video rather than taking it on ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could have freed up my developers for projects more aligned with what my team was supposed to be doing . While being commended for a job well done has its merits , referring them to a team who knows more about the requirements can help in maintaining your reputation and help you say no willingly . <p> Understanding your priorities will also help you say no . Warren Buffett is known for this powerful quote : " The difference between successful people and really successful people is that really successful people say no to almost everything . " It all boils down to priorities and what you deem to be the most important -- whether in your personal or professional life . I know of a very loving man who would not take out-of-town trips or business engagements because he would rather spend time with his loved one . He knows his priority and would go out of his way to make sure he achieves it and he is able to maintain a loving relationship . To borrow a phrase from organizing guru and author Marie Kondo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help you say no easily without regret . It will also help in ensuring that you are reliable for the tasks you are responsible for . <p> The BusinessMirror provides readers with a broader look at the nation 's business in these challenging times .

When Ethan discovers that his best friend is having an open relationship with his fianc ? e , Ethan takes this as a sign and proposes the idea to Rome . Upon the threat of a looming breakup , she eventually says yes to having no-strings-attached sex with strangers . Along this adventure , they learn things about their relationship , and most importantly , about themselves . <h> The Short , Honest Plot <p> LikeTaylor Swift said , " Bandaids do n't fix bullet holes . " Sometimes , there are problems you ca n't fix , and that 's okay . All you need to do is learn and grow from them . <h> The Actors And Where You Last Saw Them <h> Arci Mu ? oz as Rome <p> Arci Mu ? oz last starred in the romantic comedy film Last Fool Show ( 2019 ) . She 's currently in the TV series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <h> Did You Know ? <p> 2 . Arci identifies with her character Rome . She says in different interviews that like Rome , she 's not into open relationships.JC , on the other hand , does not identify at all with Ethan . Like Arci , he 's also not into open relationships . <h> What I Think : <p> Open relationships are not a topic we would usually see in TV series or films . Open does it in a very honest and daring way . From familiarity and comfortability , to boredom and annoyance , the film paints a realistic portrait of a long-time relationship . <p> The film does not portray open relationships as necessarily good nor bad . We see two types of open relationships in the film . One is successful and is described as the most loving , respectful , and liberating relationship the couple has ever had . The other one is too painful to watch , as we see their relationship continue to deteriorate . This shows that open relationships may be extremely helpful to some couples , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Of course , it was Arci and JC 's performance that made the film so relatable . Their acting is so raw that we feel as if the characters are real people while watching the film . I found myself realizing that their story can be anyone else 's story . I also noticed that when it 's Arci and JC in a scene , the camera shot shakily , signifying their unstable relationship . <p> My personal favorite is Rome and Ethan 's intense confrontation scene . The way Rome tried so hard to hold her anger in is something a lot of us might be familiar with -- when someone we deeply love does something unforgivable and we finally reach our breaking point , all the pent-up frustrations suddenly come out . <p> Aside from romantic relationships , healthy friendships are also shown in the film . Archie ( Vince Larena ) is not your typical best friend character who condones Ethan 's bad decisions . In fact , most of the important plot points revolve and happen because of him . This is so unlike most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and someone who only gives advice to the main character . I like how even the supporting roles in Open are multidimensional ! <p> Continue reading below ? <p> The complexity of the characters makes them more human . For example , I could n't COMPLETELY hate Ethan 's character throughout the film . Yes , he might have been manipulative at the beginning , but towards the end , he realizes he only loves Rome . He tries to change his ways , but the damage becomes worse . He realizes that it 's too late . I also could n't hate Erika , the woman whom Ethan is fantasizing about , because it 's not really her fault why Ethan cheated . Feeling multiple emotions towards one character is a sign of a well-written and thought-out character . <p> The characters are not the only thing that 's well-written , it 's also the whole script . The natural exchange of lines added to the rawness and relatability of the film . But what I love the most is no matter how simple the lines are , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The next person you will love is so lucky , " I felt that . Not because she 's being sappy or whatnot ; it 's because , after this experience , Ethan will already be whole and so much ready to love another person . <p> Continue reading below ? <p> The ending is how I wanted it to be . It does not romanticize the idea of open relationships -- that everything will work out in the end . It shows that Rome and Ethan tried so hard , and that they did not give up on each other easily . For 14 years , they went through hardships and trials , and they surpassed them . Ethan cheated on Rome before , but she forgave him . When they felt that their relationship was going nowhere , they experimented . They tried and tried to save the relationship until there was nothing left to save anymore -- only themselves . It is a painful ending , but a fulfilling one . The entire film is so heavy , but I left the cinema feeling content . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in rocky relationships . A word of warning , though : This might trigger some feelings . But the film can also introduce new ideas for you and your partner ! <p> Those who are plainly curious about open relationships and how they work . You can learn a few life lessons about it from the film and apply them to your life . <p> Those who love romantic comedies , but not the sappy ones . This is a must-watch because it 's a different take on the genre . It 's not a happy ending for the couple like we always see in rom-coms . But it 's a happy ending for them as individuals .

@@71235230 <p> Ceres-La Salle started their AFC Cup campaign with high drama as they earned a 2-2 stalemate against Malaysian outfit Selangor Tuesday evening at the Pana-ad Park and Stadium . Playing in front of their beloved fans , Ceres-La Salle took the lead but had to chase the game after falling behind to the visiting side . <p> The match was a stern challenge for the Filipinos who are relative newcomers in comparison to their Malaysian counterparts . Overall , Ceres-La Salle were the more dominant remnant of the two and may have ended as winners had they mustered more composure . <p> The two teams took time to figure out each other as not a lot of attacking went on at the start . Both keepers were merely spectators within the opening 15 minutes , with only a harmless Stephan Schr ? ck effort registered in that period . Looking more dangerous , the home side began to stamp their authority in the match .

Schr ? ck , on loan from Bundesliga II side Greuter F ? rth , whipped the ball into the net to put Ceres-La Salle in front . His goal , taken from outside of the box , took the Selangor defense by surprise . Razali was able to get a touch to it but was not enough to keep the Azkals midfielder 's shot out . <p> --&gt; <p> In the thick of things , Schr ? ck set up what could have been a second Ceres-La Salle goal . Six minutes after the opening goal , his free kick from the right flank found Mara ? on who could n't direct the ball on target .

The Ceres-La Salle had little to do in the opening 30 minutes of the game , so perhaps he was thrown off hostname when Olivi forced him to commit an uncharacteristic mistake . Casas ' clearance into the middle of the park was turned into the net by Olivi who simply charged past him . Just like that , the Malaysians were on level terms 10 minutes before halftime . <p> It prompted both teams to go for the lead heading into the break .

The ball then landed to Adam Nor who was could only guide the ball wide . A minute later on the other side , Kevin Ingreso linked up with Ott to shoot from just outside the box.Ingreso 's attempt , nevertheless , narrowly slid past the wrong side of the far post . Another chance came begging for hosts when a free kick at the 53rd minute landed onto the path of Ott .

It proved to be costly for Selangor went ahead courtesy of a magnificently taken free kick by Mohd Hafiz right at the hour mark . <p> Now behind , the home team was eager to find an answer . With 20 minutes to go , Reichelt threaded a fine ball into Adrian Gallardo . The Ceres-La Salle striker got a touch to it but was denied by Razali . Committing a lot of men forward , the hosts were vulnerable for counter attack . Selangor was looking for a back-breaking third goal that may well secure the precious three points on their travels .

Upon receiving the ball , Schr ? ck then drilled a fine pass towards Ott who scuffed it just wide . Soon after , Reichelt was left open on the right side but the winger 's cross was dealt with well by the Malaysians . Time was slowly running out for Ceres-La Salle and an 83rd minute effort from Mara ? on only went straight to Razali . <p> Ceres-La Salle remained hungry in pursuing an equalizer and was rewarded for it with three minutes left on the clock . Turning from finisher to creator , Schr ? ck lashed a cross that found Gallardo inside the box . The Spanish striker used his head to divert he ball into the post and in to the goal . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points away . In added time , Schr ? ck stormed into the box and earned a corner for Ceres-La Salle .

The MBFEA is an organization of small and medium banana exporters , growers , and farmers . <p> He pointed out that while they did note an increase in the production of bananas , the farms have not been as productive as it should be . <p> " One hectare would produce an average of 3000 boxes but because of the existence of the disease it has dropped by 30 to 40 percent , " he said .

Wildlife passing by farms affected by the Panama Disease also serves as a carrier of the disease . The water and the wind also pose a threat to the healthy farms . <p> " Very susceptible to spreading .

After burning , trichoderma will be applied . <p> Gutierrez said trichoderma is a fungus that " covers " the spores of the fusarium . <p> The GCTCV 219/218 are claimed to be resistant varieties against the Panama Disease . However , the resistant variety is struggling to gain the full support of both the market and the farmers . <p> " The results so far have not been promising for the resistant variety . Its harvestable bananas are not suitable for the foreign market . There are major adjustments that need to happen , " Bae said . <p> Antig said , at present , changing the bananas to the GCTV 218 and 219 , is one way for those affected by the disease to recover or survive . <p> " So far what we are banking on right now is the discovery of 218 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see if this is really the variety that is resistant to fusarium wilt , " he said . <p> Antig added , " It will take several years before we can categorically say that this is really the variety to replace the cavendish because it is resistant .

There were also lectures and seminars on goof agricultural processes . <p> Bae said on top of this different assistance to the farmers , there is a need to intensify the information and education campaign on the Fusarium wilt . <p> " Farmers are hungry for information with regards to the issue , " he said . <p> It will take a while before a cure is found but the current mitigating initiatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ website welcomes friendly debate , but comments posted on this site do not necessarily reflect the views of the SunStar management and its affiliates .

@@71255240 <h> Tell it to SunStar : Cebu 's water problem <p> METRO Cebu 's water predicament is peculiar as most of us would surmise . It is no longer summer season but some areas still have no regular water supply . We experience floods but still inadequate to provide water to the consumers . This problem has long been lingering since the 1970s but more felt in recent years . Our water problem is compounded by many factors : an outdated water system delivery , lack of water source , mismanagement of watersheds and increasing demand . <p> I have read from the papers in the ' 70s that Cebu has an impeding water crisis . During my school days ( 25 years ago ) , cause-oriented groups and non-government organizations had been giving talks and presented the current situation of our ground water and watershed . <p> Fr . Herman van Engelen SVD of the USC Water Resource Center has long presented the issue on saltwater intrusion to the key leaders of Metro Cebu . His presentation must have fallen on deaf ears . <p> In 1995 a study revealed that saltwater intrusion has reached the portions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civil society on the awareness of the ground water condition of our Metro Cebu . Many students , key leader institutions were informed on a looming water crisis in Cebu . Now a bleak study by MCWD that by 2030 saltwater intrusion will be on the foothills of Talamban . To give us an idea , these are the areas in Banilad and near University of San Carlos-Talamban Campus . It is a matter that has to be taken seriously and we as a society have failed to act on it . <p> Saltwater intrusion is caused by the excessive amount of fresh water extracted from pumps on our ground water that would result in saltwater going into our aquifers . This also makes the aquifers more vulnerable to pollutants to seep into our water source . This is either irreversible or will take time to recover if proper restorative measures will be done . This is further aggravated by deforestation , lack of rainwater seeping in the ground ( caused by too much cementing of open spaces ) and many more . <p> The blame game is now at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . However , MCWD is equally responsible for our inadequate water supply . Our leaders always resort to band-aid remedies . Remedies like digging more wells will not solve this issue . Other options like desalination should be further reviewed on its effect . It may be the fast option but not in the long run . There are adverse results to this method such as increased seawater salinity ( marine organisms die on too salty condition ) and the use of fossil fuels in the process . <p> There are numerous solutions to avert this looming crisis . Vegetative restoration using native tree species is one solution and not the use of exotic ones ( e.g mahogany , gemelina etc ) . Protection of our watersheds should be top priority . Take a look at Central Cebu Protected Landscape ( CCPL ) which is a 29,000-plus-hectare protected area . If this is managed properly , it can actually hold a large volume of water . It is the headwaters to major rivers of Cebu . Proper urban planning should be done and implemented to allow rainwater seepage into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional water sources for communities near them . <p> We in Metro Cebu should accept that the water crisis is a reality that we are now experiencing if we do n't act now . Leaders should not deny the water crisis scenario and consider immediate courses of action . The data , studies and solutions have all been available but continually neglected . We should all unite in this cause , for water is a finite resource that is vital in everything that we do .

@@71284233 <h> When size ( and performance ) matters <p> As if on cue , the doorbell rang , and I knew her ride had arrived . I looked at her longingly , held her tightly for one last embrace , and let her brush my cheek one last time . <p> Ever so carefully , I placed her in bubble wrap , making sure she was well-protected before handing her over to the messenger , uncertain where she was going next . <p> I do n't usually get #sepanx whenever I return a review unit , but the Samsung Galaxy Note 10 was like reconnecting with an old friend and reminiscing old memories -- of a time when I was just starting out as a tech reviewer and Samsung was one of the first brands that trusted me . I had the first three Galaxy Notes , and got the Note 5 from my Smart postpaid line , and if not for the damaged screen , I would still be probably using it . <p> Not so long ago , before the rise of Huawei Mate , Xiaomi Mi Mix and One Plus devices , the Samsung Galaxy Note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the " kitchen sink " of Android bringing the best of the best available technology . <p> It did n't just raise the bar , the Galaxy Note was the bar . <p> But times have changed , and now there are more flagship alternatives ( and even more flagship killers ) . So while the Galaxy Note 10 Plus still packs all of the best features you could want and need in a smartphone , the biggest reason to get a Note may ironically be the smaller Note 10 . <p> For the first time , Samsung launched a smaller Note 10 , and if you 've been having second thoughts about getting a Note because of its hefty size , this " lite " version may finally be the one to make you switch . <p> DEVOUR <p> Fantastic screen <p> More S Pen features <p> Well-designed UI <p> Solid cameras <p> Loud speakers <p> Comfortable to grip <p> DISLIKE <p> No headphone jack <p> No microSD expansion slot <p> Lower battery capacity <p> The Huawei P30-esque camera design <p> Slower charging speed <p> " Cyclops " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Starting with the obvious , there 's no denying that the Note 10 looks a lot like the Huawei P30 Pro because of the vertical camera layout . I personally do n't like it , because the camera layout of the previous Notes is what made it stand out and easily identifiable . <p> Thankfully , that is also where the similarities end . The Note 10 is a bit more angular and it 's hard to ignore the blindingly dazzling , color-changing Aura Glow finish . It is as if Samsung could n't decide on the colorway and just put all the colors of a rainbow unicorn , if such a creature existed . <p> All named with the befitting " Aura " prefix , the Note 10 comes in Aura Glow and Aura Black . The unit I had , however , was the more subdued black , but it is still rather reflective and the mirror finish is a fingerprint magnet . Our review unit did not come with a case , so I had to put it in a pouch to avoid any accidental scratches . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and pocket-friendly smartphone as its about 13 percent smaller and 17 percent lighter than the Note 10 Plus . The Note 10 has a 6.3-inch Full HD+ screen as compared to that of the 6.8-inch Quad HD+ screen of the Note 10 Plus . The smaller Note 10 means you do n't quite get the full-blown , super-immersive Note 10 Plus experience , but there is really nothing to complain about because the display is still fantastic . <p> Also worth pointing out is the Note 10 's button layout , as both volume and power buttons are now located on the left side of the phone . Even more strange is that when you press " power " it activates Bixby instead of offering the restart/power off options . So if you want to turn the phone off , there 's a software toggle in the notification drawer . Thankfully , Bixby did n't kill the power button completely , and you can customize this in settings and make the button function as it is supposed to . <p> But the real casualty is our beloved 3.5-mm headphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pressure in the name of a thinner body and bigger battery . I really did n't see it as a big thing as I know a lot of people now have at least a pair of Bluetooth headphones , but it nice to always have the option to go wired . The retail version includes a pair of USB-AKG earbuds , but , sadly , no USB-C to 3.5-mm dongle . <h> NOT THE BEST , BUT STILL EXCELLENT <p> For the first time , the Note 10 gets a rear triple-camera setup , following its debut on the Galaxy S10 . The Note was at the top of the DXO rankings once , but this was the 10 Plus 5G edition and its reign was cut short by the Huawei Mate 30 Pro . <p> The Note 10 brings together a 12-megapixel main lens , a 12-megapixel telephoto lens , and a 16-megapixel ultra-wide-angle lens . It almost has the exact same camera setup as the larger Note 10 Plus except that it lacks the Depth Vision camera for those realistic bokeh shots in portrait mode ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While it may not have the best cameras on record , the Note 10 is still an excellent photography tool and can capture great photos , even in not-so-ideal lighting conditions . I do like the camera interface and the " best shot " assist feature that helps you better compose your photo . The AR Emoji is a lot of fun though , and you can even create animated stickers . I just wish they 'd add more selections for hair and face , as well as an option to make your emoji a bit chubbier -- like yours truly . <p> On the video side , the Note 10 stands out for its Zoom-In Audio where multiple mics are used to focus audio on the subject in the frame while toning down the surroundings . Improvements have also been made to video stability and its native video editor . Now you can even add transitions , music and even doodles using your S Pen to your movies . <h> THE S PEN MADE MIGHTIER <p> The S Pen is the one thing that defines the Galaxy Note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nifty tricks to make it even more useful . First is the brand-new Microsoft Office Integration that allows you take written notes from <p> your Samsung Notes app and transcribe them into editable text , and export it as a Word document . Samsung 's transcription technology is surprisingly accurate and has been trained in about 60 languages and thousands of handwriting samples , so it should transcribe well even if you have awful penmanship . <p> Then there 's simple gesture commands called Air Actions that allow you to control your phone with just with a wave from S Pen . Move the S Pen clockwise or counterclockwise to change the camera angle and capture a close-crop group shot or the whole scene . Flick it left or right while in the Gallery app to move to the next photo , or go back to the previous one . Turn up the sound by gesturing up and lower it by gesturing down without touching the volume key . <p> The last new trick for the S Pen is AR Doodle that brings the S Pen 's drawing functionality to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces via augmented reality and face-tracking technology . It is not that easy to use though . <h> PERFORMANCE AND BATTERY <p> The Note 10 and the Note 10 Plus is powered by the latest Qualcomm 's Snapdragon 855 processor . The difference is RAM , whereas the Note 10 has 8GB and the Note 10 Plus has 12GB . It is as fast as you 'd expect from a flagship device to be , and it can handle all the games and multitasking apps you can throw at it without a hitch , and throughout my review of heavy and varied uses , never did I wish that the Note 10 had more RAM . What I did want was expandable storage though . You only get 256GB for the Note 10 and no microSD card slot unlike the Note 10 Plus . I know 256GB is already huge but if you are going to take a lot of 4K videos and photos , you 'd wish for more expandable storage even if it is just for transferring files via SD card to another device . <p> Last , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is quite disappointing considering that 4000mAh has somewhat become the norm and that the Note 10 Plus has a massive 4,300mAh battery . It can last you a work day on normal use but at its price point , a bigger battery would have made it more reasonable . It does support fast charging and you can have it fully charged in an hour and a half . Wireless charging is still available , as is reverse wireless charging , so you can recharge other devices like Samsung 's Galaxy Buds or even the Galaxy Watch Active 2 simply by placing them on the back of the phone . <p> FINAL WORD : The Note series has been known to indulge in the excess , giving users tons of features to justify its premium price and flagship stature . So does this " lite " version deprive you of the complete Note experience ? The answer is no . The Note 10 may miss out on some of the higher specs and features , but it is smaller , more pocketable size all the more makes it appealing to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers with a broader look at the nation 's business in these challenging times .

She began her speech with a comment about her footwear , saying her presentation was a chance to wear 6-inch heels , a posh break from walking in the fields barefoot or in boots . <p> Over the course of nine minutes , Atilano commanded the room with an engaging talk about her passion and expertise on sustainable agriculture . She discussed her childhood dream of being an agribusiness entrepreneur with a company that would give back to farmers ; the achievement of that dream through AGREA , her agro-social enterprise ; as well as how farmers are " endangered specie " and how we need to see not the dirt , but the gold in soil . <p> Cherrie Atilano @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early age . When she was turning 12 , Atilano came across a book that said 100 percent of the income of the poor goes to food , leaving no budget for education , shelter or clothing . The book also stated that one can save as much as 70 percent of income to address other needs just by planting vegetables at his or her own house . <p> " My mom was very strict with gifts , and we can only receive one during Christmas or birthdays . On my 12th birthday , " Atilano said at the EAT Forum , " I asked my mom for a bike because I wanted to go to farmers and teach them about the lessons from the book . " <p> By the time she was 22 , Atilano had already traveled to 81 provinces in the Philippines to spread her advocacy . She pursued her passion in college and graduated magna cum laude with a Major in Horticulture Specializing on Tissue Culture from the Visayas State University in Leyte . <p> " That entire four years in college opened so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil , but it is a vast money-making venture that is so impactful to a lot of people , from the producers to consumers , " Atilano , now 33 , told the BusinessMirror in a recent e-mail interview . <p> The agriculture champion has garnered tons of recognition for her work . In 2007 , she was named as one of the 10 Outstanding Students of the Philippines for her academic excellence , exemplary leadership and strong social responsibilities . She is also a " Global Shaper , " tied to the World Economic Forum , and was named Young Global Laureate 2014 by the International Youth Organization-Youth Action Net . <h> UN appointment <p> Atilano 's latest accomplishment came last month , when she was appointed by United Nations Secretary-General Ant ? nio Guterres as a high-level ambassador of the UN Scaling Up Nutrition ( SUN ) Movement . <p> The SUN Movement is " committed to the understanding that good nutrition is the best investment of the future , " successfully catalyzing the fight against malnutrition in 60 countries , including the Philippines . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but facilitating collaboration among public-private and international organizations to create action-driven solutions to this global problem of malnutrition , " Atilano said . <p> The new SUN Movement ambassador was appointed along with 26 others across the globe in recognition of her strong commitment to the fight against malnutrition , as evidenced by her grassroots work toward rural development through sustainable agriculture in AGREA , where she holds the titles president , CEO and " Founding Farmer . " <p> According to its web site , AGREA is an innovative and inclusive enterprise founded on fair trade and sustainable agriculture , based in the island province of Marinduque . AGREA is creating the first replicable model of a one-island economy that is zero hunger , zero waste and zero insufficiency . <p> Atilano said the UN appointment is both a humbling experience and a great honor for the country . She added that the privilege is a good opportunity to scale up their work in AGREA on a global level , including its programs . <p> One of which is The Garden Classroom , which turns barren and forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another is Farm School , designed to train and enable farmer-leaders , farmer-scientists , and farmer-agripreneurs to offer good and nutritious food for the people . <p> " I will also provide strategic oversight of the SUN Movement , encouraging coherence and collective accountability for results , " Atilano said . " With this , I can influence in strengthening both policy and action in terms of solving malnutrition across the globe . But of course , I would like to focus and give emphasis on our policy and efforts here in the Philippines and the Asean region . " <h> Local challenges and solutions <p> The current state of Philippine agriculture , according to Atilano , is going to have a big impact in the fight against hunger and malnutrition . To succeed , she said everything must begin with education , particularly informing communities to grow their own food and eat healthy . <p> " I always promote family farming as an approach to solve our malnutrition problem so that it will not be a reactive solution to do a feeding program , but more of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Atilano also stressed the government 's role in supporting agriculture , saying there should be more focus on research and development on food fortification , breeding , and food processing to produce more nutritious food . Another key factor is encouraging the planting of vegetables in rural communities , as well as in public elementary schools , where the produce can be used for student feeding programs . <p> " The government can also partner with private institutions that develop nutritious products to be promoted in the country , and can put strict restrictions on junk foods , " she said . <p> One of the bigger obstacles in winning the fight against hunger and malnutrition is population . At 105 million people , the country ' population problem has been exacerbated by the decline in agricultural productivity . <p> " There is scarcity of food , the demand is high and the supply is very low , especially within the country , " Atilano said .

If there is , only those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also a need to educate Filipinos to eat more vegetables and go for healthier diets . " <h> ' Farming is cool and sexy ' <p> To attract the younger generation to farming , Atilano says behavioral change is necessary .

" There is a need to change the narrative of agriculture ; we need to stop telling them that agriculture is always associated to poverty and drudgery . " <p> Atilano has a message as well for the youth about farming . <p> " I truly believe that at the end of the day , farming is cool and sexy for young people to venture , " she said .

@@71284238 <p> THE Philippines continues to be confronted with energy supply challenges . But one that has to be dealt with immediately is the urgency to find and develop new energy sources to fill the void that will be left in the wake of the Malampaya gas field depletion . <p> If no viable alternatives to the gas field -- supplying more than 40 percent of Luzon 's power requirement -- are presented anytime soon , it is possible that rotational brownouts may hit Luzon again . <p> " Unless we find new indigenous natural gas deposits or develop the capacity to import and process natural gas , we stand to lose a tremendous amount of energy-generation capacity . This will compromise our energy supply stability in the coming decades , " Senate energy committee head Sherwin Gatchalian said . <p> The latest discovery announced by the Department of Energy ( DOE ) is the Alegria oil field , which is found to have commercial quantities of natural gas and oil resources . However , it could only power up a 60-megawatt ( MW ) gas plant and produce only 180 to 360 barrels of oil per day . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in San Rafael , Bulacan . <p> Albeit small , the agency said this is still a positive development since this will help the economy because it will support the local industry using crude oil . <h> Contracting round <p> On a larger scale , the DOE launched the Philippine Conventional Energy Contracting Program ( PCECP ) , a process through which the agency awards service contracts for the exploration and development of various energy resources , including oil . <p> It offered 14 predetermined areas ( PDAs ) but received offers to explore only four areas . The agency also received nominations for prospective areas in Southeast Luzon Basin , Northwest Palawan Basin , Sulu Sea Basin and Agusan-Davao Basin . <p> Senate energy committee head Sherwin Gatchalian <p> " We 're happy to get a third of the predetermined areas , " commented DOE Assistant Secretary Leonido J. Pulido III . <p> The DOE said it would continue to encourage investors , especially foreign firms , to participate in the program . <p> Though the Philippines is essentially a frontier country as far as energy resource development is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank in the West Philippine Sea does not exactly make the country marketable . <p> " If you look at the context of the Philippines , we are currently competing against markets from Africa , we 're currently competing for investments from the US .

So there is difficulty , there is a challenge there and we are working on that , " commented Pulido . <p> Still , the DOE expressed hope that the contracting round would result in finding another Malampaya . <h> Renewables <p> While this is being pursued , the DOE is collaborating with the National Renewable Energy Board ( NREB ) to build a renewable energy ( RE ) portfolio of 2,000 megawatts by offering a green energy tariff via an auction . <p> NREB will allocate the RE capacity to the distribution utilities ( DUs ) which , in turn , are required to purchase RE because of their Renewable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alfonso Cusi said the Philippines remains open to the possibility of harnessing nuclear energy for the country 's energy requirements so long as it is both feasible and viable to implement the highest safety and compliance standards . <p> Atty . Monalisa Dimalanta , NREB chairman , explained that the implementation of the program must coincide with the RPS , a policy mandating DUs to source a minimum portion of energy from renewable sources , thus guaranteeing a market for RE generators . <p> NREB is the advisory body tasked by the law to recommend policies , rules and standards to govern the implementation of the RE law , which granted fiscal and nonfiscal incentives to RE projects . <p> This plan , said DOE Secretary Alfonso Cusi , will help achieve the target of increasing the country 's renewable capacity to 15,304 megawatts by 2030 . <p> Another key policy lined up to hit the country 's target of 22,000 MW in RE capacity , with RE accounting for 35 percent of the total energy mix by 2030 , is the Green Energy Option ( GEO ) . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their energy is sourced from renewable resources . <p> Meanwhile , a consumer group said it would closely monitor the DOE and NREB on how they will enforce the proposed green energy tariff program . <p> " The DOE is mulling a green rate for renewable energy players .

He said the policy addresses the issue of whether nuclear energy is going to be an option for the country , especially since " there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a power source . " <p> In fact , during President Duterte 's visit to Moscow last week , the Philippines and Russia agreed to " jointly explore " the prospects of constructing a nuclear power plant in the Philippines . <p> This plan , however , is risky , according to Gatchalian . " We should study this well because it 's very risky and nuclear power plants should have a lot of safeguards , " he said , adding that an in-depth study must be conducted . <p> Meantime , the country will continue to be heavily dependent on oil imports while industry stakeholders continue to aggressively pursue and support new players , conduct more oil exploration discoveries , and invest in other forms of renewable energy . <p> " Together with our country 's economic management team , the DOE and your entire energy family remain unyielding in finding ways to manage the situation at hand . <p> " We will not rest from pushing vital industry reforms , including the crafting of policies that promote the exploration and development of our indigenous energy resources , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity of safety and resiliency standards , and bring power to unserved and underserved areas in the Philippines , " the DOE said . <p> These are the promises of DOE .

In fact , she lived for many years on 57th Street , in the same area where she recently completed the interior design of this stunning 3,576sqft penthouse .

She mostly used furniture from Italian manufacturer Flexform to accomplish her goals with this project . <p> " I carefully chose neutral tones and rich finishings so as not to detract from the art or spectacular views , " says Cihan . " My favourite aspect of the architecture are the high ceilings and vast windows that frame the sensational views .

@@71295239 <h> Thanks ! <p> The decision to open a restaurant housed in a Singapore landmark hotel is far from an easy one to make . But for one of the world 's most iconic chefs , the ever-affable Alain Ducasse , it helped that it coincided with a particularly fond memory of visiting and cooking at Raffles Hotel Singapore over 30 years ago . <p> It was also after major renovation works , he recalls , and he had been invited to cook for a special event to celebrate the reopening . It was his first time visiting the Grand Dame and what he experienced made a lasting impression . " The diversity , quality and design of the F&amp;B offerings were the best in Asia at that time , " he tells us during a quick catch-up following the launch of BBR by Alain Ducasse two weeks ago , which has taken over the hotel 's famed 122-year-old Bar and Billiard Room . <p> The BBR by Alain Ducasse kitchen is helmed by Chef de Cuisine , Louis Pacquelin , who has worked closely with Alain Ducasse for many years and is specially picked to present his cuisine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ -- after launching more than 30 restaurants across seven countries and three continents -- to open a restaurant here , the 63-year-old French-born Mon ? gasque chef simply affirmed that it was only a matter of time . " There is a saying that good things come at the right time if you have time , " he posits , adding how he was drawn to the Bar and Billiard Room from the start because he likes the idea of investing in a landmark space to develop a concept with a " contemporary design and a strong vision " . He noted that he had also wanted the project to coincide with the " spirit behind the renovation " of the iconic hotel . <p> Noted for his take on contemporary French cuisine , many forget how much of an influence the cuisine of the Mediterranean is for Ducasse <h> Personal Reflection <p> Ducasse was adamant from the beginning that he was not going to open a fine dining concept in Singapore . He felt that it was already in " the DNA " of the country 's vibrant dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so , it made sense to invest in a grill and sharing-plates concept ; in this case , a " casual yet elegant " space that specialises in a breadth of Mediterranean classics . <p> What most diners tend to overlook is the fact that the concept also expresses Ducasse 's " more personal " side . Seduced by the flavours of the Mediterranean from a young age , the diversity of the cuisine , mainly across Portugal , Spain , Italy and France , is also a nod to his early years in the kitchen , working in Provence at the Moulin de Mougins with Roger Verg ? in 1977 , and Le Louis XV in Monaco in 1987 . <p> For now , though , the focus of the menu at BBR by Alain Ducasse seems to be on the classics from the French-Italian riviera , Spain and Portugal . " Step by step , we hope to include dishes from the other Mediterranean coasts , " he shares . He noted how this is a cuisine he has long been invested in , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Livre De Cuisine : Alain Ducasse 's Culinary Encyclopedia , which boasts 700 recipes from French and Mediterranean cuisine that incorporate 100 basic ingredients and 10 major cooking styles . <p> He says that it 's also about carrying on a heritage , adding that by opening BBR by Alain Ducasse , he is putting on the menu of this historical landmark a historical cuisine that has strong roots and strong flavours . <p> The aim , he expounds , is to showcase Mediterranean cuisine as tasty , sexy and accessible -- the same way street food in Singapore is . <h> Moving Forward <p> We asked if innovation is still important when it came to curating dishes for the menu at BBR . " Innovation , yes , but not evolution , " Ducasse insists , highlighting the importance of respecting and preserving the essence and identity of the original recipes . <p> For example , when curating dishes for a specific region like Catalunya , the team 's aim is to develop adaptations with less fat , less salt and that are more refined than the original recipes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spain , he points out , the recipes today are less fatty . <p> The Cataplana de Marisco is a hearty Carabinero shrimp and shellfish stew <p> Ducasse goes on to clarify that this latest opening , which follows recent openings of similarly casual but " chic " concepts ( in Paris and Monaco , for example ) , is coincidental . Rest assured , the decision to launch a new address is a highly strategic one , and a testament to his inspiring string of successes in a notoriously volatile industry . <p> His latest , for instance , is Esterre in Tokyo , Japan , which opens in November at the Palace Hotel Tokyo . It 's an adaptation of his haute cuisine concept at Hotel Plaza Ath ? n ? e in Paris , France , that serves what 's been dubbed " naturalness cuisine " . Drawing on a fashion metaphor , he says that " Alain Ducasse au Plaza Ath ? n ? e is haute couture " while Esterre will be the " pr ? t- ? -porter deluxe " version that will feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish . " And just one chicken and one beef option , " he adds , so as to not impose this cuisine style on first time visitors . <p> Suffice it to say , his attention to detail and quality will be apparent , as it is even with decidedly more accessible concepts like BBR by Alain Ducasse , which he is confident will offer a quality of dining worthy of a Michelin star . " Though it 's not a plan ( to get one ) , " teases the man whose restaurants boasts a total of 21 Michelin stars .

@@71363234 <h> Travel Blogging 101 : How to become a Certified Travel Blogger ? <p> You 've decided to join the ranks of the elite by setting forth to earn your certification as a travel blogger . The certification process to become a travel blogger is a long and arduous road , but the truth is that there is no certifying body for travel bloggers , though that may not always be the case . <p> If you want to become a certified travel blogger , there are really just three things you have to do : <p> Travel <p> Write <p> Have a Blog <p> Now let 's have a look at each of the requirements . <p> Joel Aldor of JoelAldor.com in Nagcarlan Laguna Underground Cemetery <p> First you have to travel . Some people would argue with this , but the fact is that no matter how great a writer you are , it is impossible to write about what you have never experienced in a way that will draw readers to you . <p> Sure , you can buy travel books and create imaginary stories about travel , but without the experience of actually meeting new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place to another , it is doubtful whether you will be able to create a blog that is compelling to readers . To give you a more helpful example , I have posted the photos and URL 's of some of the Philippines most popular travel bloggers . <p> In terms of travel , you also have to make sure that you know what kind of travel you are going to write about to . The travel niche is huge . You can write about business travel , international adventures , budget travel , Europe , or even create a blog about one specific area and everything there is to do there . <p> Second , you need to be able to write . I must confess , Im not really a good writer but keeping your spelling , grammar &amp; punctuation right will save your ass . This might sound obvious , but the truth is that the internet is littered with websites of people who wanted to blog about travel but did n't realize that writing is a key component . Just creating a site called John 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if your name is John . <p> Simply writing " I went to China with my father " is n't going to win you any readers whereas taking the time to craft something like " It was hard to convince my father to allow me to accompany him to the furthest reaches of the world " might just keep your readers coming back for more . <p> The third major requirement is that in order to become a certified travel blogger , you need to have a blog . Blogs are easy to come by these days . You can get free blogs through wordpress , blogger , and tons of travel portals such as WorldNomads.com , BootsnAll , or TravelBlog.org . <p> The benefit of going with established travel portals is that you have a built in audience waiting for you . Of course , if you plan to go big time , you will probably want to buy your own domain name , host your own blog , and have complete editorial control over your content and site . <p> Melo Villareal is the Online Publisher of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corporate world at the age of 23 to explore his beautiful country and the rest of the world .

I 'm completely confident in players and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a great season , " he told a news conference . <p> " There is a long way to go in everything , I think we 're close to arriving at one of the peaks you have in the season , we 'll be very strong very soon . <p> " I think we 'll have a great season and we 're focused to face a complicated opponent who are in great form . We ca n't look back , we can only look forward . " <p> Asked if the players were anxious about their poor form in front of goal , Lopetegui replied : " We 'll just try to do what we try to do and focus on our play . We 're not worried about the record or anything , we just have to create chances and take them , that 's the best way we can be in this game .

It does n't help us win if I take notice of that . " <p> Lopetegui was asked if his plans had changed given Madrid 's struggles and the 52-year-old said it is inevitable that a coach must adapt during the course of a season . <p> " Plans change all the time , you have to keep evolving , keep changing things .

@@71394234 <p> A couple of weeks ago , many of us in the automotive media from all over the world arrived in Japan for the Tokyo Motor Show . <p> The anticipation was very high . TMS , after all , is the premier automotive trade show in Asia . It 's the prime launch pad for Japan 's automobiles for the world , the home event for companies such as Toyota , Honda , Nissan , Mitsubishi , and many more , ranking up there in the big five international auto shows : Geneva in Switzerland , Frankfurt in Germany , Detroit in the USA , Paris in France , and then Tokyo . <p> But during the first day , there was a bit of confusion . A big part of that was the venue : Tokyo Big Sight . <p> The Tokyo Motor Show has always been impressive , and massive given how it can occupy the many halls and buildings that make up the Tokyo Big Sight . To give you an idea of scale , our own World Trade Center Manila exhibition hall which hosts the Manila International Auto Show and Philippine International Motor Show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But this year , the show has been affected by the preparations for the 2020 Tokyo Summer Olympics as the biggest hall , the East Hall , has been closed down to be renovated for next year 's games , leaving only the smaller West , North and South Halls . To compensate , they used the large Aomi Hall , but that necessitated a bus ride to the other side of Odaiba . It was like having one event but one half of it is in WTC Manila while the other is at the SMX Convention Center in MOA . <p> The organizers were doing their best to manage the unusual arrangement ; the 2020 Olympics , after all , takes top billing compared to a motor show . But it proved to be tricky for a global event on the scale of TMS , and that was already with the Japanese way of getting everything organized . The shuttle buses were inadequate , and the hour allotted to get from Ariake to Aomi for the Toyota presentation proved to be insufficient . Manufacturers such as Honda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Toyota , Subaru , Hino were in Aomi . All in all , it was the best possible arrangement with a complex situation . <p> But there was a palpably odd feeling circulating amongst those in attendance . It 's hard to put a finger on it , but the feeling hovered around the question : <p> Where are the automobiles ? <p> Let 's try to qualify that a bit . The Tokyo Motor Show has been the launch pad for many motor vehicles of different types . A lot of hatchbacks , sedans , sports cars , SUVs , vans and even trucks have premiered at TMS . And we 're not just talking about vehicles you can buy when you walk into showrooms in a few months or even a year , as TMS has also premiered automobiles in various stages of development like futuristic concepts , fully functional prototypes , and even tuned , upgraded , or updated versions of existing production models . But for some reason , there was quite a lack of them . <p> It may not be entirely accurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each booth ( save for 1 ) did have quite a few on display for us to admire , take photos or videos of and write about . But typically , we 're looking for the wow factor ; the next big thing , so to speak . And in that light , many of us were disappointed because there were so few things at TMS that qualifies as something that really stole the show and captured our collective imaginations . <p> Mitsubishi 's looked promising with the kei car spec Super Height K Wagon concept as well as the adventurous Mi-TECH ( Mitsubishi Intelligent Technology ) buggy in that shade of blue , but we were hoping for more . We would have wanted a next generation Lancer or to have seen if they 'd developed the Engelberg Tourer concept into something more , like maybe a next generation Pajero . <p> We liked Nissan 's booth with the Ariya concept and the IMk . No doubt that both were stunning and beautiful concepts , but we had hoped for a better peek at the production models or prototypes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the IMX ( X presumably for the next gen X-Trail ) . Many of us were even wishing for a new GT-R concept especially since the premiere of the R35 GT-R concept was already 18 years ago at the 2001 TMS . <p> Honda was the only major Japanese manufacturer that really debuted a production car in the form of the Honda Fit , a model that we know as the Jazz . Many of our readers were critical of the design of the vehicle , but maybe they can make a few changes for the model that we will get in South East Asia . We also saw the production version of the Honda e electric car that they first debuted in concept form two years ago , as well as a lot of new bikes and upgraded ones . <p> The Lexus area was quite nice too , particularly with the very futuristic LF 30 concept . Lexus says they made it for their 30th birthday , and that it has 536 horsepower from its pure electric drive system . Perhaps most notably , it has gullwing doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TMS , one particularly caught our eye : Toyota . Now in the run up to the show , Toyota had been teasing us with the things they will have to display . The new hydrogen powered Mirai , for example , is one we were particularly excited at seeing given that it no longer looks like a Prius offshoot ; now it 's reminiscent of the Stinger ( yeah , from Kia ) . Toyota also revealed the new Yaris hatchback a few days prior online ; that too , we were excited about . <p> When we did arrive at the Toyota booth , however , we did n't see any of them . In fact , Toyota did n't have any production or prototype cars that can see production at their actual booth . Instead what we saw were ideas of the future and how vehicles can be used for more than just getting around . They had the e-Racer ; a futuristic peek at what racing cars of the future will look like , but it 's meant to be in the virtual video game space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Toyota will use to move athletes ( specifically paralympic athletes ) around in 2020 , they also envisioned it to be able to function as an autonomous delivery vehicle , a mobile laboratory , or even a mobile store . <p> Perhaps the most oddball display of all was the Toyota e-Broom . No , it 's not a Nimbus 2000 ; instead it 's a broom with an electrically-driven wheel . They even demonstrated it with a guy wearing a futuristic suit with rollerblades . And at that point , we just thought : what the hell was going on ? <p> Toyota did say they were going to " Play The Future " . Yeah , some of the ideas were neat and very playful , but the thing is that we just did n't expect it to go that way . As for the Mirai and the other cars we wanted to see , we had to go over to a different building , Megaweb , just to see and shoot them . <p> There was , however , a realization . The car manufacturers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradigm shift with the Tokyo Motor Show as well as the automobile industry . <p> TMS is organized by JAMA , or the Japan Automobile Manufacturer 's Association which is also led by Toyota 's Akio Toyoda . Judging by what we saw , they worked to re-orient the show to not be as serious a major auto expo as before . Generally speaking , a major motor show is intended to cater to auto executives , industry personnel , and journalists . It 's a serious event where carmakers spend months preparing for to put their best foot forward for the cameras and the media outlets . <p> This year 's show was more like a theme park . Toyota had a big open air park where people of all ages can try out some interesting bits of future tech , and you can even try out some of the stuff at their booth in Aomi . <p> Aomi was also the site of the big partnership that JAMA had with KidZania . Nissan and Mitsubishi had booths where kids can learn about car design and mold concept cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineers , programmers , and mechanics . Subaru showed kids how to be mechanics too . Honda had racing simulators , among others . Of course , there was also the big Tomica booth . <p> The results were staggering for the show . For years , the attendance figures at the biennial ( read : every other year ) Tokyo Motor Show have been declining . In 2013 attendance was at 902,000 , but dropped to 813,500 in 2015 . In 2017 , that dropped even further to 771,200 . For this year , the Tokyo Motor Show 's attendance surged by 70% to more than 1.3 million . <p> We were able to catch up with Mitsubishi Motors Corporation CEO Takao Kato during his recent visit to the Philippines , and he said that the role of the motor show is changing . <p> " As you know very well , for automotive field a lot of new technology will be introduced or be understood such as connected , autonomous , EV , shared brain , and more , " said Kato .

@@71394240 <p> While we at AutoIndustriya have always been reviewing passenger cars , SUVs , pick-ups , and vans , in the last couple of months we noticed a new trend : the market has been launching quite a few commercial vehicles . You know , the kind you use for business rather than for personal mobility . <p> Mitsubishi had restarted the production line for the L300 that is Euro4 emissions compliant , and it 's poised to regain its crown as the king of Philippine commercial vehicles . Isuzu launched the all-new Traviz , another LCV contender that comes in short wheelbase form to compete with L300 , and a longer wheelbase to compete with the Hyundai H-100 and the Kia K2500 . <p> But what if you needed something bigger , has more power and torque , more modern , and much more in payload capacity without being covered by the truck ban in some areas ? <p> If those are your requirements , then the Fuso Canter -specifically this FE71- will get the job done . <p> Fuso is a name that has long been associated with Mitsubishi Motors , and for quite a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MMPC . Now , however , there 's a new distributor for Fuso : Sojitz Fuso Philippines Corporation , and their primary light truck is the Japan-made Canter . <p> We all know the Canter , and there was a lot of them neatly lined up at the Fuso yard in Laguna so as not to trigger any of our OCD tendencies . There are a lot of variations of the Canter , and they 're classified by the length of the chassis after the front cab and the number of wheels . For instance , the FE85 ( while not at the yard ) is the biggest of the lot and is classified as an 18-footer , meaning there is 18-feet of space on the back for a customer to fit a body or a bed or other specialized equipment ( i.e. utility crane or car carrier ) and its a 6-wheeler with dual rear wheels ( DRW ) . <p> The one we 're going to try out is the FE71 : it 's the smallest variation of the bunch with 10-feet of bare chassis at the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gross weight of 4.4 metric tons ( 4,400 kilograms ) . Those details are key , as it means the Canter FE71 is n't covered by the truck ban regulations that prohibit vehicles that have a GVW ( Gross Vehicle Weight ) of over 4500 kilograms ( 4.5 metric tons or tonnes ) from plying certain streets . <p> We 're not going to get much into the design because , well , there is n't much to report . This Canter is an eighth generation model ; honestly even I was surprised that there has been that many already . Apparently , the history of the Canter goes all the way back to 1963 in Japan , and has been continuously updated with new engines , new looks , new technologies , improved frames , the list goes on . For the curious , the name " Canter " comes from the fast gait of a horse , and you 'll recognize it from the 3 quick beats in succession : Thump-Thump-Thump . <p> The Canter is a cab over truck , meaning the engine is underneath the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Traviz ) , accessing the engine is n't about flipping up the seat cushions ; you have to tilt the entire cab to get ot it . From the passenger side ( which is the driver 's side in its home market of Japan ) you pull a lever to release the master lock , pull another lever to release another latch , and push the cabin to tilt forward up . Honestly , it was very easy ; it 's almost sexist , but Fuso says a lady can easily lift that cabin , no problem . Their words , not mine . <p> Once you do lock that cabin forward , you 'll see the 4M42 engine underneath . Owners of the Pajero and Montero will probably find that engine code familiar : Mitsubishi did use the fairly closely related 2.8L 4M40 and 3.2L 4M41 , in those SUVs . In the Fuso Canter , the engine displaces 3.0-liters , has twin camshafts , 16-valves , a turbocharger , and common-rail direct injection . It 's quite a modern engine . <p> The 8th gen Canter has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at first debuted in 2018 . While there are no major cosmetic changes since 2010 , there is one key difference : the emissions standards . This Canter and its 4M42 engine makes for a Euro4 compliant package . So if maintained properly ( emphasis on properly ) , anti-smoke belching units ( ASBU ) will just be wasting their time if they do n't spot the big Euro4 stickers on the doors . <p> Like we said , this FE71 can fit a 10-foot long body in the back , and the example we 're trying out comes with a 10 ' x 6 ' x 6 ' ( L x W x H ) , meaning it has a volume of 360 cubic feet ; slightly less , of course when you consider the thickness of the walls with the plywood lining . The body actually built very well with clean seams , no waviness on the metal , and high quality latches on the back . Using our many XL Balikbayan Boxes , we estimate you can neatly fit a total of 45 of them inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3 stacked . <p> The key to this body ( it 's built by Almazora ) is its construction : they used aluminum . That means the body consumes less of the payload capacity of the vehicle ; yes , the actual body is part of the payload weight which is 2,640 kilograms . The logic is simple : the lighter the body , the more actual cargo you can carry . We do wish we had actual weight figures from Fuso or Almazora , but in this case we 'll just have to take their word that it 's light compared to its steel counterparts . <p> Getting up to the cabin was n't difficult at all ; it 's high enough to give a great view of the road , but not too tall so as to make getting up a chore . The first thing that surprised me was the modernity of the cabin . I have n't been in a Canter in a while , and even then it was a much older generation , so seeing a fairly nice and modern dashboard was oddly refreshing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ litter brother , the L300 , which still has essentially the same dash since the 80 's . Honestly , Mitsubishi could have asked their parts suppliers to update the dashboard of the L300 a little bit . <p> There 's a nice sense of versatility about the dashboard with the many storage compartments and trays , and even comes with pull out cupholders . The gauges look like they could have come from a Montero Sport or a Strada . There 's even an LED dome light , which is strange . There is no radio though ; that 's an option . We were surprised to find a tilt and telescopic steering wheel ( and with a nice grip to it ) ; unusual for the class . The Canter also comes with a 5-speed manual ' box that 's mounted on the dashboard instead of the steering column or on the floor ; that frees up some legroom . <p> The key thing that the Canter does not have is airconditioning . Yes , there 's a panel with the vent controls and the fan speed thingamabob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's no compressor mounted onto the engine , so no cooling for the cabin . Fuso tells us that their corporate and business customers do n't want A/C fitted to the Canter for fear of the drivers falling asleep . Well , that makes sense , but just be prepared for a smelly cabin thanks to the sweat as well as other foul odors from the cabin after a few months ; the Canter , after all , was built with the presumption that the employees using it will smoke , thanks to the presence of ashtrays and a 12-volt cig lighter . <p> One thing that they do n't tell you about is how the Canter has become a global product . Yes , it 's Japan-made , but a closer look around the cabin and the frame reveals that they 're using some non-Japanese parts . The most obvious component are the glass windows : they say Pilkington on them . <p> If that brand sounds unfamiliar , that 's because Pilkington is a British brand , and they 're the same supplier for windshields on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rover , among others . Actually , Pilkington is a UK glass manufacturer , but they 're Japanese-owned , but they have their main hub in Germany . How 's that for a strange connection . <p> The backstory to that connection is that Fuso no longer reports to MMC . As part of a compensation agreement , MMC transferred ownership of Fuso ( specifically Mitsubishi Fuso Truck and Bus Corporation , or MFTBC ) to their former partner : Daimler AG . That means Daimler now holds 89.29% of the company . If you see some some German parts in the Canter when you examine it , this is why . They did , however , retain the Mitsubishi Motors diamond star on the grille ; that was a specific request from the dealers , as Mitsubishi dealers in the Philippines do carry the Canter in their portfolio . <p> The Canter FE71 is fairly sprightly with 125 PS of power . Most drivers would start with second gear as first gear is only really used to get the Canter moving if there 's a lot of weight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payload , but it seems the 3.0-liter turbodiesel is more than up to the task . The key factor is the torque : it has 294 Nm , but it comes in at a very early 1700 rpm ; which should be good for fuel economy . Unfortunately we could n't take the Canter out onto the public highway ( unregistered and all ) , so perhaps we can do a fuel eco run later on and see how the FE71 does . <p> The steering was quite light ; it 's a hydraulic power steering unit , which should be superior for long term reliability for this application . The braking was also very powerful . This was something we learned on larger trucks because , for safety , truck manufacturers actually beef up the braking systems on their vehicles . Much larger trucks have those maintenance intensive air brake systems , but light duty trucks like the Canter does n't really need that system ; this one uses a more conventional one with hydraulics . The brakes are very very powerful when you 're driving unladen , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to having a lot of payload , so long as you do n't exceed the GVW . <p> The turning radius was surprising though ; the Canter FE71 can turn tighter than most pick-up trucks . The reason is because while most pick-ups have a wheelbase at around 3000mm , the Canter has a shorter 2500mm wheelbase . Fuso can make the wheelbase that short because the FE71 is a cabover design that frees up more space forward , negating the need for a longer wheelbase ( which would widen the turning circle ) . So if you have to do some deliveries in cities with tight streets and 90 degree corners , drivers of the FE71 should be able to easily manage with the huge windows and big side mirrors mounted forward on extended stems . <p> The only real downside ( apart from the exclusion of the A/C ) was the manual transmission . The shifter may be nicely mounted to free up space on the floor . The shift pattern takes a little getting used to if you 're hopping from a conventional passenger car as where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the real first gear starts where the second gear would normally be . But that 's not really a problem : the only issue we have is the clunkiness of the gearbox . <p> Sometimes it takes force to engage a gear , and sometimes there 's a little grinding that induces some cringing . Sometimes it just wo n't go in even when the clutch is depressed the whole way . That 's really how it is , says the guys at Fuso . We found it odd , so we spoke to some drivers at the local market as they were making their deliveries , and they say it improves greatly over time . We just happen to be driving a truck that 's fresh from the factory in Japan , so some drivers say it takes a bit of breaking in , and then you 're good to go . <p> Who are we to argue with them ? There 's a good reason why the Canter is the default choice when moving up from an LCV to a light duty truck , and much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any business that involves mobility either by deliveries or by passengers ( like the FB body ) , reliability is king . <p> This 2019 Fuso Canter FE71 is priced at PhP 1,440,000 in cab and chassis configuration . If you want to add the Almazora 10x6x6 aluminum body , that will add another PhP 93,000 on top of it . Fuso also has partnerships with other body manufacturers such as Centro and Metro Trucks , expanding your options list for your business . If you want to add A/C , well , you can pay another PhP 88,000 ( thereabouts ) to cool the cabin . <p> Fuso wants to build on that well-earned reputation , and with the way the Canter FE71 is built , it looks like it 's only going to get better in the future .

This project reconnects us to our pre-Spanish period at the same time that we need to reach out to our neighbors in the Asian region . There has been a hiatus in which we lost that connection during the Spanish and American colonial periods . <p> " We explore our past and our capacity as a people with the balangay .

Lawrence Lemuel Fortun , principal author of the bill , said . <p> He noted that the ' balangay , ' known as the Butuan boat , was the first-ever wooden watercraft to be excavated in Southeast Asia demonstrating early Filipino boat-building genius and seamanship expertise during the pre-colonial times . <p> " Found only in the Philippines where a flotilla of such ancient boats exists , the Butuan boat was utilized by our ancestors to maintain trade relations with neighboring islands around the country and empires around Southeast Asia , " Fortun said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for trade confirms the active involvement of our forefathers in robust commercial activities in Asia as early as the 10th and 11th centuries .

If there is a problem , he will not sleep until he is able to find a solution . " <p> To reconstruct the boats , Valdez and his team hired boat builders from the Sama Dilaya tribe from Sibutu and Sitangkai islands of Tawi-Tawi . <p> But all these difficulties were made up for by the beauty they encountered on their voyage . Dolphins swam alongside the boats . You will see how beautiful the Philippines is if you make this round trip through all its islands .

He saved me the panic attack and answered sarcastically , " We do n't believe in labels ; we 're indie . " <p> Remember when indie simply meant doing it yourself ? Now indie music no longer means that an artist is n't good enough to be signed . Instead , it 's " too good " to be played on the radio or to be shared with everyone else . Maybe I 've been to one too many gigs feeling judging eyes on me or maybe I 'm just a self-absorbed newbie who feels out of place at times . Either way , I feel indie rock is getting a little overplayed . Not that too much rock music is bad but a breather from it can be good , too . Fortunately , Manila 's indie hip-hop scene is " straight blowin ' up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rap battle , I thought he meant one of the videos he usually watches online . Imagine my horror when he explained it was a local rap battle league , the only Filipino one . The first FlipTop Battle was held at the start of the year . I was surprised to see so many people at the event since the only marketing they did was an online poster . <p> FlipTop has English and Filipino conferences and contrary to what most think rap battles should be , the battles are n't strictly freestyle . Emcees are encouraged to do research on their opponents and pre-write their rhymes . Of course it 's more impressive when one refutes the other 's attacks on the spot but it 's also about the style and the words they choose which are emphasized by the lack of beat to ride on -- every battle is a cappella . <p> The brains behind the FlipTop Battle League is 22 year-old Aric Yuson . " With all sorts of clutter in the hip-hop world , people will hear one emcee/group and think that that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says about the current state of hip-hop , " I admittedly do n't know everything about hip-hop .

What 's important is to never stop searching , never stop learning , and to never stop wanting and trying to improve or learn more . I think that would also be the proper attitude involving anything in life , actually . " <p> Aric has always been a fan of the battling aspect of hip-hop and watches different battle leagues online such as America 's Grind Time Now and Canada 's King of The Dot . He wanted to apply it to Philippine culture and has been successful in doing so . " As for rap or emcee battles , I enjoy the spontaneity , competition , and of course , the relatively twisted humor employed in degrading your opponent " Aric shares .

The crowd grows larger every time to the point of venues not being able to accommodate everyone . " The ( insults ) , besides being every Filipino male 's pastime throughout grade school , high school , and a bit in college , probably appeals to Filipinos with non-confrontational mindsets , " Aric explains . I may be wrong on this one but I can imagine how people enjoy watching and admiring things that they ca n't do . So if the mind-state is along the lines of ' Dang , I could n't ever think of insulting someone like that face-to-face , much less in rhyme form , ' then they 'd probably be amazed at how emcees seem to be able to keep their composure before , during and after the battle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever they say , it 's merely for the sake of the battle and that they should n't hold anything against their opponent . Unless it 's a grudge match , then that 's an entirely different thing .

" All in all , complete advancement for hip-hop as we hope to get more acts to perform here and there . " <p> Aric is the son of well-respected writer Alfred Yuson and when I ask him what his father thinks of FlipTop he laughs and says , " I do n't think he 's ever watched it and he 's probably not aware of it in its entirety .

It is what it is -- the same with my relationship ; I 've gotten past the fear of being labeled a girlfriend and all the things that come with it because nothing 's changed , really . Independent artists keep progressing because individuals love them enough to lend their support .

As a general rule , Grab has to refund consumers of excess charges for each comparable trip for each rider before the acquisition of Uber by Grab and post-acquisition fare rates . <p> The disgorgement mechanism is a major amendment to the initial undertaking . It also ensures transparency so that consumers know how Grab arrived at computing their fares . The system-wide average fare cap is in place to limit Grab 's ability to unreasonably increase fares beyond pre-transaction levels . <p> PCC has also made the penalties stricter by imposing up to ? 2 million in fines per breach . This is on top of the refund to consumers should they breach the 22.5 percentage cap in fares vs the comparable period before the merger . <p> " The PCC stands to guard against any breach of the Extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grab on its commitments , " said Balisacan . <p> The PCC defended its way of disciplining Grab noting that without the extension of the initial undertaking , they would have no way to monitor Grab . <p> " I would rather see this as a positive . The fact that we are able to monitor and able to impose fines for deviations show that the undertaking was effective , " said PCC Commissioner Johannes R. Bernabe . But he also said that what is deemed ineffective is the fact that there has been no new viable TNC competitors to have come to the market yet . This justified , he said , the need for both parties to agree to extend the initial one-year undertaking . <p> " Even Grab has recognized there have been competition concerns so they themselves have to extend their voluntary commitments , " said Bernabe . <p> For non-exclusivity commitments , drivers will have the power of choice to operate with any TNCs and will not be tied to Grab by way of any agreement , policy or incentive .

The four-year extension on the non-exclusivity commitments was meant to give enough time for a viable TNC competitor to enter the local market . <p> For service quality commitments , Grab must improve passenger experience by setting standards for completion rates for drivers and by removing the " see destination " feature of discriminating ones . <p> It could be recalled that in March 2018 , Grab bought its rival Uber in the whole Southeast Asia .

@@71508234 <h> The meaning of ' the common good ' <h> Being Right <p> By Jemy Gatdula <p> This is a topic I 've written about previously but feel it bears revisiting . The term " common good " is quite fashionable nowadays . From the environment to education reform , common good has been uttered to add credibility to whatever measure is being proposed . Unfortunately , there is a need to clarify what is really meant by the term " common good . " <p> To start , let us discuss another oft-used phrase : Salus populi est supreme lex , which many people understand as " the will of the people is the supreme law . " Which is not really the case . The closer translation goes like this : " The welfare of the people is the supreme law . " <p> There is a world of difference between the two translations : the latter indicating that what is necessarily good for the people is something they may not consciously will or desire but still must logically or rationally be achieved . <p> The same with the common good . <p> The common good is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people . Rather , it is the instrument for which each people 's individual rational flourishing is to be achieved . More on this later . <p> As I wrote in 2014 ( " The Common Good " ) , one finds the term in our Constitution 's very beginning , the Preamble : " An attempt to restore the phrase ' general welfare ' in place of the Committee 's phrase ' common good ' was not accepted . The change from ' general welfare ' to ' common good ' was intended to project the idea of a social order that enables every citizen to attain his or her fullest development economically , politically , culturally , and spiritually . The rejection of the phrase ' general welfare ' was based on the apprehension that the phrase could be interpreted as meaning the ' greatest good for the greatest number ' even if what the greater number wants does violence to human dignity , as for instance when the greater majority might want the extermination of those who are considered as belonging to an inferior race ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic of the Philippines , 2009 ) . " <p> From the foregoing , two points : The Preamble lays down the purpose of the Constitution . It is , as Fr . Bernas points out , a " manifestation of the sovereign will of the Filipino people . " Secondly , the use of the term " common good " was a deliberate act on the part of our Constitution 's drafters . <p> Now , what should be undeniable is the peculiar strain of Judeo-Christian thought that permeates our constitutional system . It comes from two sources : its Spanish lineage and the relatively recent ( and more direct ) US genealogy . <p> And many from those sources up to the people who drafted the present Constitution would have been steeped ( consciously or not ) in Aristotelian thought , and quite definitely the ideas of the Enlightenment thinkers such as Locke and Rousseau . <p> Hence , the recognition of man 's inherent dignity and equality ( between men and women , and regardless of race or religion ) , the natural law and natural rights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the right to change religions ) , the social contract , and -- of course -- the common good . <p> For Aristotle , sometimes acknowledged as the father of the " common good , " the same is that which leads to individual good or human flourishing ( the so-called " eudaimonia " ) . This finds its way in Catholic social teaching ( e.g. , Gaudium et Spes ) , which views the common good as ' the sum total of social conditions which allow people , either as groups or as individuals , to reach their fulfillment more fully and more easily . " <p> For me personally , the best definition can be found in John Finnis 's Natural Law and Natural Rights : " a set of conditions which enables the members of a community to attain for themselves reasonable objectives , or to realize reasonably for themselves the value(s) , for the sake of which they have reason to collaborate with each other ( positively and/or negatively ) in a community . " <p> Note the repeated mention of the attainment " for themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , must not attempt to do everything , the president is not envisioned to be the national patriarch . <p> And thus , here is another point where many of our government and policy makers go wrong : the common good of society , indeed even society ( or country ) itself , are not the ends . They are merely instrumental ( not intrinsic ) goods . They are " primarily a means to the realization of valuable ends by members of the community ; it is not an end in itself . Participating in the life of the community as one of its members does not immediately instantiate a basic aspect of our well-being and fulfillment as human persons ( Robert George , The Common Good : Instrumental But Not Just Contractual ; Public Discourse , 2013 ) . " <p> The end is the flourishing of each member of the community , for which responsibility ultimately lies not with the government but with each and every individual .

Not the judiciary . <p> One of the more damaging legal theories to have ever crossed our shores is that of the " living constitution " ; i.e. , the argument that constitutional or statutory provisions change ( evolve ) through time to meet the exigencies of the present . <p> The problem with that theory ( so beloved by the so-called prestigious local law schools ) is that the absence of textual basis in law or democratic logic . <p> " The Constitution is not an organism ; it 's a legal text ! " says the late Justice Antonin Scalia . And he is right . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal document . The validity of the living constitution theory is as flaky as saying that one 's contractual obligations could change because one of the parties unilaterally decided that the words thereof have evolved through time . <p> With the living constitution theory , what you have is a body of jurisprudence that is ( to borrow from lawyer Michael McConell ) " sloppy , results-driven , plagued with fuzzy three-part tests and fuzzier four-part tests , all of them concocted ... with little basis in constitutional text . " <p> To law students : what this means is that your constitutional law studies could have been easier had our judiciary stuck to their function of simply declaring what the law is . Law books would have been slimmer , consistent , and focused had it not been filled with judicial standards and tests whose foundations are mostly tenuously connected ( at best ) to the Constitution . <p> If such standard or tests were necessary , it is up to Congress -- the elected legislative representatives of the people -- that should make it . Not the judiciary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " the provisions of the Constitution have a fixed meaning , which does not change : they mean today what they meant when they were adopted , nothing more and nothing less . " <p> Granted , there are the " majestic generalities , " as Holmes would say . Also the unfortunate " grave abuse of discretion " clause , which allows an unelected judiciary to substitute its preferences over that of the people 's elected legislature . <p> But even then , Supreme Court 's function is merely to apply the Constitution 's specific Judeo-Christian philosophy , principles , and values at the time it was authored by the Filipino people . <p> Not the justice 's personal wisdom or current views , no matter how progressive it may be . <p> Ultimately , what is being called for here is humility and trust in the democratic system and in the Filipino people . <p> As Justice Scalia urges : " The good judge must suppress his personal views and must decide each case as the law dictates , not as he would have resolved the matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at issue .
